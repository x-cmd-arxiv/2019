classification is proposed for wireless spectrum monitoring applications, which
automatically learns from the time domain in-phase and quadrature data without
requiring the design of hand-crafted expert features. With the intuition of
convolutional layers with pooling serving as the role of front-end feature
distillation and dimensionality reduction, sequential convolutional recurrent
neural networks are developed to take complementary advantage of parallel
computing capability of convolutional neural networks and temporal sensitivity
of recurrent neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed architecture delivers overall superior performance in signal to noise
ratio range above -10~dB, and achieves significantly improved classification
accuracy from 80\% to 92.1\% at high signal to noise ratio range, while
drastically reduces the average training and prediction time by approximately
74% and 67%, respectively. Response patterns learned by the proposed
architecture are visualized to better understand the physics of the model.
Furthermore, a comparative study is performed to investigate the impacts of
various sequential convolutional recurrent neural network structure settings on
classification performance. A representative sequential convolutional recurrent
neural network architecture with the two-layer convolutional neural network and
subsequent two-layer long short-term memory neural network is developed to
suggest the option for fast automatic modulation classification.

Pilot abstraction, addresses these challenges and serves as an effective
runtime system to execute workloads comprised of many tasks. In this paper, we
characterize the performance of executing many tasks using RP when interfaced
with JSM and PRRTE on Summit: RP is responsible for resource management and
task scheduling on acquired resource; JSM or PRRTE enact the placement of
launching of scheduled tasks. Our experiments provide lower bounds on the
performance of RP when integrated with JSM and PRRTE. Specifically, for
workloads comprised of homogeneous single-core, 15 minutes-long tasks we find
that: PRRTE scales better than JSM for > O(1000) tasks; PRRTE overheads are
negligible; and PRRTE supports optimizations that lower the impact of overheads
and enable resource utilization of 63% when executing O(16K), 1-core tasks over

which is a novel duplexing scheme that combines time-division duplex (TDD) and
frequency-division duplex (FDD). In D-TFDD, a user receives from the base
station (BS) on the downlink in one frequency band and transmits to the BS on
the uplink in another frequency band, as in FDD. Next, the user shares its
uplink transmission (downlink reception) on the corresponding frequency band
with the uplink transmission or the downlink reception of another user in a
D-TDD fashion. Hence, in a given frequency band, the BS communicates with user
1 (U1) and user 2 (U2) in a D-TDD fashion. The proposed D-TFDD scheme does not
require inter-cell interference (ICI) knowledge and only requires channel state
information (CSI) of the local BS-U1 and BS-U2 channels. Thereby, it is
practical for implementation. The proposed D-TFDD scheme increases the
throughput region between the BS and the two users in a given frequency band,
and significantly decreases the outage probabilities on the corresponding BS-U1
and BS-U2 channels. Most importantly, the proposed D-TFDD scheme doubles the
diversity gain on both the corresponding BS-U1 and the BS-U2 channels compared
to the diversity gain of existing duplexing schemes, which results in very
large performance gains.

probability density function concentrated on $(\mathbb{X}, f)$.
  Our techniques are based on the interleaving distance of constructible
cosheaves and topological estimation via kernel density estimates. Following
Munch and Wang (2018), we first show that the mapper graph of $(\mathbb{X},
f)$, a constructible $\mathbb{R}$-space (with a fixed open cover), approximates
the Reeb graph of the same space. We then construct an isomorphism between the
mapper of $(\mathbb{X},f)$ to the mapper of a super-level set of a probability
density function concentrated on $(\mathbb{X}, f)$. Finally, building on the

can recover the mapper of the super-level set given a sufficiently large

Language Embedding (MULE) which has been visually-semantically aligned across

MULE learns a single language branch in the multimodal model, we can also scale
to support many languages, and languages with fewer annotations can take
advantage of the good representation learned from other (more abundant)
language data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MULE on the bidirectional
image-sentence retrieval task, supporting up to four languages in a single
model. In addition, we show that Machine Translation can be used for data
augmentation in multilingual learning, which, combined with MULE, improves mean
recall by up to 21.9% on a single-language compared to prior work, with the
most significant gains seen on languages with relatively few annotations. Our

with Gaussian unitaries, makes for universal quantum resources. Photon number
resolving (PNR) detection, a readily-realizable non-Gaussian measurement, has
been a popular tool to try and engineer non-Gaussian states for universal
quantum processing. In this paper, we consider PNR detection of a subset of the
modes of a zero-mean pure multi-mode Gaussian state as a means to herald a
target non-Gaussian state on the undetected modes. This is motivated from the
ease of scalable preparation of Gaussian states that have zero mean, using
squeezed vacuum and passive linear optics. We calculate upper bounds on the
fidelity between the actual heralded state and the target state. We find that
this fidelity upper bound is $1/2$ when the target state is a multi-mode
coherent cat-basis cluster state, a resource sufficient for universal quantum
computing. This proves that there exist non-Gaussian states that are not
producible by this method. Our fidelity upper bound is a simple expression that
depends only on the target state represented in the photon-number basis, which
could be applied to other non-Gaussian states of interest.

Measures of social media mentions and coverage are now emerging as an
alternative indicator of impact of scholarly articles. This article aims to
explore how much scholarly research output from India is covered in different
social media platforms, and how similar or different it is from the world
average. It also analyses the discipline-wise variations in coverage and
altmetric attention for Indian research output, including a comparison with the
world average. Results obtained show interesting patterns. Only 28.5% of the
total research output from India is covered in social media platforms, which is
about 18% less than the world average. ResearchGate and Mendeley are the most
popular social media platforms in India for scholarly article coverage. In
terms of discipline-wise variation, medical sciences and biological sciences
have relatively higher coverage across different platforms compared to
disciplines like information science and engineering.

Typically multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods treat agents
equally and the goal is to solve the Markov game to an arbitrary Nash
equilibrium (NE) when multiple equilibra exist, thus lacking a solution for NE
selection. In this paper, we treat agents \emph{unequally} and consider
Stackelberg equilibrium as a potentially better convergence point than Nash
equilibrium in terms of Pareto superiority, especially in cooperative
environments. Under Markov games, we formally define the bi-level reinforcement
learning problem in finding Stackelberg equilibrium. We propose a novel
bi-level actor-critic learning method that allows agents to have different
knowledge base (thus intelligent), while their actions still can be executed
simultaneously and distributedly. The convergence proof is given, while the
resulting learning algorithm is tested against the state of the arts. We found
that the proposed bi-level actor-critic algorithm successfully converged to the
Stackelberg equilibria in matrix games and find an asymmetric solution in a
highway merge environment.

Smith maps, from $3$-manifolds into $7$-manifolds that parametrize associative
$3$-folds in Riemannian $7$-manifolds equipped with $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures.
Associative Smith maps are solutions of a conformally invariant nonlinear first
order PDE system, called the Smith equation, that may be viewed as a
$\mathrm{G}_2$-analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann system for $J$-holomorphic
curves.
  In this paper, we show that associative Smith maps enjoy many of the same
analytic properties as $J$-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry. In
particular, we prove: (i) an interior regularity theorem, (ii) a removable
singularity result, (iii) an energy gap result, and (iv) a mean-value
inequality. While our approach is informed by the holomorphic curve case, a
number of nontrivial extensions are involved, primarily due to the degeneracy
of the Smith equation.
  At the heart of above results is an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem that
gives quantitative $C^{1,\beta}$-regularity of $W^{1,3}$ associative Smith maps
under a smallness assumption on the $3$-energy. The proof combines previous
work on weakly $3$-harmonic maps and the observation that the associative Smith
equation demonstrates a certain ""compensation phenomenon"" that shows up in many
other geometric PDEs.
  Combining these analytical properties and the conformal invariance of the
Smith equation, we explain how sequences of associative Smith maps with bounded
$3$-energy may be conformally rescaled to yield bubble trees of such maps. When
the $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure is closed, we prove that both the $3$-energy and
the homotopy are preserved in the bubble tree limit. This result may be
regarded as an associative analogue of Gromov's Compactness Theorem in
symplectic geometry.

exploited in areas such as computation, cryptography and metrology. The
entanglement between photons can be present in various degrees of freedom

various quantum applications by fully controlling the properties of the
entangled photons in multiple DOFs. While current entangled-photon sources are
capable of generating entanglement in one or more DOFs, there is currently a
lack of practical techniques that can shape and control the entanglement
properties in multiple DOFs. Here we show that cascading two or more
entangled-photon sources with tunable linear media in between allows us to
generate photon-pairs whose entanglement properties can be tailored and shaped
in the frequency and polarisation domains. We first develop a quantum
mechanical model to study the quantum state generated from the cascade
structure with special considerations paid to the effects of pump temporal
coherence, linear dispersion, and in-structure polarisation transformation
applied between the entangled-photon sources. We then experimentally generate
photon-pairs with tunable entanglement properties by manipulating the
dispersion and birefringence properties of the linear medium placed in between
two entangled-photon sources. This is done in an all-fibre, phase stable, and
alignment-free configuration. Our results show that the cascade structure
offers a great deal of flexibility in tuning the properties of entangled
photons in multiple DOFs, opening up a new avenue in engineering quantum light

the eighteen sources we detected, sixteen are YSOs (three Class 0, five Class
I, six Class II, and two Class III) and two are extragalactic candidates. We
find that thermal dust emission generally contributes less that 30% of the
emission at 10 GHz. The radio emission is dominated by other types of emission
such as gyro-synchrotron radiation from active magnetospheres, free-free
emission from thermal jets, free-free emission from the outflowing
photo-evaporated disk material, and/or synchrotron emission from accelerated
cosmic-rays in jet or protostellar surface shocks. These different types of
emission could not be clearly disentangled. Our non-detections towards Class
II/III disks suggest that extreme UV-driven photoevaporation is insufficient to
explain the disk dispersal, assuming that the contribution of UV
photoevaporating stellar winds to radio flux does not evolve with time. The
sensitivity of our data cannot exclude photoevaporation due to X-ray photons as
an efficient mechanism for disk dispersal. Deeper surveys with the Square

change the character of the dispersion force, turning it from attractive to

possibility to control and tailor interatomic dispersion interactions through
external actions. By a numerical estimate of the field-modified interaction, we
show that at typical interatomic distances the change of the interaction's
strength can match or even outmatch the unperturbed interaction; this can be
obtained for values of the external field that can be currently achieved in the

view of the above problem, this paper proposes a RNN-based Hierarchical
Multi-modal Fusion Generation Variational Autoencoder (VAE) network,
MIDI-Sandwich2, for multi-track symbolic music generation. Inspired by VQ-VAE2,
MIDI-Sandwich2 expands the dimension of the original hierarchical model by
using multiple independent Binary Variational Autoencoder (BVAE) models without
sharing weights to process the information of each track. Then, with
multi-modal fusion technology, the upper layer named Multi-modal Fusion
Generation VAE (MFG-VAE) combines the latent space vectors generated by the
respective tracks, and uses the decoder to perform the ascending dimension
reconstruction to simulate the inverse operation of multi-modal fusion,
multi-modal generation, so as to realize the RNN-based multi-track symbolic
music generation. For the multi-track format pianoroll, we also improve the
output binarization method of MuseGAN, which solves the problem that the
refinement step of the original scheme is difficult to differentiate and the
gradient is hard to descent, making the generated song more expressive. The
model is validated on the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset (LPD) multi-track dataset.
Compared to the MuseGAN, MIDI-Sandwich2 can not only generate harmonious
multi-track music, the generation quality is also close to the state of the art
level. At the same time, by using the VAE to restore songs, the semi-generated
songs reproduced by the MIDI-Sandwich2 are more beautiful than the pure
autogeneration music generated by MuseGAN. Both the code and the audition audio

  Recommendation",,,"10.1109/ICDM.2019.00087",,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the recent studies of social recommendation assume that people share
similar preferences with their friends and the online social relations are
helpful in improving traditional recommender systems. However, this assumption
is often untenable as the online social networks are quite sparse and a
majority of users only have a small number of friends. Besides, explicit
friends may not share similar interests because of the randomness in the
process of building social networks. Therefore, discovering a number of
reliable friends for each user plays an important role in advancing social
recommendation. Unlike other studies which focus on extracting valuable
explicit social links, our work pays attention to identifying reliable friends
in both the observed and unobserved social networks. Concretely, in this paper,
we propose an end-to-end social recommendation framework based on Generative
Adversarial Nets (GAN). The framework is composed of two blocks: a generator
that is used to produce friends that can possibly enhance the social
recommendation model, and a discriminator that is responsible for assessing
these generated friends and ranking the items according to both the current
user and her friends' preferences. With the competition between the generator
and the discriminator, our framework can dynamically and adaptively generate
reliable friends who can perfectly predict the current user' preference at a
specific time. As a result, the sparsity and unreliability problems of explicit
social relations can be mitigated and the social recommendation performance is
significantly improved. Experimental studies on real-world datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our framework and verify the positive effects of the
generated reliable friends.

chemical source terms are constructed starting from instantaneous temperature
and species measurements using a variant of the pairwise mixing stirred reactor

the closure terms: the mean PCs chemical source terms and the density. These
means are parameterized in terms of the mean PCs using artificial neural
networks (ANN). The framework is demonstrated a posteriori using the data from
the Sandia piloted turbulent jet flames D, E and F by performing RANS
calculations. The radial profiles of mean and RMS of temperature and measured

interacting with people from different network components on the same platform.
While compelling, evidence for this causal theory comes from observational
studies, making it difficult to rule out non-causal explanations. We
investigate the role of structural diversity on retention by conducting a
large-scale randomized controlled study on the Twitter platform. We first show
that structural diversity correlates with user retention on Twitter,
corroborating results from past observational studies. We then exogenously vary
structural diversity by altering the set of network recommendations new users
see when joining the platform; we confirm that this design induces the desired
changes to network topology. We find, however, that low, medium, and high
structural diversity treatment groups in our experiment have comparable
retention rates. Thus, at least in this case, the observed correlation between
structural diversity and retention does not appear to result from a causal
relationship, challenging theories based on past observational studies.

Set Disjointness (and the equivalent task of distributed LP feasibility) we
derive upper and lower bounds of $\tilde O(d^2\log n)$ and~$\Omega(d\log n)$.
These results improve upon several previous works in distributed learning and
optimization.
  Unlike typical works in communication complexity, the main technical
contribution of this work lies in the upper bounds. In particular, our
protocols are based on a {\it Container Lemma for Halfspaces} and on two
variants of {\it Carath\'eodory's Theorem}, which may be of independent
interest. These geometric statements are used by our protocols to provide a
compressed summary of the players' input.

commutation or anticommutation relations quantized at equal light-front time
not only cannot be transformed into each other, they take completely different

that this is not in fact the case. By looking not at equal times but at unequal
times, we show that unequal instant-time commutation or anticommutation
relations are completely equivalent to unequal light-front time commutation or
anticommutation relations. Light-front quantization and instant-time
quantization are thus the same, with it being only the restriction to equal
times that makes them look different. However for fermions there is a caveat,
as the light-front anticommutation relations involve projection operators
acting on the fermion fields. Nonetheless, not only can one still derive
fermion unequal light-front time anticommutators starting from unequal
instant-time ones, one can even derive unequal instant-time fermion
anticommutators starting from unequal light-front time anticommutators even
though the fermion projection operators that are relevant in the light-front
case are not invertible. To establish the equivalence for gauge fields we
present a quantization procedure that does not involve zero-mode singularities
that are commonly encountered in light-front gauge field studies. We also study
time-ordered products of fields, and again show the equivalence despite the
fact that there are additional terms in the fermion light-front case. We
establish our results first for free theories, and then to all orders in
interacting theories though comparison of the instant-time and light-front
Lehmann representations. Finally, we compare instant-time Hamiltonians and
light-front Hamiltonians, and show that in the instant-time rest frame they
give identical results.

  generation problem: the Recurrent Neural Networks solution",,,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coarse-grained simulations of conjugated polymers have become a popular way
of investigating the device physics of organic photovoltaics. While UV-Vis
spectroscopy remains one of key experimental methods for the interrogation of
these devices, a rigorous bridge between coarse-grained simulations and
spectroscopy has never been established. Here we address this challenge by
developing a method that predicts spectra of conjugated polymers directly from
coarse-grained representations while avoiding ad-hoc procedures such as
back-mapping from coarse-grained to atomistic representations followed by
computing the spectra using standard quantum chemistry methods. Our approach is
based on a generative deep learning model: the long-short-term memory recurrent
neural network (LSTM-RNN) and it is suggested by the apparent similarity
between natural languages and the mathematical structure of the perturbative
expansions of the excited state energies due to small fluctuations of the
polymer conformation. We use this model to demonstrate a dangerous discrepancy
between the spectra obtained in the coarse-grained representation and after the
back-mapping. This indicates that standard protocols may require additional
fine-tuning in order to become reliable and that our model presents a novel
tool uniquely suited for improving the back-mapping protocols and for including
spectral data in the development of coarse-grained potentials.

localization, the initial phase in DFL is to build the fingerprint database

recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper introduces
RadioGrapher; a system that automates the process of device-free fingerprint
calibration in IoT environments. RadioGrapher leverages the device-based
locations of entities in the area of interest in a crowd-sensing manner, aided
with Fresnel zones of the wirelessly connected IoT devices to automatically
construct a device-free fingerprint. Experimental evaluation of RadioGrapher in
an IoT testbed using multiple entities shows that it can construct DFL
fingerprints with high accuracy. Moreover, its median localization accuracy is
comparable to that of manual fingerprinting. This comes with no calibration
overhead, highlighting the promise of RadioGrapher as a crowdsourcing

influenced by the control inputs of the players. Here, each of the players has
to satisfy their respective state and control constraints or loses the game.
The main contribution is a backward-forward reachable set splitting scheme,
which can be used to derive numerically tractable conservative approximations
of such two player games. In detail, we introduce a novel class of differential
inequalities that can be used to find convex outer approximations of these
backward and forward reachable sets. This approach is worked out in detail for
ellipsoidal set parameterizations. Our numerical examples illustrate not only
the effectiveness of the approach, but also the subtle differences between

variables with an approximated variational posterior. The model often assumes
the variational posterior to be factorized even when the true posterior is not.
The learned variational posterior under this assumption does not capture the
dependency relationships over latent variables. We argue that this would cause
a typical training problem called posterior collapse observed in all other
variational language models. We propose Gaussian Copula Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to avert this problem. Copula is widely used to model correlation and
dependencies of high-dimensional random variables, and therefore it is helpful
to maintain the dependency relationships that are lost in VAE. The empirical
results show that by modeling the correlation of latent variables explicitly
using a neural parametric copula, we can avert this training difficulty while
getting competitive results among all other VAE approaches.

one-dimensional likelihood model, using the limit-state function. To sample
from this target distribution we utilize HMCMC algorithms that produce Markov
chain samples based on Hamiltonian dynamics rather than random walks. We
compare the performance of typical HMCMC scheme with our newly developed
Quasi-Newton based mass preconditioned HMCMC algorithm that can sample very
adeptly, particularly in difficult cases with high-dimensionality and very
small failure probabilities. To eventually compute the probability of interest,
an original post-sampling step is devised at this stage, using an inverse
importance sampling procedure based on the samples. The involved user-defined
parameters of ASTPA are then discussed and general default values are
suggested. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is examined in
detail and compared against Subset Simulation in a series of static and dynamic

privacy against tracking and censorship. At the same time, little is known
about the lifetime and nature of hidden services. Data collection and study of
Tor hidden services is challenging due to its nature of providing privacy.
Studying the lifetime of hidden services provides several benefits. For
example, it allows investigation of the maliciousness of domains based on their
lifetime. Short-lived hidden services are more likely not to be legitimate
domains, e.g., used by ransomware, as compared to long-lived domains. In this
work, we investigate the lifetime of hidden services by collecting data from a
small (2%) subset of all Tor HSDir relays in a privacy-preserving manner. Based
on the data collected, we devise protocols and extrapolation techniques to
infer the lifetime of hidden services. Moreover we show that, due to Tor's
specifics, our small subset of HSDir relays is sufficient to extrapolate
lifetime with high accuracy, while respecting Tor user and service privacy and
following Tor's research safety guidelines. Our results indicate that a large
majority of the hidden services have a very short lifetime. In particular, 50%
of all current Tor hidden services have an estimate lifetime of only 10 days or
less, and 80% have a lifetime of less than a month.

analysis: that any mechanism for answering adaptively chosen statistical

we expect will be useful elsewhere. We show: 1) that differential privacy
ensures that the expectation of any query on the posterior distribution on
datasets induced by the transcript of the interaction is close to its true
value on the data distribution, and 2) sample accuracy on its own ensures that
any query answer produced by the mechanism is close to its posterior
expectation with high probability. This second claim follows from a thought
experiment in which we imagine that the dataset is resampled from the posterior
distribution after the mechanism has committed to its answers. The transfer
theorem then follows by summing these two bounds, and in particular, avoids the
""monitor argument"" used to derive high probability bounds in prior work. An
upshot of our new proof technique is that the concrete bounds we obtain are
substantially better than the best previously known bounds, even though the
improvements are in the constants, rather than the asymptotics (which are known
to be tight). As we show, our new bounds outperform the naive

this work we introduce RecWalk; a novel random walk-based method that leverages
the spectral properties of nearly uncoupled Markov chains to provably lift this

paradigm for learning the ``best'' active learning strategy. However, current
learning-based active learning approaches still require sufficient training
data so as to generalize meta-learning models for active learning. This is
contrary to the nature of active learning which typically starts with a small
number of labeled samples. The unavailability of large amounts of labeled
samples for training meta-learning models would inevitably lead to poor
performance (e.g., instabilities and overfitting). In our paper, we tackle
these issues by proposing a novel learning-based active learning framework,
called Learning To Sample (LTS). This framework has two key components: a
sampling model and a boosting model, which can mutually learn from each other
in iterations to improve the performance of each other. Within this framework,
the sampling model incorporates uncertainty sampling and diversity sampling
into a unified process for optimization, enabling us to actively select the
most representative and informative samples based on an optimized integration
of uncertainty and diversity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the LTS
framework, we have conducted extensive experiments on three different
classification tasks: image classification, salary level prediction, and entity
resolution. The experimental results show that our LTS framework significantly
outperforms all the baselines when the label budget is limited, especially for
datasets with highly imbalanced classes. In addition to this, our LTS framework
can effectively tackle the cold start problem occurring in many existing active

will naturally be on the dynamics of ability, thus complicating usage of
traditional IRT models. We propose DynAEsti, an augmentation of the traditional
IRT Expectation Maximization algorithm that allows ability to be a continuously
varying curve over time. In the process, we develop CurvFiFE, a novel

this, we develop a novel technique called grafting, which can successfully
approximate distributions represented by graphical models when other popular
techniques like Loopy Belief Propogation (LBP) and Variational Inference (VI)
fail. The performance of DynAEsti is evaluated through simulation, where we
achieve results comparable to the optimal of what is observed in the static
ability scenario. Finally, DynAEsti is applied to a longitudinal performance

The clipped signal is generally modelled as the summation of the scaled
original signal and clipping noise, which is treated by the linear equalizer in
the receiver. Generally, it is assumed that the clipped and original signal
share the same statistics. Although valid in some cases, we show that such

observables as characterized by their large deviation functions, and find that
in many cases the variational estimate is quantitatively accurate.
Additionally, we provide expressions to exactly correct the variational
estimate that can be evaluated directly. We benchmark this algorithm against
the numerically exact solution of a model of a driven particle in a periodic
potential, where the control force can be represented with a complete basis. We
then demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in a model of repulsive particles
on a line, which undergo a dynamical phase transition, resulting in singular
changes to the form of the optimal control force. In both systems, we find fast
convergence and are able to evaluate large deviation functions with significant
increases in statistical efficiency over alternative Monte Carlo approaches.

traditional Reynolds stress closure models lead to only partially reliable

anisotropy tensor involving novel machine learning techniques have garnered
considerable attention and have been rapidly developed. Focusing on modeling
the Reynolds stress closure for the specific case of turbulent channel flow,
this paper proposes three modifications to a standard neural network to account
for the no-slip boundary condition of the anisotropy tensor, the Reynolds
number dependence, and spatial non-locality. The modified models are shown to
provide increased predicative accuracy compared to the standard neural network
when they are trained and tested on channel flow at different Reynolds numbers.
The best performance is yielded by the model combining the boundary condition
enforcement and Reynolds number injection. This model also outperforms the

the shortest detected time scales and the highest acceleration efficiency. Here
we focus on detailed multiwavelength analysis of a very initial phase of the
SOL2011-08-04 flare, which demonstrated prominent short subpeaks of nonthermal
emission during filament eruption associated with the flare. We demonstrate
that the three-dimensional configuration of the flare, combined with timing and
spectral behavior of the rapidly varying component, put very stringent
constraints on the acceleration regime. Specifically, the rapid subpeaks are
generated by short injections of nonthermal electrons with a reasonably hard,
single power-law spectrum and a relatively narrow spread of pitch-angles along
the mean magnetic field. The acceleration site is a compact volume located near
the top of extended coronal loop(s). The electrons are accelerated up to
several hundreds of keV promptly, with the characteristic acceleration time
shorter than 50 ms. We show, that these properties are difficult to reconcile
with widely adopted stochastic acceleration models, while the data inescapably
require acceleration by a super-Dreicer electric field, whether regular or

of its general availability. Although the presence of clicks signals the users'
preference to some extent, the lack of such clicks does not necessarily
indicate a negative response from the users, as it is possible that the users
were not exposed to the items (positive-unlabeled problem). This leads to a
difficulty in predicting the users' preferences from implicit feedback.
Previous studies addressed the positive-unlabeled problem by uniformly
upweighting the loss for the positive feedback data or estimating the
confidence of each data having relevance information via the EM-algorithm.
However, these methods failed to address the missing-not-at-random problem in
which popular or frequently recommended items are more likely to be clicked
than other items even if a user does not have a considerable interest in them.
To overcome these limitations, we first define an ideal loss function to be
optimized to realize recommendations that maximize the relevance and propose an
unbiased estimator for the ideal loss. Subsequently, we analyze the variance of
the proposed unbiased estimator and further propose a clipped estimator that
includes the unbiased estimator as a special case. We demonstrate that the
clipped estimator is expected to improve the performance of the recommender
system, by considering the bias-variance trade-off. We conduct semi-synthetic
and real-world experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method largely
outperforms the baselines. In particular, the proposed method works better for
rare items that are less frequently observed in the training data. The findings
indicate that the proposed method can better achieve the objective of
recommending items with the highest relevance.

detectors by injecting frequency dependent squeezed light into the the dark
port of the interferometer. This frequency dependent squeezing can be generated
by combining squeezed light with external filter cavities. However, in future
long baseline interferometers (LBIs), the filter cavity required to achieve the
broadband squeezing has a low bandwidth -- necessitating a very long cavity to
mitigate the issue from optical loss. It has been shown recently that by taking
advantage of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement in the squeezed light
source, the interferometer can simultaneously act as a detector and a filter
cavity. This is an attractive broadband squeezing scheme for LBIs because the
length requirement for the filter cavity is naturally satisfied by the length
of the interferometer arms. In this paper we present a systematic way of
finding the working points for this broadband squeezing scheme in LBIs. We also
show that in LBIs, the EPR scheme achieves nearly perfect ellipse rotation as
compared to 4km interferometers which have appreciable error around the
intermediate frequency. Finally, we show that an approximation for the
opto-mechanical coupling constant in the 4km case can break down for longer
baselines. These results are applicable to future detectors such as the 10km

is irradiated on only one-half of the graphene channel. This partial
irradiation creates a temperature gradient perpendicular to the graphene
channel. In the presence of an external magnetic field, thermopower is
generated perpendicular to the temperature gradient due to the Nernst effect.
Consequently, photo-Nernst voltage is generated along the graphene channel,
which can be detected from the contacts on both ends of the channel. We
demonstrate selective detection of the photo-Nernst effect while minimizing the
other photovoltaic contributions, such as the photo-Seebeck effect. We
investigate the dependence of the photo-Nernst effect on magnetic field and
excitation wavelength, which reveals a significant enhancement of photo-Nernst
signal at the cyclotron resonance conditions in graphene. Our finding could
facilitate the realization of far-infrared light detector using cyclotron
resonance of graphene.

constraint can be relaxed in the nonlinear regime, thereby enabling nonlinear
anomalous Hall current in time-reversal invariant materials - an underexplored
realm with exciting new opportunities beyond classical linear Hall effect.
Here, using group theory and first-principles theory, we demonstrate a
remarkable ferroelectric nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal
invariant few-layer WTe$_2$ where nonlinear anomalous Hall current switches in
odd-layer WTe$_2$ while remaining invariant in even-layer WTe$_2$ upon
ferroelectric transition. This even-odd oscillation of ferroelectric nonlinear
anomalous Hall effect was found to originate from the absence and presence of
Berry curvature dipole reversal and shift dipole reversal due to distinct
ferroelectric transformation in even and odd-layer WTe$_2$. Our work not only
treats Berry curvature dipole and shift dipole on an equal footing to account
for intraband and interband contributions to nonlinear anomalous Hall effect,
but also establishes Berry curvature dipole and shift dipole as new order
parameters for noncentrosymmetric materials. The present findings, therefore,
suggest that ferroelectric metals and Weyl semimetals may offer unprecedented

with large memory and long time of training. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage framework to accelerate the training process of synthesizing high
resolution images. High resolution images are first transformed to small codes
via the trained encoder and decoder networks. The code in latent space is times
smaller than the original high resolution images. Then, we train a code
generation network to learn the distribution of the latent codes. In this way,
the generator only learns to generate small latent codes instead of large
images. Finally, we decode the generated latent codes to image space via the
decoder networks so as to output the synthesized high resolution images.
Experimental results show that the proposed method accelerates the training
process significantly and increases the quality of the generated samples. The
proposed acceleration framework makes it possible to generate high resolution

Ultrafast solution of MAB problems has been demonstrated by utilizing

this paper, we address a lifted representation of nonlinear dynamical systems

consideration of the unboundedness of operators. For this purpose, we first
consider Perron-Frobenius operators with kernel-mean embeddings for such

Meanwhile, the Arnoldi method requires the assumption that the operator is
bounded, which is not necessarily satisfied for transfer operators on nonlinear
systems. We accordingly develop the shift-invert Arnoldi method for
Perron-Frobenius operators to avoid this problem. Also, we describe an approach
of evaluating predictive accuracy by estimated operators on the basis of the
maximum mean discrepancy, which is applicable, for example, to anomaly
detection in complex systems. The empirical performance of our methods is

Therefore, OBF is optimal if and only if one assumes all features are mutually
independent, and OBF is the only filter method that is optimal under at least
one model in the general Bayesian framework. Second, OBF under independent
Gaussian models is consistent under very mild conditions, including cases where
the data is non-Gaussian with correlated features. This result provides
conditions where OBF is guaranteed to identify the correct feature set given

decomposes a joint action of selecting K items simultaneously into K iterative

is in contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many
pairwise non-homeomorphic solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We
similarly develop a definable cohomology theory which strengthens \v{C}ech

  We also apply definable cohomology theory to the study of the space $\left[
X,S^{2}\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions from a solenoid
complement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg
in 1936. It was proved by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1940 that the space $\left[

that each orbit of the canonical action $\mathrm{Homeo}% \left( X\right)
\curvearrowright \left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is countable, and hence that such an
action has uncountably many orbits. This can be seen as a rigidity result, and
will be deduced from a rigidity result for definable automorphisms of the
\v{C}ech cohomology of $X$. We will also show that these results still hold if
one replaces solenoids with pro-tori.
  We conclude by applying the machinery developed herein to bound the Borel
complexity of several well-studied classification problems in mathematics, such
as that of automorphisms of continuous-trace $C^{*}$-algebras up to unitary
equivalence, or that of Hermitian line bundles, up to isomorphism, over a

with a large user set. It dynamically rejects users in bad conditions, and
thereby guarantees high quality-of-service (QoS) for the others. Unfortunately,
a frequently-varying admissible user set requests remarkable power to
continually re-establish the transmission link. Hence, we explore the stability
of admissible user set, and formulate a joint long-term admission control and
beamforming problem for a network with one multi-antenna base station (BS) and
multiple single-antenna users. We consider the downlink transmission in a time
period containing multiple time slices. By jointly optimizing the admissible
users and the BS transmit beamformers in different time slices, we aim to
minimize the total power cost, including not only the power for QoS guarantee,
but also the power for user status switching. Due to the NP-hardness of the
problem, we develop two (offline and online) algorithms to find some efficient
suboptimal solutions. The offline algorithm requires all channel state
information (CSI), and solves the admissible users and beamformers in different
time slices in one shot, based on successive upper-bound minimization (SUM). To
support real-time data transmission, we further design an alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM)-based online algorithm, which outputs the
admissible users and beamformers in different time slices successively,
utilizing the previous admissible user set, the actual value of current CSI,
and the distribution of future CSI. Simulations validate the performance of the
two algorithms, and show that the online algorithm is an efficient practical
alternative to the offline algorithm.

of the solar system. Recent studies suggest that planetesimal collisions and
the resulting impact melts are promising for forming chondrules. Given that the
dynamics of planetesimals is a key in impact-based chondrule formation
scenarios, we here perform direct $N$-body simulations to examine how the
presence of Jupiter affects the properties of chondrule-forming collisions. Our
results show that the absence/presence of Jupiter considerably changes the
properties of high velocity collisions whose impact velocities are higher than
2.5 km s$^{-1}$; high velocity collisions occur due to impacts between
protoplanets and planetesimals for the case without Jupiter; for the case with
Jupiter, eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up by the secular and
resonant perturbations from Jupiter. We also categorize the resulting
planetesimal collisions and find that most of high velocity collisions are
classified as grazing ones for both cases. To examine the effect of Jupiter on
chondrule formation directly, we adopt the impact jetting scenario and compute
the resulting abundance of chondrules. Our results show that for the case
without Jupiter, chondrule formation proceeds in the inside-out manner,
following the growth of protoplanets. If Jupiter is present, the location and
timing of chondrule formation are determined by Jupiter's eccentricity, which
is treated as a free parameter in our simulations. Thus, the existence of
Jupiter is the key parameter for specifying when and where chondrule formation
occurs for impact-based scenarios.

information for on-orbit repairing and manipulation by space robots. This task,

bounding box of the target object, however, more detailed information should be
provided by visual tracking such as binary mask. In this paper, we proposed a
SSLT (Saliency-based Semi-supervised Learning for Tracking) algorithm that
provides both the bounding box and segmentation binary mask of target
satellites at 12 frame per second without requirement of annotated data. Our
method, SSLT, improves the segmentation performance by generating a saliency
map based semi-supervised on-line learning approach within the initial bounding
box estimated by tracking. Once a customized segmentation model has been
trained, the bounding box and satellite trajectory will be refined using the
binary segmentation result. Experiment using real on-orbit rendezvous and

(MFs). In the topological phase, a KC hosts two MFs at its ends. Being
separated in space, these two MFs are nonlocal. The nonlocal transport in a KC
biased between two normal metal leads is mediated by electron tunneling (ET)
and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). ET contributes positively while CAR
contributes negatively to the nonlocal conductance. Enhanced CAR and hence a
negative nonlocal conductance is a hallmark of nonlocality of MFs. But simple
conductance measurements in the above setup cannot probe the nonlocality of MFs
due to the almost cancellation of currents from ET and CAR. On the other hand,
a Josephson junction between two KCs hosts two Andreev bound states (ABSs) at
the junction formed by a recombination of Majorana fermions of the individual
KCs. The energies of the ABSs are away from zero and can be changed by altering
the superconducting phase difference. A Josephson junction between two finitely
long KCs hosts two MFs at the two ends and two ABSs at the junction. We show
that when normal metal leads are connected to two ends of such a Josephson
junction, the nonlocal conductance of the setup can be negative for bias values
equal to the energies of the ABSs. Thus the nonlocal conductance in such setup
can probe the nonlocality of the constituent MFs.

disturbances, such as traffic accidents, can cause highly congested traffic

we consider a planner that controls autonomous cars, which are a fraction of
all present cars. We study a dynamic routing game, in which the route choices
of autonomous cars can be controlled and the human drivers react selfishly and
dynamically. As the problem is prohibitively large, we use deep reinforcement
learning to learn a policy for controlling the autonomous vehicles. This policy
indirectly influences human drivers to route themselves in such a way that
minimizes congestion on the network. To gauge the effectiveness of our learned
policies, we establish theoretical results characterizing equilibria and
empirically compare the learned policy results with best possible equilibria.
We prove properties of equilibria on parallel roads and provide a
polynomial-time optimization for computing the most efficient equilibrium.
Moreover, we show that in the absence of these policies, high demand and
network perturbations would result in large congestion, whereas using the
policy greatly decreases the travel times by minimizing the congestion. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs deep reinforcement
learning to reduce congestion by indirectly influencing humans' routing

shape requires sufficiently contextual semantic information, yet few works
devote to this. Here we propose DensePoint, a general architecture to learn
densely contextual representation for point cloud processing. Technically, it
extends regular grid CNN to irregular point configuration by generalizing a
convolution operator, which holds the permutation invariance of points, and
achieves efficient inductive learning of local patterns. Architecturally, it
finds inspiration from dense connection mode, to repeatedly aggregate
multi-level and multi-scale semantics in a deep hierarchy. As a result, densely
contextual information along with rich semantics, can be acquired by DensePoint
in an organic manner, making it highly effective. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks across four tasks, as well as thorough model analysis,
verify DensePoint achieves the state of the arts.

applications in biomedical engineering. In these datasets, some sources belong
to all subjects (joint), a subset of subjects (partially-joint), or a single
subject (individual). In this paper, this source model is referred to as
joint/partially-joint/individual multiple datasets multidimensional (JpJI-MDM),
and accordingly, a source extraction method is developed. Method: We present a
deflation-based algorithm utilizing higher order cumulants to analyze the
JpJI-MDM source model. The algorithm maximizes a cost function which leads to
an eigenvalue problem solved with thin-SVD (singular value decomposition)
factorization. Furthermore, we introduce the JpJI-feature which indicates the
spatial shape of each source and the amount of its jointness with other
subjects. We use this feature to determine the type of sources. Results: We
evaluate our algorithm by analyzing simulated data and two real functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In our simulation study, we will
show that the proposed algorithm determines the type of sources with the
accuracy of 95% and 100% for 2-class and 3-class clustering scenarios,

partially-joint sources from the two real datasets, which are consistent with
the existing neuroscience studies. Conclusion: Our results in analyzing the
real datasets reveal that both datasets follow the JpJI-MDM source model. This
source model improves the accuracy of source extraction methods developed for
multi-subject datasets. Significance: The proposed joint blind source
separation algorithm is robust and avoids parameters which are difficult to
fine-tune.

due to the underactuated degree of freedom in the trunk, which makes the motion
planning and control difficult. The research on trunk movements in human
locomotion is insufficient, and no formalism is known to transfer human motion
patterns onto robots. Related work mostly focuses on the lower extremities, and
simplifies the problem by stabilizing the trunk at a fixed angle. In contrast,
humans display significant trunk motions that follow the natural dynamics of
the gait. In this work, we use a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with a
trunk (TSLIP) together with a virtual point (VP) target to create trunk
oscillations and investigate the impact of these movements. We analyze how the
VP location and forward speed determine the direction and magnitude of the
trunk oscillations. We show that positioning the VP below the center of mass

below the CoM leads to a synergistic work between the hip and leg, reducing the
leg loading. However, it comes at the cost of increased peak hip torque. Our
results provide insights for leveraging the trunk motion to redistribute joint

multiwavelength visibilities and closure phases with purely geometrical models
with an increasing complexity in order to retrieve the sizes, temperatures and
flux ratios of the different components All sources are resolved and the
different components contributing to the H-band flux are dissected. The
environment of these targets is very complex: 13/23 targets need models with
thirteen or more parameters to fit the data. We find that the inner disk rims
follow and extend the size-luminosity relation established for disks around
young stars with an offset toward larger sizes. The measured temperature of the
near-infrared circumstellar emission of post-AGB binaries is lower (Tsub~1200K)
than for young stars, probably due to a different dust mineralogy and/or gas
density in the dust sublimation region. The dusty inner rims of the
circumbinary disks around post-AGB binaries are ruled by dust sublimation
physics. Additionally, a significant amount of the circumstellar H-band flux is
over-resolved (14 targets have more than 10% of their non-stellar flux
over-resolved) hinting for more structure from a yet unknown origin (disk
structure or outflow). The amount of over-resolved flux is larger than around
young stars. Due to the complexity of these targets, interferometric imaging is
a necessary tool to reveal the interacting inner regions in a model-independent
way.

given by its $0$-$1$ valued adjacency matrix, the graph homomorphism function
$G \mapsto \hom(G, H)$ determines the isomorphism type of $H$. In the past 50
years various extensions have been proved by many researchers [18, 12, 1, 23,

these extensions all have some restrictions such as all vertex weights must be

have arbitrary vertex and edge weights. A noteworthy aspect is that we prove
this by a surprisingly simple and unified argument. This bypasses various
technical obstacles and unifies and extends all previous known versions of this
theorem on graphs. The constructive proof of our theorem can be used to make
various complexity dichotomy theorems for graph homomorphism effective in the

its infinite predetermined digits (which we name \emph{principle of infinite

based on \emph{finite information quantities} (FIQs). Moreover, we discuss the
perspectives that an indeterministic physics could open (such as strong
emergence), as well as some potential problematic issues. Finally, we make
evident that any indeterministic interpretation of physics would have to deal
with the problem of explaining how the indeterminate values become determinate,
a problem known in the context of quantum mechanics as (part of) the ``quantum
measurement problem''. We discuss some similarities between the classical and
the quantum measurement problems, and propose ideas for possible solutions

driving, our results reveal how the local dissipation, at the basis of
self-propulsion, constrains internal transport by reducing the mobility and the

investigate how interactions are affected when varying dissipation. This leads
us to shed light on a microscopic mechanism to promote clustering at low

an alternative route to phase transitions in active fluids.

the spontaneous $C_4$ symmetry breaking of the electronic wave function,
leading to the nematic behavior, can appear due to electron correlations
induced mainly by the onsite Coulomb repulsion, even in the absence of the
corresponding intersite oxygen-oxygen repulsion term. The latter has been
considered as the triggering factor of the nematic state formation in a number
of previous studies. Also, we show that, at the transition to the nematic phase
electron concentration transfer from $d$- to $p$- orbitals takes place, apart
from the usually discussed $p_x/p_y$ polarization. The determined stability
regime of the nematic phase appears in the doping range similar to that of the
paired phase, showing that both phases have a common origin, even though they
compete. Also, we show that in a significant doping range a coexistence region
of superconductivity and nematicity appears. The results are discussed in the

being enforced to happen within a certain time period thus inducing two
different facets of quiescence. Furthermore, tioco is frequently defined on
Timed I/O Labeled Transition Systems (TIOLTS), a semantic model of Timed I/O

treated as a measure of the confounder with noise. But the proxy variables has
been proved to be unreliable, because of the bias it may induce. In this paper,
we try to ""recover"" the unobserved confounders for the Granger causality. We
use a generative model with latent variable to build the relationship between

close pairs spread over a large range of redshifts ($0.2<z<6$) and stellar
masses ($10^7-10^{11}M_{\odot}$). Using the stellar mass ratio between the
secondary and primary galaxy as a proxy to split the sample into major, minor

minor close pairs corresponding to a mass ratio range of 1:1-1:6, 1:6-1:100 and
lower than 1:100, respectively. Due to completeness issues, we do not consider

increases up to $z\approx 2-3$ reaching 25% for pairs with the most massive

is shown to follow a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. However, when spreading
happens, the question of spreading speed was left open in [8]. In this paper we
obtain a rather complete answer to this question. We find a condition on the
kernel function such that spreading grows linearly in time exactly when this
condition holds, which is achieved by completely solving the associated
semi-wave problem that determines this linear speed; when the kernel function
violates this condition, we show that accelerating spreading happens.

However,

different types of ice with different ice adhesion test methods at temperatures
of $-10^o$C and $-18^o$C. One laboratory uses the centrifuge adhesion test and
tests precipitation ice and bulk water ice, while the other laboratory uses a
vertical shear test and tests only bulk water ice. The surfaces tested were
bare aluminum and a commercial icephobic coating, with all samples prepared in
the same manner. The results showed comparability in the general trends,
surprisingly, with the greatest differences for bare aluminum surfaces at
temperature $-10^o$C. For bulk water ice, the vertical shear test resulted in
systematically higher ice adhesion strength than the centrifugal adhesion test.
The standard deviation depends on the surface type and seems to scale with the
absolute value of the ice adhesion strength. The experiments capture the
overall trends in which the ice adhesion strength surprisingly decreases from
$-10^o$C to $-18^o$C for aluminum and is almost independent of temperature for
a commercial icephobic coating. In addition, the study captures similar trends
in the effect of ice type on ice adhesion strength as previously reported and
substantiates that ice formation is a key parameter for ice adhesion
mechanisms.

in recent years considering its advantage of low labeling cost. Most of the
advanced algorithms follow the design principle that expands and constrains the
seed regions from class activation maps (CAM). As well-known, conventional CAM
tends to be incomplete or over-activated due to weak supervision. Fortunately,
we find that semantic segmentation has a characteristic of spatial
transformation equivariance, which can form a few self-supervisions to help
weakly supervised learning. This work mainly explores the advantages of scale
equivariant constrains for CAM generation, formulated as a self-supervised
scale equivariant network (SSENet). Specifically, a novel scale equivariant
regularization is elaborately designed to ensure consistency of CAMs from the
same input image with different resolutions. This novel scale equivariant
regularization can guide the whole network to learn more accurate class
activation. This regularized CAM can be embedded in most recent advanced weakly
supervised semantic segmentation framework. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC
2012 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively for weakly supervised
semantic segmentation. Code has been made available.

the spectral lines of the Mira star $\chi$ Cyg, we derive information about the
dynamics of the stellar photosphere, including pulsation.
  Methods: From spectropolarimetric observations of $\chi$ Cyg, we perform
careful analysis of the polarisation signals observed in atomic and molecular
lines, both in absorption and emission, using the radiative transfer in the
polarisation context, through two mechanisms: intrinsic polarisation and
continuum depolarisation. We also explain the observed line doubling phenomenon
in terms of an expanding shell in spherical geometry, which allows us to
pinpoint the coordinates over the stellar disk with enhanced polarisation.
  Results: We find that the polarised spectrum of $\chi$ Cyg is dominated by
intrinsic polarisation, with a negligible continuum depolarisation.
  The observed polarised signals can only be explained by assuming that this
polarisation is locally enhanced by velocity fields.
  During the pulsation, radial velocities are not homogeneous over the disk.
  We map these regions of enhanced velocities.
  Conclusions: We have set an algorithm to distinguish in any stellar spectra
of linear polarisation the origin of this polarisation and the way to increase
signal by coherently adding many lines with an appropriated weight. Applied to
the Mira star $\chi$ Cyg, we reached the unexpected result that during the
pulsation, velocities are radial but not homogeneous over the disk. The reason
for these local velocity enhancements are probably related to the interplay
between the atmospheric pulsation dynamics and the underlying stellar
convection.

understand the physical evolution of an atmosphere, and can provide physical
interpretation of the complex flows found in simulations performed using Global
Circulation Models (GCM). In particular, the acceleration of superrotating flow
at the equator of hot Jupiters has mostly been studied under several
simplifying assumptions, the relaxing of which may impact final results. Aims.
We develop and benchmark a publicly available algorithm to identify the
eigenmodes of an atmosphere around any initial steady state. We also solve for
linear steady states. Methods. We linearise the hydrodynamical equations of a
planetary atmosphere in a steady state with arbitrary velocities and thermal
profile. We then discretise the linearised equations on an appropriate
staggered grid, and solve for eigenvectors and linear steady solutions with the
use of a parallel library for linear algebra: ScaLAPACK. We also implement a
posteriori calculation of an energy equation in order to obtain more
information on the underlying physics of the mode. Results. Our code is
benchmarked against classical wave and instability test cases in multiple
geometries. The steady linear circulation calculations also reproduce expected
results for the atmosphere of hot Jupiters. We finally show the robustness of
our energy equation, and its power to obtain physical insight into the modes.
Conclusions. We have developed and benchmarked a code for the study of linear
processes in planetary atmospheres, with an arbitrary steady state. The

robustness and physical meaning to the obtained eigenmodes. This code can be

typically simulated on phantoms, i.e., virtual surrogates of patient anatomy.
Currently, phantoms are built according to reasonable, yet simple,
human-designed criteria. This often results in a lack of individualization. We
present a novel approach that combines imaging and ML to build individualized
phantoms automatically. Given the features of a patient treated historically
(only 2D radiographs available), and a database of 3D Computed Tomography (CT)
imaging with organ segmentations and relative patient features, our approach
uses ML to predict how to assemble a patient-specific phantom automatically.
Experiments on 60 abdominal CTs of pediatric patients show that our approach
constructs significantly more representative phantoms than using current
phantom building criteria, in terms of location and shape of the abdomen and of
two considered organs, the liver and the spleen. Among several ML algorithms
considered, the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm for Genetic

technique for the estimation of conditional distributions under order

relevant loss functions, subject to isotonicity constraints in terms of a
partial order on the covariate space. Nonparametric isotonic quantile
regression and nonparametric isotonic binary regression emerge as special

the use of IDR as a generic benchmark technique in probabilistic forecast
problems, as it does not involve any parameter tuning nor implementation
choices, except for the selection of a partial order on the covariate space.
The method can be combined with subsample aggregation, with the benefits of
smoother regression functions and gains in computational efficiency. In a

many-body polarization affects the accuracy of classical molecular dynamics
simulations of biomolecules.While the effects of electronic polarization are
highly pronounced for molecules with an opposite total charge, they are also
non-negligible for interactions with overall neutral molecules. For instance,
neglecting these effects in important biomolecules like amino acids and
phospholipids affects the structure of proteins and membranes having a large
impact on interpreting experimental data as well as building coarse grained
models. With the combined advances in theory, algorithms and computational
power it is currently realistic to perform simulations with explicit
polarizable dipoles on systems with relevant sizes and complexity.
Alternatively, the effects of electronic polarization can also be included at
zero additional computational cost compared to standard fixed-charge force
fields using the electronic continuum correction, as was recently demonstrated
for several classes of biomolecules.

  Development",,,,,"cs.IR cs.SE cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last few years, the arena of mobile application development has
expanded considerably beyond the balance of the world\'s software markets. With
the growing number of mobile software companies, and the mounting
sophistication of smartphones\' technology, developers have been building
several categories of applications on dissimilar platforms. However, developers
confront several challenges through the implementation of mobile application
projects. In particular, there is a lack of consolidated systems that are
competent to provide developers with personalised services promptly and
efficiently. Hence, it is essential to develop tailored systems which can
recommend appropriate tools, IDEs, platforms, software components and other
correlated artifacts to mobile application developers. This paper proposes a
new recommender system framework comprising a fortified set of techniques that
are designed to provide mobile app developers with a distinctive platform to
browse and search for the personalised artifacts. The proposed system make use
of ontology and semantic web technology as well as machine learning techniques.
In particular, the new RS framework comprises the following components; (i)
domain knowledge inference module: including various semantic web technologies
and lightweight ontologies; (ii) profiling and preferencing: a new proposed
time-aware multidimensional user modelling; (iii) query expansion: to improve
and enhance the retrieved results by semantically augmenting users\' query; and
(iv) recommendation and information filtration: to make use of the
aforementioned components to provide personalised services to the designated
users and to answer a user\'s query with the minimum mismatches.

Separate universe simulations (SUS) enable accurate measurements of this
biasing relation by implementing the peak-background split (PBS). In this work,
we apply the SUS technique to measure the void bias parameters. We confirm that
the PBS argument works well for underdense tracers. The response of the void
size distribution depends on the void radius. For voids larger (smaller) than
the size at the peak of the distribution, the void abundance responds
negatively (positively) to a long wavelength mode. The linear bias from the SUS
is in good agreement with the cross power spectrum measurement on large scales.
Using the SUS, we have detected the quadratic void bias for the first time in
simulations. We find that $ b_2 $ is negative when the magnitude of $ b_1 $ is
small, and that it becomes positive and increases rapidly when $ |b_1| $
increases. We compare the results from voids identified in the halo density
field with those from the dark matter distribution, and find that the results
are qualitatively similar, but the biases generally shift to the larger voids
sizes.

computational efficiency of differential emission measure (DEM) inversions by
an order of magnitude or higher, with the efficiency factor increasing with the
size of the input dataset. The method, named the Gridded Solar Iterative
Temperature Emission Solver (Grid-SITES) is based on grouping pixels according
to the similarity of their intensities in multiple channels, and solving for
one DEM per group. This is shown to be a valid approach, given a sufficiently
high number of grid bins for each channel. The increase in uncertainty arising
from the quantisation of the input data is small compared to the general
measurement and calibration uncertainties. In this paper, we use the Solar
Iterative Temperature Emission Solver (SITES) as the core method for the DEM
inversion, although Grid-SITES provides a general framework which may be used
with any DEM inversion method, or indeed any large multi-dimensional data
inversion problem. The method is particularly efficient for processing larger
images, offering a factor of 30 increase in speed for a 10 megapixel image. For
a time series of observations, the gridded results can be passed sequentially
to each new image, with new populated bins added as required. This process
leads to increasing efficiency with each new image, with potential for a
$\approx$100 increase in efficiency dependent on the size of the images.

based on the halo model and takes into account the mean luminosity-mass
relation. The model is used to forecast the possibility to simultaneously
constrain cosmological, CIB and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters
in the presence of foregrounds. For the analysis we use wavelengths in eight
frequency channels between 200 and 900$\;\mathrm{GHz}$ with survey
specifications given by Planck and LiteBird. We explore the sensitivity to the
model parameters up to multipoles of $\ell =1000$ using auto- and
cross-correlations between the different frequency bands. With this setting,
cosmological, HOD and CIB parameters can be constrained to a few percent.
Galactic dust is modeled by a power law and the shot noise contribution as a
frequency dependent amplitude which are marginalized over. We find that dust
residuals in the CIB maps only marginally influence constraints on standard
cosmological parameters. Furthermore, the bispectrum yields tighter constraints
(by a factor four in $1\sigma$ errors) on almost all model parameters while the
degeneracy directions are very similar to the ones of the power spectrum. The
increase in sensitivity is most pronounced for the sum of the neutrino masses.
Due to the similarity of degeneracies a combination of both analysis is not
needed for most parameters. This, however, might be due to the simplified bias
description generally adopted in such halo model approaches.

regularisation in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss that Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) models use for learning. There are few satisfactory
approaches to deal with a balance between the prior and reconstruction
objective, with most methods dealing with this problem through heuristics. In
this paper, we show that the noise variance (often set as a fixed value) in the
Gaussian likelihood p(x|z) for real-valued data can naturally act to provide
such a balance. By learning this noise variance so as to maximise the ELBO
loss, we automatically obtain an optimal trade-off between the reconstruction
error and the prior constraint on the posteriors. This variance can be
interpreted intuitively as the necessary noise level for the current model to
be the best explanation of the observed dataset. Further, by allowing the
variance inference to be more flexible it can conveniently be used as an
uncertainty estimator for reconstructed or generated samples. We demonstrate
that optimising the noise variance is a crucial component of VAE learning, and
showcase the performance on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CelebA datasets. We find
our approach can significantly improve the quality of generated samples whilst
maintaining a smooth latent-space manifold to represent the data. The method

of the Sun's corona. Most theories for coronal heating postulate that free
energy in the form of magnetic twist/stress is injected by the photosphere into
the corona where the free energy is converted into heat either through
reconnection or wave dissipation. The magnetic helicity associated with the
twist/stress, however, is expected to be conserved and appear in the corona. In
previous work we showed that helicity associated with the small-scale twists
undergoes an inverse cascade via stochastic reconnection in the corona, and
ends up as the observed large-scale shear of filament channels. Our ``helicity
condensation'' model accounts for both the formation of filament channels and
the observed smooth, laminar structure of coronal loops. In this paper, we
demonstrate, using helicity- and energy-conserving numerical simulations of a
coronal system driven by photospheric motions, that the model also provides a
natural mechanism for heating the corona. We show that the heat generated by
the reconnection responsible for the helicity condensation process is
sufficient to account for the observed coronal heating. We study the role that
helicity injection plays in determining coronal heating and find that,
crucially, the heating rate is only weakly dependent on the net helicity
preference of the photospheric driving. Our calculations demonstrate that
motions with 100\% helicity preference are least efficient at heating the
corona; those with 0\% preference are most efficient. We discuss the physical
origins of this result and its implications for the observed corona.

example, for a (uniformly) random permutation $\pi$, the event that no point is
displaced by more than a fixed distance $d$ and the event that $\pi$ is the
product of at most $k$ adjacent transpositions are positively correlated. In
contrast, under the weak Bruhat order we show that this completely fails:
surprisingly, there are two up-sets each of measure $1/2$ whose intersection
has arbitrarily small measure.
  We also prove analogous correlation results for a class of non-uniform
measures, which includes the Mallows measures. Some applications and open
problems are discussed.

from limited samples to generalize well in the whole state-action space. This
problem is much more severe in high-dimensional state environments, such as
game playing with raw pixel inputs. Under this situation, even state-of-the-art
adversary-based imitation learning algorithms fail. Through empirical studies,
we find that the main cause lies in the failure of training a powerful
discriminator to generate meaningful rewards in high-dimensional environments.
Although it seems that dimensionality reduction can help, a straightforward
application of off-the-shelf methods cannot achieve good performance. In this
work, we show in theory that the balance between dimensionality reduction and
discriminative training is essential for effective learning. To achieve this
target, we propose HashReward, which utilizes the idea of supervised hashing to
realize such an ideal balance. Experimental results show that HashReward could
outperform state-of-the-art methods for a large gap under the challenging

core scales to giant molecular cloud scales. A multi-scale observational
characterisation of an entire molecular complex is necessary to constrain them.
We investigate star formation in G202.3+2.5, a ~10x3 pc sub-region of the
Monoceros OB1 cloud with a complex morphology harbouring interconnected
filamentary structures. We aim to connect the evolution of cores and filaments
in G202.3+2.5 with the global evolution of the cloud and to identify the
engines of the cloud dynamics. In this first paper, the star formation activity
is evaluated by surveying the distributions of dense cores and protostars, and
their evolutionary state, as characterised using both infrared observations
from the Herschel and WISE telescopes and molecular line observations with the
IRAM 30-m telescope. We find ongoing star formation in the whole cloud, with a
local peak in star formation activity around the centre of G202.3+2.5 where a
chain of massive cores (10-50 Msun) forms a massive ridge (>150 Msun). All
evolutionary stages from starless cores to Class II protostars are found in
G202.3+2.5, including a possibly starless, large column density (8x10^{22}
cm-2), and massive (52 Msun) core. All the core-scale observables examined in
this paper point to an enhanced star formation activity centred on the junction
between the three main branches of the ramified structure of G202.3+2.5. This
suggests that the increased star-formation activity results from the
convergence of these branches. To further investigate the origin of this
enhancement, it is now necessary to extend the analysis to larger scales, in
order to examine the relationship between cores, filaments and their
environment. We address these points through the analysis of the dynamics of
G202.3+2.5 in a joint paper.

two-dimensional Mott insulating and superconducting states, simple electronic
properties, and high doping/bandwidth tunability in the same sample. Here we
report the temperature dependence of the transport properties under electron
and hole doping in an organic Mott electric-double-layer transistor. At high
temperatures, the bad-metal behavior widely appears except at half filling
regardless of the doping polarity. At lower temperatures, the pseudogap
behavior is observed only under hole doping, while the Fermi-liquid-like

universal high-energy scale phenomenon, while the pseudogap behavior is based
on lower energy scale physics that can be influenced by details of the band

Assuming that agents are risk-averse and select paths with minimum conditional

Wardrop equilibrium (CWE). We focus on computing this equilibrium under the
condition that the distribution of the uncertainty is unknown and a set of
independent and identically distributed samples is available. To this end, we
define the sample average approximation scheme where CWE is estimated with
solutions of a variational inequality problem involving sample average
approximations of the CVaR. We establish two properties for this scheme. First,
under continuity of costs and boundedness of uncertainty, we prove asymptotic
consistency, establishing almost sure convergence of approximate equilibria to
CWE as the sample size grows. Second, under the additional assumption of
Lipschitz cost, we prove exponential convergence where the probability of the
distance between an approximate solution and the CWE being smaller than any
constant approaches unity exponentially fast. Simulation example validates our

learning the dynamics of complex and partially observable physical systems.
However, their use in the robotics domain is, to date, still limited. In this
paper, we introduce Belief Regulated Dual Propagation Networks (BRDPN), a
general-purpose learnable physics engine, which enables a robot to predict the
effects of its actions in scenes containing groups of articulated multi-part
objects. Specifically, our framework extends recently proposed propagation
networks (PropNets) and consists of two complementary components, a physics
predictor and a belief regulator. While the former predicts the future states
of the object(s) manipulated by the robot, the latter constantly corrects the
robot's knowledge regarding the objects and their relations. Our results showed
that after training in a simulator, the robot can reliably predict the
consequences of its actions in object trajectory level and exploit its own
interaction experience to correct its belief about the state of the
environment, enabling better predictions in partially observable environments.
Furthermore, the trained model was transferred to the real world and verified
in predicting trajectories of pushed interacting objects whose joint relations
were initially unknown. We compared BRDPN against PropNets, and showed that
BRDPN performs consistently well. Moreover, BRDPN can adapt its physic
predictions, since the relations can be predicted online.

the threshold value $k_c = 0.2\eta_K^{-1}$ where $\eta_K$ is the Kolmogorov
length scale of the flow. When the data are available over a period of one
large eddy turn-over time scale, the filtered enstrophy and other small scale
quantities are reconstructed with a $30\%$ or smaller normalized point-wise
error, and a $90\%$ point-wise correlation. The spectral correlation between
the reconstructed and target fields is higher than $80\%$ for all wavenumbers.
Minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids (MVEEs) and MVEE trees are introduced to
quantitatively compare the geometry of non-local structures. Results show that,
for the majority samples, errors in the locations and the sizes of the
reconstructed structures are within $15\%$, and those in the orientations is
within $15^\circ$. This investigation demonstrates that satisfactory
reconstruction of the scales two or more octaves smaller is possible if data at
large scales are available for at least one large eddy turn-over time. In
comparison, a direct substitution scheme results in three times bigger
point-wise discrepancy in enstrophy. The spectral difference between the
reconstructed and target velocity fields is more than ten times higher than

prediction models in the recent decades, the ``spring predictability barrier''

To overcome this barrier, here we develop an analysis tool, the System Sample
Entropy (SysSampEn), to measure the complexity (disorder) of the system
composed of temperature anomaly time series in the Nino 3.4 region. When
applying this tool to several near surface air-temperature and sea surface
temperature datasets, we find that in all datasets a strong positive
correlation exists between the magnitude of El Nino and the previous calendar
year's SysSampEn (complexity). We show that this correlation allows to forecast
the magnitude of an El Nino with a prediction horizon of 1 year and high
accuracy (i.e., Root Mean Square Error $=0.23^\circ C$ for the average of the
individual datasets forecasts). For the on-going 2018 El Nino event, our method
forecasts a weak El Nino with a magnitude of $1.11\pm 0.23^\circ C$. Our
framework presented here not only facilitates a long--term forecasting of the
El Nino magnitude but can potentially also be used as a measure for the
complexity of other natural or engineering complex systems.

Precise tuning of the photon energy makes it possible to observe the transition
regime between direct photoemission into the open continuum and field induced
ionization of highly-excited Rydberg states. The paths can be identified by
their characteristic dependency on the extraction field and on the Ti:sapphire
polarization. ToF analysis allowed us to disentangle the ionization paths and
the dependence of the spatio-temporal distribution of the cold electrons on the
polarization of the ionizing laser.

important to knowledge graph completion. For a fact $(h,r,t)$ with the head
entity $h$ having a relation $r$ with the tail entity $t$, the current
approaches aim to learn low dimensional representations
$(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{r},\mathbf{t})$, each of which corresponds to the elements
in $(h, r, t)$, respectively. As $(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{r},\mathbf{t})$ is
learned from the existing facts within a knowledge graph, these representations
can not be used to detect unknown facts (if the entities or relations never
occur in the knowledge graph).
  This paper proposes a new approach called TransW, aiming to go beyond the
current work by composing knowledge graph embeddings using word embeddings.
Given the fact that an entity or a relation contains one or more words (quite
often), it is sensible to learn a mapping function from word embedding spaces
to knowledge embedding spaces, which shows how entities are constructed using
human words. More importantly, composing knowledge embeddings using word
embeddings makes it possible to deal with the emerging new facts (either new
entities or relations). Experimental results using three public datasets show
the consistency and outperformance of the proposed TransW.

goal of AI research aiming to deal with the complex data in the real world and

The constraints come from two basic assumptions of data, which are independent

outputs. We completely break these constraints and develop the subjectivity
learning theory for general intelligence. We assign the mathematical meaning
for the philosophical concept of subjectivity and build the data representation
of general intelligence. Under the subjectivity representation, then the global
risk is constructed as the new learning goal. We prove that subjectivity
learning holds a lower risk bound than traditional machine learning. Moreover,
we propose the principle of empirical global risk minimization (EGRM) as the
subjectivity learning process in practice, establish the condition of
consistency, and present triple variables for controlling the total risk bound.
The subjectivity learning is a novel learning theory for unconstrained real

from structure formation driven by supersonic turbulence, rather than from the

called stochastic and spatial concurrent constraint systems (SSCC) -- in the
rewriting logic semantic framework. The approach is based on an enhanced and
generalized model of concurrent constraint programming (CCP) where
computational hierarchical spaces can be assigned to belong to agents. The
executable semantics faithfully represents and operationally captures the
highly concurrent nature, uncertain behavior, and spatial and epistemic
characteristics of reactive systems with flow of information. In SSCC, timing
attributes -- represented by stochastic duration -- can be associated to
processes, and exclusive and independent probabilistic choice is also
supported. SMT solving technology, available from the Maude system, is used to
realize the underlying constraint system of SSCC with quantifier-free formulas
over integers and reals. This results in a fully executable real-time symbolic
specification that can be used for quantitative analysis in the form of
statistical model checking. The main features and capabilities of SSCC are
illustrated with examples throughout the paper. This contribution is part of a
larger research effort aimed at making available formal analysis techniques and

models, such as ComplEx and TorusE, reinterpreting them as a variant of
translation-based models. Then, we show that these models utilize paths for
link prediction and propose a method for evaluating rules based on this idea.
Finally, we combine an embedding model and observed feature models to predict
missing triples. This is possible because all of these models utilize paths. We
also conduct experiments, including link prediction tasks, with standard
datasets to evaluate our method and framework. The experiments show that our
method can evaluate rules faster than traditional methods and that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of link prediction.

MAGIC telescopes in La Palma, Canary Islands, are constantly exposed to the

sand, changing temperatures, and rain. Because of the size of the telescope,
protecting the structure with a dome is not practical. The current mirrors used
in MAGIC are aluminum front-coated glass mirrors, covered by a thin quartz
layer. But even with this protective layer, significant decrease in
reflectivity can be seen on timescales of several years. The quartz layer is
very delicate and can be easily scratched or damaged, which also makes cleaning
the mirrors almost impossible. We have tested a novel design of glass mirrors
that can be easily cleaned and should show almost no degradation in
reflectivity due to environmental influences. The protective layer is a
ultra-thin glass sheet which is back-coated with aluminum, making it possible
to simply wipe the mirror with household cleaning tools. In this contribution
we will present results from laboratory tests of reflectivity and focusing
properties of prototype mirrors, as well as long-term tests on-site at the

loops during 2012 August 31 filament eruption. Prior to the eruption,
individual bright strands composing one of the legs of the filament were
observed in the 171 A filter channel data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly.
After the onset of the eruption, one of the hooked ribbons started to propagate
and contract, sweeping footpoints of the bright filament strands as well as
coronal loops located close by. Later on, hot flare loops appeared in regions
swept by the hook, where the filament strands were rooted. Timing and
localization of these phenomena suggest that they are caused by reconnection of
field lines composing the filament at the hook, which, to our knowledge, has
not been observed before. This process is not included in the standard flare
model (CSHKP), as it does not address footpoints of erupting flux ropes and
ribbon hooks. It has, however, been predicted using the recent
three-dimensional extensions to the standard flare model. There, the erupting
flux rope can reconnect with surrounding coronal arcades as the hooked
extensions of current ribbons sweep its footpoints. This process results in
formation of flare loops rooted in previous footpoints of the flux rope. Our
observations of sweeping of filament footpoints are well described by this
scenario. In all observed cases, all of the footpoints of the erupting filament
became footpoints of flare loops. This process was observed to last for about
150 minutes, throughout the whole eruption.

an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We measure a

vehicles) in an image of unconstrained congested scenes. Designing a general
crowd counting algorithm applicable to a wide range of crowd images is
challenging, mainly due to the possibly large variation in object scales and
the presence of many isolated small clusters. Previous approaches based on
convolution operations with multi-branch architecture are effective for only
some narrow bands of scales and have not captured the long-range contextual
relationship due to isolated clustering. To address that, we propose SACANet, a
novel scale-adaptive long-range context-aware network for crowd counting.
SACANet consists of three major modules: the pyramid contextual module which
extracts long-range contextual information and enlarges the receptive field, a
scale-adaptive self-attention multi-branch module to attain high scale
sensitivity and detection accuracy of isolated clusters, and a hierarchical
fusion module to fuse multi-level self-attention features. With group
normalization, SACANet achieves better optimality in the training process. We
have conducted extensive experiments using the VisDrone2019 People dataset, the
VisDrone2019 Vehicle dataset, and some other challenging benchmarks. As
compared with the state-of-the-art methods, SACANet is shown to be effective,
especially for extremely crowded conditions with diverse scales and scattered
clusters, and achieves much lower MAE as compared with baselines.

additionally endowed with matter fields. The developed framework then guides
the computation of the most general, alternative theory of gravity that is
consistent with the two fundamental requirements. Utilizing this framework we
recover the cosmological sector of general relativity solely from assuming that
spacetime is a spatially homogeneous and isotropic metric manifold. On top of
that, we explicitly test the perturbative framework by deriving the most
general third-order expansion of a metric theory of gravity that is causally
compatible with a Klein-Gordon scalar field. Thereby we recover the
perturbative expansion of general relativity. To demonstrate how new physics
emerges from our approach, we finally construct the most comprehensive

clustering measurements from the VIDEO survey observations. Using mocks built
from a VIDEO-like photometry, we first explore the bias introduced into
clustering measurements by using stellar masses and redshifts derived from
SED-fitting, rather than the intrinsic values. The propagation of redshift and
mass statistical and systematic uncertainties in the clustering measurements
causes us to underestimate the clustering amplitude. We find then that
clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) modelling results are
qualitatively similar in Horizon-AGN and VIDEO. However at low stellar masses
Horizon-AGN underestimates the observed clustering by up to a factor of ~3,
reflecting the known excess stellar mass to halo mass ratio for Horizon-AGN low
mass haloes, already discussed in previous works. This reinforces the need for
stronger regulation of star formation in low mass haloes in the simulation.
Finally, the comparison of the stellar mass to halo mass ratio in the simulated
catalogue, inferred from angular clustering, to that directly measured from the
simulation, validates HOD modelling of clustering as a probe of the galaxy-halo

fluctuations, i.e. growth of macroscopic fluctuations in a single degree of
freedom, without ordering, in the grand canonical case. We further clarify that
this is a manifestation of nonequivalence of the ensembles, due to the
existence of long range correlations in the grand canonical one. Our results
shed new light on the recent experimental realization of BEC in a photon gas,
suggesting that the observed BEC when prepared under grand canonical conditions
is an instance of condensation of fluctuations.

suppression of the motion-induced dephasing between ground and Rydberg states
of neutral atoms. The dephasing often occurs during the {\it gap} time when the
atom is shelved in a Rydberg state before its deexcitation. By using laser
fields to induce specific extra phase change to the Rydberg state during the
gap time, it is possible to faithfully transfer the Rydberg state back to the
ground state after the gap. Although the Rydberg state transitions back and
forth between different eigenstates during the gap time, it preserves the
blockade interaction between the atom of interest and a nearby Rydberg
excitation. This simple method of suppressing the motional dephasing of a
flying Rydberg atom can be used in a broad range of quantum control over
neutral atoms.

the many-body Schrodinger equation. The core uncertainty inside DFT theory is
the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, the exact form of which is still
unknown. Therefore, the essential part of DFT success is based on the progress
in the development of XC approximations. Traditionally, they are built upon
analytic solutions in low- and high-density limits and result from quantum
Monte Carlo numerical calculations. However, there is no consistent and general
scheme of XC interpolation and functional representation. Many different
developed parametrizations mainly utilize a number of phenomenological rules to
construct a specific XC functional. In contrast, the neural network (NN)
approach can provide a general way to parametrize an XC functional without any
a priori knowledge of its functional form. In this work, we develop NN XC
functionals and prove their applicability to 3-dimensional physical systems. We
show that both the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) are well reproduced by the NN approach. It is demonstrated
that the local environment can be easily considered by changing only the number
of neurons in the first layer of the NN. The developed NN XC functionals show
good results when applied to systems that are not presented in the
training/test data. The generalizability of the formulated NN XC framework
leads us to believe that it could give superior results in comparison with
traditional XC schemes provided training data from high-level theories such as
the quantum Monte Carlo and post-Hartree-Fock methods.

arise from the model which are answered from certain experiments but not from
other experiments. BED can take two forms, and these two forms are expressed in
three example models in this work. The first example takes the form of a
Bayesian linear regression, but also this example is a benchmark for checking
numerical and analytical solutions. One of two parameters is an estimator of
the synthetic experimental data, and the BED task is choosing among which of
the two parameters to inform (limited experimental observability). The second
example is a chemical reaction model with a parameter space of informed
reaction free energy and temperature. The temperature is an independent
experimental design variable explored for information gain. The second and
third examples are of the form of adjusting an independent variable in the
experimental setup. The third example is a catalytic membrane reactor similar

variables, temperature and volume, for the greatest information gain is
conducted. Also, maximum information gain is conducted is optimized with two
algorithms: the differential evolution algorithm and steepest ascent, both of

practical applications, since the acceptance of the OOD input that is
unsupported by the current system may lead to catastrophic failure. However,
most existing OOD detection methods rely heavily on manually labeled OOD
samples and cannot take full advantage of unlabeled data. This limits the
feasibility of these models in practical applications.
  In this paper, we propose a novel model to generate high-quality pseudo OOD
samples that are akin to IN-Domain (IND) input utterances, and thereby improves
the performance of OOD detection. To this end, an autoencoder is trained to map
an input utterance into a latent code. and the codes of IND and OOD samples are
trained to be indistinguishable by utilizing a generative adversarial network.
To provide more supervision signals, an auxiliary classifier is introduced to
regularize the generated OOD samples to have indistinguishable intent labels.
Experiments show that these pseudo OOD samples generated by our model can be
used to effectively improve OOD detection in NLU. Besides, we also demonstrate
that the effectiveness of these pseudo OOD data can be further improved by
efficiently utilizing unlabeled data.

the utility on detecting actions with complex variations. In this paper, we
propose to address the problem by introducing Gaussian kernels to dynamically
optimize temporal scale of each action proposal. Specifically, we present
Gaussian Temporal Awareness Networks (GTAN) --- a new architecture that novelly
integrates the exploitation of temporal structure into an one-stage action
localization framework. Technically, GTAN models the temporal structure through
learning a set of Gaussian kernels, each for a cell in the feature maps. Each
Gaussian kernel corresponds to a particular interval of an action proposal and
a mixture of Gaussian kernels could further characterize action proposals with
various length. Moreover, the values in each Gaussian curve reflect the
contextual contributions to the localization of an action proposal. Extensive
experiments are conducted on both THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets, and
superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.
More remarkably, GTAN achieves 1.9% and 1.1% improvements in mAP on testing set
of the two datasets.

of the large variance of occluders, our goal is a model trained on
occlusion-free data while generalizable to occlusion conditions. In this work,
we integrate prototypes, partial matching and top-down attention regulation
into deep neural networks to realize robust object classification under
occlusion. We first introduce prototype learning as its regularization
encourages compact data clusters, which enables better generalization ability
under inconsistent conditions. Then, attention map at intermediate layer based
on feature dictionary and activation scale is estimated for partial matching,
which sifts irrelevant information out when comparing features with prototypes.
Further, inspired by neuroscience research that reveals the important role of
feedback connection for object recognition under occlusion, a top-down feedback
attention regulation is introduced into convolution layers, purposefully
reducing the contamination by occlusion during feature extraction stage. Our
experiment results on partially occluded MNIST and vehicles from the PASCAL3D+

obtain a universal formula for the scalar curvature $R$. We first review the
thermodynamics of a van der Waals fluid and calculate the coexistence and
spinodal curves. From this we are able to clearly display the phase diagram.
Notwithstanding the invalidity of the equation of state in the coexistence
phase regions, we find that the scalar curvature is always negative for the van
der Waals fluid, indicating that attractive interactions dominate amongst the
fluid microstructures. Along the coexistence curve, the scalar curvature $R$
decreases with temperature, and goes to negative infinity at a critical
temperature. We then numerically study the critical phenomena associated with
the scalar curvature. We next consider four-dimensional charged AdS black
holes. Vanishing of the heat capacity at constant volume yields a divergent
scalar curvature. In order to extract the corresponding information, we define
a new scalar curvature that has behaviour similar to that of a van der Waals
fluid. We analytically confirm that at the critical point of the small/large
black hole phase transition, the scalar curvature has a critical exponent 2,
and $R(1-\tilde{T})^{2}C_{v}=1/8$, the same as that of a van der Waals fluid.
However we also find that the scalar curvature can be positive for the small

may fail to properly describe the quantitative characteristics of each of the
two terms. In the case of the tadpole contribution, the LCFA considerably
underestimates the number of photons emitted for sufficiently high frequency of
the external field. The vertex term predicts emission of a great number of soft
photons whose spectrum is no longer isotropic in contrast to the LCFA results.
A notable difference among the photon yields along different spatial
directions, which is not captured by the LCFA, represents an important
signature for experimental studies of the photon emission process. Since this

algorithms for linear algebra tasks that are compatible with noisy

ground states of the constructed Hamiltonians. Based on the variational quantum
algorithms, we introduce Hamiltonian morphing together with an adaptive ansatz
for efficiently finding the ground state, and show the solution verification.
Our algorithms are especially suitable for linear algebra problems with sparse

problems. The algorithm for matrix multiplications can be also used for
Hamiltonian simulation and open system simulation. We evaluate the cost and

hydrodynamic adiabatic flows from nozzles into a constant pressure-matched

injected material. We find that the morphological classification of a simulated
radio galaxy depends significantly on several factors with increasing distance
(i.e. decreasing observed resolution) and decreasing orientation often causing
re-classification from FR\,II (limb-brightened) to FR\,I (limb-darkened) type.
We introduce the Lobe or Limb Brightening Index (LBI) to measure the radio lobe
type more precisely. The jet density also has an influence as expected with
lower density leading to broader and bridged lobe morphologies as well as
brighter radio jets. Hence, relating observed source type to the intrinsic jet
dynamics is not straightforward. Precession of the jet direction may also be
responsible for wide relaxed sources with lower LBI and FR class as well as for
X-shaped and double-double structures. Helical structures are not generated
because the precession is usually too slow. We conclude that distant radio
galaxies could appear systematically more limb-darkened due to merger-related
re-direction and precession as well as due to the resolution limitation.

of $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus type, with pulsation frequencies at
about $15-18$ day$^{-1}$ for p modes and about $0.2-1.2$ day$^{-1}$ for

examine the period spacing patterns in the free oscillating g modes and
identify them mostly as prograde sectoral dipole modes. The unstable frequency

patterns would be helpful for understanding and representing an image.
Nevertheless, there has not been evidence in support of the idea on describing
an image with a natural-language utterance. In this paper, we introduce a new
design to model a hierarchy from instance level (segmentation), region level
(detection) to the whole image to delve into a thorough image understanding for
captioning. Specifically, we present a HIerarchy Parsing (HIP) architecture
that novelly integrates hierarchical structure into image encoder. Technically,
an image decomposes into a set of regions and some of the regions are resolved
into finer ones. Each region then regresses to an instance, i.e., foreground of
the region. Such process naturally builds a hierarchal tree. A tree-structured
Long Short-Term Memory (Tree-LSTM) network is then employed to interpret the
hierarchal structure and enhance all the instance-level, region-level and
image-level features. Our HIP is appealing in view that it is pluggable to any
neural captioning models. Extensive experiments on COCO image captioning
dataset demonstrate the superiority of HIP. More remarkably, HIP plus a
top-down attention-based LSTM decoder increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1%
to 127.2% on COCO Karpathy test split. When further endowing instance-level and
region-level features from HIP with semantic relation learnt through Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN), CIDEr-D is boosted up to 130.6%.

network of full duplex (FD) operating nodes. Each vehicle in this network
senses the energy level of the channel before and during its transmission. The
measured energy is compared against a dynamic threshold which is preset based
on the target detection probability, transmitter's power, sensing time and
self-interference cancellation (SIC) capability of the vehicles' on board units
(OBU). Probabilities of detection and false alarm, detection threshold before
and during transmission, and effect of residual self interference (SI) on these
metrics have been formulated. It is shown that the proposed scheme would
experience a shorter collision duration. Meanwhile, it also requires a minimum
SIC capability for acceptable operation, below which, system throughput would
be poor due to high false alarm probability. Numerical simulations verify the
accuracy of our analysis. They also illustrate that the proposed model perform
better than the fixed threshold strategy. A trade-off between half duplex (HD)
and FD has been found and the scheme would be applicable even if SIC capability
of OBUs is relatively poor, with no need for complicated and expensive devices
for future vehicular communication.

value in agreement with fundamental parameters of the primary star and also
implies that the near-convective-core rotation rate is almost the same as the
orbital period. Thus both the surface and the core of this Gamma Dor pulsator

dialogue dataset (GoRecDial), which consists of 9,125 dialogue games and 81,260
conversation turns between pairs of human workers recommending movies to each
other. The task is specifically designed as a cooperative game between two
players working towards a quantifiable common goal. We leverage the dataset to
develop an end-to-end dialogue system that can simultaneously converse and
recommend. Models are first trained to imitate the behavior of human players
without considering the task goal itself (supervised training). We then
finetune our models on simulated bot-bot conversations between two paired
pre-trained models (bot-play), in order to achieve the dialogue goal. Our
experiments show that models finetuned with bot-play learn improved dialogue
strategies, reach the dialogue goal more often when paired with a human, and
are rated as more consistent by humans compared to models trained without

values. For a given $s$, there exist $n=2s+1$ states $|s,m\rangle$,
$m=s,s-1,........,-s$. A statistical assembly of particles (like a beam or
target employed in experiments in physics) with the lowest value of spin
$s=\frac {1}{2}$ can be described in terms of probabilities $p_m$ assigned to
the two states $m=\pm \frac {1}{2}$. A generalization of this concept to higher
spins $s>\frac {1}{2}$ leads only to a particularly simple category of
statistical assemblies known as `Oriented systems'. To provide a comprehensive
description of all realizable categories of statistical assemblies in
experiments, it is advantageous to employ the generators of the Lie group
$SU(n)$. The probability domain then gets identified to the interior of regular
polyhedra in $\Re^{n-1},$ where the centre corresponds to an unpolarized
assembly and the vertices represent `pure' states. All the other interior
points correspond to `mixed' states. The higher spin system has embedded within
itself a set of $s(2s+1)$ independent axes, which are determinable empirically.
Only when all these axes turn out to be collinear, the simple category of
`Oriented systems' is realized, where probabilities $p_m$ are assigned to the
states $|s,m\rangle$. The simplest case of higher spin $s=1$ provides an
illustrative example, where additional features of `aligned' and more general
`non oriented' categories are displayed.

always truthfully reported. This may not be practical in all scenarios,
especially in distributed/semi-distributed networks. In this paper, incentive
for truthful reporting in network optimizations with local information is
studied. A novel general model for extending network utility maximization (NUM)
problems to incorporate local information is proposed, which allows each user
to choose its own objective locally and/or privately. Two specific problems,
i.e., a user-centric problem (UCP) and a network-centric problem (NCP), are
studied. In the UCP, a network center aims to maximize the collective benefit
of all users, and truthful reporting from the users regarding their local
information is necessary for finding the solution. We show that the
widely-adopted dual pricing cannot guarantee truthful information reporting
from a user unless the resource is over-supplied or the price is too high for
this user to afford. In the NCP, the network center has its own objective and
preferred solution, and incentive needs to be provided for the users to adopt
the solution it prefers. Truthful reporting from users is necessary for the
center to determine the incentives and achieve its solution. For two-user and
multiuser cases, we propose two mechanisms to motivate truthful reporting from
users while guaranteeing nonnegative utility gains for both the users and the
center. A case study on underlay D2D communication illustrates the application
of the UCP and NCP. Simulations are conducted for the D2D application to
validate the analytical results and demonstrate the proposed mechanisms.

deterministic value gradients with the finite horizon, but it is too myopic
compared with infinite horizon. We firstly give a theoretical guarantee of the
existence of the value gradients in this infinite setting. Based on this
theoretical guarantee, we propose a class of the deterministic value gradient

analytical gradients by the learned model trade off between the variance of the
value gradients and the model bias. Furthermore, to better combine the
model-based deterministic value gradient estimators with the model-free
deterministic policy gradient estimator, we propose the deterministic

where noise generation arises from the scattering of boundary layer

tone with equidistant secondary tones, as discussed in literature. An
interesting feature of the present flows at zero incidence is shown; despite
the geometric symmetry, the flows become non-symmetric with a separation bubble
only on one side of the airfoil. A separation bubble is also observed for the
non-zero incidence flow. For both angles of incidence analyzed, it is shown
that low-frequency motion of the separation bubbles induce a frequency
modulation of the flow instabilities developed along the airfoil boundary

modulation is also observed in the flow quantities, resulting in a complex

Nd layer is not so effective in that it reduces the Hubbard U between the Ni
3dx2-y2 electrons just by 10--20 %. On the other hand, the electron-phonon
coupling is not strong enough to mediate superconductivity of Tc ~ 10 K. These
results indicate that NdNiO2 hosts an almost isolated correlated 3dx2-y2

single-orbital system in the Mott-Hubbard regime. We find that the Fermi
pockets formed by the Nd-layer states dramatically shrink when the

By an extensive materials search, we find that the Fermi pockets almost
disappear in NaNd2NiO4 and NaCa2NiO3.

rely on CNNs trained end-to-end on a vast amount of data. However, these

much different in appearance and/or context from those observed at training
time. This domain shift issue is usually addressed by fine-tuning on smaller
sets of images from the target domain annotated with depth labels.
Unfortunately, relying on such supervised labeling is seldom feasible in most
practical settings. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation
technique which does not require groundtruth labels. Our method relies only on
image pairs and leverages on classical stereo algorithms to produce disparity
measurements alongside with confidence estimators to assess upon their
reliability. We propose to fine-tune both depth-from-stereo as well as
depth-from-mono architectures by a novel confidence-guided loss function that
handles the measured disparities as noisy labels weighted according to the
estimated confidence. Extensive experimental results based on standard datasets
and evaluation protocols prove that our technique can address effectively the
domain shift issue with both stereo and monocular depth prediction
architectures and outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised loss

Asynchronous Many Task runtime systems, a key aspect of the scheduling problem

large-scale deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional parameter fields (which
are high-dimensional after discretization). hIPPYlib overcomes the prohibitive
nature of Bayesian inversion for this class of problems by implementing
state-of-the-art scalable algorithms for PDE-based inverse problems that
exploit the structure of the underlying operators, notably the Hessian of the
log-posterior. The key property of the algorithms implemented in hIPPYlib is
that the solution of the deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse problem
is computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is
independent of the parameter dimension. The mean of the posterior is
approximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing the negative
log-posterior. This deterministic nonlinear least-squares optimization problem
is solved with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior
covariance is approximated by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log
posterior evaluated at the MAP point. This Gaussian approximation is exact when
the parameter-to-observable map is linear; otherwise, its logarithm agrees to
two derivatives with the log-posterior at the MAP point, and thus it can serve
as a proposal for Hessian-based MCMC methods. The construction of the posterior
covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the
Hessian of the log-likelihood. Scalable tools for sample generation are also
implemented. hIPPYlib makes all of these advanced algorithms easily accessible
to domain scientists and provides an environment that expedites the development
of new algorithms. hIPPYlib is also a teaching tool to educate researchers and

optical tracking of probe particles in bacterial and yeast cells where

task mainly due to the complexity of the layout and the highly variant
typography. Nevertheless, in the last few years great progress has been made in
the area of historical OCR, resulting in several powerful open-source tools for
preprocessing, layout recognition and segmentation, character recognition and
post-processing. The drawback of these tools often is their limited
applicability by non-technical users like humanist scholars and in particular
the combined use of several tools in a workflow. In this paper we present an
open-source OCR software called OCR4all, which combines state-of-the-art OCR
components and continuous model training into a comprehensive workflow. A
comfortable GUI allows error corrections not only in the final output, but
already in early stages to minimize error propagations. Further on, extensive
configuration capabilities are provided to set the degree of automation of the
workflow and to make adaptations to the carefully selected default parameters
for specific printings, if necessary. Experiments showed that users with
minimal or no experience were able to capture the text of even the earliest
printed books with manageable effort and great quality, achieving excellent
character error rates (CERs) below 0.5%. The fully automated application on
19th century novels showed that OCR4all can considerably outperform the
commercial state-of-the-art tool ABBYY Finereader on moderate layouts if
suitably pretrained mixed OCR models are available. The architecture of OCR4all
allows the easy integration (or substitution) of newly developed tools for its
main components by standardized interfaces like PageXML, thus aiming at
continual higher automation for historical printings.

of developing a general model to unify the analysis of various replacement

the first part of this work, we consider the case of time-invariant content
popularity based on the independent reference model (IRM). In such case, we

leads to a unique STF. The STF determines the expected trace of the dynamic
change in the cache state distribution, as a result of content requests and
replacements, from any initial point. Moreover, given the replacement scheme,
the STF is only determined by the content popularity. Using four example

show that the STF can be used to analyze replacement schemes such as finding
their steady states, highlighting their differences, and revealing insights
regarding the impact of knowledge of content popularity. Based on the above
results, STF is shown to be useful for characterizing and illustrating
replacement schemes. Extensive numeric results are presented to demonstrate

time-varying content popularity on the STF and how such impact accumulates to
affect the performance of a replacement scheme. Unlike the case in the first
part, the STF is no longer static over time, and we introduce instantaneous STF
to model it. Moreover, we demonstrate that many metrics, such as instantaneous
state caching probability and average cache hit probability over an arbitrary
sequence of requests, can be found using the instantaneous STF. As a steady
state may not exist under time-varying content popularity, we characterize the
performance of replacement schemes based on how the instantaneous STF of a
replacement scheme after a content request impacts on its cache hit probability
at the next request. From this characterization, insights regarding the
relations between the pattern of change in the content popularity, the
knowledge of content popularity exploited by the replacement schemes, and the
effectiveness of these schemes under time-varying popularity are revealed. In
the simulations, different patterns of time-varying popularity, including the

  the subharmonic signal","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1909.02694",,,,"physics.flu-dyn nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The acoustic bubble is an example of a highly nonlinear system which is the
building block of several applications and phenomena ranging from underwater
acoustics to sonochemistry and medicine. Nonlinear behavior of bubbles, and
most importantly 1/2 order subharmonics (SH), are used to increase the contrast
to tissue ratio (CTR) in diagnostic ultrasound (US) and to monitor bubble
mediated therapeutic US. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when
bubbles are sonicated with their SH resonance frequency (fsh=2fr where fr is
the linear resonance frequency), SHs are generated at the lowest excitation
pressure. SHs then increase rapidly with pressure increase and reach an upper
limit of the achievable SH signal strength. Numerous studies have investigated
the pressure threshold of SH oscillations; however, conditions to enhance the
saturation level of SHs has not been investigated. In this paper nonlinear
dynamics of bubbles excited by frequencies in the range of fr<f<2fr is studied
for different sizes of bubbles (400nm-8 micron). We show that the SH resonance
frequency is pressure dependent and decreases as pressure increases. When a
bubble is sonicated with its pressure dependent SH resonance frequency,
oscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation from a P1 or P2 regime to a P2
oscillation regime with higher amplitude. The saddle node bifurcation is
concomitant with over saturation of the SH and UH amplitude and eventual
enhancement of the upper limit of SH and UH strength (e.g. $\approx$ 7 dB in UH
amplitude). This can increase the CTR and signal to noise ratio in
applications. Here, we show that the highest non-destructive SH amplitude
occurs when f~=1.5-1.8fr.

we consider a more complex dissipative perturbation adding the effect of
two-photon absorption and the quintic gain/loss effects that yields formally
the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). We construct a perturbation theory
for the CGLE with a small dissipative perturbation and define the behavior of
the solitonic solutions with parameters of the system and compare the solution
with numerical simulations of the CGLE. We show that similarly to the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation with a simplified dissipation term, a zero-velocity
solitonic solution of non-zero amplitude appears as an attractor for the CGLE.
In this case the amplitude and velocity of the solitonic fixed point attractor
does not depend on the quintic gain/loss effects. Furthermore, the effect of
two-photon absorption leads to an increase in the strength of the solitonic
fixed point attractor.

concentrating stiffness towards the leading edge if resonance cannot be

efficiency can be made at low frequencies by concentrating stiffness away from
the leading edge, since doing so induces efficient travelling wave kinematics.
We also speculate on the effects of a finite Reynolds number in the form of

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1909.02531",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a formal robot motion risk reasoning framework and
develops a risk-aware path planner that minimizes the proposed risk. While
robots locomoting in unstructured or confined environments face a variety of
risk, existing risk only focuses on collision with obstacles. Such risk is
currently only addressed in ad hoc manners. Without a formal definition,
ill-supported properties, e.g. additive or Markovian, are simply assumed.
Relied on an incomplete and inaccurate representation of risk, risk-aware
planners use ad hoc risk functions or chance constraints to minimize risk. The
former inevitably has low fidelity when modeling risk, while the latter
conservatively generates feasible path within a probability bound. Using
propositional logic and probability theory, the proposed motion risk reasoning
framework is formal. Building upon a universe of risk elements of interest,
three major risk categories, i.e. locale-, action-, and traverse-dependent, are
introduced. A risk-aware planner is also developed to plan minimum risk path
based on the newly proposed risk framework. Results of the risk reasoning and
planning are validated in physical experiments in real-world unstructured or
confined environments. With the proposed fundamental risk reasoning framework,
safety of robot locomotion could be explicitly reasoned, quantified, and
compared. The risk-aware planner finds safe path in terms of the newly proposed
risk framework and enables more risk-aware robot behavior in unstructured or
confined environments.

situations only when smoothness is not required. In this paper, we construct
deep neural networks with rectified power units (RePU), which can give better
approximations for smooth functions. Optimal algorithms are proposed to
explicitly build neural networks with sparsely connected RePUs, which we call
PowerNets, to represent polynomials with no approximation error. For general
smooth functions, we first project the function to their polynomial
approximations, then use the proposed algorithms to construct corresponding
PowerNets. Thus, the error of best polynomial approximation provides an upper
bound of the best RePU network approximation error. For smooth functions in
higher dimensional Sobolev spaces, we use fast spectral transforms for
tensor-product grid and sparse grid discretization to get polynomial
approximations. Our constructive algorithms show clearly a close connection
between spectral methods and deep neural networks: a PowerNet with $n$ layers
can exactly represent polynomials up to degree $s^n$, where $s$ is the power of
RePUs. The proposed PowerNets have potential applications in the situations

Bjorken expansion. The Bjorken Equation in the case of a longitudinal expansion
scenario of a non-ideal relativistic medium in finite volume is solved using
certain initial conditions $(\tau_i,T(\tau_i))$ and their effect is studied in
detail. The evolution of the temperature as a function of the proper time
$T(\tau,V)$ is then obtained at different volumes. Different times
characterising different scales of the whole time evolution, like the time of
the finite volume transition point $\tau_0(V)$, the hadronic time $\tau_H(V)$
at which the hadronization is completed, the lifetime of the Colorless Partonic
Plasma $\Delta \tau_{CPP}(V)$ and the lifetime of the confining phase
transition $\Delta \tau_{PT}(V)$ are calculated and their finite size scaling
properties are studied in detail. New finite size scaling laws are derived.
Also, the time evolution of some Thermal Response Functions as the order
parameter $\mathcal{H}(\tau,V)$, energy density $\epsilon(\tau,V)$, pressure
$\mathscr{P}(\tau,V)$ and the sound velocity $\mathscr{C}_{s}(\tau,V)$ are
investigated and studied in detail. We find that the time evolution of our
system is really affected by the colorlessness requirement and the initial
conditions of the partonic matter: the closer the volume is to the
thermodynamic limit, the longer are the times and the lifetimes of the system.
A detailed analysis of the temporal decreasing, in negative power, of the
energy density $\epsilon(\tau,V) \propto \tau^{-\theta}$ in each of the three
stages of the Bjorken expansion is carried out.

are necessary to prevent estimates from becoming unphysical, which very often
happens and which has not yet been noted in the literature. The first fix is to
constrain the limits of certain of the model's parameters; without this limit,
estimates from the model are seen to produce absurd values. The second is to
estimate a point at which additional contributions of atmospheric ammonia are
not part of a planned expert but are the result of natural background levels.
These two fixes produce results that are everywhere physical. Some experiment
types, such as surface broadcast, are not well cast in the Ryden and McNeil
scheme, and lead to over-estimates of atmospheric ammonia.

heterogenous producer-consumers in an exchange space in which interactions
depend on agents' positions. Each agent is described by his production,
consumption, stock of capital, as well as the position he occupies in this
abstract space. Each agent produces one differentiated good whose price is
fixed by market clearing conditions. Production functions are Cobb-Douglas, and
capital stocks follow the standard capital accumulation dynamic equation.
Agents consume all goods but have a preference for goods produced by their
closest neighbors. Agents in the exchange space are subject both to attractive
and repulsive forces. Exchanges drive agents closer, but beyond a certain level
of proximity, agents will tend to crowd out more distant agents. The present
model uses a formalism based on statistical field theory developed earlier by
the authors. This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models
with an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions
and complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of
capital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated.
Interactions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first
phase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial
central position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average
and leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will
experience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital
drives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their
exchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product.
As usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher
rates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase,
attractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an
additional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed
initially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial
stock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold
and occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain
below the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the
periphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less
homogenous than in the first phase.

occupied pores, snapping off a gas bubble, which then moves to a stable
configuration. This phenomenon is induced by the capillary instability due to
the wettability heterogeneity of the pore network and has a much smaller time
scale as compared to the evaporation process. The capillary instability induced
liquid refilling and bubble movement are explained in detail based on the
analysis of the images obtained from the visualization experiment. The
capillary valve effect, which hinders the movement of the gas-liquid interface
and is induced by the sudden geometrical expansion between small and large
pores, can be suppressed by the residual liquid in the large pore. For better
understanding of the capillary instability induced gas-liquid two-phase
transport during evaporation, a novel pore network model is developed, which
considers not only the capillary and viscous forces but also the inertial
forces that are seldom taken into account in the previous models. The pore
network modeling results are in good agreement with the experimental data,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed pore network model, which
opens up a new route for better understanding of the role of inertial forces in
two-phase transport in porous media.
