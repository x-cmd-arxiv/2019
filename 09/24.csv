random seed by investigating the effects of the induced randomness on model
performance and the robustness of the model in general. We specifically perform
a controlled study on the effect of random seeds on the behaviour of attention,
gradient-based and surrogate model based (LIME) interpretations. Our analysis
suggests that random seeds can adversely affect the consistency of models
resulting in counterfactual interpretations. We propose a technique called
Aggressive Stochastic Weight Averaging (ASWA)and an extension called
Norm-filtered Aggressive Stochastic Weight Averaging (NASWA) which improves the
stability of models over random seeds. With our ASWA and NASWA based
optimization, we are able to improve the robustness of the original model, on
average reducing the standard deviation of the model's performance by 72%.

pelvis in order to estimate a patient's complete pelvis. A SSM of normal,
complete, female pelvis anatomy was created and evaluated from 42 subjects. A
leave-one-out test was performed to characterise the inherent generalisation
capability of the SSM. An additional leave-one-out test was conducted to
measure performance of the smooth extrapolation method and an existing
""cut-and-paste"" extrapolation method. Unknown anatomy was simulated by keeping
the axial slices of the patient's acetabulum intact and varying the amount of
the superior iliac crest retained; from 0% to 15% of the total pelvis extent.
The smooth technique showed an average improvement over the cut-and-paste
method of 1.31 mm and 3.61 mm, in RMS and maximum surface error, respectively.
With 5% of the iliac crest retained, the smoothly estimated surface had an RMS
surface error of 2.21 mm, an improvement of 1.25 mm when retaining none of the
iliac crest. This anatomical estimation method creates the possibility of a
patient and surgeon benefiting from the use of a CAS system and simultaneously
reducing the patient's radiation exposure.

Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) aboard the Cassini spacecraft at low and

ortho-to-para ratio in Titan's troposphere. We used constraints from limb
spectra between 50 and 900 cm$^{-1}$ and from in situ measurements by the
Huygens probe to characterize the temperature, haze and gaseous absorber
profiles. We confirm that the N$_2$-CH$_4$ collision-induced absorption (CIA)

of 70-85 K. We find that the N$_2$-N$_2$ CIA coefficients are also too low in
the N$_2$ band far wing, beyond 110 cm$^{-1}$, in agreement with recent quantum
mechanical calculations. We derived a H$_2$ mole fraction equal to (0.88 $\pm$
0.13) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, which pertains to the $\sim$1-34 km altitude range
probed by the S$_0$(0) and S$_0$(1) lines. The H$_2$ para fraction is close to
equilibrium in the 20-km region. We have investigated different mechanisms that
may operate in Titan's atmosphere to equilibrate the H$_2$ o-p ratio and we
have developed a one-dimensional model that solves the continuity equation in
presence of such conversion mechanisms. We conclude that exchange with H atoms
in the gas phase or magnetic interaction of H$_2$ in a physisorbed state on the
surface of aerosols are too slow compared with atmospheric mixing to play a
significant role. On the other hand, magnetic interaction of H$_2$ with CH$_4$,
and to a lesser extent N$_2$, can operate on a timescale similar to the
vertical mixing time in the troposphere. This process is thus likely
responsible for the o-p equilibration of H$_2$ in the mid-troposphere implied
by CIRS measurements.

than the bulk due to changed topologies and symmetry protections. The
outstanding problem is to find out if the exoticity of a material is linked to
the changed topology at the surface or it is a bulk property. Hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) is a significantly bulk sensitive technique
(escape depth of valence electrons is about 40 \AA\ for 6 keV photon energy)
and the probing depth can be tuned by changing the electron emission angle.
Therefore, HAXPES is often used to reveal the surface-bulk differences in a
material. Here, we show that the delineation of surface-bulk differences in the
valence band spectral functions using this method is highly non-trivial due to
the complexity arising from linear dichroic effect in addition to the change in
surface sensitivity. We show that core level spectra can be used to reveal the
surface-bulk differences in the electronic structure. The Ca 2p spectra exhibit
evidence of significant hybridization with the conduction electrons revealing
their importance in the electronic properties of the system as also found for
the charge reservoir layers in cuprate superconductors. The Fe 2p core level
spectra as a function of bulk sensitivity and temperature reveals an unusual
scenario; while the surface electronic structure corroborates well with the
observed phase transitions of the system, the bulk spectra exhibit signature of
additional structural phases providing a rare evidence of structural anomaly to
be a bulk property.

hybrid model that uses linear models to locally substitute any black-box model,
capturing subspaces that are most likely to be in a class while leaving the
rest of the data to the black-box. MALC brings together the interpretable power
of linear models and good predictive performance of a black-box model. We
formulate the training of a MALC model as a convex optimization. The predictive
accuracy and transparency (defined as the percentage of data captured by the
linear models) balance through a carefully designed objective function and the
optimization problem is solved with the accelerated proximal gradient method.
Experiments show that MALC can effectively trade prediction accuracy for
transparency and provide an efficient frontier that spans the entire spectrum

constant-parameters reaction-diffusion PDE systems. The approach relies on the
emulation of backstepping control along with a suitable triggering condition
which establishes the time instants at which the control value needs to be
sampled/updated. In this paper, it is shown that under the proposed
event-triggered boundary control, there exists a minimal dwell-time
(independent of the initial condition) between two triggering times and
furthermore the well-posedness and global exponential stability are guaranteed.
The analysis follows small-gain arguments and builds on recent papers on
sampled-data control for this kind of PDE. A simulation example is presented to
validate the theoretical results.

with no prior assumption on the relation of communities among different layers.
Our model relies on a novel idea of incorporating a large set of generic
localized community label constraints across the layers, in conjunction with
the celebrated Stochastic Block Model (SBM) in each layer. Accordingly, we
build a probabilistic graphical model over the entire multiplex network by
treating the constraints as Bayesian priors. We mathematically prove that these
constraints/priors promote existence of identical communities across layers
without introducing further correlation between individual communities. The
constraints are further tailored to render a sparse graphical model and the
numerically efficient Belief Propagation algorithm is subsequently employed. We
further demonstrate by numerical experiments that in the presence of consistent
communities between different layers, consistent communities are matched, and
the detectability is improved over a single layer. We compare our model with a
""correlated model"" which exploits the prior knowledge of community correlation
between layers. Similar detectability improvement is obtained under such a
correlation, even though our model relies on much milder assumptions than the
correlated model. Our model even shows a better detection performance over a

goal is to investigate the impact of stellar magnetism on the forcing of tidal

the base and the top of the convective envelope. We find that the large-scale
magnetic field of the star has little influence on the excitation of tidal

systems, but that it has a major impact on the way waves are dissipated. Our

Extremal Ensemble Learning. It uses iterative extremal updating of an ensemble
of network partitions, which can be found by a conventional base algorithm, to
find a node partition that maximizes modularity. At each iteration, core groups
of nodes that are in the same community in every ensemble partition are
identified and used to form a reduced network. Partitions of the reduced
network are then found and used to update the ensemble. The smaller size of the
reduced network makes the scheme efficient. We use the scheme to analyze the
community structure in a set of commonly studied benchmark networks and find
that it outperforms all other known methods for finding the partition with
maximum modularity.

consensus among researchers of how people vote strategically, even in simple
voting settings. This paper addresses this gap by comparing different
approaches that have been used to model strategic voting, including expected
utility maximization, heuristic decisionmaking, and bounded rationality models.
The models are applied to data collected from hundreds of people in controlled
voting experiments, where people vote after observing non-binding poll
information. We introduce a new voting model, the Attainability- Utility (AU)
heuristic, which weighs the popularity of a candidate according to the poll,
with the utility of the candidate to the voter. We argue that the AU model is
cognitively plausible, and show that it is able to predict peoples voting
behavior significantly better than other models from the literature. It was
almost at par with (and sometimes better than) a machine learning algorithm
that uses substantially more information. Our results provide new insights into
the strategic considerations of voters, that undermine the prevalent
assumptions of much theoretical work in social choice.

statechart models, Yakindu in particular, so that medical functionalities and

into the framework to provide formal verification capabilities to verify safety

open-source Yakindu statecharts as well as the transformation rules from
statecharts to timed automata, do not have built-in semantics. The ambiguity
becomes unavoidable unless formal semantics is defined for the framework, which

exists and can be computed in pseudo-polynomial time; moreover, an allocation
that maximizes the weighted Nash social welfare may not be strongly WEF1, but
always satisfies the weak version of the property. Moreover, we establish that
a generalization of the round-robin picking sequence algorithm produces in

polynomial-time quantum computation can be simulated by polylogarithmic-depth
quantum computation interleaved with polynomial-depth classical computation.
Separately, Aaronson conjectured that there exists an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ such
that $\textrm{BQP}^{\mathcal{O}} \neq
(\textrm{BPP}^\textrm{BQNC})^{\mathcal{O}}$. These conjectures are intriguing
allusions to the unresolved potential of combining classical and low-depth
quantum computation. In this work we show that the Welded Tree Problem, which
is an oracle problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time as shown by
Childs et al. (arXiv:quant-ph/0209131), cannot be solved in
$\textrm{BPP}^{\textrm{BQNC}}$, nor can it be solved in the class that Jozsa
describes. This proves Aaronson's oracle separation conjecture and provides a
counterpoint to Jozsa's conjecture relative to the Welded Tree oracle problem.
More precisely, we define two complexity classes, $\textrm{HQC}$ and
$\textrm{JC}$ whose languages are decided by two different families of
interleaved quantum-classical circuits. $\textrm{HQC}$ contains
$\textrm{BPP}^\textrm{BQNC}$ and is therefore relevant to Aaronson's
conjecture, while $\textrm{JC}$ captures the model of computation that Jozsa
considers. We show that the Welded Tree Problem gives an oracle separation
between either of $\{\textrm{JC}, \textrm{HQC}\}$ and $\textrm{BQP}$.
Therefore, even when interleaved with arbitrary polynomial-time classical
computation, greater ""quantum depth"" leads to strictly greater computational
ability in this relativized setting.

been successful in many arenas, it is clearly inadequate for describing many
interesting natural phenomena driven far from equilibrium. The simplest step
towards that goal is a better understanding of nonequilibrium steady-states
(NESS). Here we focus on one of the distinctive features of NESS, persistent
probability currents, and their manifestations in our climate system. We
consider the natural variability of the steady-state climate system, which can
be approximated as a NESS. These currents must form closed loops, which are odd
under time reversal, providing the crucial difference between systems in
thermal equilibrium and NESS. Seeking manifestations of such current loops
leads us naturally to the notion of probability angular momentum and
oscillations in the space of observables. Specifically, we will relate this
concept to the asymmetric part of certain time-dependent correlation functions.
Applying this approach, we propose that these current loops give rise to
preferred spatio-temporal patterns of natural climate variability that take the
form of climate oscillations such as the El-Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) and the Madden-Julien Oscillation (MJO). In the space of climate
indices, we observe persistent currents and define a new diagnostic for these
currents: the probability angular momentum. Using the observed climatic time
series of ENSO and MJO, we compute both the averages and the distributions of
the probability angular momentum. These results are in good agreement with the
analysis from a linear Gaussian model. We propose that, in addition to being a
new quantification of climate oscillations across models and observations, the
probability angular momentum provides a meaningful characterization for all
statistical systems in NESS.

discovered within the first $\sim$Gyr after the Big Bang. One pathway for the
formation of SMBHs is through the collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs). A
possible obstacle to this scenario is that the collapsing gas fragments and
forms a cluster of main-sequence stars. Here we raise the possibility that
stellar collisions may be sufficiently frequent and energetic to inhibit the
contraction of the massive protostar, avoiding strong UV radiation driven
outflows, and allowing it to continue growing into an SMS. We investigate this
scenario with semianalytic models incorporating star formation, gas accretion,
dynamical friction from stars and gas, stellar collisions, and gas ejection. We
find that when the collapsing gas fragments at a density of $\lesssim 3\times
10^{10}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, the central protostar contracts due to infrequent
stellar mergers, and in turn photoevaporates the remaining collapsing gas,
resulting in the formation of a $\lesssim 10^4~{\rm M_\odot}$ object. On the
other hand, when the collapsing gas fragments at higher densities (expected for
a metal-poor cloud with $Z\lesssim10^{-5}\,{\rm Z_\odot}$ with suppressed ${\rm
H_2}$ abundance) the central protostar avoids contraction and keeps growing via
frequent stellar mergers, reaching masses as high as $\sim 10^5-10^6\,{\rm
M_\odot}$. We conclude that frequent stellar mergers represent a possible
pathway to form massive BHs in the early universe.

parameter of $b=20\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. As this sightline is
${\sim}1100\,\textrm{pkpc}$ ($0.7R_\textrm{vir}$) from the center of Abell 133,
we suggest that all gas in the filament is hot at this location, or that any

white dwarf (WD) tidal disruption event (TDE). We consider a TDE where a 0.2
$M_{\odot}$ helium WD is disrupted by a $10^{2.5}\,M_{\odot}$ intermediate-mass
black hole (IMBH). The helium WD is not only tidally disrupted but is also
detonated by the tidal compression and by succeeding shocks. We focus on the
emission powered by radioactive nuclei in the unbound TDE ejecta. We perform
hydrodynamic simulations coupled with nuclear reactions, post-process detailed
nucleosynthesis calculations, and then radiative transfer simulations. We thus
derive multi-band light curves and spectra. The helium WD TDE shows rapid
($\Delta t_{1\mathrm{mag}}\simeq5\text{--}10$ days) and relatively faint
($L_{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq10^{42}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) light curves,
because the ejecta mass and $^{56}$Ni mass are low ($0.12\,M_{\odot}$ and
$0.03\,M_{\odot}$, respectively). The spectra show strong calcium and Fe-peak
features and very weak silicon features, reflecting the peculiar elemental
abundance. The key feature is the Doppler shift of the spectral lines up to
$\simeq\pm12,000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, depending on the viewing
angle, due to the bulk motion of the ejecta. Our model matches well with two
rapid and faint transients reported in Pursiainen et al. (2018). The particular
model presented here does not match with observed SNe Iax, calcium-rich
transients, or .Ia explosion candidates, either in the spectra or light curves.
However, we expect a large variety of the observational signatures once a wide
range of the WD/black hole masses and orbital parameters are considered. This
study contributes to the search for WD TDEs with current and upcoming surveys,
and to the identification of IMBHs as disrupters in the TDEs.

level of intrinsic scatter in c200 is constrained as \sigma(\ln[c200]) < 24%

halos. This is likely caused in part by the X-ray selection bias in terms of
the relaxation state. We determine the temperature-mass (Tx-M500) relation for
a subset of 105 XXL clusters that have both measured HSC lensing masses and
X-ray temperatures. The resulting Tx-M500 relation is consistent with the

at group scales, but has a slightly steeper mass trend, implying a smaller mass
scale in the cluster regime. The overall offset in the Tx-M500 relation is at
the $1.5\sigma$ level, corresponding to a mean mass offset of (34\pm 20)%. We
also provide bias-corrected, weak-lensing-calibrated M200 and M500 mass

nuclear star cluster, M54, which is the only galaxy nucleus that can be
resolved into individual stars at optical wavelengths. It is thus a key target
for understanding the formation of nuclear star clusters and their relation to
globular clusters. We present a large Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
data set that covers M54 out to $\sim$2.5 half-light radius, from which we
extracted the spectra of $\sim$6600 cluster member stars. We use these data in
combination with HST photometry to derive age and metallicity for each star.
The stellar populations show a well defined age-metallicity relation, implying
an extended formation history for the central region of Sgr dSph. We classify
these populations into three groups, all with the same systemic velocity: young
metal-rich (YMR; 2.2\,Gyr, \mbox{[Fe/H]$=-0.04$}); intermediate-age metal-rich
(IMR; 4.3\,Gyr, \mbox{[Fe/H]$=-0.29$}); and old metal-poor (OMP; 12.2\,Gyr,
\mbox{[Fe/H]$=-1.41$}). The YMR and OMP populations are more centrally
concentrated than the IMR population, which are likely stars of the Sgr dSph.
We suggest the OMP population is the result of accretion and merging of two or
more old and metal-poor globular clusters dragged to the center by dynamical
friction. The YMR is consistent with being formed by in situ star formation in
the nucleus. The ages of the YMR population suggest that it may have been
triggered into forming when the Sgr dSph began losing its gas during the most
recent interaction with the Milky Way, $\sim$3\,Gyr ago.

smooth transition from the prompt phase, dominated by synchrotron emission in a
moderately fast cooling regime, to the afterglow phase whose emission has been
observed from the radio to the GeV energy range. The LAT (0.1 - 100 GeV) light
curve initially rises ($F_{\rm LAT}\propto t^{2.4}$), peaks at $\sim$78 s, and
falls steeply ($F_{\rm LAT}\propto t^{-2.2}$) afterwards. The peak, which we
interpret as the onset of the fireball deceleration, allows us to estimate the
bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{0}\sim 150 \ (300)$ under the assumption of a
wind-like (homogeneous) circum-burst medium density. We derive a flux upper
limit in the LAT energy range at the time of H.E.S.S. detection, but this does
not allow us to unveil the nature of the high energy component observed by
H.E.S.S. We fit the prompt spectrum with a physical model of synchrotron
emission from a non-thermal population of electrons. The 0 - 35 s spectrum
after its $E F(E)$ peak (at 1 - 2 MeV) is a steep power law extending to
hundreds of MeV. We derive a steep slope of the injected electron energy
distribution $N(\gamma)\propto \gamma^{-5}$. Our fit parameters point towards a
very low magnetic field ($B'\sim 1 $ G) in the emission region.

applications involving the bulk properties of the convection zone including its
total mass, which excludes the spectroscopic technique. Overall, the calibrated
ML2/alpha is smaller than what is commonly used in evolutionary models and
theoretical determinations of the blue edge of the instability strip for
pulsating DB and DBA stars. With calibrated ML2/alpha we are able to deduce
more accurate convection zone sizes needed for studies of planetary debris
mixing and dredge-up of carbon from the core. We highlight this by calculating
examples of metal-rich 3D DBAZ models and finding their convection zone masses.
Mixing length calibration represents the first step of in-depth investigations
of convective overshoot in white dwarfs with helium-dominated atmospheres.

the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of
science in observational cosmology. While a rich literature exists on
morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data volumes,
coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming 'Big-Data'
surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large
data volumes make such datasets intractable for visual inspection (even via
massively-distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it
difficult to employ techniques like supervised machine-learning, since it may
be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short timescales.
Unsupervised machine learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally
suited to the morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we
employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order
to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed
from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the
Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously
reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of 'morphological
clusters', populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then
benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which
we release publicly) exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends
in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological type at z<1 (e.g.
stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours and the position of galaxies on the
star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised
machine learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will
become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.

now include the weak lensing effect of magnification bias on galaxy clustering
in a publicly available, modular parameter estimation code. We thus forecast
constraints on the parameters of the concordance cosmological model, dark
energy, and modified gravity theories from galaxy clustering tomographic
angular power spectra. We find that a correct modelling of magnification is
crucial in order not to bias the estimation of cosmological parameters,
especially in the case of deep galaxy surveys. Our case study adopts
specifications of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), which is a
full-sky, deep radio-continuum survey, and is expected to probe the Universe up
to redshift $z\sim6$. We assume the Limber approximation, and include
magnification bias on top of density fluctuations and redshift-space
distortions. By restricting our analysis to the regime where the Limber
approximation holds true, we significantly minimise the computational time
needed, compared to that of the exact calculation. We also show that there is a
trend for more biased parameter estimates from neglecting magnification when
the redshift bins are very wide. We conclude that this result implies a strong
dependence on the lensing contribution, which is an integrated effect and
becomes dominant when wide redshift bins are considered. Finally, we note that
instead of being considered a contaminant, magnification bias encodes important
cosmological information, and its inclusion leads to an alleviation of the
degeneracy between the galaxy bias and the amplitude normalisation of the
matter fluctuations.

objects, disfavoring the alternative solution of low-redshift dusty
star-forming interlopers. We derive stellar masses of
$\mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/M_\odot)\sim11$ and ongoing star formation rates
placing these galaxies $\gtrsim 1-2$ dex below the main sequence at their
redshifts. The adopted parametrization of the star formation history suggests
that these sources experienced a strong ($\langle \rm SFR \rangle \sim
1200-3500\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) and short ($\sim 50$ Myr) burst of star
formation, peaking $\sim 150-500$ Myr before the time of observation, all
properties reminiscent of the characteristics of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs)

densities and the properties of these two populations. We find a fair agreement
only with the deepest sub-mm surveys detecting not only the most extreme
starbursts, but also more normal galaxies. We support these findings by further
exploring the Illustris-TNG cosmological simulation, retrieving populations of

However, we focus on the ATLAS lepton + jet data, for which correlations of the

We investigate the effect of some reasonable decorrelation of these
uncertainties, finding the impact on the fit quality to be significant and the
resultant gluon not negligible. This is in particular found to be larger than
the effect of including NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections in the top quark pair

physics underlying these errors sources and in particular the uncertainty on

perform this diagnostic test on a clean interacting system (subjected to a
static electric field) that exhibits three distinct phases: integrable,

that in the non-integrable ergodic phase, the equivalence between the

holds. In sharp contrast, in the integrable and non-integrable MBL phases, the
entanglement entropy shows large eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations, and
differs from the thermodynamic entropy. Thus the non-integrable MBL phase
violates ETH similar to an integrable system; however, a key difference is that
the magnitude of the entanglement entropy in the MBL phase is significantly
smaller than in the integrable phase, where the entanglement entropy is of the
same order of magnitude as in the non-integrable phase, but with a lot of
eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations. Quench dynamics from an initial CDW
state independently supports the validity of the ETH in the ergodic phase and
its violation in the MBL phase.

($M_{BH} \sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$), accreting at rates close to the Eddington
limit, at very high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 6-7$) in the early Universe. Recent
observations indicate that the host galaxies of the first quasars are
chemically evolved systems, containing unexpectedly large amounts of dust. Such
a combination of high luminosities and large dust content should form
favourable physical conditions for radiative dusty feedback. We explore the
impact of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, driven by radiation
pressure on dust, on the early growth of massive black holes. Assuming
Eddington-limited exponential black hole growth, we find that the dynamics and
energetics of the radiation pressure-driven outflows also follow exponential
trends at late times. We obtain modest outflow energetics (with momentum flux
$\dot{p} \lesssim L/c$ and kinetic power $\dot{E}_{k} \lesssim 10^{-3} L$),
comparable with available observations of quasar-driven outflows at very high
redshifts, but significantly lower than typically observed in local quasars and
predicted by wind energy-driven models. AGN radiative dusty feedback may thus
play an important role in powering galactic outflows in the first quasars in
the early Universe.

flesh out some of its details along the way. Thanks to the compact form of the
resulting amplitudes, many of their properties, and in particular the
constraints of perturbative unitarity, are easily seen in this formalism. Our
approach is purely bottom-up, assuming just the standard-model electroweak
spectrum as well as the conservation of electric charge and fermion number. The
most general massive three-point amplitudes consistent with these symmetries
are derived and studied in detail, as the primary building blocks for the
construction of scattering amplitudes. We employ a simple argument, based on
tree-level unitarity of four-point amplitudes, to identify the three-point
amplitudes that are non-renormalizable at tree level. This bottom-up analysis
remarkably reproduces many low-energy relations implied by electroweak symmetry
through the standard-model Higgs mechanism and beyond it. We then discuss
four-point amplitudes. The gluing of three-point amplitudes into four-point
amplitudes in the massive spinor helicity formalism is clarified. As an
example, we work out the $\psi^c \psi Zh$ amplitude, including also the
non-factorizable part. The latter is an all-order expression in the
effective-field-theory expansion. Further constraints on the couplings are
obtained by requiring perturbative unitarity. In the $\psi^c \psi Zh$ example,
one for instance obtains the renormalizable-level relations between vector and
fermion masses and gauge and Yukawa couplings. We supplement our bottom-up
derivations with a matching of three- and four-point amplitude coefficients

variations serve as indirect evidence for bound supermassive black hole
binaries (SBHBs) at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we test the SBHB
hypothesis for 14 quasars with double-peaked broad emission lines using their
long-term (14--41 years) radial velocity curves. We improve on previous work by
(a) using elliptical instead of circular orbits for the SBHBs, (b) adopting a
statistical model for radial velocity jitter, (c) employing a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method to explore the orbital parameter space efficiently and build
posterior distributions of physical parameters and (d) incorporating new
observations. We determine empirically that jitter comprises approximately
Gaussian distributed fluctuations about the smooth radial velocity curves that
are larger than the measurement errors by factors of order a few. We initially
treat jitter by enlarging the effective error bars and then verify this
approach via a variety of Gaussian process models for it. We find lower mass
limits for the hypothesized SBHBs in the range $10^8$--$10^{11}\;M_{\odot}$.
For seven objects the SBHB scenario appears unlikely based on goodness-of-fit
tests. For two additional objects the minimum SBHB masses are unreasonably
large ($>10^{10}\;M_{\odot}$), strongly disfavoring the SBHB scenario. Using
constraints on the orbital inclination angle (which requires some assumptions)
makes the minimum masses of four more objects unreasonably large. We also cite
physical and observational arguments against the SBHB hypothesis for nine
objects. We conclude that the SBHB explanation is not the favoured explanation
of double-peaked broad emission lines.

for decoding in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). However, one major drawback
of these methods is that it is not possible to determine what aspect of the
signal the classifier is built on, leaving open the possibility that artifacts
drive classification performance. In areas where artifactual control is
problematic, specifically neurofeedback and BCIs in patient populations, this
has led people to continue to rely on spatial filters as a way of generating
features that are provably brain-related. Furthermore, these methods also
suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are almost infeasible in
high-density online BCI systems. To tackle these drawbacks, we introduce here a
method for computing spatial filters from any linear function in the Riemannian
tangent space, which allows for more efficient classification as well as the
removal of artifact sources from classifiers built on Riemannian methods. We
first prove a fundamental relationship between certain tangent spaces and
spatial filtering methods, including an explanation of common spatial patterns
within this framework, and then validate our proposed approach using an
open-access BCI analysis framework.

in that the observed radii and temperatures are often respectively larger and

elucidate this issue, we examine the double-lined Kepler eclipsing binary star
system KIC 8736245. We supplement the near-continuous 4-year Kepler light curve
with ground-based multicolor photometry from Mount Laguna Observatory and
spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The binary has an edge-on,
circular 5.07 day orbit with stellar masses equal to $0.987\pm0.009$ and
$0.782\pm0.009\,\text{M}_\odot$ and radii of $1.311 \pm 0.006$ and $0.804 \pm
0.004\,\text{R}_\odot$, respectively, and an estimated age of 7-9 Gyr. We find
that the stellar radii are consistent with theoretical models within the
uncertainties, whereas the temperature of the secondary star is $\sim$6% cooler
than predicted. An important aspect of this work is that the uncertainties
derived from a single epoch (individual night of observations) underestimates
the overall system parameter uncertainties due to the effect of the 1-4%
fluctuations caused by stellar activity. Our error estimates come from the
spread in parameters measured at 8 epochs. From the periodicities in the light
curve and from the eclipse times, we measure candidate spin periods to be
approximately 4.98 and 5.87 days for the primary and secondary star.
Surprisingly, these imply super- and sub-synchronous rotation compared to the

origin of high-ionization nebular HeII emission in galaxies dominated by
stellar photoionization remains unclear. Accretion-powered radiation from
high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is still one of the leading proposed
explanations for the missing $\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing photons, but this
scenario has yet to be conclusively tested. In this paper, we present nebular
line predictions from a grid of photoionization models with input SEDs
containing the joint contribution of both stellar atmospheres and a multi-color
disk model for HMXBs. This grid demonstrates that HMXBs are inefficient
producers of the photons necessary to power HeII, and can only boost this line
substantially in galaxies with HMXB populations large enough to power X-ray
luminosities of $10^{42}$ erg/s per unit star formation rate (SFR). To test
this, we assemble a sample of eleven low-redshift star-forming galaxies with
high-quality constraints on both X-ray emission from Chandra and HeII emission
from deep optical spectra, including new observations with the MMT. These data
reveal that the HMXB populations of these nearby systems are insufficient to
account for the observed HeII strengths, with typical X-ray luminosities or
upper limits thereon of only $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg/s per SFR. This indicates
that HMXBs are not the dominant source of $\mathrm{He^+}$ ionization in these
metal-poor star-forming galaxies. We suggest that the solution may instead
reside in revisions to stellar wind predictions, softer X-ray sources, or very
hot products of binary evolution at low metallicity.

potentials. The effective potential is calculated to next-to-leading order
(NLO) in the $\pi^{\pm}$-condensed phase, the $K^{\pm}$-condensed phase, and
the $K^0/\bar{K}^0$-condensed phase. It is shown that the transitions from the
vacuum phase to these phases are second order and take place when,
$|\mu_I|=m_{\pi}$, $|{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_S|=m_K$, and
$|-{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_S|=m_K$, respectively at tree level and remains unchanged
at NLO. The transition between the two condensed phases is first order. The
effective potential in the pion-condensed phase is independent of $\mu_S$ and
in the kaon-condensed phases, it only depends on the combinations
$\pm{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_S$ and not separately on $\mu_I$ and $\mu_S$. We
calculate the pressure, isospin density and the equation of state in the
pion-condensed phase and compare our results with recent $(2+1)$-flavor lattice
QCD data. We find that the three-flavor $\chi$PT results are in good agreement
with lattice QCD for $\mu_I<200$ MeV, however for larger values $\chi$PT
produces values for observables that are consistently above lattice results.
For $\mu_I>200$ MeV, the two-flavor results are in better agreement with
lattice data. Finally, we consider the observables in the limit of very heavy
$s$-quarks, where they reduce to their two-flavor counterparts with
renormalized couplings. The disagreement between the predictions of two and
three flavor $\chi$PT can largely be explained by the differences in the
experimental values of the low-energy constants.

patients showing extreme response (n=72) and non-response (n=27) to the

underlie response to the drug. Although no common SNP (MAF>5%) crossed the

polymorphisms in genes SPNS3, HDC, MDGA2, NSG1 and RASGEF1C, which collectively
predict clinical response to levetiracetam in our cohort with ~91% predictive
accuracy. Among these genes, HDC, NSG1, MDGA2 and RASGEF1C are potentially
implicated in synaptic neurotransmission, while SPNS3 is an atypical solute
carrier transporter homologous to SV2A, the known molecular target of
levetiracetam. Furthermore, we performed gene- and pathway-based statistical
analysis on sets of rare and low-frequency variants (MAF<5%) and we identified
associations between the following genes or pathways and response to
levetiracetam: a) genes PRKCB and DLG2, which are involved in glutamatergic
neurotransmission, a known target of anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam;
b) genes FILIP1 and SEMA6D, which are involved in axon guidance and modelling
of neural connections; and c) pathways with a role in synaptic

disinhibition of SNARE formation. In summary, our approach to utilise whole

in condensed matter exhibits large spikes close to the atomic nuclei. We showed
that these spikes in the electron densities, 3-4 orders of magnitude larger
than those inside the Sun's core, have no effect on the neutrino emission and
absorption probabilities or on the neutrinoless double beta decay probability.
However, it was not clear if the effect of these spikes is equivalent to that
of an average constant electron density in matter. We investigated these
effects by a direct integration of the coupled Dirac equations describing the
propagation of flavor neutrinos into, through, and out of the matter. We found
little evidence that these spikes affect the standard oscillations
probabilities, but found a new fast and efficient algorithm of calculating
these probabilities for neutrinos propagating through varying electron
densities.

and Weyl semimetals are studied paying special attention to the structure and
properties of the surface Fermi arcs. The latter make the electric charge and
current density distributions in nanowires strongly nonuniform as the majority
of the charge density is accumulated at the surface. It is found that a Weyl
semimetal wire also supports a magnetization current localized mainly at the
surface because of the Fermi arcs contribution. By using the Kubo linear
response approach, the direct current (DC) conductivity is calculated and it is
found that its spatial profile is nontrivial. By explicitly separating the
contributions of the surface and bulk states, it is shown that when the
electric chemical potential and/or the radius of the wire is small, the
electron transport is determined primarily by the Fermi arcs and the electrical
conductivity is much higher at the surface than in the bulk. Due to the rise of
the surface-bulk transition rate, the relative contribution of the surface
states to the total conductivity gradually diminishes as the chemical potential
increases. In addition, the DC conductivity at the surface demonstrates
noticeable peaks when the Fermi level crosses energies of the surface states.

  https://github.com/jjy1994/MemGuard",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a membership inference attack, an attacker aims to infer whether a data
sample is in a target classifier's training dataset or not. Specifically, given
a black-box access to the target classifier, the attacker trains a binary
classifier, which takes a data sample's confidence score vector predicted by
the target classifier as an input and predicts the data sample to be a member
or non-member of the target classifier's training dataset. Membership inference
attacks pose severe privacy and security threats to the training dataset. Most
existing defenses leverage differential privacy when training the target
classifier or regularize the training process of the target classifier. These
defenses suffer from two key limitations: 1) they do not have formal
utility-loss guarantees of the confidence score vectors, and 2) they achieve
suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs.
  In this work, we propose MemGuard, the first defense with formal utility-loss
guarantees against black-box membership inference attacks. Instead of tampering
the training process of the target classifier, MemGuard adds noise to each
confidence score vector predicted by the target classifier. Our key observation
is that attacker uses a classifier to predict member or non-member and
classifier is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Based on the observation, we
propose to add a carefully crafted noise vector to a confidence score vector to
turn it into an adversarial example that misleads the attacker's classifier.
Our experimental results on three datasets show that MemGuard can effectively
defend against membership inference attacks and achieve better privacy-utility
tradeoffs than existing defenses. Our work is the first one to show that
adversarial examples can be used as defensive mechanisms to defend against
membership inference attacks.

formation of LTO domains close to the transition temperature and how the domain

temperature and to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the

The MICROSCOPE mission aims to test its validity to a precision of $10^{-15}$,
two orders of magnitude better than current on-ground tests, by using two
masses of different compositions (titanium and platinum alloys) on a
quasi-circular trajectory around the Earth. This is realised by measuring the
accelerations inferred from the forces required to maintain the two masses
exactly in the same orbit. Any significant difference between the measured
accelerations, occurring at a defined frequency, would correspond to the
detection of a violation of the WEP, or to the discovery of a tiny new type of
force added to gravity. MICROSCOPE's first results show no hint for such a
difference, expressed in terms of E\""otv\""os parameter

  High-Energy Emission from Prompt to Afterglow","24 pages, 9 figures, Accepted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab5b05",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on the observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 190114C by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The
early-time observations reveal multiple emission components that evolve
independently, with a delayed power-law component that exhibits significant
spectral attenuation above 40 MeV in the first few seconds of the burst. This
power-law component transitions to a harder spectrum that is consistent with
the afterglow emission observed at later times. This afterglow component is
clearly identifiable in the GBM and BAT light curves as a slowly fading
emission component on which the rest of the prompt emission is superimposed. As
a result, we are able to constrain the transition from internal shock to
external shock dominated emission. We find that the temporal and spectral
evolution of the broadband afterglow emission can be well modeled as
synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into a wind-like
circumstellar environment and find that high-energy photons observed by Fermi
LAT are in tension with the theoretical maximum energy that can be achieved
through synchrotron emission from a shock. These violations of the maximum
synchrotron energy are further compounded by the detection of very high energy
(VHE) emission above 300 GeV by MAGIC concurrent with our observations. We
conclude that the observations of VHE photons from GRB 190114C necessitates
either an additional emission mechanism at very high energies that is hidden in
the synchrotron component in the LAT energy range, an acceleration mechanism
that imparts energy to the particles at a rate that is faster than the electron
synchrotron energy loss rate, or revisions of the fundamental assumptions used
in estimating the maximum photon energy attainable through the synchrotron
process.

topology optimization of structures based on hierarchical B-splines. This work
focuses on the influence of the discretization approach and the adaptation
strategy on the optimization results and computational cost. The geometry of
the design is represented implicitly by the iso-contour of a level set
function. An immersed boundary technique, here the extended finite element
method, is used to predict the structural response. Both the level set function
and the state variable fields are discretized by hierarchical B-splines. While
only first-order B-splines are used for the state variable fields, up to third
order B-splines are considered for discretizing the level set function. The
discretizations of the level set function and the state variable fields are
locally refined along the material interfaces and selectively coarsened within
the bulk phases. For locally refined/coarsened meshes, truncated B-splines are
considered. The properties of the proposed mesh adaptation strategy are studied
for level set topology optimization where either the initial design is
comprised of a uniform array of inclusions or inclusions are generated during
the optimization process. Numerical studies employing static linear elastic
material/void problems in 2D and 3D demonstrate the ability of the proposed
method to start from a coarse mesh and converge to designs with complex
geometries and fine features, reducing the overall computational cost.
Comparing optimization results for different B-spline orders suggests that
higher order basis functions promote the development of smooth designs and
suppress the emergence of small features, without providing an explicit feature
size control. A distinct advantage of cubic over quadratic B-splines is not
observed.

induced by the addition of a source term for small cluster sizes. We consider
both discrete and continuous coagulation equations, and allow for a large class
of coagulation rate kernels, with the main restriction being boundedness from
above and below by certain weight functions. The weight functions depend on two
power law parameters, and the assumptions cover, in particular, the commonly
used free molecular and diffusion limited aggregation coagulation kernels. Our
main result shows that the two weight function parameters already determine
whether there exists a stationary solution under the presence of a source term.
In particular, we find that the diffusive kernel allows for the existence of
stationary solutions while there cannot be any such solutions for the free
molecular kernel. The argument to prove the non-existence of solutions relies
on a novel power law lower bound, valid in the appropriate parameter regime,
for the decay of stationary solutions with a constant flux. We obtain optimal
lower and upper estimates of the solutions for large cluster sizes, and prove
that the solutions of the discrete model behave asymptotically as solutions of
the continuous model.

severely the influence network for low initial cultural diversity, resulting in
a network composed of only microscopic components in the thermodynamic limit.

agreements in libration and hindered translation bands are due to the improved
dynamics of the H-bond network enabled by a less structured liquid in the

simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) excitations, single-shot inversion-recovery (IR)

calibrationless model-based reconstruction is extended to SMS, formulating the
estimation of parameter maps and coil sensitivities from all slices as a single
nonlinear inverse problem. Joint-sparsity constraints are further applied to
the parameter maps to improve T1 precision. Validations of the proposed method
are performed for a phantom and for the human brain and liver in six healthy

performance of SMS acquisitions compared to the conventional spoke-interleaved
multi-slice acquisition using model-based reconstruction. Apart from good

times near the light curve maximum. The TESS satellite observed ESO-Halpha 99
with high cadence during one of these minor minima and found brightness
fluctuations on timescales of days and hours. Imaging with UKIRT shows the
outline of an outflow cavity, and we find one knot of H_2 1-0 S(1) emission,
now named MHO 1520, on the symmetry axis of this nebula, indicating recent
collimated outflow activity from ESO-Halpha 99. Its pre-outburst SED shows a
flat FIR spectrum, confirming its early evolutionary state and its similarity
to other deeply embedded objects in the broader EXor class. The pre-outburst
luminosity is 34 L_sun, a much higher luminosity than typical EXors, indicating
that ESO-Halpha 99 may be a star of intermediate mass.

causes distortion in the nonlinear power amplifier of the transmitter.
Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and Cubic Metric (CM) are the common metrics
to quantify the phenomenon. A promising approach for PAPR or CM reduction is
Sign Selection which is based on altering the signs of the data symbols. In
this paper, the Method of Conditional Expectations (CE Method) is proposed to
obtain a competing suboptimal solution to the Sign Selection problem. For PAPR
reduction, a surrogate metric is introduced which allows for an efficient
application of the CE Method. For CM reduction, the tractability of the
definition of CM is exploited to this end. The algorithm is analyzed to obtain
an upper bound on the worst-case reduced metric value. A noticeable
characteristic is the persistent reduction capability for a wide range of
subcarrier numbers. In particular, simulations show a reduction of the
so-called ""effective PAPR"" to about 6.5 dB from 10.5 dB and 11.7 dB
respectively for 64 to 1024 subcarriers. A similar steady reduction of 3 dB is
observed for CM. In addition, the CE Method leads to a pruned version of Sign
Selection which halves the rate loss.

nucleation and propagation with a sharp (nonsmeared) representation of the
crack. Implicit time-stepping schemes are often favored in mechanics due to
their ability to take larger time steps in quasistatic and moderate dynamic
problems. Furthermore, initially rigid cohesive models are typically preferred
when the location of the crack is not known in advance, since initially elastic
models artificially lower the material stiffness. It is challenging to include
an initially rigid cohesive model in an implicit scheme because the initiation
of fracture corresponds to a nondifferentiability of the underlying potential.
In this work, an interior-point method is proposed for implicit time stepping
of initially rigid cohesive fracture. It uses techniques developed for convex
second-order cone programming for the nonconvex problem at hand. The underlying
cohesive model is taken from Papoulia (2017) and is based on a
nondifferentiable energy function. That previous work proposed an algorithm
based on successive smooth approximations to the nondifferential objective for
solving the resulting optimization problem. It is argued herein that cone
programming can capture the nondifferentiability without smoothing, and the
resulting cone formulation is amenable to interior-point algorithms. A further
benefit of the formulation is that other conic inequality constraints are
straightforward to incorporate. Computational results are provided showing that
certain contact constraints can be easily handled and that the method is
practical.

tailor their magnetic properties. When considering the two extreme cases of the
$Co_{x}Fe_{3-x}O_{4}$ series, i.e. the $x=0$ and $x=1$ values, one finds that
the system evolves from a negative cubic-anisotropy energy constant,
$K_{C}^{-}<0$, to a positive one, $K_{C}^{+}>0$. Thus, what happens for
intermediate $x$-compositions? In this work we present a very simple
phenomenological model for the anisotropy, under the \textit{macrospin}
approximation, in which the resultant anisotropy is just directly proportional
to the amount of $Co$. First, we perform a detailed analysis on a rather ideal
system in which the extreme values have the same magnitude (i.e.
$|K_{C}^{-}|=|K_{C}^{+}|$) and then we focus on the real $Co_{x}Fe_{3-x}O_{4}$
system, for which $|K_{C}^{+}|\sim 18|K_{C}^{-}|$. Remarkably, the approach
reproduces rather well the experimental values of the heating performance of
$Co_{x}Fe_{3-x}O_{4}$ nanoparticles, suggesting that our simple approach may in
fact be a good representation of the real situation. This gives rise to an
intriguing related possibility arises: a $Co$-doping composition should exist
for which the effective anisotropy tends to zero, estimated here as 0.05.

  graphs with one-sided error (It is all about forbidden subgraphs)",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of characterizing testable graph properties (properties that can
be tested with a number of queries independent of the input size) is a
fundamental problem in the area of property testing. While there has been some
extensive prior research characterizing testable graph properties in the dense
graphs model and we have good understanding of the bounded degree graphs model,
no similar characterization has been known for general graphs, with no degree
bounds. In this paper we take on this major challenge and consider the problem
of characterizing all testable graph properties in general planar graphs.
  We consider the model in which a general planar graph can be accessed by the
random neighbor oracle that allows access to any given vertex and access to a
random neighbor of a given vertex. We show that, informally, a graph property
$P$ is testable with one-sided error for general planar graphs if and only if
testing $P$ can be reduced to testing for a finite family of finite forbidden
subgraphs. While our presentation focuses on planar graphs, our approach
extends easily to general minor-free graphs.
  Our analysis of the necessary condition relies on a recent construction of
canonical testers in the random neighbor oracle model that is applied here to
the one-sided error model for testing in planar graphs. The sufficient
condition in the characterization reduces the problem to the task of testing
$H$-freeness in planar graphs, and is the main and most challenging technical
contribution of the paper: we show that for planar graphs (with arbitrary
degrees), the property of being $H$-free is testable with one-sided error for
every finite graph $H$, in the random neighbor oracle model.

Recent studies applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize single

However, optimization of global traffic condition over a large road network
fundamentally is a cooperative multi-agent control problem, for which
single-agent RL is not suitable due to environment non-stationarity and
infeasibility of optimizing over an exponential joint-action space. Motivated
by these challenges, we propose QCOMBO, a simple yet effective multi-agent

competitive performance of QCOMBO versus recent state-of-the-art MARL

of the conventional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological

the diversity of the generated geology through interpretable latent vectors.
The resulting samples are ensured to have the equal probability (or an unbiased
distribution) as from the training dataset. This is critical when applying GANs
to generate unbiased and representative geological models that can be further
used to facilitate objective uncertainty evaluation and optimal decision-making
in oil field exploration and development.
  We proposed and implemented a new variant of GANs called Info-WGAN for the
geological facies modeling that combines Information Maximizing Generative
Adversarial Network (InfoGAN) with Wasserstein distance and Gradient Penalty
(GP) for learning interpretable latent codes as well as generating stable and
unbiased distribution from the training data. Different from the original GAN
design, InfoGAN can use the training images with full, partial, or no labels to
perform disentanglement of the complex sedimentary types exhibited in the
training dataset to achieve the variety and diversity of the generated samples.
This is accomplished by adding additional categorical variables that provide
disentangled semantic representations besides the mere randomized latent vector
used in the original GANs. By such means, a regularization term is used to
maximize the mutual information between such latent categorical codes and the
generated geological facies in the loss function.
  Furthermore, the resulting unbiased sampling by Info-WGAN makes the data
conditioning much easier than the conventional GANs in geological modeling
because of the variety and diversity as well as the equal probability of the
unconditional sampling by the generator.

been extensively studied over the past few decades. Practical observations,
however, often contain compositional noise, i.e. a nonlinear shift along the
time axis, which makes standard methods not directly applicable. The key
challenge is that these observations are not ""aligned"", and registration
procedures are required for successful estimation. In this paper, we propose an
alignment-based framework for positive intensity estimation. We first show that
the intensity function is area-preserved with respect to compositional noise.
Such a property implies that the time warping is only encoded in the normalized
intensity, or density, function. Then, we decompose the estimation of the
intensity by the product of the estimated total intensity and estimated
density. The estimation of the density relies on a metric which measures the
phase difference between two density functions. An asymptotic study shows that
the proposed estimation algorithm provides a consistent estimator for the
normalized intensity. We then extend the framework to estimating non-negative
intensity functions. The success of the proposed estimation algorithms is
illustrated using two simulations. Finally, we apply the new framework in a
real data set of neural spike trains, and find that the newly estimated
intensities provide better classification accuracy than previous methods.

demonstrate that a fitting procedure for 1-D data extracted from the scattering

distances, rather than the usual Hamming distance. That is, a codemaker chooses
a hidden vector $\mathbf{y}\in\{-k,-k+1,\dots,k-1,k\}^n$ and answers to queries
of the form $\Vert\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}\Vert_p$ where
$\mathbf{x}\in\{-k,-k+1,\dots,k-1,k\}^n$. The goal is to minimize the number of
queries made in order to correctly guess $\mathbf{y}$.
  Motivated by this question, in this work, we develop a nonadaptive polynomial
time algorithm that works for a natural class of separable distance measures,
i.e.\ coordinate-wise sums of functions of the absolute value. This in
particular includes distances such as the smooth max (LogSumExp) as well as
many widely-studied $M$-estimator losses, such as $\ell_p$ norms, the
$\ell_1$-$\ell_2$ loss, the Huber loss, and the Fair estimator loss. When we
apply this result to $\ell_p$ queries, we obtain an upper bound of
$O\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{n\log k}{\log n}\right\}\right)$ queries for any
real $1\leq p<\infty$. We also show matching lower bounds up to constant
factors for the $\ell_p$ problem, even for adaptive algorithms for the

$\mathbf{y}'$ such that $\Vert\mathbf{y}'-\mathbf{y}\Vert_p\leq R$ for any
$R\leq k^{1-\varepsilon}n^{1/p}$ for constant $\varepsilon>0$. Thus,
essentially any approximation of this problem is as hard as finding the hidden
vector exactly, up to constant factors. Finally, we show that for the noisy
version of the problem, i.e. the setting when the codemaker answers queries
with any $q = (1\pm\varepsilon)\Vert\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}\Vert_p$, there is no

effectiveness in improving GANs was demonstrated on multiple datasets. However,
DRS and MH-GAN are based on discriminator based density ratio estimation (DRE)
methods, so they may not work well if the discriminator in the trained GAN is
far from optimal. Moreover, they do not apply to some GANs (e.g., MMD-GAN). In
this paper, we propose a novel Softplus (SP) loss for DRE. Based on it, we
develop a sample-based DRE method in a feature space learned by a specially
designed and pre-trained ResNet-34 (DRE-F-SP). We derive the rate of
convergence of a density ratio model trained under the SP loss. Then, we
propose three different density ratio subsampling methods (DRE-F-SP+RS,

power sources. However, the safety issue associated with the employment of
highly flammable liquid electrolyte impedes the further development of
next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently, researchers reported the use
of electrospun core-shell fiber as the battery separator consisting of polymer
layer as protective shell and flame retardants loaded inside as core. In case
of a typical battery shorting, the protective polymer shell melts during
thermal-runaway and the flame retardants inside would be released to suppress
the combustion of the electrolyte. Due to the use of a single precursor
solution for electrospinning containing both polymer and flame retardants, the
weight ratio of flame retardants is limited and dependent. Herein, we developed
a dual-nozzle, coaxial electrospinning approach to fabricate the core-shell
nanofiber with a greatly enhanced flame retardants weight percentage in the
final fibers. The weight ratio of flame retardants of triphenyl phosphate in
the final composite reaches over 60 wt.%. The LiFePO4-based cell using this
composite nanofiber as battery separator exhibits excellent flame-retardant
property without compromising the cycling stability or rate performances. In
addition, this functional nanofiber can also be coated onto commercial
separators instead of being used directly as separators.

An
uncertainty variable is characterized by an uncertainty set, in which its

by a set map, from a given realization of a variable to a set of possible
realizations of another variable. We prove Bayes' law and the law of total
probability equivalents for uncertainty variables. We define a notion of
independence, conditional independence, and pairwise independence for a
collection of uncertainty variables, and show that this new notion of
independence preserves the properties of independence defined over random
variables. We then develop a graphical model, namely Bayesian uncertainty
network, a Bayesian network equivalent defined over a collection of uncertainty
variables, and show that all the natural conditional independence properties,
expected out of a Bayesian network, hold for the Bayesian uncertainty network.
We also define the notion of point estimate, and show its relation with the
maximum a posteriori estimate. Probability theory starts with a distribution
function (equivalently a probability measure) as a primitive and builds all
other useful concepts, such as law of total probability, Bayes' law,
independence, graphical models, point estimate, on it. Our work shows that it
is perfectly possible to start with a set, instead of a distribution function,

head detection is often trapped in more false positives, and 2) the performance
of human detector frequently drops dramatically in crowd scenes. To handle
these two issues, we present a novel joint head and human detection network,
namely JointDet, which effectively detects head and human body simultaneously.
Moreover, we design a head-body relationship discriminating module to perform
relational learning between heads and human bodies, and leverage this learned
relationship to regain the suppressed human detections and reduce head false

bounding boxes of the CityPersons and Caltech-USA datasets, and conduct
extensive experiments on the CrowdHuman, CityPersons and Caltech-USA datasets.
As a consequence, the proposed JointDet detector achieves state-of-the-art
performance on these three benchmarks. To facilitate further studies on the

from equilibrium states decay with the same relaxation rates. In contrast, a
first passage time is the required time for arriving for the first time from
one state to another. In this paper, we discuss how and why the slowest
relaxation rates of relaxation modes are reconstructed from the first passage
times. As an illustrative model, we use a continuous-time Markov state model of
vacancy diffusion in KCl nanoclusters. Using this model, we reveal that all
characteristics of the relaxations in KCl nanoclusters come from the fact that
they are hybrids of two kinetically different regions of the fast surface and
slow bulk diffusions. The origin of the different diffusivities turns out to
come from the heterogeneity of the activation energies on the potential energy
landscapes. We also develop a stationary population method to compute the mean
first passage times as mean times required for pair annihilations of
particle-hole pairs, which enables us to obtain the symmetric results of
relaxation rates under the exchange of the sinks and the sources. With this
symmetric method, we finally show why the slowest relaxation times can be
reconstructed from the mean first passage times.

  Deletions",,,,,"cs.IT cs.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We give a complete answer to the following basic question: ""What is the
maximal fraction of deletions or insertions tolerable by $q$-ary list-decodable
codes with non-vanishing information rate?""
  This question has been open even for binary codes, including the restriction
to the binary insertion-only setting, where the best-known result was that a
$\gamma\leq 0.707$ fraction of insertions is tolerable by some binary code
family.
  For any desired $\epsilon > 0$, we construct a family of binary codes of
positive rate which can be efficiently list-decoded from any combination of
$\gamma$ fraction of insertions and $\delta$ fraction of deletions as long as $
\gamma+2\delta\leq 1-\epsilon$. On the other hand, for any $\gamma,\delta$ with
$\gamma+2\delta=1$ list-decoding is impossible. Our result thus precisely
characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for
insertions and deletions.
  We further generalize our result to codes over any finite alphabet of size
$q$. Surprisingly, our work reveals that the feasibility region for $q>2$ is
not the natural generalization of the binary bound above. We provide tight
upper and lower bounds that precisely pin down the feasibility region, which
turns out to have a $(q-1)$-piece-wise linear boundary whose $q$ corner-points
lie on a quadratic curve.
  The main technical work in our results is proving the existence of code
families of sufficiently large size with good list-decoding properties for any
combination of $\delta,\gamma$ within the claimed feasibility region. We
achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh, Ma; SIAM
J. Discrete Math; 2014]. Finally, we give a simple yet powerful concatenation
scheme for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes which transforms any such
(non-efficient) code family (with vanishing information rate) into an
efficiently decodable code family with constant rate.

phaseless linear measurements. This problem can be effectively solved by
minimizing a nonconvex amplitude-based loss function. However, this loss
function is non-smooth. To address the non-smoothness, a series of methods have
been proposed by adding truncating, reweighting and smoothing operations to
adjust the gradient or the loss function and achieved better performance. But
these operations bring about extra rules and parameters that need to be
carefully designed. Unlike previous works, we present a smooth amplitude flow
method (SAF) which minimizes a novel loss function, without additionally
modifying the gradient or the loss function during gradient descending. Such a
new heuristic can be regarded as a smooth version of the original non-smooth
amplitude-based loss function. We prove that SAF can converge geometrically to
a global optimal point via the gradient algorithm with an elaborate
initialization stage with a high probability. Substantial numerical tests
empirically illustrate that the proposed heuristic is significantly superior to
the original amplitude-based loss function and SAF also outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of the recovery rate and the converging

Convolutional Neural Network, that is, only the objects or parts of them with
the most discriminative response will be located. However, the activation maps
often display different local maximum responses or relatively weak response
when one image contains multiple objects with the same type or small objects.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-scale discriminative
region discovery method to localize not only more integral objects but also as
many as possible with only image-level class labels. The gradient weights
flowing into different convolutional layers of CNN are taken as the input of
our method, which is different from previous methods only considering that of
the final convolutional layer. To mine more discriminative regions for the task
of object localization, the multiple local maximum from the gradient weight
maps are leveraged to generate the localization map with a parallel sliding
window. Furthermore, multi-scale localization maps from different convolutional
layers are fused to produce the final result. We evaluate the proposed method

related topics, but with quite different goals. In DE, one attempts to estimate
the intrinsic dimensionality or number of latent variables in a set of

random vector, either linearly or non-linearly, to a lower dimensional space
that preserves the information contained in the original higher dimensional

doing DR to a dimension smaller than suggested by DE will likely lead to
information loss. Accordingly, in this paper we will focus on a particular
class of deep neural networks called autoencoders which are used extensively
for DR but are less well studied for DE. We show that several important
questions arise when using autoencoders for DE, above and beyond those that
arise for more classic DR/DE techniques such as Principal Component Analysis.
We address autoencoder architectural choices and regularization techniques that

topology optimization are proposed. In these approaches, the level set field
describes the material-void interface while the density field describes the
material distribution within the material phase. Both fields are optimized
simultaneously by coupling them through either a single abstract design
variable field or a penalty term introduced into the objective function. These
approaches eliminate drawbacks of level set topology optimization methods that
rely on seeding the initial design domain with a large number of holes.
Instead, the proposed approaches insert holes during the optimization process
where beneficial. The dependency of the optimization results on the initial
hole pattern is reduced, and the computational costs are lowered by keeping the
number of elements intersected by the material interface at a minimum. In
comparison to level set methods that use topological derivatives to seed small
holes at distinct steps in the optimization process, the proposed approaches
introduce holes continuously during the optimization process, with the hole
size and shape being optimized for the particular design problem. The proposed
approaches are studied using the extended finite element method for spatial

problem with motion constraints and space constraints in 2D space for a large
number of robots. To solve the problem of arbitrary dynamics and constraints we
propose formulating the problem as a multi-agent problem. In contrast to
previous works that propose using learning solutions for unlabelled motion
planning with constraints, we are able to demonstrate the scalability of our
methods for a large number of robots. The curse of dimensionality one
encounters when working with a large number of robots is mitigated by employing
a graph convolutional neural (GCN) network to parametrize policies for the
robots. The GCN reduces the dimensionality of the problem by learning filters
that aggregate information among robots locally, similar to how a convolutional
neural network is able to learn local features in an image. Additionally, by
employing a GCN we are also able to overcome the computational overhead of
training policies for a large number of robots by first training graph filters
for a small number of robots followed by zero-shot policy transfer to a larger
number of robots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through
various simulations.

in high dimensional factor models. The existing literatures are mainly based on
the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Due to the incomparability of the
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix caused by heterogeneous scales of observed
variables, it is very difficult to give an accurate relationship between these
eigenvalues and the number of common factors. To overcome this limitation, we
appeal to the correlation matrix and show surprisingly that the number of
eigenvalues greater than $1$ of population correlation matrix is the same as
the number of common factors under some mild conditions. To utilize such a
relationship, we study the random matrix theory based on the sample correlation
matrix in order to correct the biases in estimating the top eigenvalues and to
take into account of estimation errors in eigenvalue estimation. This leads us
to propose adjusted correlation thresholding (ACT) for determining the number
of common factors in high dimensional factor models, taking into account the
sampling variabilities and biases of top sample eigenvalues. We also establish
the optimality of the proposed methods in terms of minimal signal strength and
optimal threshold. Simulation studies lend further support to our proposed

increases with decreasing temperature below 4.6 K, indicating the presence of

significant evolution in stellar velocity dispersion over the last 12 Gyr.
Based on an upper limit on its physical size from deep optical images
(r_eff<1.3 kpc), we find that its dynamical mass is consistent with the stellar
mass inferred from photometry. Furthermore, the galaxy is located on the mass
fundamental plane extrapolated from lower redshift galaxies. Combining all
these results, we find that the velocity dispersion does not significantly
evolve with redshift, although the size and mass of massive quenched galaxies
do. This suggests that the mass in the core of massive galaxies does not evolve
significantly, while most of the mass growth occurs in the outskirts of the
galaxies, which also increases the size. This picture is consistent with a
two-phase formation scenario in which mass and size growth is due to accretion
in the outskirts of galaxies via mergers.

Until technology develops to the state with practical error correction,
computational approaches other than the standard digital one can be used to
avoid execution of the most noisy quantum operations. We demonstrate how a
hybrid digital-analog approach allows simulating dynamics of a transverse-field
Ising model without standard two-qubit gates, which are currently one of the
most problematic building blocks of quantum circuits. We use qubit-qubit
crosstalks (couplings) of IBM superconducting quantum processors to simulate
Trotterized dynamics of spin clusters and then we compare the obtained results
with the results of conventional digital computation based on two-qubit gates
from the universal set. The comparison shows that digital-analog approach
significantly outperforms standard digital approach for this simulation
problem, despite of the fact that crosstalks in IBM quantum processors are
small. We argue that the efficiency of digital-analog quantum computing can be
improved with the help of more specialized processors, so that they can be used
to efficiently implement other quantum algorithms. This indicates the prospect
of a digital-to-analog strategy for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum

states on an epigenetic landscape with phenotypic changes being transitions
between states. Measuring these transitions is challenging because they are
both very rare in the absence of appropriate signals and very fast. As such, it
has proven difficult to experimentally map the epigenetic landscapes that are
widely believed to underly developmental networks. Here, we introduce a new
nonequilibrium perturbation method to help reconstruct a regulatory network's

method on simulated data to reconstruct the landscapes. Our results show that
with a relatively small number of perturbation experiments it is possible to
recover an accurate representation of the true epigenetic landscape. We propose
that our theory provides a general method by which epigenetic landscapes can be

essential for human well-being, subsistence, and livelihood. The expansion of
cultivation and cropland, which is the backbone of the Indian economy, is one
of the main drivers of rapid Land Use Land Cover changes in India. To assess
the impact of the Green Revolution led agrarian expansion on the total
ecosystem service values, we first estimated the ESVs from 1985 to 2005 for
eight ecoregions in India using several value transfer approaches. Five
explanatory factors such as Total Crop Area, Crop Production, Crop Yield, Net
Irrigated Area, and Cropping Intensity representing the cropping scenarios in
the country were used in constructing local Geographical Weighted Regression
model to explore the cumulative and individual effects on ESVs. A Multi-Layer
Perceptron based Artificial Neural Network algorithm was employed to estimate
the normalized importance of these explanatory factors. During the observation
periods, cropland, forestland, and water bodies have contributed the most and
form a significant proportion of ESVs, followed by grassland, mangrove,
wetland, and urban builtup. In all three years, among the nine ESs, the highest
ESV accounts for water regulation, followed by soil formation and soilwater
retention, biodiversity maintenance, waste treatment, climate regulation, and
gas regulation. Among the five explanatory factors, TCA, NIA, CP showed a
strong positive association with ESVs, while the CI exhibited a negative
association. The study reveals a strong association between GR led agricultural
expansion and ESVs in India.

emerging trend of conversational question answering models in the natural

QuAC and CoQA, there has been more work on conversational question answering,
and recent work has achieved competitive performance on both datasets. However,
to best of our knowledge, two important questions for conversational
comprehension research have not been well studied: 1) How well can the
benchmark dataset reflect models' content understanding? 2) Do the models well
utilize the conversation content when answering questions? To investigate these
questions, we design different training settings, testing settings, as well as
an attack to verify the models' capability of content understanding on QuAC and
CoQA. The experimental results indicate some potential hazards in the benchmark
datasets, QuAC and CoQA, for conversational comprehension research. Our
analysis also sheds light on both what models may learn and how datasets may
bias the models. With deep investigation of the task, it is believed that this

phenomena are often observed in situation where flow instabilities appear. In
order to disentangle the two effects we have measured the pressure-flux

ratio of the pressure drop to that of the (Newtonian) solvent has a maximum due
to the competition between polymer extension and scission. We find a

of molecular weight, concentration, solvent quality and viscosity, and can be
used to predict the scission under successive passes.

Discarding broken test cases causes a significant waste of effort and leads to
test suites that are less effective and have lower coverage. Test repair
approaches evolve test suites along with applications by repairing the broken
test cases. Objective: Numerous studies are published on test repair approaches
every year. It is important to summarise and consolidate the existing knowledge
in the area to provide directions to researchers and practitioners. This
research work provides a systematic literature review in the area of test case
repair and breakage prevention, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners
in the field of software testing. Method: We followed the standard protocol for
conducting a systematic literature review. First, research goals were defined
using the Goal Question Metric (GQM). Then we formulate research questions
corresponding to each goal. Finally, metrics are extracted from the included
papers. Based on the defined selection criteria a final set of 41 primary
studies are included for analysis. Results: The selection process resulted in 5
journal papers, and 36 conference papers. We present a taxonomy that lists the
causes of test case breakages extracted from the literature. We found that only
four proposed test repair tools are publicly available. Most studies evaluated
their approaches on open-source case studies. Conclusion: There is significant
room for future research on test repair techniques. Despite the positive trend
of evaluating approaches on large scale open-source studies, there is a clear
lack of results from studies done in a real industrial context. Few tools are
publicly available which lowers the potential of adaption by industry
practitioners.

explores the variational structure of the Cauchy problems of the Maxwell

the largest interactions leads to a transverse field Ising model of the
dipoles. This quantifies, justifies and confirms recent claims that the dipoles
are of crucial importance for understanding these materials. We show that two
effects are responsible for a range of behaviors found in the dipoles in
different $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ salts. (i) The inter-dimer hopping,
$t_{b1}$, which gives rise to the ""transverse field"" in the Ising model for the
dipoles ($H^T=2t_{b1}$), is between a third and a tenth smaller in the mercuric
materials than for the mercury-free salts. (ii) The Ising model of dipoles is
in the quasi-one-dimensional limit for the mercuric salts, but
quasi-two-dimensional (between the square and isotropic triangular limits) for
the mercury-free materials. Thus, the dimensionless critical field is much
smaller in the mercuric compounds. Effect (ii) is much larger than effect (i).
Simple explanations of both effects based on the band structures of the
different salts are given. We show that dipolar order and even short-range
dipolar correlations have a profound impact on the nature of the interdimer
magnetic (superexchange) interactions. For example, dipole crystallization
drives the materials towards quasi-one-dimensional magnetic interactions, which
could be important for understanding the spin liquids found in some of these
materials.

polarimetry, active galactic nuclei (AGN) have proven to be the richest in
terms of complex yet fundamental signatures that helped to understand their
true nature. Indeed, AGN exhibit a wide range of wavelength-dependent
polarimetric features that are intrinsically related to their multi-scale
emission mechanisms. Each waveband is characterized by a different set of
polarimetric signatures that can be related to various physical mechanisms
that, from the radio band to the soft-$\gamma$ rays, probe increasingly smaller
AGN regions. In fact, panchromatic polarization measurements are the key to
understand how and when AGN form, accrete, and impact the host galaxy they
reside in. In this chapter, I will first introduce AGN without focusing on a
particular observational technique. I will then review the discoveries and
constraints that spectro-, imaging and broadband polarimetry have achieved.
Finally, I will highlight the important questions that remain unanswered and
how they can be solved with future large millimeter and radio antennas, 30-m
class optical and infrared telescopes, and high energy satellites equipped with
state-of-the-art polarimeters.

reduction, we seek to solve the problem deterministically, with no probability

branching fractions and other observables are calculated. In SM, we obtain the
ratio ${\cal R}(\Lambda_c)=0.33\pm0.01$. Supposing that NP only affects the
third generation fermions, we present the correlations among ${\cal R}(D)$,
${\cal R}(D^*)$ and ${\cal R}(\Lambda_c)$. We perform a minimum $\chi^2$ fit of
the wilson coefficient of each operator to the latest experimental data of

Among them, one of the state-of-the-art approaches (Cheng et al., 2019) showed
that hard-label attack can be modeled as an optimization problem where the

the information pool feeds the second half part with the combination of
hierarchical features from the previous layers. Secondly, we employ a

of particle physics, in condensed matter physics. In contrast to their particle
physics counterparts, Majorana fermions are zero energy, chargeless, spinless,
composite quasiparticles, residing at the boundaries of so-called topological
superconductors. Furthermore, in opposition to any particles in the standard
model, Majorana fermions in solid-state systems obey non-Abelian exchange
statistics that make them attractive candidates for decoherence-free
implementations of quantum computers. In this review, we report on the recent
advances to realize synthetic topological superconductors supporting Majorana
fermions with an emphasis on chains of magnetic impurities on the surface of
superconductors. After outlining the theoretical underpinning responsible for
the formation of Majorana fermions, we report on the subsequent experimental
efforts to build topological superconductors and the resulting evidence in
favor of Majorana fermions, focusing on scanning tunneling microscopy and the
hunt for zero-bias peaks in the measured current. We conclude by summarizing
the open questions in the field and propose possible experimental measurements
to answer them.

azimuthal Alfven waves within an expanding flux tube. We consider the process
of resonant absorption in a loop with a non-uniform Alfven frequency profile
but in the absence of a radial density gradient. Methods. Using the MHD code,
Lare3d, we model an oscillating magnetic flux tube that expands radially with
height. An initially straight loop structure with a magnetic field enhancement
is relaxed towards a force-free state before a standing kink mode is
introduced. Results. We demonstrate that the transverse gradient in Alfven
frequency required for the existence of resonant field lines can be associated
with the expansion of a high field-strength flux tube from concentrated flux
patches. This allows for the conversion of energy between wave modes even in
the absence of the density profile typically assumed in wave heating models. As
with standing modes in straight flux tubes, small scales are dominated by the
vorticity at the loop apex and by currents at the foot points. The azimuthal
wave exhibits the structure of the expanded flux tube and is therefore
associated with smaller length scales close to the foot points of the flux
tube. Conclusions. Resonant absorption can proceed throughout the corona, even
in the absence of dense loop structures. The flux tube and MHD waves considered
are difficult to observe and our model highlights how estimating hidden wave
power within the solar atmosphere can be problematic. We highlight that, for
standing modes, the global properties of field lines are important for resonant
absorption and coronal conditions at a single altitude will not fully determine
the nature of MHD resonances. We provide a new model in partial response to the
criticism that wave heating models cannot self-consistently generate or sustain
the density profile upon which they typically rely.

classification with a limited number of prior labels is always full of
challenges. For general supervised deep learning classification algorithms, the
pixel-by-pixel algorithm achieves precise yet inefficient classification with a
small number of labeled pixels, whereas the pixel mapping algorithm achieves
efficient yet edge-rough classification with more prior labels required. To
take efficiency, accuracy and prior labels into account, we propose a novel
pixel-refining parallel mapping network in the complex domain named CRPM-Net
and the corresponding training algorithm for PolSAR image classification.
CRPM-Net consists of two parallel sub-networks: a) A transfer dilated
convolution mapping network in the complex domain (C-Dilated CNN) activated by
a complex cross-convolution neural network (Cs-CNN), which is aiming at precise
localization, high efficiency and the full use of phase information; b) A
complex domain encoder-decoder network connected parallelly with C-Dilated CNN,
which is to extract more contextual semantic features. Finally, we design a
two-step algorithm to train the Cs-CNN and CRPM-Net with a small number of
labeled pixels for higher accuracy by refining misclassified labeled pixels. We
verify the proposed method on AIRSAR and E-SAR datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that CRPM-Net achieves the best classification results and
substantially outperforms some latest state-of-the-art approaches in both
efficiency and accuracy for PolSAR image classification. The source code and

network compression and can accelerate the inference by leveraging bitwise
operations. Although many binarization methods have improved the accuracy of
the model by minimizing the quantization error in forward propagation, there
remains a noticeable performance gap between the binarized model and the
full-precision one. Our empirical study indicates that the quantization brings
information loss in both forward and backward propagation, which is the
bottleneck of training accurate binary neural networks. To address these
issues, we propose an Information Retention Network (IR-Net) to retain the
information that consists in the forward activations and backward gradients.
IR-Net mainly relies on two technical contributions: (1) Libra Parameter
Binarization (Libra-PB): simultaneously minimizing both quantization error and
information loss of parameters by balanced and standardized weights in forward
propagation; (2) Error Decay Estimator (EDE): minimizing the information loss
of gradients by gradually approximating the sign function in backward
propagation, jointly considering the updating ability and accurate gradients.
We are the first to investigate both forward and backward processes of binary
networks from the unified information perspective, which provides new insight
into the mechanism of network binarization. Comprehensive experiments with
various network structures on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets manifest that the
proposed IR-Net can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization
methods.

events forces surgeons to implement corrective strategies and, thus, deviate
from the standard surgical process. Therefore, it is clear that the automatic
identification of adverse events is a major challenge for patient safety. In
this paper, we have proposed a method enabling us to identify such deviations.
We have focused on identifying surgeons' deviations from standard surgical
processes due to surgical events rather than anatomic specificities. This is
particularly challenging, given the high variability in typical surgical
procedure workflows. Methods: We have introduced a new approach designed to
automatically detect and distinguish surgical process deviations based on
multi-dimensional non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model
using manual annotation of surgical processes. The approach was then evaluated
using cross-validation. Results: The best results have over 90% accuracy.
Recall and precision were superior at 70%. We have provided a detailed analysis
of the incorrectly-detected observations. Conclusion: Multi-dimensional
non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model provides promising
results for detecting deviations. Our error analysis of the

improve our method. Significance: Our method demonstrated the feasibility of
automatically detecting surgical deviations that could be implemented for both

utilizes the basic head structure of the RefineDet model, which is a variant of
the single-shot object detector (SSD). In order to ensure real-time
performance, CNN models with relatively shallow layers or fewer parameters have
been used as the backbone structure. In addition to the basic VGGNet and ResNet
structures, various backbone structures such as MobileNet, Xception, ResNeXt,
Inception-SENet, and SE-ResNeXt have been used for this purpose. Successful
training of object detection networks was achieved through an appropriate
combination of intermediate layers. The accuracy of the proposed detector was
estimated by the evaluation of the MS-COCO 2017 object detection dataset and
the inference speed on the NVIDIA Drive PX2 and Jetson Xavier boards were
tested to verify real-time performance in the embedded systems. The experiments
show that the proposed models ensure balanced performance in terms of accuracy
and inference speed in the embedded system environments. In addition, unlike
the high-end GPUs, the use of embedded GPUs involves several additional
concerns for efficient inference, which have been identified in this work. The
codes and models are publicly available on the web (link).

(ASGD) methods are immune to these slowdowns but are scarcely used due to

have had limited success mitigating the gradient staleness when scaling up to
many workers (computing nodes). In this paper we define the Gap as a measure of

method that penalizes stale gradients linearly to the Gap and performs well
even when scaling to large numbers of workers. Our evaluation on the CIFAR,
ImageNet, and WikiText-103 datasets shows that GA outperforms the currently
acceptable gradient penalization method, in final test accuracy. We also
provide convergence rate proof for GA. Despite prior beliefs, we show that if
GA is applied, momentum becomes beneficial in asynchronous environments, even

However, most of the prior research on text processing in social media is

training data, which in practice is both difficult and expensive to obtain. In
this paper, we present methods for unsupervised mining of fashion attributes
from Instagram text, which can enable a new kind of user recommendation in the
fashion domain. In this context, we analyze a corpora of Instagram posts from
the fashion domain, introduce a system for extracting fashion attributes from
Instagram, and train a deep clothing classifier with weak supervision to
classify Instagram posts based on the associated text.
  With our experiments, we confirm that word embeddings are a useful asset for
information extraction. Experimental results show that information extraction
using word embeddings outperforms a baseline that uses Levenshtein distance.
The results also show the benefit of combining weak supervision signals using
generative models instead of majority voting. Using weak supervision and
generative modeling, an F1 score of 0.61 is achieved on the task of classifying
the image contents of Instagram posts based solely on the associated text,
which is on level with human performance. Finally, our empirical study provides
one of the few available studies on Instagram text and shows that the text is

patterns. As a simple model for pattern formation in convection, the effects
are demonstrated with a generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation including random
advection. We also discuss the implications of our results for the large-scale
flow of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection.

overcome the issues in traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) and
identity-based public key cryptography (ID-PKC). There exist a vast number of
certificateless signature (CLS) schemes in the literature; however, most of

Recently, two lightweight CLS schemes have been proposed by Karati et al. and
Kumar et al. to be employed in IoT and HWSNs, respectively. While both schemes
are claimed to be existentially unforgeable, in this paper, we show that both
these signatures can easily be forged. More specifically, it is shown that 1)
in Karati et al.'s scheme, a type 1 adversary, considered in certificateless
cryptography, can generate a valid partial private key corresponding to any
user of its choice and as a consequence, it can forge any users' signature on
any message of its choice, and 2) in Kumar et al.'s scheme, both types of
adversaries which are considered in certificateless cryptography are able to
forge any signer's signature on an arbitrary message.

correlations between structure and star-formation activity in galaxies, notably
the sloped and moving boundaries that divide star-forming from quenched
galaxies in key structural diagrams. This paper uses these and other relations
to ``reverse-engineer'' the quenching process for central galaxies. The basic
idea is that star-forming galaxies with larger radii (at a given stellar mass)
have lower black-hole masses due to lower central densities. Galaxies cross
into the green valley when the cumulative effective energy radiated by their
black hole equals $\sim4\times$ their halo-gas binding energy. Since
larger-radii galaxies have smaller black holes, one finds they must evolve to
higher stellar masses in order to meet this halo-energy criterion, which
explains the sloping boundaries. A possible cause of radii differences among
star-forming galaxies is halo concentration. The evolutionary tracks of
star-forming galaxies are nearly parallel to the green-valley boundaries, and
it is mainly the sideways motions of these boundaries with cosmic time that
cause galaxies to quench. BH-scaling laws for star-forming, quenched, and
green-valley galaxies are different, and most BH mass growth takes place in the
green valley. Implications include: the radii of star-forming galaxies are an
important second parameter in shaping their black holes; black holes are
connected to their halos but in different ways for star-forming, quenched, and
green-valley galaxies; and the same BH-halo quenching mechanism has been in
place since $z \sim 3$. We conclude with a discussion of black hole-galaxy
co-evolution, the origin and interpretation of BH scaling laws.

algorithmic framework for separable optimization problems with linear
constraints. For numerical ADMM fail to exploit the particular structure of the
problem at hand nor the input data information, leveraging task-specific
modules (e.g., neural networks and other data-driven architectures) to extend
ADMM is a significant but challenging task. This work focuses on designing a
flexible algorithmic framework to incorporate various task-specific modules
(with no additional constraints) to improve the performance of ADMM in
real-world applications. Specifically, we propose Guidance from Optimality
(GO), a new customization strategy, to embed task-specific modules into ADMM
(GO-ADMM). By introducing an optimality-based criterion to guide the
propagation, GO-ADMM establishes an updating scheme agnostic to the choice of
additional modules. The existing task-specific methods just plug their
task-specific modules into the numerical iterations in a straightforward
manner. Even with some restrictive constraints on the plug-in modules, they can
only obtain some relatively weaker convergence properties for the resulted ADMM
iterations. Fortunately, without any restrictions on the embedded modules, we
prove the convergence of GO-ADMM regarding objective values and constraint
violations, and derive the worst-case convergence rate measured by iteration
complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical
results and demonstrate the efficiency of GO-ADMM.

Galactic Nuclei are among the main targets for the present generation of
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and will remain of great
importance for very high-energy $\gamma$-ray science in the era of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Observations by IACTs, which have relatively
small fields of view ($\sim$ few degrees), are limited by viewing conditions;
therefore, it is important to select the most promising targets in order to
increase the number of detections. The aim of this paper is to search for
unclassified blazars among known $\gamma$-ray sources from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) third source catalog that are likely detectable with IACTs or
CTA. We use an artificial neural network algorithm and updated analysis of
Fermi-LAT data. We found 80 $\gamma$-ray source candidates, and for the
highest-confidence candidates, we calculate their potential detectability with
IACTs and CTA based on an extrapolation of their energy spectra. Follow-up
observations of our source candidates could significantly increase the current
TeV source population sample and could ultimately confirm the efficiency of our
algorithm to select TeV sources.

nonlinearity has long been a fundamental issue, which is vital for
deterministic and scalable photonic quantum information processing. It requires
not only strong nonlinear interaction at the single-photon level, but also
suppressed phase noise and spectral entanglement for high gate fidelity. In
this paper, we propose that high-quality factor microcavity with strong
$\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity can be quantized to anharmonic energy levels and be
effectively treated as an artificial atom. Such artificial atom has a size much
larger than the photon wavelength, which enables passive and active
ultra-strong coupling to traveling photons. High-fidelity quantum control-phase
gate is realized by mediating the phase between photons with an intermediate
artificial atom in a photonic molecule structure. The scheme avoids the
two-photon emission and thus eliminates the spectral entanglement and quantum
phase noises. Experimental realization of the artificial atom can be envisioned
on the integrated photonic chip and holds great potential for
single-emitter-free, room-temperature quantum information processing.

mitigation of uncertainties and/or biases affecting $H_0$ measurements. Here,

interplay between redshift and Leavitt laws in an expanding Universe:
Redshift-Leavitt bias (RLB). Redshift dilates oscillation periods of pulsating
stars residing in supernova-host galaxies relative to periods of identical
stars residing in nearby (anchor) galaxies. Multiplying dilated $\log{P}$ with
Leavitt Law slopes leads to underestimated absolute magnitudes, overestimated
distance moduli, and a systematic error on $H_0$. Emulating the SH0ES distance
ladder, we estimate an associated $H_0$ bias of $(0.27 \pm 0.01)$% and obtain a
corrected $H_0 = (73.70 \pm 1.40) \rm{km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. RLB becomes
increasingly relevant as distance ladder calibrations pursue greater numbers of
ever more distant galaxies hosting both Cepheids (or Miras) and type-Ia
supernovae. The measured periods of oscillating stars can readily be corrected
for heliocentric redshift (e.g. of their host galaxies) in order to ensure
$H_0$ measurements free of RLB.

cameras. Training such systems usually requires a large amount of cross-camera
pedestrians to be annotated from surveillance videos, which is labor-consuming
especially when the number of cameras is large. Differently, this paper
investigates ReID in an unexplored single-camera-training (SCT) setting, where
each person in the training set appears in only one camera. To the best of our
knowledge, this setting was never studied before. SCT enjoys the advantage of
low-cost data collection and annotation, and thus eases ReID systems to be
trained in a brand new environment. However, it raises major challenges due to
the lack of cross-camera person occurrences, which conventional approaches
heavily rely on to extract discriminative features. The key to dealing with the
challenges in the SCT setting lies in designing an effective mechanism to
complement cross-camera annotation. We start with a regular deep network for
feature extraction, upon which we propose a novel loss function named
multi-camera negative loss (MCNL). This is a metric learning loss motivated by
probability, suggesting that in a multi-camera system, one image is more likely
to be closer to the most similar negative sample in other cameras than to the
most similar negative sample in the same camera. In experiments, MCNL
significantly boosts ReID accuracy in the SCT setting, which paves the way of
fast deployment of ReID systems with good performance on new target scenes.

  Subquadratic update time for SSSP, Diameter, Centralities, ect.: When we want

fundamental question is to beat trivially calling Dijkstra's static algorithm
after each update, taking $\Theta(n^2)$ update time on dense graphs. It was
known to be improbable for exact algorithms and for combinatorial
any-approximation algorithms to polynomially beat the $\Omega(n^2)$ bound
(under some conjectures) [Roditty, Zwick, ESA'04; Abboud, V. Williams,

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this, guaranteeing $\tilde
O(n^{1.823}/\epsilon^2)$ worst-case update time for directed graphs with
positive real weights in $[1, W]$. With ideas from [Roditty, V. Williams,

fractures has attracted widespread interest by virtue of its outstanding
performance in dealing with complex cracks. The ES-FEM is an excellent member
of the S-FEM family developed in combination with meshless ideas and finite
element method (FEM), which is characterized by higher accuracy, softer
stiffness, and insensitive to mesh distortion. Given that, the advantages of
the phase-field method (PFM) and ES-FEM are fully combined by the approach

developed, which considerably improved the computational efficiency.

operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This problem is also
considered in reinforcement learning (RL), but limited work exists on comparing
the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this paper, we
provide: 1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active
inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are
generally engineered in RL; 2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between
active inference and RL on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a
condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing
the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of
RL. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference
agents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for uncertainty about
their environment in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the
reliance on an explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference,
where reward can simply be treated as another observation; even in the total
absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We
make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active
inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to
both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior
preferences over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the
observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism
can be applied to more complex settings if appropriate generative models can be
formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference
agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation,
and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside RL
agents.

particles (JPs) using the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations. The linear and
angular velocity of a single JP are shown to respectively result from a
coupling of electrochemical forces to the fluid flow fields induced by a force
and torque on the JP. A model calculation is provided for half-capped JPs
catalysing a chemical reaction of solutes at their surface, by reducing the
continuity equations of the reacting solutes to Poisson equations for the
corresponding electrochemical fields. We find that an anisotropic chemical
activity alone is enough to give rise to active linear motion of a JP, whereas
active rotation only occurs if the JP is not axisymmetric. In the absence of
specific interactions with the solutes, the active linear velocity of the JP is
shown to be related to the stoichiometrically weighted sum of the friction
coefficients (or hydrodynamic radii) of the reacting solutes. Our reciprocal
treatment further suggests that a specific interaction with the solutes is
required to observe far-field diffusiophoretic interactions between JPs, which
rely on an interfacial solute excess at the JP surface. Most notably, our
approach applies beyond the boundary-layer approximation and accounts for both
the diffusio- and electrophoretic nature of active motion.

ART takes advantage of the location information of previous non-fault-detecting

jump-diffusions under the scale separation by a small parameter $\varepsilon

the system depend on the segment process of the slow variable (responsible for
capturing delay effects on the slow component) and on the state of the fast
variable. We derive a moderate deviations principle for the slow component of
the system in the small noise limit using the weak convergence approach. The
rate function is written in terms of the averaged dynamics associated to the

case we describe a procedure/algorithm to compute a set of generators for
$Sat_g(S)$ which terminates if and only if it is finitely generated.
  Then we consider the more interesting case when $S$ is graded. In particular,
if $S$ is graded by a positive matrix $W$ and $g$ is an indeterminate, we show
that if we choose a term ordering $\sigma$ of $g$-DegRev type compatible with
$W$, then the two operations of computing a $\sigma$-SAGBI basis of $S$ and
saturating $S$ with respect to $g$ commute.
  This fact opens the doors to nice algorithms for the computation of
$Sat_g(S)$. In particular, under special assumptions on the grading one can use
the truncation of a $\sigma$-SAGBI basis and get the desired result.
  Notably, this technique can be applied to the problem of directly computing

observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics

In this study we aim at developing a new coronal seismology method for
determining the transport coefficients based on a parametric study of wave
properties using a 1D nonlinear MHD loop model in combination with the linear
theory. The simulations suggest a two-step scheme: we first determine the
effective thermal conduction coefficient from the observed phase shift between
temperature and density perturbations as this physical parameter is insensitive
to the unknown viscosity; then from the loop model with the obtained thermal
conduction coefficient, we determine the effective viscosity coefficient from
the observed decay time using the parametric modeling. With this new seismology
technique we are able to quantify the suppression of thermal conductivity by a
factor of about 3 and the enhancement of viscosity coefficient by a factor of
10 in the studied flaring loop. Using the loop model with these refined
transport coefficients, we study the excitation of slow magnetoacoustic waves
by launching a flow pulse from one footpoint. The simulation can
self-consistently produce the fundamental standing wave on a timescale in
agreement with the observation.

TDM-EPON, a plethora of research is already present to achieve energy savings
at Optical Network Units (ONUs) which can easily be applied for TWDM-EPON ONUs.
However, TWDM-EPON provides an additional opportunity for saving energy at the
Optical Line Terminal (OLT). All existing protocols have primarily been
designed for saving energy at the OLT receivers. The protocols to save energy
at the OLT receives depends only on the Up-Stream(US) traffic scheduling while
its transmitter counterpart depends on both US and Down-Stream (DS) scheduling
since the OLT transmits GATE message along with DS traffic. The US and DS
scheduling have a basic difference. The MAC protocol doesn't allow scheduling
of US traffic of an ONU after its REPORT arrival at multiple disjoint time
slots. However, this restriction is absent for DS traffic and hence, the
grant-size of an ONU can be partitioned and every part can be scheduled at
different times. In this paper, we propose a method for saving energy at the
OLT transmitters in TWDM-EPON while satisfying the SLAs. This includes a
heuristic algorithm to partition the DS grant and schedule them. Through
extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a
significant improvement in energy efficiency as compared to existing protocols
(up to 45%).

physical insight -- that the roles of the radiative emitter and dew collector

passive dew collection strongly coupled those roles leading to nonideal

strength and orientation of LSC are quantified by the amplitude and phase of
the first Fourier mode of the vertical velocity. The plane containing LSC is
generally aligned along one of the diagonals of the box accompanied by a
four-roll structure in the other. However, an abnormal single-roll state with
substructures is noted at the face planes for low Ra. In addition to the
primary roll, two secondary corner-roll structures are also observed in the LSC
plane which grow in size and destabilize the LSC resulting in partial and
complete reversals. In addition to previously reported rotation-led
reorientations, we also observe cessation events which are rare in cubic cells.
The distribution of turbulent kinetic energy shows that the energy is primarily
extracted from the non-LSC plane and fed to the LSC plane by the transport
mechanism. We observe that the corner-rolls reduce in size and the
substructures diminish at higher Ra, which leads to the reduction in the
occurrence of reorientations of LSC.

quantization maps $Q_{1/N}: \tilde{A}_0\rightarrow A_{1/N}$ (where
$\tilde{A}_0$ is an equally natural dense Poisson subalgebra of $A_0$). We
apply this quantization formalism to the Curie--Weiss model (an exemplary
quantum spin with long-range forces) in the parameter domain where its
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in the thermodynamic limit
$N\raw\infty$. If this limit is taken with respect to the macroscopic
observables of the model (as opposed to the quasi-local observables), it yields
a classical theory with phase space $X_2\cong B^3$ (i.e\ the unit three-ball in
$\R^3$). Our quantization map then enables us to take the classical limit of
the sequence of (unique) algebraic vector states induced by the ground state
eigenvectors $\Psi_N^{(0)}$ of this model as $N\raw\infty$, in which the
sequence converges to a probability measure $\mu$ on the associated classical
phase space $X_2$. This measure is a symmetric convex sum of two Dirac measures
related by the underlying $\Z_2$-symmetry of the model, and as such the
classical limit exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, too. Our proof of
convergence is heavily based on Perelomov-style coherent spin states and at
some stage it relies on (quite strong) numerical evidence. Hence the proof is
not completely analytic, but somewhat hybrid.

challenges in integrating blockchain technology into resource-constrained IoT

provide a secure, scalable and lightweight distributed ledger for IoT systems.
By using a bias-resistant randomness protocol and a cryptographic sortition
algorithm, a random subset of nodes are selected as a final committee to
perform the consensus protocol. The hybrid consensus mechanism relies on PoC, a
pure Proof of stake (PoS) protocol, to determine whether or not a participant

credit assignment. The voting-based chain finality protocol is responsible for
finalizing a history of blocks by resolving conflicting checkpoint and
selecting a unique chain. A proof-of-conception prototype is implemented and
tested on a physical network environment. The experimental results verify that
the Micorchain is able to offer a partially decentralized, scalable and

and find the coordinate transformations between the two metrics. For this
purpose the two metrics must have the same approximation and describe the
gravitational field of static objects. Since both the Erez-Rosen and the
Hartle-Thorne solutions are particular solutions of a more general solution,
the Zipoy-Voorhees transformation is applied to the exact Erez-Rosen metric in
order to obtain a generalized solution in terms of the Zipoy-Voorhees parameter
$\delta=1+sq$. The Geroch-Hansen multipole moments of the generalized
Erez-Rosen metric are calculated to find the definition of the total mass and
quadrupole moment in terms of the mass $m$, quadrupole $q$ and Zipoy-Voorhees
$\delta$ parameters. The coordinate transformations between the metrics are
found in the approximation of $\sim$q. It is shown that the Zipoy-Voorhees
parameter is equal to $\delta=1-q$ with $s=-1$. This result is in agreement
with previous results in the literature.

close and slow encounter with 2I/Borisov. Only one object from among 647 stars

that the probability that Kruger 60 is a home system of 2I/Borisov is small.

It confirms the prediction that a pairing state with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces

can be explained by the competition of intra- and interband pairing and is

lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$ for the (randomized) communication complexity of
this problem, in the range of parameters which make it a total search problem.
We answer this question affirmatively.
  Additionally, we introduce two natural fixed point problems in the two-player
communication model.
  $\bullet$ Each player is given a function from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]^{n/2}$,
and their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the concatenation of

  Finally, we initiate the study of finding a panchromatic simplex in a
Sperner-coloring of a triangulation (guaranteed by Sperner's lemma) in the
two-player communication model: A triangulation $T$ of the $d$-simplex is
publicly known and one player is given a set $S_A\subset T$ and a coloring

such that $S_A\dot\cup S_B=T$, and their goal is to find a panchromatic

$|T|^{\Omega(1)}$ for the aforementioned problem as well (when $d$ is large).

ego vehicle obtain the intentions of pedestrians in the related environment,
which are the base of safety measures such as collision avoidance and
prewarning. However, because of relatively small sizes and high-level
deformation of pedestrians, common pedestrian orientation estimation models
fail to extract sufficient and comprehensive information from them, thus having
their performance restricted, especially monocular ones which fail to obtain
depth information of objects and related environment. In this paper, a novel
monocular pedestrian orientation estimation model, called FFNet, is proposed.
Apart from camera captures, the model adds the 2D and 3D dimensions of
pedestrians as two other inputs according to the logic relationship between
orientation and them. The 2D and 3D dimensions of pedestrians are determined
from the camera captures and further utilized through two feedforward links
connected to the orientation estimator. The feedforward links strengthen the
logicality and interpretability of the network structure of the proposed model.
Experiments show that the proposed model has at least 1.72% AOS increase than
most state-of-the-art models after identical training processes. The model also
has competitive results in orientation estimation evaluation on KITTI dataset.

locally increase or decrease the local resolution through increasing or

The adaptation workflow uses a sensor for both discontinuities and smooth

used in conjunction with other feature-based sensors or error estimators. We
demonstrate this proof-of-concept using two geometries at transonic and

throughout the Milky Way with the COMPTEL and INTEGRAL satellites. In
particular the Doppler shifts measured with INTEGRAL connect $^{26}$Al with
superbubbles, which may guide $^{26}$Al flows off spiral arms in the direction
of Galactic rotation. In order to test this paradigm, we have performed
galaxy-scale simulations of superbubbles with $^{26}$Al injection in a Milky
Way-type galaxy. We produce all-sky synthetic $\gamma-$ray emission maps of the
simulated galaxies. We find that the 1809keV emission from the radioactive
decay of $^{26}$Al is highly variable with time and the observer's position.
This allows us to estimate an additional systematic variability of 0.2dex for a
star formation rate derived from $^{26}$Al for different times and measurement
locations in Milky Way-type galaxies. High-latitude morphological features
indicate nearby emission with correspondingly high integrated $\gamma-$ray
intensities. We demonstrate that the $^{26}$Al scale height from our simulated
galaxies depends on the assumed halo gas density. We present the first
synthetic 1809keV longitude-velocity diagrams from 3D hydrodynamic simulations.
The line-of-sight velocities for $^{26}$Al can be significantly different from
the line-of-sight velocities associated with the cold gas. Over time, $^{26}$Al
velocities consistent with the INTEGRAL observations, within uncertainties,
appear at any given longitude, broadly supporting previous suggestions that
$^{26}$Al injected into expanding superbubbles by massive stars may be
responsible for the high velocities found in the INTEGRAL observations. We
discuss the effect of systematically varying the location of the superbubbles
relative to the spiral arms.

surface and allowed to evaporate in an open laboratory environment. We
investigate the influence of substrate orientation (horizontal and vertical) on
evaporation dynamics. Using optical and infrared imaging, we report droplet
fluid dynamics and heat transfer characteristics of the evaporating droplet.
Overall, evaporation is more efficient on the vertical surface, exhibiting
higher total heat transfer rates and up to 10% shorter evaporation times.
Counterintuitively, on the vertical surface, the substrate-droplet interfacial
heat flux was higher near the lower contact line than in the upper region,
despite a high contact angle and an expected wedge effect at the bottom. At the
same time, the temperature is colder in the lower part of the droplet. We
attribute this apparent anomaly to the competition between sensible heating and
evaporation, and a modified convective flow signature (both within the droplet
and the gas phase) compared to a horizontal surface. We also show that the
thermal signature becomes uniform once the contact angles at the upper and
lower contact lines become equal towards the end of the evaporation process.

solution, dynamics are determined by assuming a circular precession trajectory
around the direction perpendicular to the plane, as set by the effective field,
and calculating the energy integral over a single precession period. In a more
realistic approach, we include the bias dependence of the tunnel
magnetoresistance, which is assumed empirically to be a piecewise linear
function of the applied voltage. The dynamical states are found by solving the
stability condition for the Jacobian matrix for out-of-plane static states. We
find that the bias dependence of the tunnel magnetoresistance, which is an
inseparable effect in every tunnel junction, exhibits drastic impact on the

current for dynamics and quenching the oscillations at high currents. The

$\|W\|_{H}:=|t(H,W)|^{1/e(H)}$ and $\|W\|_{r(H)}:=t(H,|W|)^{1/e(H)}$ and say
that $H$ is (semi-)norming if $\|.\|_{H}$ is a (semi-)norm and that $H$ is
weakly norming if $\|.\|_{r(H)}$ is a norm. We obtain two results that
contribute to the theory of (weakly) norming graphs. Firstly, answering a
question of Hatami, who estimated the modulus of convexity and smoothness of
$\|.\|_{H}$, we prove that $\|.\|_{r(H)}$ is not uniformly convex nor uniformly
smooth, provided that $H$ is weakly norming. Secondly, we prove that every
graph $H$ without isolated vertices is (weakly) norming if and only if each
component is an isomorphic copy of a (weakly) norming graph. This strong
factorisation result allows us to assume connectivity of $H$ when studying
graph norms. In particular, we correct an error in the original statement of
the aforementioned theorem by Hatami.

LQCD to directly provide the kinematic regions where the experimental values

lattice spacing to minimize lattice artifacts at order $(P_z a)^n$ will become
crucial for next-generation LaMET-like structure calculations. Furthermore,
such calculations require operators with long Wilson-link displacements (in
finer lattice units), increasing the communication costs relative to that of
the propagator inversion. In this work, we explore whether machine-learning

cosmological analyses. It is important to accurately evaluate the significance
of such discordances when present. We propose here a Bayesian interpretation of
inconsistency measures that can extract information about physical
inconsistencies in the presence of data scatter. The new framework is based on
the conditional probability distribution of the level of physical inconsistency
given the obtained value of the measure. We use the index of inconsistency as a
case study to illustrate the new interpretation framework, but this can be
generalized to other metrics. Importantly, there are two aspects in the
quantification of inconsistency that behave differently as the number of model
parameters increases. The first is the probability for the level of physical
inconsistency to reach a threshold which drops with the increase of the number
of parameters under consideration. Then the second is the actual level of
physical inconsistency which remains rather insensitive to such an increase in
parameters. This often-overlooked ambiguity leads to an underestimation of the
physical inconsistency by the commonly adopted significance level when used,
but is resolved by the Bayesian interpretation because the conditional
probability distribution includes all the statistical information of the level
of physical inconsistency. Finally, we apply the Bayesian interpretation to
examine the (in)consistency between Planck versus the Cepheid-based local
measurement, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) and WMAP. We confirm and revisit the degrees of previous physical
inconsistencies and show the stability of the new interpretation to the number
of cosmological parameters compared to the commonly used n-$\sigma$
interpretation when applied to cosmological tensions in multi-parameter spaces.

additional hole doping of the A-type LCMO layers, which likely originates from
La and/or Mn vacancies, can explain their fragile ferromagnetic order since it
places them close to the boundary of the ferromagnetic order at which even weak

$P_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\sim10^{24}~$W Hz$^{-1}$. Assuming that the entire radio
emission originates from star-forming (SF) activity in the nuclear region of
the host galaxy, we obtained an upper limit on the characteristic star
formation rate, $\sim4200~$M$_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$. The angular resolution of FIRST
images is insufficient to distinguish between the SF and AGN origin of radio
emission at these redshifts. However, a comparison with properties of
individual sources from the literature indicates that a mixed nature is likely.

of numbers (counting multiplicities) can be the eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix with nonnegative entries. While examples of such matrices are abundant
in linear algebra and various applications, this question is still open for
matrices of dimension $N\geq 5$. One of the approaches to solve the SNIEP was
proposed by George W. Soules, relying on a specific type of eigenvectors
(Soules vectors) to derive sufficient conditions for this problem. Elsner et
al. later showed a canonical way to construct all Soules vectors, based on
binary rooted trees. While Soules vectors are typically treated as a totally
ordered set of vectors, we propose in this article to consider a relaxed
alternative: a partially ordered set of Soules vectors. We show that this
perspective enables a more complete characterization of the sufficient
conditions for the SNIEP. In particular, we show that the set of eigenvalues
that satisfy these sufficient conditions is a convex cone, with symmetries
corresponding to the automorphisms of the binary rooted tree from which the
Soules vectors were constructed. As a second application, we show how Soules
vectors can be used to construct graph Laplacian matrices with a given spectrum

dependencies of the edges may render the task challenging. We apply our
recently introduced method, Generative Examination Networks (GENs) to create
the first text-based generative graph models using one-line text formats as
graph representation. In our GEN, a RNN-generative model for a one-line text
format learns autonomously to predict the next available character. The
training is stopped by an examination mechanism checking validating the
percentage of valid graphs generated. We achieved moderate to high validity
using dense g6 strings (random 67.8 +/- 0.6, canonical 99.1 +/- 0.2). Based on
these results we have adapted the widely used SMILES representation for
molecules to a new input format, which we call linear graph input (LGI). Apart
from the benefits of a short compressible text-format, a major advantage
include the possibility to randomize and augment the format. The generative
models are evaluated for overall performance and for reconstruction of the
property space. The results show that LGI strings are very well suited for
machine-learning and that augmentation is essential for the performance of the
model in terms of validity, uniqueness and novelty. Lastly, the format can
address smaller and larger dataset of graphs and the format can be easily
adapted to define another meaning of the characters used in the LGI-string and
can address sparse graph problems in used in other fields of science.

q 1's and l rows of q 0's. We consider extremal problems for matrices avoiding
certain submatrices. Let A be a (0,1)-matrix forbidding any (t+l)x(\lambda+2)
submatrix (\lambda+2). (1_t 0_l) . Assume A is m-rowed and only columns of sum
t+1,t+2,... ,m-l are allowed to be repeated. Assume that A has the maximum
number of columns subject to the given restrictions. Assume m is sufficiently
large. Then A has each column of sum 0,1,... ,t and m-l+1,m-l+2,..., m exactly
once and, given the appropriate divisibility condition, the columns of sum t+1
correspond to a t-design with block size t+1 and parameter \lambda and there
are no other columns. The proof derives a basic upper bound on the number of
columns of A by a pigeonhole argument and then a careful argument, for large m,
reduces the bound by a substantial amount down to the value given by design
based constructions. We extend in a few directions.

provides a uniform wideband convergence in approximating high frequency
functions and solutions of wave equations. The PhaseDNN makes use of the fact
that common DNNs often achieve convergence in the low frequency range first,
and a series of moderately-sized DNNs are constructed and trained for selected
high frequency ranges. With the help of phase shifts in the frequency domain,
each of the DNNs will be trained to approximate the function's higher frequency
content over a specific range at the the speed of convergence as in the low
frequency range. As a result, the proposed PhaseDNN is able to convert high
frequency learning to low frequency one, allowing a uniform learning to
wideband functions. The PhaseDNN will then be applied to find the solution of
high frequency wave equations in inhomogeneous media through both differential
and integral equation formulations with least square residual loss functions.
Numerical results have demonstrated the capability of the PhaseDNN in learning
high frequency functions and oscillatory solutions of interior and exterior
Helmholtz equations.

intersatellite communications (ISC) between two satellites at a large distance
one from another. The main goal of the theory is to formulate all the
navigation observables within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same
approach should be applied also to the intersatellite GPS-communications (in
perspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite
constellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for
ISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the
introduction of two gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and
receiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable
distance between the satellites during their uncorrelated motion. This
intersection of the two null cones gives the space-time interval in GRT.
Applying some theorems from higher algebra, it was proved that this space-time
distance can become zero, consequently it can be also negative and positive.
But in order to represent the geodesic distance travelled by the signal, the
space-time interval has to be ""compatible"" with the Euclidean distance. So this
""compatibility condition"", conditionally called ""condition for ISC"", is the
most important consequence of the theory. The other important consequence is
that the geodesic distance turns out to be the space-time interval, but with
account also of the ""condition for ISC"". The geodesic distance is proved to be
greater than the Euclidean distance - a result, entirely based on the ""two null
cones approach"" and moreover, without any use of the Shapiro delay formulae.
Application of the same higher algebra theorems shows that the geodesic
distance cannot have any zeroes, in accord with being greater than the
Euclidean distance.

approaching a problem from an agnostic position and propose a systematic and
iterative methodology to discover theories underlying physical phenomena. At
first, commonly observed functional forms of theoretical expressions are used
to transform original features before conducting correlation analysis to
output. Using random combinations of highly correlated expressions, training of

logs have become one type of fast-growing big data in industry. In particular,
such logs often need to be stored for a long time in practice (e.g., a year),
in order to analyze recurrent problems or track security issues. However,
archiving logs consumes a large amount of storage space and computing
resources, which in turn incurs high operational cost. Data compression is
essential to reduce the cost of log storage. Traditional compression tools
(e.g., gzip) work well for general texts, but are not tailed for system logs.
In this paper, we propose a novel and effective log compression method, namely
logzip. Logzip is capable of extracting hidden structures from raw logs via
fast iterative clustering and further generating coherent intermediate
representations that allow for more effective compression. We evaluate logzip
on five large log datasets of different system types, with a total of 63.6 GB
in size. The results show that logzip can save about half of the storage space
on average over traditional compression tools. Meanwhile, the design of logzip
is highly parallel and only incurs negligible overhead. In addition, we share

companies. It saves tens of millions of money fro m Chinese Fintech companies
since the bad loan rate is more than 10%. HC Financial Service Group is the 3rd
largest company in the Chinese P2P financial market. In this paper we
illustrate how we tackle the fraud detection problem at HC Financial. We
utilize two powerful workhorses in the machine learning field - random forest
and gradient boosting decision tree to detect fraudulent users . We demonstrate
that by carefully select features and tune model parameters , we could
effectively filter out fraudulent users in the P2P market.

  its Relation with Quadratic Residues",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2000, A. Tripathi used generating functions to obtain a formula for the
number of non-negative solutions (x,y) of the equation ax + by = n where a, b
and n are given positive integers. We generalize this procedure for the number
of solutions of the equation ax + by + cz = n. The formula leads us to a
surprising connection between the number of solutions of the equation ax + by +
cz = n and quadratic residues. As a consequence of our work, we are able to
prove the equivalence between two fundamental results by Gauss and Sylvester in
the nineteenth century which are generally viewed to be independent.

  improvements with new results and figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequential pulling policies to flatten and smooth fabrics have applications
from surgery to manufacturing to home tasks such as bed making and folding
clothes. Due to the complexity of fabric states and dynamics, we apply deep
imitation learning to learn policies that, given color (RGB), depth (D), or
combined color-depth (RGBD) images of a rectangular fabric sample, estimate
pick points and pull vectors to spread the fabric to maximize coverage. To
generate data, we develop a fabric simulator and an algorithmic supervisor that
has access to complete state information. We train policies in simulation using
domain randomization and dataset aggregation (DAgger) on three tiers of
difficulty in the initial randomized configuration. We present results
comparing five baseline policies to learned policies and report systematic
comparisons of RGB vs D vs RGBD images as inputs. In simulation, learned
policies achieve comparable or superior performance to analytic baselines. In
180 physical experiments with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot,
RGBD policies trained in simulation attain coverage of 83% to 95% depending on
difficulty tier, suggesting that effective fabric smoothing policies can be
learned from an algorithmic supervisor and that depth sensing is a valuable
addition to color alone. Supplementary material is available at
