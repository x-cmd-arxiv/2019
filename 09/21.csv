circle-compactified spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{d-1} \times S^1$ (with a small
radius $R \Lambda \ll 1$) can differ from that on the non-compactified
spacetime $\mathbb{R}^d$. We argue this under the following assumptions, which
are often realized in large $N$ theories with twisted boundary conditions: (i)
a loop integrand of a renormalon diagram is volume independent, i.e. it is not
modified by the compactification, and (ii) the loop momentum variable along the
$S^1$ direction is not associated with the twisted boundary conditions and
takes the values $n/R$ with integer $n$. We find that the Borel singularity is
generally shifted by $-1/2$ in the Borel $u$-plane, where the renormalon
ambiguity of $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^k)$ is changed to
$\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{k-1}/R)$ due to the circle compactification $\mathbb{R}^d
\to \mathbb{R}^{d-1} \times S^1$. The result is general for any dimension $d$
and is independent of details of the quantities under consideration. As an
example, we study the $\mathbb{C} P^{N-1}$ model on $\mathbb{R} \times S^1$
with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ twisted boundary conditions in the large $N$ limit.

achieves $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and $O(1/{\epsilon})$ complexity bound in terms
of number of inner solver iterations, respectively for the strongly convex and
non-strongly convex case. Without the boundedness assumption, only logarithm
terms need to be added and the above two complexity bounds increase
respectively to $\tilde O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and $\tilde O(1/{\epsilon})$,

sufficient conditions on sample complexity, by effectively summarizing the
difficulty of the tree-structure learning problem. Specifically, we show that
the finite sample complexity of the Chow-Liu algorithm for ensuring exact
structure recovery from noisy data is inversely proportional to the information
threshold squared (provided it is positive), and scales almost logarithmically
relative to the number of nodes over a given probability of failure.
Conversely, we show that, if the number of samples is less than an absolute
constant times the inverse of information threshold squared, then no algorithm
can recover the hidden tree structure with probability greater than one half.
As a consequence, our upper and lower bounds match with respect to the
information threshold, indicating that it is a fundamental quantity for the
problem of learning hidden tree-structured models. Further, the Chow-Liu
algorithm with noisy data as input achieves the optimal rate with respect to
the information threshold. Lastly, as a byproduct of our analysis, we resolve
the problem of tree structure learning in the presence of non-identically

utilization and performance gains. However, this leaves the cache vulnerable to
side-channel attacks, where timing differences in shared cache behavior are
exploited to infer information on the victim's execution patterns, ultimately
leaking private information. The root cause for these attacks is mutually
distrusting processes sharing cache entries and accessing them in a
deterministic manner. Various defenses against cache side-channel attacks have
been proposed. However, they either degrade performance significantly, impose
impractical restrictions, or can only defeat certain classes of these attacks.
More importantly, they assume that side-channel-resilient caches are required
for the entire execution workload and do not allow to selectively enable the
mitigation only for the security-critical portion of the workload. We present a
generic mechanism for a flexible and soft partitioning of set-associative
caches and propose a hybrid cache architecture, called HybCache. HybCache can
be configured to selectively apply side-channel-resilient cache behavior only
for isolated execution domains, while providing the non-isolated execution with
conventional cache behavior, capacity and performance. An isolation domain can
include one or more processes, specific portions of code, or a Trusted
Execution Environment. We show that, with minimal hardware modifications and
kernel support, HybCache can provide side-channel-resilient cache only for
isolated execution with a performance overhead of 3.5-5%, while incurring no
performance overhead for the remaining execution workload. We provide a
simulator-based and hardware implementation of HybCache to evaluate the
performance and area overheads, and show how it mitigates typical access-based

further unveils that the observed switching is mainly dominated by domain
nucleation and domain wall motion, which might limit the potentiality of using
this type of multilayer stack design for nanoscale SOT-MRAM application.
Comparison of the experimental switching behavior with micromagnetic

explained by the stray field contribution of the in-plane magnetized layer, and
the roughness-caused N\'eel coupling effect might play a more important role in
achieving the observed field-free deterministic switching.

(silica precursor) with water in an alcoholic medium (e.g. ethanol) in the
presence of KCl electrolyte and ammonia as a catalyst. It has been observed
that the size of the microparticles closely depends on the amount of the TEOS

1.7 micrometer has been confirmed as the amount of TEOS increases from 3.5 ml

theory which has successfully elucidated the behaviors of strong, weak and
electromagnetic interactions of all the known fundamental particles, come from
the lepton and quark flavors. The discovery of neutrino oscillations has proved
that the SM is incomplete, at least in its lepton sector; and thus the door of
opportunity is opened to exploring new physics beyond the SM and solving a
number of flavor puzzles. In this review article we give an overview of
important progress made in understanding the mass spectra, flavor mixing
patterns, CP-violating effects and underlying flavor structures of charged
leptons, neutrinos and quarks in the past twenty years. After introducing the
standard pictures of fermion mass generation, flavor mixing and CP violation in
the SM extended with the presence of massive Dirac or Majorana neutrinos, we
briefly summarize current experimental knowledge about the flavor parameters of
quarks and leptons. Various ways of describing flavor mixing and CP violation
are discussed, the renormalization-group evolution of flavor parameters is
illuminated, and the matter effects on neutrino oscillations are interpreted.
Taking account of possible extra neutrino species, we propose a standard
parametrization of the $6\times 6$ flavor mixing matrix and comment on the
phenomenological aspects of heavy, keV-scale and light sterile neutrinos. We
pay particular attention to those novel and essentially model-independent ideas
or approaches regarding how to determine the Yukawa textures of Dirac fermions
and the effective mass matrix of Majorana neutrinos, including simple discrete
and continuous flavor symmetries. An outlook to the future development in
unravelling the mysteries of flavor structures is also given.

We provide explicit convergence rates to the optimality depending on the
decrease rate of the regularization parameter. Our experiments show that the
empirical error closely follows the established theoretical convergence rates.
In addition to optimality, we demonstrate two desirable behaviours of the
regularized algorithms even in the absence of approximations: robustness to
stochasticity of environment and safety of trajectories induced by the policy

degrees offset from those detected at 1.2 mm and 0.85-0.89 mm. Such a 90 degree
offset may be explained by that the inner $\sim$100 AU area is optically thick

absorption of aligned dust against the weakly or unpolarized warm dust emission
from the innermost region. This can also consistently explain why the highest

increases with dust brightness temperature in the inner $\sim$100 AU region of

Unfortunately, this strategy introduces significant artifacts, removing natural

trained on such bicubic images therefore struggle to generalize to natural

bicubic downsampling in order to restore the natural image characteristics
present in the data. This allows us to generate realistic image pairs,

algorithms that collect aggregates about sensitive user data, and is now
deployed in several large systems. We initiate a systematic study of a
fundamental limitation of locally differentially private protocols: they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. While any algorithm can be
manipulated by adversaries who lie about their inputs, we show that any
non-interactive locally differentially private protocol can be manipulated to a
much greater extent. Namely, when the privacy level is high or the input domain
is large, an attacker who controls a small fraction of the users in the
protocol can completely obscure the distribution of the users' inputs. We also
show that existing protocols differ greatly in their resistance to
manipulation, even when they offer the same accuracy guarantee with honest
execution. Our results suggest caution when deploying local differential
privacy and reinforce the importance of efficient cryptographic techniques for
emulating mechanisms from central differential privacy in distributed settings.

$\sigma_{\Delta \langle z \rangle} \leq 0.006$ in all tomographic bins. We show
that the SOM calibration is unbiased in the cases of noiseless photometry and
perfectly representative spectroscopic datasets, as expected from theory. The
inclusion of both photometric noise and spectroscopic selection effects in our

dense stellar clusters. When these black holes go through an active accretion
phase, the multiple components of the accretion disk, stellar cluster, and
black hole system all coexist. We analyze the effect of drag forces on highly
eccentric stellar orbits incurred as stars puncture through the disk plane.
Disk crossings dissipate orbital energy, drawing eccentric stars into more
circular orbits. For high surface density disks, such as those found around
black holes accreting near the Eddington mass accretion limit, the magnitude of
this energy dissipation can be larger than the mean scatterings that stars
receive by two body relaxation. One implication of this is the presence of a
disk ""loss cone"" for highly eccentric stellar orbits where the dissipation from
disk interaction outweighs scatter via two body relaxation. The disk loss cone
is larger than the tidal disruption loss cone for near-Eddington black hole
accretion rates. Stellar orbits within the disk loss cone are lost from the
overall cluster as stellar orbits are circularized and stars are potentially
ablated by their high-velocity impacts with the disk. We find, however, that
the presence of the disk loss cone has a minimal effect on the overall rate of
stellar tidal disruptions. Stars are still efficiently fed to the black hole
from more-distant stellar orbits that receive large-enough per orbit scatter to
jump over the disk loss cone and end up tidally disrupted.

the size and orientation of each filament. With filament spines inferred from
existing galaxy surveys as a proxy for typical real filaments, we find hundreds
of filaments in the region of the sky accessible to the SKA that can be
detected. Once the various phases of the SKA telescope become operational,
their own surveys will be able to find the galaxies required to infer the
position of even more filaments within the survey area. We find that in 120 h,
SKA1-mid/SKA2 will detect HI emission from the strongest filaments in the field

regulating their spin and accretion evolution. We perform a series of 3D
hydrodynamics simulations in both the isothermal and adiabatic limits to
systematically measure the rotation rates, sizes, and masses of CPDs as
functions of $q_{\rm thermal}$, the ratio of the planet mass to the disk
thermal mass. Our $q_{\rm thermal}$ ranges from 0.1 to 4; for our various disk
temperatures, this corresponds to planet masses between 1 Earth mass and 4
Jupiter masses. Within this parameter space, we find that isothermal CPDs are
disky and bound within $\sim$10\% of the planet's Bondi radius $r_{\rm B}$,
with the innermost $\sim0.05\,r_{\rm B}$ in full rotational support. Adiabatic
CPDs are spherical (therefore not actually ""disks""), bound within
$\sim0.2\,r_{\rm B}$, and mainly pressure-supported with rotation rates scaling
linearly with $q_{\rm thermal}$; extrapolation suggests full rotational support
of adiabatic envelopes at $\sim10\,q_{\rm thermal}$. Fast rotation and 3D
supersonic flow render isothermal CPDs significantly different in structure
from --- and orders of magnitude less massive than --- their 1D isothermal
hydrostatic counterparts. Inside a minimum-mass solar nebula, even a maximally
cooled, isothermal CPD around a 10 Earth-mass core may have less than 1 Earth
mass, suggesting that gas giant formation may hinge on angular momentum
transport processes in CPDs. Our CPD sizes and masses appear consistent with
the regular satellites orbiting solar system giants.

DARTS successfully minimizes validation loss, the found solutions generalize

better generalization properties. Based on these observations, we propose
several simple variations of DARTS that perform substantially more robustly in

regarding the overall behavior of the total LD and the intrinsic spin and
parity distributions of the excited states. However, very few experimental
constraints are taken into account: LD at neutron separation energy coming from
average resonance spacings, whenever they have been previously measured, and
the sometimes subjective extrapolation of discrete levels. These, however,
constrain the LD only for very specific spins, parities and excitation
energies. This work aims to establish additional experimental constraints on LD
through quantitative correlations between cross sections and LD. This allows
for the fitting and determination of detailed structures in LD. For this we use
the microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) LD to associate variations
predicted by the model with the structure observed in double-differential
spectra at low outgoing neutron energy, which is dominated by the LD input. We
also use \nuc{56}{Fe} ($n,p$) as an example cross sections are extremely
sensitive to LD. For comparison purposes we also perform calculations with the
GC model. With this approach we are able to perform fits of the LD based on
actual experimental data, constraining the model and ensuring its consistency.
This approach can be particularly useful in extrapolating the LD to nuclei for
which high-excited discrete levels and/or resonance spacings are unknown. It
also predicts inelastic gamma cross sections that can significantly differ from
more standard phenomenological LD.

everyday tasks without relying on a caregiver. Unfortunately, the very
dexterity that makes these arms useful also makes them challenging to
teleoperate: the robot has more degrees-of-freedom than the human can directly
coordinate with a handheld joystick. Our insight is that we can make assistive
robots easier for humans to control by leveraging latent actions. Latent
actions provide a low-dimensional embedding of high-dimensional robot behavior:
for example, one latent dimension might guide the assistive arm along a pouring
motion. In this paper, we design a teleoperation algorithm for assistive robots
that learns latent actions from task demonstrations. We formulate the
controllability, consistency, and scaling properties that user-friendly latent
actions should have, and evaluate how different low-dimensional embeddings
capture these properties. Finally, we conduct two user studies on a robotic arm
to compare our latent action approach to both state-of-the-art shared autonomy
baselines and a teleoperation strategy currently used by assistive arms.
Participants completed assistive eating and cooking tasks more efficiently when
leveraging our latent actions, and also subjectively reported that latent
actions made the task easier to perform. The video accompanying this paper can

mining the balance between over-de-raining (e.g. removing texture details in

paper, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine network called Gradual Network
(GraNet) consisting of coarse stage and fine stage for delving into single
image de-raining with different granularities. Specifically, to reveal
coarse-grained rain-streak characteristics (e.g. long and thick rain
streaks/raindrops), we propose a coarse stage by utilizing local-global spatial
dependencies via a local-global subnetwork composed of region-aware blocks.
Taking the residual result (the coarse de-rained result) between the rainy
image sample (i.e. the input data) and the output of coarse stage (i.e. the
learnt rain mask) as input, the fine stage continues to de-rain by removing the
fine-grained rain streaks (e.g. light rain streaks and water mist) to get a
rain-free and well-reconstructed output image via a unified contextual merging
sub-network with dense blocks and a merging block. Solid and comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our GraNet can
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods by removing rain streaks

approximately simulates the LIP and derive linear constraints that are
sufficient conditions for maintaining ground contact. This allows for rapid

disease spread. We find that our model can be described at a global scale as an
infectious transmission process between communities with global infectious and

disease reaches most of the communities, but each community has only a small

point. This scenario could make the decision on whether to launch a pandemic
alert or not more difficult. Finally, we show that link percolation theory can
be used at a global scale to estimate the probability of a pandemic since the
global transmissibility between communities has a weak dependence on the global

under-approximated by the solution to a CVaR-Markov Decision Process. We adopt
an existing value iteration algorithm to find an approximate solution to the
reduced problem for a class of linear systems. Then, we develop a realistic
numerical example of a stormwater system to show that this approach can be
applied to non-linear systems. Finally, we compare the CVaR criterion to the
exponential disutility criterion. The latter allocates control effort evenly
across the cost distribution to reduce variance, while the CVaR criterion
focuses control effort on a given worst-case quantile--where it matters most
for safety.

constraints that guarantee the generalization of a learning algorithm. These
constraints are usually expressed as some simplicity assumptions on the target.
For instance, in the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory the space of possible
hypotheses is considered to have a limited VC dimension. In this paper, the
constraint on the entropy $H(X)$ of the input variable $X$ is studied as a
simplicity assumption. It is proven that the sample complexity to achieve an
$\epsilon$-$\delta$ Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) hypothesis is bounded
by $\frac{2^{
\left.6H(X)\middle/\epsilon\right.}+\log{\frac{1}{\delta}}}{\epsilon^2}$ which
is sharp up to the $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$ factor. Morever, it is shown that if
a feature learning process is employed to learn the compressed representation
from the dataset, this bound no longer exists. These findings have important
implications on the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory which had been utilized
to explain the generalization power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but its
applicability for this purpose is currently under debate by researchers. In
particular, this is a rigorous proof for the previous heuristic that compressed
representations are exponentially easier to be learned. However, our analysis
pinpoints two factors preventing the IB, in its current form, to be applicable
in studying neural networks. Firstly, the exponential dependence of sample
complexity on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, which can lead to a dramatic effect on the
bounds in practical applications when $\epsilon$ is small. Secondly, our
analysis reveals that arguments based on input compression are inherently
insufficient to explain generalization of methods like DNNs in which the
features are also learned using available data.

embedded systems. While these tasks are among the most compute-intensive tasks
from the artificial intelligence domain, they are only allowed to use limited
computation and memory resources on embedded devices. In the meanwhile, such
resource-constrained implementations are often required to satisfy additional
demanding requirements such as real-time response, high-throughput performance,

SkyNet, a hardware-efficient neural network to deliver the state-of-the-art

common top-down flow for compact DNN (Deep Neural Network) design, SkyNet
provides a bottom-up DNN design approach with comprehensive understanding of
the hardware constraints at the very beginning to deliver hardware-efficient
DNNs. The effectiveness of SkyNet is demonstrated by winning the competitive
System Design Contest for low power object detection in the 56th IEEE/ACM
Design Automation Conference (DAC-SDC), where our SkyNet significantly
outperforms all other 100+ competitors: it delivers 0.731 Intersection over

IoU and 25.05 FPS on an Ultra96 embedded FPGA. The evaluation of SkyNet is also
extended to GOT-10K, a recent large-scale high-diversity benchmark for generic
object tracking in the wild. For state-of-the-art object trackers SiamRPN++ and
SiamMask, where ResNet-50 is employed as the backbone, implementations using
our SkyNet as the backbone DNN are 1.60X and 1.73X faster with better or
similar accuracy when running on a 1080Ti GPU, and 37.20X smaller in terms of

multiple discretization steps. In this paper, we focus on developing
computationally efficient MB schemes for multiple shooting based nonlinear

by introducing MB in the shooting step, resulting in a smaller but sparse OCP.
Therefore, the discretization accuracy and level of sparsity is maintained. A
condensing algorithm that exploits the sparsity structure of the OCP is
proposed, that allows to reduce the computation complexity of condensing from
quadratic to linear in the number of discretization nodes. As a result,
active-set methods with warm-start strategy can be efficiently employed, thus
allowing the use of a longer prediction horizon. A detailed comparison between
the proposed scheme and the nonuniform grid NMPC is given. Effectiveness of the

transition rate and thermal quenching. To assess its predictive power for the
latter properties, we propose a new \textit{optimized configuration path (OCP)
method in which} the ground-state and excited-state forces are mixed instead of
their configurations. We also define another one-parameter model thanks a
double energy parabola hypothesis (DEPH). We compare the OCP method and the
DEPH reference with the 1D-CCM for three paradigmatic 4f-5d phosphors
Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$:Ce, Lu$_2$SiO$_5$:Ce, and YAlO$_3$:Ce. We find that the OCP

lower ground-state energies than the 1D-CCM for the same 4f-5d energy
difference. However, the OCP method suffers from the appearance of multiple
local minima, rendering the clear determination of the optimal geometry very
difficult in practice. Still the OCP method allows one to quantify the
deviations from the 1D-CCM, therefore increasing confidence in the lower bound
obtained from the DEPH for the 4f-5d crossing barrier, and its comparison with
the energy of the auto-ionization thermal quenching mechanism. We expect the
OCP approach to be applicable to other luminescent materials or molecules.

evolution of the disc of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) in comparison with the
Milky Way. We use Planetary Nebulae (PNe) to obtain the age-velocity dispersion
relation in different radial bins of the M31 disc. We separate the observed PNe
sample based on their extinction values into two distinct age populations. The
observed velocities of our high- and low-extinction PNe, which correspond to
higher and lower mass progenitors respectively, are fitted in de-projected
elliptical bins to obtain their rotational velocities, $V_{\phi}$, and
corresponding dispersions, $\rm\sigma_{\phi}$. We assign ages to the two PNe
populations by comparing central-star properties of an archival sub-sample of
PNe, having models fitted to their observed spectral features, to stellar
evolution tracks. For the high- and low-extinction PNe, we find ages of
$\sim2.5$ Gyr and $\sim4.5$ Gyr respectively, with distinct kinematics beyond a
deprojected radius R$\rm_{GC}= 14$ kpc. At R$\rm_{GC}$=17--20 kpc, which is the
equivalent distance in disc scale lengths of the Sun in the Milky Way disc, we
obtain $\rm\sigma_{\phi,~2.5~Gyr}= 61\pm 14$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$\rm\sigma_{\phi,~4.5~Gyr}= 101\pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$. The age-velocity dispersion
relation for the M31 disc is obtained in two radial bins, R$\rm_{GC}$=14--17
and 17--20 kpc. The high- and low-extinction PNe are associated with the young
thin and old thicker disc of M31 respectively, whose velocity dispersion values
increase with age. These values are almost twice and thrice that of the Milky
Way disc stellar population of corresponding ages. From comparison with
simulations of merging galaxies, we find that the age-velocity dispersion
relation in the M31 disc measured using PNe is indicative of a single major
merger that occurred 2.5 -- 4.5 Gyr ago with an estimated merger mass ratio
$\approx$ 1:5.

presents a context-aware natural image matting method for simultaneous
foreground and alpha matte estimation. Our method employs two encoder networks
to extract essential information for matting. Particularly, we use a matting
encoder to learn local features and a context encoder to obtain more global
context information. We concatenate the outputs from these two encoders and
feed them into decoder networks to simultaneously estimate the foreground and
alpha matte. To train this whole deep neural network, we employ both the
standard Laplacian loss and the feature loss: the former helps to achieve high
numerical performance while the latter leads to more perceptually plausible
results. We also report several data augmentation strategies that greatly
improve the network's generalization performance. Our qualitative and
quantitative experiments show that our method enables high-quality matting for
a single natural image. Our inference codes and models have been made publicly

analytic functions. Rather than studying potential fixed points of such
operators, we examine their effect on the singularities of functions. To that
end, we introduce the notion of a ""dreamcatcher"", an object which encodes the
location and ""virtual residue"" of the singularities of an analytic function of
a specified growth rate along the boundary of the function's region of
convergence. Dreamcatchers can be given rigorous footing as elements of the

dreamcatcher of a fixed point is itself the fixed point of the operator induced
on L2(Q/Z) (the ""dreamcatcher operator"") by the permutation operator. Using
Pontryagin duality and p-adic analysis, the fixed points of the operators
acting on dreamcatchers for simple-pole-like singularities are completely
determined for a large class of Hydra maps in the case where the fixed points

our choice of biased gradient estimators. We prove that introducing bias by
dropping Categorical terms from the gradient estimate or using Gumbel-Softmax
mitigates the adverse effect on the SNR. We apply SVO to three nonlinear latent

detection system against adversarial examples (AEs) that not only are able to
fool the model, but also maintain the executability of the original input. As
such, we first investigate the application of existing off-the-shelf
adversarial attack approaches on malware detection systems through which we
found that those approaches do not necessarily maintain the functionality of
the original inputs. Therefore, we proposed an approach to generate adversarial
examples, COPYCAT, which is specifically designed for malware detection systems
considering two main goals; achieving a high misclassification rate and
maintaining the executability and functionality of the original input. We
designed two main configurations for COPYCAT, namely AE padding and sample
injection. While the first configuration results in untargeted
misclassification attacks, the sample injection configuration is able to force
the model to generate a targeted output, which is highly desirable in the
malware attribution setting. We evaluate the performance of COPYCAT through an
extensive set of experiments on two malware datasets, and report that we were
able to generate adversarial samples that are misclassified at a rate of 98.9%
and 96.5% with Windows and IoT binary datasets, respectively, outperforming the
misclassification rates in the literature. Most importantly, we report that
those AEs were executable unlike AEs generated by off-the-shelf approaches. Our
transferability study demonstrates that the generated AEs through our proposed
method can be generalized to other models.

low Strouhal number ($St$) and non-zero azimuthal wavenumbers ($m$). In these

streamwise vortices and streaks similar to those found in turbulent

global resolvent analysis, which shows that they are a response to upstream
forcing of streamwise vorticity near the nozzle exit. Analysis of mode shapes,
component-wise amplitudes, and sensitivity analysis distinguishes the three
mechanisms and the regions of frequency-wavenumber space where each dominates,
finding lift-up to be dominant as $St/m \rightarrow 0$. Finally, SPOD and
resolvent analyses of localized regions show that the lift-up mechanism is

proportional to streamwise distance from the nozzle, with streaks of azimuthal
wavenumber exceeding five near the nozzle, and wavenumbers one and two most

FOPTs and non-trivial primordial GW spectra which can fall well within the
frequency and amplitude sensitivity of upcoming experiments, including LISA,
BBO and u-DECIGO. However, GWs observability clashes with invisible Higgs decay
constraints from the LHC. A simple and consistent fix is to assume the
majoron-like mass to lie above the Higgs-decay kinematical threshold. We also

approaches to perform spectral unmixing (SU) considering variability of the

spectral signatures acquired a priori. However, existing spectral libraries are
often small and unable to properly capture the variability of each EM in
practical scenes, which compromises the performance of MESMA. In this paper, we
propose a library augmentation strategy to increase the diversity of existing
spectral libraries, thus improving their ability to represent the materials in
real images. First, we leverage the power of deep generative models to learn
the statistical distribution of the EMs based on the spectral signatures
available in the existing libraries. Afterwards, new samples can be drawn from
the learned EM distributions and used to augment the spectral libraries,
improving the overall quality of the SU process. Experimental results using

commonsense tasks is still far from that of humans. As a preliminary attempt,
we propose a simple yet effective method to teach pretrained models with
commonsense reasoning by leveraging the structured knowledge in ConceptNet, the
largest commonsense knowledge base (KB). Specifically, the structured knowledge
in KB allows us to construct various logical forms, and then generate
multiple-choice questions requiring commonsense logical reasoning. Experimental
results demonstrate that, when refined on these training examples, the
pretrained models consistently improve their performance on tasks that require
commonsense reasoning, especially in the few-shot learning setting. Besides, we
also perform analysis to understand which logical relations are more relevant
to commonsense reasoning.

is the integration of high-quality, ultrathin high-\k{appa} dielectrics that
fully meet the roadmap requirements for low-power applications. With a
dangling-bond free surface, the deposition of dielectrics by atomic layer
deposition (ALD) on 2D materials is usually characterized with non-uniform
nucleation and island formation, producing a highly porous dielectric layer
with serious leakage particularly at the small equivalent oxide thickness (EOT)

molecular crystal as seeding layer. Ultrathin dielectrics down to 1 nm EOT is
realized on graphene, MoS2 and WSe2, with considerably reduced roughness,

constrain torus parameters such as the torus optical depth, X-ray absorbing

X-ray spectrum as well as the UV-optical-infrared spectral energy distribution
(UOI-SED) with clumpy torus models in X-ray (XCLUMPY; Tanimoto et al. 2019) and
infrared (CLUMPY; Nenkova et al. 2008) respectively. From our current data, the
constraints on $\sigma$--$i$ from both X-rays and UOI show that the line of
sight crosses the torus as expected for a type 2 AGN. We obtain a small X-ray
scattering fraction (<0.1%), which suggests narrow torus openings, giving
preference to the bi-polar outflow picture of the double-peaked profile.
Comparing the optical depth of the torus from the UOI-SED and the absorbing
column density $N_{\rm H}$ from the X-ray spectrum, we find that the

reconstruction of the state of polarization (SoP) of a light beam using only
intensity measurements. A given SoP is reconstructed from a set of four Stokes
parameters, which are computed through four intensity measurements. Since all
intensities must be performed on the same beam, it is common to record each
intensity individually, one after the other, limiting its performance to light
beams with static SoP. Here, we put forward a novel technique to extend SP to a
broader set of light beams with dynamic SoP. This technique relies on the
superposition principle, which enables the splitting of the input beam into
identical copies, allowing the simultaneous measurement of all intensities. For
this, the input beam is passed through a multiplexed digital hologram displayed
on a polarization-insensitive Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) that grants
independent and rapid (20 kHz) manipulation of each beam. We are able to
reliably reconstruct the SoP with high fidelity and at speeds of up to 27 Hz,

achieve high performance and high system efficiency. Currently there is a trend
in designing accelerators for special applications, while arguably a debate is
sparked whether we should customize architecture for each application. In this
study, we introduce what we refer to as Gene-Patterns, which are the base
patterns of diverse applications. We present a Recursive Reduce methodology to
identify the hotspots, and a HOtspot Trace Suite (HOTS) is provided for the
research community. We first extract the hotspot patterns, and then, remove the
redundancy to obtain the base patterns. We find that although the number of
applications is huge and ever-increasing, the amount of base patterns is
relatively small, due to the similarity among the patterns of diverse
applications. The similarity stems not only from the algorithms but also from
the data structures. We build the Periodic Table of Memory Access Patterns
(PT-MAP), where the indifference curves are analogous to the energy levels in
physics, and memory performance optimization is essentially an energy level
transition. We find that inefficiency results from the mismatch between some of
the base patterns and the micro-architecture of modern processors. We have
identified the key micro-architecture demands of the base patterns. The
Gene-Pattern concept, methodology, and toolkit will facilitate the design of
both hardware and software for the matching between architectures and

generating various visual content. However, images generated by existing GANs
are often of attributes (e.g., smiling expression) learned from one image
domain. As a result, generating images of multiple attributes requires many
real samples possessing multiple attributes which are very resource expensive
to be collected. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN, namely IntersectGAN, to
learn multiple attributes from different image domains through an intersecting
architecture. For example, given two image domains $X_1$ and $X_2$ with certain
attributes, the intersection $X_1 \cap X_2$ denotes a new domain where images
possess the attributes from both $X_1$ and $X_2$ domains. The proposed
IntersectGAN consists of two discriminators $D_1$ and $D_2$ to distinguish
between generated and real samples of different domains, and three generators
where the intersection generator is trained against both discriminators. And an
overall adversarial loss function is defined over three generators. As a
result, our proposed IntersectGAN can be trained on multiple domains of which
each presents one specific attribute, and eventually eliminates the need of
real sample images simultaneously possessing multiple attributes. By using the
CelebFaces Attributes dataset, our proposed IntersectGAN is able to produce
high quality face images possessing multiple attributes (e.g., a face with
black hair and a smiling expression). Both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations are conducted to compare our proposed IntersectGAN with other
baseline methods. Besides, several different applications of IntersectGAN have
been explored with promising results.

with the blue- and red-shifted components of an expanding spherical shell. The

A few bright lines present extended wings (with velocities up to a few hundred

Since they contribute to low-velocity ejecta components as observationally

The LCZ classification scheme is primarily focused on urban climate-related

demonstrate the scaling nature of the QCD vacuum and their ratio defines the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter indicating the border of type I and type II dual

unexpected macroscopic phenomena, and has attracted sustained attention in
recent years--particularly in the field of solitons and associated nonlinear
phenomena. Meanwhile, optical lattices have emerged as a versatile toolbox for
understanding the properties and controlling the dynamics of BEC, among which
the realization of bright gap solitons is an iconic result. However, the dark
gap solitons are still experimentally unproven, and their properties in more
than one dimension remain unknown. In light of this, we describe, numerically
and theoretically, the formation and stability properties of gap-type dark
localized modes in the context of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices.
Two kinds of stable dark localized modes--gap solitons and soliton
clusters--are predicted in both the one- and two-dimensional geometries. The
vortical counterparts of both modes are also constructed in two dimensions. A
unique feature is the existence of a nonlinear Bloch-wave background on which
all above gap modes are situated. By employing linear-stability analysis and
direct simulations, stability regions of the predicted modes are obtained. Our
results offer the possibility of observing dark gap localized structures with
cutting-edge techniques in ultracold atoms experiments and beyond, including in
optics with photonic crystals and lattices.

rectify data errors. Traditional methods depend on data dependencies to check
the existence of errors in data, but they fail to rectify the errors. To
overcome this limitation, recent methods define repairing rules on which they
depend to detect and fix errors. However, all existing data repairing rules are
provided by experts which is an expensive task in time and effort. Besides,
rule-based data repairing methods need an external verified data source or user
verifications; otherwise they are incomplete where they can repair only a small
number of errors. In this paper, we define weighted matching rectifying rules
(WMRRs) based on similarity matching to capture more errors. We propose a novel
algorithm to discover WMRRs automatically from dirty data in-hand. We also
develop an automatic algorithm for rules inconsistency resolution.
Additionally, based on WMRRs, we propose an automatic data repairing algorithm

dependably. We experimentally verify our method on both real-life and synthetic

codimension-2 transverse intersection of two codimension-1 discontinuity sets.
The Filippov convention can be extended to such intersections, but this
approach does not provide a unique sliding vector and, as opposed to the
classical sliding vector-field on codimension-1 discontinuity manifolds, there
is no agreed notion of stability in the codimension-2 context. In this paper,
we perform a regularization of the piecewise smooth system, introducing two
regularization functions and a small perturbation parameter. Then, based on
singular perturbation theory, we define sliding and stability of sliding
through a critical manifold of the singularly perturbed, regularized system. We
show that this notion of sliding vector-field coincides with the Filippov one.
The regularized system gives a parameterized surface (the canopy) independent
of the regularization functions. This surface serves as our natural basis to
derive new and simple geometric criteria on the existence, multiplicity and
stability of the sliding flow, depending only on the smooth vector fields
around the intersection. Interestingly, we are able to show that if there exist
two sliding vector-fields then one is a saddle and the other is of
focus/node/center type. This means that there is at most one stable sliding
vector-field. We then investigate the effect of the choice of the
regularization functions, and, using a blowup approach, we demonstrate the
mechanisms through which sliding behavior can appear or disappear on the
intersection and describe what consequences this has on the dynamics on the
adjacent codimension-1 discontinuity sets. Finally, we show the existence of
canard explosions of regularizations of PWS systems in $\mathbb R^3$ that

first and the last word in the constituent. Second, graph convolutions relying
on the constituent tree are performed, yielding syntactically-informed
constituent representations. Finally, the constituent representations are
`decomposed' back into word representations which in turn are used as input to
the SRL classifier. We evaluate SpanGCN against alternatives, including a model

to isolate the 21cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal from the much larger

called as the EoR window. There are in-fact three distinct regions in the
Fourier space, (i) the Foreground wedge portion, (ii) the EoR window region

wedge and the Field of View wedge. This paper addresses two questions: (1)
Whether the signal in between the two wedges is also a direct representation of
the EoR brightness temperature fluctuations? and (2) How can we extract the
cosmology information from this region considering that the foregrounds are
much larger than the signal? The answer to the first question is yes, the
visibilities as function of baseline and delay are, within a few percent, same
as the EoR brightness temperature fluctuations for the cases considered.
Secondly, the in between region is not foreground free, due to non-negligible
sidelobes. But, one can possibly extract signal from this region if one models
foregrounds and instruments accurately. As all the three components, the
cosmological signal, the foregrounds and the thermal noise are calculated in

clusters make up 5-20% of the interstitial clusters formed directly in
cascades. In continuous irradiation, C15 clusters are frequently formed, after
which they remain highly stable and grow by absorbing nearby single
interstitial atoms. Growth of C15 clusters ultimately leads to collapse into
dislocation loops, most frequently into 1/2<111> loops and only rarely
collapsing into <100> loops at low temperatures. The population, size, and

popular and beginning to be well accepted. Obtaining and representing the
ground and excited state wave functions are examples of such applications.
Another application is analyzing the wave functions and determining their
quantum phases. Here, we review the recent progress of using the multilayer
convolutional neural network, so-called deep learning, to determine the quantum
phases in random electron systems. After training the neural network by the
supervised learning of wave functions in restricted parameter regions in known
phases, the neural networks can determine the phases of the wave functions in
wide parameter regions in unknown phases; hence, the phase diagrams are
obtained. We demonstrate the validity and generality of this method by drawing
the phase diagrams of two- and higher dimensional Anderson metal-insulator
transitions and quantum percolations as well as disordered topological systems
such as three-dimensional topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. Both
real-space and Fourier space wave functions are analyzed. The advantages and
disadvantages over conventional methods are discussed.

  from Natural Language","WACV 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing methods using generative adversarial approaches for Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL) aim to generate realistic visual features from class semantics
by a single generative network, which is highly under-constrained. As a result,
the previous methods cannot guarantee that the generated visual features can
truthfully reflect the corresponding semantics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel method named Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks for
Zero-Shot Learning (CANZSL). It encourages a visual feature generator to
synthesize realistic visual features from semantics, and then inversely
translate back synthesized the visual feature to corresponding semantic space
by a semantic feature generator. Furthermore, in this paper a more challenging
and practical ZSL problem is considered where the original semantics are from
natural language with irrelevant words instead of clean semantics that are
widely used in previous work. Specifically, a multi-modal consistent
bidirectional generative adversarial network is trained to handle unseen
instances by leveraging noise in the natural language. A forward one-to-many
mapping from one text description to multiple visual features is coupled with
an inverse many-to-one mapping from the visual space to the semantic space.
Thus, a multi-modal cycle-consistency loss between the synthesized semantic
representations and the ground truth can be learned and leveraged to enforce
the generated semantic features to approximate to the real distribution in
semantic space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on natural
language-based zero-shot learning tasks.

atypical motor development holds promise for recognizing those infants who are
at risk for a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy,
autism spectrum disorders). Previously, novel wearable technology has shown
promise for offering efficient, scalable and automated methods for movement
assessment in adults. Here, we describe the development of an infant wearable,
a multi-sensor smart jumpsuit that allows mobile accelerometer and gyroscope
data collection during movements. Using this suit, we first recorded play
sessions of 22 typically developing infants of approximately 7 months of age.
These data were manually annotated for infant posture and movement based on
video recordings of the sessions, and using a novel annotation scheme
specifically designed to assess the overall movement pattern of infants in the
given age group. A machine learning algorithm, based on deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) was then trained for automatic detection of posture and
movement classes using the data and annotations. Our experiments show that the
setup can be used for quantitative tracking of infant movement activities with
a human equivalent accuracy, i.e., it meets the human inter-rater agreement
levels in infant posture and movement classification. We also quantify the
ambiguity of human observers in analyzing infant movements, and propose a
method for utilizing this uncertainty for performance improvements in training
of the automated classifier. Comparison of different sensor configurations also
shows that four-limb recording leads to the best performance in posture and
movement classification.

nonlinear structure is duly taken into account. In particular, while in
previous treatments the linearization of this homogeneous integral equation
introduced an indeterminacy in the scale of the corresponding mass, the current
approach determines it uniquely, once the value of the gauge coupling at a
given renormalization point is used as input. A crucial ingredient for this
construction is the ""kinetic term"" of the gluon propagator, whose form is not
obtained from the complicated equation governing its evolution, but is rather
approximated by suitable initial {\it Ans\""atze}, which are subsequently
improved by means of a systematic iterative procedure. The multiplicative
renormalization of the central equation is carried out following an approximate
method, which is extensively employed in the studies of the standard quark gap
equation. This approach amounts to the effective substitution of the vertex
renormalization constants by kinematically simplified form factors of the
three- and four-gluon vertices. The resulting numerical interplay, exemplified
by the infrared suppression of the three-gluon vertex and the mild enhancement
of the four-gluon vertex, is instrumental for obtaining positive-definite and
monotonically decreasing running gluon masses. The resulting gluon propagators,
put together from the gluon masses and kinetic terms obtained with this method,
match rather accurately the data obtained from large-volume lattice
simulations.

However, it faces the problem that the class activation regions are usually

problem is also caused by the first step (training step), because single
classification model trained on the entire classes contains finite discriminate
information that limits the object region extraction. To this end, this paper
solves CAM generation by using multiple classification models. To form multiple
classification networks that carry different discriminative information, we try
to capture the semantic relationships between classes to form different
semantic levels of classification models. Specifically, hierarchical clustering
based on class relationships is used to form hierarchical clustering results,
where the clustering levels are treated as semantic levels to form the
classification models. Moreover, a new orthogonal module and a two-branch based

orthogonal and complementary. We use the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset to verify the

The mark indicates the value of some attribute associated to the respective

Our goal is to design schemes that can efficiently compress such graphical data
without making assumptions about its stochastic properties. Namely, we wish to
develop a universal compression algorithm for graphical data sources. To
formalize this goal, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, also
called the objective method, which provides a technique to think of a marked
graph as a kind of stationary stochastic processes, stationary with respect to
movement between vertices of the graph. In recent work, we have generalized a
notion of entropy for unmarked graphs in this framework, due to Bordenave and
Caputo, to the case of marked graphs. We use this notion to evaluate the
efficiency of a compression scheme. The lossless compression scheme we propose
in this paper is then proved to be universally optimal in a precise technical
sense. It is also capable of performing local data queries in the compressed

of the stress-free state of the body that can strongly influence the optimal

optimization of structures undergoing large deformations due to thermal and

multiplicatively decomposing thermal and mechanical effects and introducing an
intermediate stress-free state between the undeformed and deformed coordinates.
By incorporating the thermoelastic nonlinearity into the level-set topology
optimization scheme, wider design spaces can be explored with the consideration
of both mechanical and thermal loads. Four numerical examples are presented
that demonstrate how temperature changes affect the optimal design of
large-deforming structures. In particular, we show how optimization can
manipulate the material layout in order to create a counteracting effect
between thermal and mechanical loads, even up to a degree that buckling and
snap-through are suppressed. Hence the consideration of large deformations in
conjunction with thermoelasticity opens many new possibilities for controlling

define and help analyse the problem of large wind farm aerodynamics. The theory
splits the problem into two sub-problems; namely an 'external' (or farm-scale)
problem, which is a time-dependent problem considering large-scale motions of
the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) to assess the amount of momentum available
to the ABL's bottom resistance at a certain time; and an 'internal' (or
turbine-scale) problem, which is a quasi-steady (in terms of large-scale
motions of the ABL) problem describing the breakdown of the ABL's bottom
resistance into wind turbine drag and land/sea surface friction. The two
sub-problems are coupled to each other through a non-dimensional parameter
called 'farm wind-speed reduction factor' or 'farm induction factor,' for which
a simple analytic equation is derived that can be solved iteratively using
information obtained from both sub-problems. This general form of coupling
allows us to use the present theory with various types of flow models for each

problem and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the internal

followed by a discussion on how the theory can be applied (in an approximate
manner) to real-world problems; for example, how to estimate the power loss due
to the so-called 'wind farm blockage effect' for a given large wind farm under
given environmental conditions.

proper understanding of the factors generating pollution and of the behavior of
air pollution in time is crucial to support the development of effective
policies aiming at the reduction of pollutant concentration. This paper
considers the hourly time series of three pollutants, namely NO$_2$, O$_3$ and
PM$_{2.5}$, collected on sixteen measurement stations in Switzerland. The air
pollution patterns due to the location of measurement stations and their
relationship with anthropogenic activities, and specifically land use, are
studied using two approaches: Fisher-Shannon information plane and
complexity-invariant distance between time series. A clustering analysis is
used to recognize within the measurements of a same pollutant group of stations
behaving in a similar way. The results clearly demonstrate the relationship
between the air pollution probability densities and land use activities.

attempts to design a thermodynamically consistent multi-component, multiphase
pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model that allows mass transfer across the
phase interfaces and is capable to predict the phase behavior of typically
partially miscible hydrocarbon mixtures. The designed model defines the total
interaction force for the entire phase and split the force into individual
components. Through a properly derived force split factor associated with the
volatility of each component, the model can achieve precise thermodynamic
consistency in multi-component hydrocarbon mixtures, which is described by the
iso-fugacity rule.

  Strategies For Disease Management Across Agricultural Production Systems",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0228983",,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Failing to mitigate propagation of disease spread can result in dire economic
consequences for agricultural networks. Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic
Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to
prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments,
management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of
contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes
associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system
wide biosecurity. Data gathered from digital field experiments can provide
insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision
support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak
scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked
with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified
the risk associated with each participant's decisions and delineated three
dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and
opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk
and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects
risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as
the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that
more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse
behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity
increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find
no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to
Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using
digital field experiments to study how risk communication affects behavior,
which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.

applications. We propose a novel global localization method that employs the
map traversability as a hidden observation. The resulting map-corrected
odometry localization is able to provide an accurate belief tensor of the robot
state. Our method can be used for blind robots in dark or highly reflective
areas. In contrast to odometry drift in long-term, our method using only
odometry and the map converges in longterm. Our method can also be integrated
with other sensors to boost the localization performance. The algorithm does
not have any initial state assumption and tracks all possible robot states at
all times. Therefore, our method is global and is robust in the event of
ambiguous observations. We parallel each step of our algorithm such that it can
be performed in real-time (up to ~ 300 Hz) using GPU. We validate our algorithm
in different publicly available floor-plans and show that it is able to
converge to the ground truth fast while being robust to ambiguities.

are embedded into plants to collect vital data and help in decision making to
ensure higher quality of crops and prevent pests, disease, and other possible
threats. In Saudi Arabia, growing palms is the most important agricultural
activity, and there is an increasing need to leverage smart agriculture
technology to improve the production of dates and prevent diseases. One of the
most critical diseases of palms if the red palm weevil, which is an insect that
causes a lot of damage to palm trees and can devast large areas of palm trees.
The most challenging problem is that the effect of the weevil is not visible by
humans until the palm reaches an advanced infestation state. For this reason,
there is a need to use advanced technology for early detection and prevention
of infestation propagation. In this project, we have developed am IoT based
smart palm monitoring prototype as a proof-of-concept that (1) allows to
monitor palms remotely using smart agriculture sensors, (2) contribute to the
early detection of red palm weevil. Users can use web/mobile application to
interact with their palm farms and help them in getting early detection of
possible infestations. We used Elm company IoT platform to interface between
the sensor layer and the user layer. In addition, we have collected data using
accelerometer sensors and we applied signal processing and statistical
techniques to analyze collected data and determine a fingerprint of the
infestation.
