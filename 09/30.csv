autonomous vehicle. Our system mainly consists of a virtual LiDAR and a pose
tracker. We use a perspective transformation method to synthesize a
surround-view image from undistorted fisheye camera images. With a semantic
segmentation model, the free space can be extracted. The scans of the virtual
LiDAR are generated by discretizing the contours of the free space. As for the
pose tracker, we propose a visual odometry system fusing both the feature
matching and the virtual LiDAR scan matching results. Only those feature points
located in the free space area are utilized to ensure the 2D-2D matching for
pose estimation. Furthermore, bundle adjustment (BA) is performed to minimize
the feature points reprojection error and scan matching error. We apply our
system to an autonomous vehicle equipped with four fisheye cameras. The testing
scenarios include an outdoor parking lot as well as an indoor garage.
Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves a more robust and
accurate performance comparing with a fisheye camera based monocular visual
odometry system.

(genes, proteins, etc.) in a given case-control population are tested to verify
existence of an association between each genetic marker and a specific disease.
A popular approach in this regard is to estimate local false discovery rate
(LFDR), the posterior probability that the null hypothesis is true, given an
observed test statistic. However, the existing LFDR estimation methods in the
literature are usually complicated. Assuming a chi-square model with one degree
of freedom, which covers many situations in genome-wide association studies, we
use the method of moments and introduce a simple, fast and efficient approach
for LFDR estimation. We perform two different simulation strategies and compare
the performance of the proposed approach with three popular LFDR estimation
methods. We also examine the practical utility of the proposed method by
analyzing a comprehensive 1000 genomes-based genome-wide association data
containing approximately 9.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, and a
microarray data set consisting of genetic expression levels for 6033 genes for
prostate cancer patients. The R package implementing the proposed method is

an unsupervised method based on autoencoders for inferring these basic features

optimization of the `local entropy' rather than the standard loss, resulting in
a more robust inference, and enhancing the performance on this type of data
considerably. Algorithmically, this is realized by training an interacting
system of replicated autoencoders. We apply this method to synthetic and

Propyne (CH$_3$CCH) has been detected in a variety of environments,
from Galactic star-forming regions to extragalactic sources. Such molecules are
excellent tracers of the physical conditions in star-forming regions.
  Aims. This study explores the emission of CH$_3$CCH in the low-mass
protostellar binary, IRAS 16293$-$2422, examining the spatial scales traced by
this molecule, as well as its formation and destruction pathways.
  Methods. ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey
(PILS) are used to determine the abundances and excitation temperatures of
CH$_3$CCH towards both protostars, exploring spatial scales from 70 to 2400 au.
The three-phase chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL is also used, to explore the
chemical reactions of this molecule.
  Results. CH$_3$CCH is detected towards both IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B and
is found to trace the hot corino component around each source in the PILS
dataset. Eighteen transitions above 3$\sigma$ are detected, enabling robust
excitation temperatures and column densities to be determined in each source.
In IRAS 16293A, an excitation temperature of 90 K and a column density of
7.8$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ best fits the spectra. In IRAS 16293B, an
excitation temperature of 100 K and 6.8$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ best fits
the spectra. The chemical modelling finds that in order to reproduce the
observed abundances, both gas-phase and grain-surface reactions are needed.
  Conclusions. CH$_3$CCH is a molecule whose brightness and abundance in many
different regions can be utilised to provide a benchmark of molecular variation
with the physical properties of star-forming regions. It is essential when
making such comparisons, that the abundances are determined with a good
understanding of the spatial scale of the emitting region, to ensure that
accurate abundances are derived.

with comet-like morphology and asteroid-like orbits. However, MBCs are
challenging targets to study remotely due to their small sizes and the
relatively large distance they are from the Sun and the Earth. Recently, a
number of weakly active short-period comets have been identified that might
originate in the asteroid main belt. Among all of the known candidates, comet
66P/du Toit has been suggested to have one of the highest probabilities of
coming from the main belt. We obtained medium and high-resolution spectra of
66P from 300-2500 nm with the X-shooter/VLT and the UVES/VLT instruments in
July 2018. We also obtained a series of narrow-band images of 66P to monitor
the gas and dust activity between May and July 2018 with TRAPPIST-South. In
addition, we applied a dust model to characterize the dust coma of 66P and
performed dynamical simulations to study the orbital evolution of 66P. We
derive the OPR of ammonia (NH$_3$) in 66P to be 1.08$\pm$0.06, which
corresponds to a nuclear spin temperature of $\sim$34 K. We computed the
production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3,$ and C$_2$ radicals and measured the dust
proxy, Af$\rho$. The dust analysis reveals that the coma can be best-fit with
an anisotropic model and the peak dust production rate is about 55 kg s$^{-1}$
at the perihelion distance of 1.29 au. Dynamical simulations show that 66P is
moderately asteroidal with the capture time, t$_{cap} \sim 10^4$ yr. Our
observations demonstrate that the measured physical properties of 66P are
consistent with other typical short-period comets and differ significantly from
other MBCs. Therefore, 66P is unlikely to have a main belt origin.

  135 pages",,,,"hep-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we apply techniques from quantum information theory to study
quantum gravity within the framework of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field
theory correspondence (AdS/CFT). Through AdS/CFT, progress has been made in
understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum field theories, and in
how gravitational physics can emerge from these structures. However, this
understanding is far from complete and will require the development of new
tools to quantify correlations in CFT.
  This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product
expansion (OPE) blocks in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal
family to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields in AdS which are
diffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered in
the maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In
less symmetric states the duality must be modified. Working with excited states
within AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis shows how the OPE block decomposes into
more fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields integrated over
non-minimal geodesics.
  Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics of entanglement
measures for general quantum systems. Results are presented for the family of
quantum R\'enyi entropies and entanglement negativity. R\'enyi entropies are
studied for general dynamics by imposing special initial conditions. Around
pure, separable initial states, all R\'enyi entropies grow with the same
timescale at leading, and next-to-leading order. Mathematical tools are
developed for the differentiation of non-analytic matrix functions with respect
to constrained arguments and are used to construct analytic expressions for
derivatives of negativity. We establish bounds on the rate of change of state
distinguishability and the rate of entanglement growth for closed systems.

layer functions, such as encoders and decoders, together with shared keys to
provide a threshold-type security scheme. To this end, we first consider a
scenario where the effect of the physical layer is omitted and all the channels
between the involved parties are assumed to be noiseless. We introduce a model
for threshold-secure coding, where the legitimate parties communicate using a
shared key such that an eavesdropper does not get any information, in an
information-theoretic sense, about the key as well as about any subset of the
input symbols of size up to a certain threshold. Then, a framework is provided
for constructing threshold-secure codes from linear block codes while
characterizing the requirements to satisfy the reliability and security
conditions. Moreover, we propose a threshold-secure coding scheme, based on
Reed-Muller (RM) codes, that meets security and reliability conditions. It is
shown that the encoder and the decoder of the scheme can be implemented
efficiently with quasi-linear time complexity. In particular, a successive
cancellation decoder is shown for the RM-based coding scheme. Then we extend
the setup to the scenario where the channel between the legitimate parties is
no longer noiseless. The reliability condition for noisy channels is then
modified accordingly, and a method is described to construct codes attaining
threshold security as well as desired reliability. Also, we propose a coding
scheme based on RM codes for threshold security and robustness designed for
binary erasure channels along with a unified successive cancellation decoder.
The proposed threshold-secure coding schemes are flexible and can be adapted
for different key lengths.

improving the $\Omega(n^2)$ time needed to form $\bar{A}$. Finally, we initiate

work is motivated by the field of synthetic biology, in which saddle points are

both digital and analog computation, though developing genetic digital
computation has been the main focus. We frame the analog computing challenge of
generating a steady state input-output function inside living cells. To program
the steady state, a data-driven approach is taken wherein an approximation of
the Koopman operator, identified via deep dynamic mode decomposition, is used
to describe the dynamics of the system linearly. The new representation of the
dynamics are then used to solve an optimization problem for the input which
maximizes a direction in state space. Some added structure on the Koopman
operator learning process for controlled systems is given for dynamics that are
separable in the state and input. Finally, the methods are demonstrated on
simulation examples of an incoherent feedforward loop and a combinatorial
promoter system, two common network architectures seen in the field of
synthetic biology.

a large context for robust estimation of inter-channel features, which is
impractical in applications requiring low-latency responses. In this paper, we
propose filter-and-sum network (FaSNet), a time-domain, filter-based
beamforming approach suitable for low-latency scenarios. FaSNet has a two-stage
system design that first learns frame-level time-domain adaptive beamforming
filters for a selected reference channel, and then calculate the filters for
all remaining channels. The filtered outputs at all channels are summed to
generate the final output. Experiments show that despite its small model size,
FaSNet is able to outperform several traditional oracle beamformers with
respect to scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio (SI-SNR) in reverberant speech
enhancement and separation tasks. Moreover, when trained with a
frequency-domain objective function on the CHiME-3 dataset, FaSNet achieves
14.3\% relative word error rate reduction (RWERR) compared with the baseline
model. These results show the efficacy of FaSNet particularly in reverberant

the mapping of FLRW cosmology onto conformal mechanics. On the one hand, we

fixes the ordering ambiguities in the Wheeler-de Witt quantization and allows

multiple worker machines that compute stochastic gradients which are further

and the asymptotic expansions. The former converges for all finite values of
the complex variable, $z$, but it requires a large number of terms for large
values of $|z|$, and the latter is a Poincar\'{e}-type expansion which is
well-suited for such large values and where optimal truncation is possible. The
asymptotic series of the Airy function shows a classical example of the Stokes
phenomenon where a type of discontinuity occurs for the homonymous multipliers.
A new series expansion is presented here that stems from the method of steepest
descents, as can the asymptotic series, but which is convergent for all values
of the complex variable. It originates in the integration of uniformly
convergent power series representing the integrand of the Airy's integral in
different sections of the integration path. The new series expansion is not a
power series and instead relies on the calculation of complete and incomplete
Gamma functions. In this sense, it is related to the Hadamard expansions. It is
an alternative expansion to the two main aforementioned power series that also
offers some insight into the transition zone for the Stokes' multipliers due to
the splitting of the integration path. Unlike the Hadamard series, it relies on
only two different expansions, separated by a branch point, one of which is
centered at infinity. The interest of the new series expansion is mainly a
theoretical one in a twofold way. First of all, it shows how to convert an
asymptotic series into a convergent one, even if the rate of convergence may be
slow for small values of $|z|$. Secondly, it sheds some light on the Stokes
phenomenon for the Airy function by showing the transition of the integration
paths at $\arg z = \pm 2 \pi/3$.

floating-point operations with binary bit operations which significantly
reduces the memory bandwidth and storage requirement. However, it suffers from
non-negligible accuracy loss and underutilized digital signal processing (DSP)
blocks of FPGAs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes REQ-YOLO, a

We adopt the block-circulant matrix method and propose a heterogeneous weight

development in the networked systems community. In this work, we explore if and
how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to incentivize data
sharing by enabling a generic framework for sharing synthetic datasets with
minimal expert knowledge. As a specific target, our focus in this paper is on
time series datasets with metadata (e.g., packet loss rate measurements with
corresponding ISPs). We identify key challenges of existing GAN approaches for
such workloads with respect to fidelity (e.g., long-term dependencies, complex
multidimensional relationships, mode collapse) and privacy (i.e., existing
guarantees are poorly understood and can sacrifice fidelity). To improve
fidelity, we design a custom workflow called DoppelGANger (DG) and demonstrate
that across diverse real-world datasets (e.g., bandwidth measurements, cluster
requests, web sessions) and use cases (e.g., structural characterization,
predictive modeling, algorithm comparison), DG achieves up to 43% better
fidelity than baseline models. Although we do not resolve the privacy problem
in this work, we identify fundamental challenges with both classical notions of
privacy and recent advances to improve the privacy properties of GANs, and
suggest a potential roadmap for addressing these challenges. By shedding light
on the promise and challenges, we hope our work can rekindle the conversation
on workflows for data sharing.

the molecular filaments in the 50MC. They have already broken through the

shocked molecular gas components around the HII regions. From line width of the

Lienkaemper, Shiu, and Woodstock imply that odim and cdim may differ, even for

  (*) If $\mathcal C$ is a simplicial complex, then cdim$(\mathcal{C}) =
\mbox{odim}(\mathcal C)$,
  (*) If $\mathcal C$ is intersection complete, then cdim$(\mathcal C)\le

in particular. Furthermore, the reliability of such methods is higher when the
nature of short-ranged interactions need not be modeled explicitly. This may be
necessary for two reasons: (1) there are interactions that occur over a short
range that cannot be accurately modeled with a potential function and/or (2)
the entire Hamiltonian loses its reliability when applied at short distances.
This work is an investigation of the utility and consequences of omitting a
finite region of space from quantum mechanical analysis, accomplished by
imposition of an artificial boundary behind which obscured short-ranged
physical effects may operate. With this method, a free function of integration
that depends on momentum is interpreted as a function encoding information
needed to match a long-distance wavefunction to an appropriate state function
on the other side of the boundary. Omitting part of the space from analysis
implies that the strict unitarity requirement of quantum mechanics must be
relaxed, since particles can actually propagate beyond the boundary. Strict
orthogonality of eigenmodes and hermiticity of the Hamiltonian must also be
relaxed in this method; however, all of these canonical relations are obeyed
when averaged over sufficiently long times. What is achieved, therefore,
appears to be an effective long-wavelength theory, at least for stationary
systems. As examples, the quantum defect theory of the one-dimensional Coulomb
interaction is recovered, as well as a new perspective of the inverse-square
potential and the free particle, as well as the Wigner time delay associated
with contact interactions. Potential applications of this method may include
three-dimensional atomic systems and two-dimensional systems, such as graphene.

determine the exact solutions to geodesic distances on two different families

our technique is more general and convenient to implement compared to those
previous methods mainly because there are not complicated calculations needed.
In addition, the closed-form expression of mean first-passage time ($MFPT$) for
random walk on each member in tree families is also readily obtained according
to connection of our obtained results to effective resistance of corresponding

filters (BPFs) based on the circular patch resonator is proposed in this work.
By modifying the output balanced ports of the balanced BPFs to inhibit or
transport TM31 mode of the circular patch resonator under the differential-mode
(DM) excitation, a single-band or dual-band balanced BPF can realized. As the
odd modes could be restrained under the common-mode (CM) excitation, the
balanced BPFs could achieve high CM suppression in the DM passbands. Meanwhile,
several perturbing ways are introduced to improve the performance of the
balanced BPFs. Specifically, perturbation vias are introduced to disturb the
electric field distribution to improve the CM suppression in the DM passbands,
and slots are cut on the circular patch resonators to perturb the current
distribution to modify the second DM passband of the dual-band balanced BPF.
Furthermore, the proposed single-band and dual-band balanced BPFs are
fabricated and characterized. Good agreement can be achieved between the
simulated and measured results of the fabricated balanced BPFs, which validates
the feasibility of the proposed design method.

quantized Fock states and the inhomogeneous coupling between them. The
Hamiltonian of two cavities coupled with a two-level atom is an intrinsic
one-dimensional Su-Schriefer-Heeger model of Fock states. By adding another
cavity, the Fock-state lattice is extended to two dimensions with a honeycomb
structure, where the strain due to the inhomogeneity of the coupling strengths
induces a Lifshitz topological phase transition between a semimetal and a band
insulator. In the semimetallic phase, the strain is equivalent to a
pseudomagnetic field, which results in the quantization of the Landau levels
and the valley Hall effect. We further construct a Haldane model where the
topological phases can be characterized by the topological markers. This study
demonstrates a fundamental distinction between the topological phases of bosons

bargaining scenario where a seller and a buyer negotiate the price of an item

intelligent transportation systems. Most existing learning methods mainly focus
on isolated intersections and suffer from inefficient training. This paper aims
at the cooperative control for large scale multi-intersection traffic signal,
in which a novel end-to-end learning based model is established and the
efficient training method is proposed correspondingly. In the proposed model,
the input traffic status in multi-intersections is represented by a tensor,
which not only significantly reduces dimensionality than using a single matrix
but also avoids information loss. For the output, a multidimensional boolean
vector is employed for the control policy to indicate whether the signal state
changes or not, which simplifies the representation and abides the practical
phase changing rules. In the proposed model, a multi-task learning structure is
used to get the cooperative policy by learning. Instead of only using the
reinforcement learning to train the model, we employ imitation learning to
integrate a rule based model with neural networks to do the pre-training, which
provides a reliable and satisfactory stage solution and greatly accelerates the
convergence. Afterwards, the reinforcement learning method is adopted to
continue the fine training, where proximal policy optimization algorithm is
incorporated to solve the policy collapse problem in multi-dimensional output
situation. In numerical experiments, the advantages of the proposed model are
demonstrated with comparison to the related state-of-the-art methods.

reduce the challenge size, we exploit distributional relaxations of
space-efficient LWEs. That allows only a small challenge-seed to be transmitted
with the full-length challenge generated by the LFSR, resulting in a 100X
reduction of communication cost. To prevent an active challenge-manipulation
attack, a self-incrementing counter is embedded into the challenge seed.
  We prototyped the lattice PUF with 2^136 challenge-response pairs (CRPs) on a
Spartan 6 FPGA, which required 45 slices for the PUF logic proper and 233
slices for the FE. Simulation-based evaluation shows the mean (std) of
uniformity to be 49.98% (1.58%), of uniqueness to be 50.00% (1.58%), and of
reliability to be 1.26% (2.88%). The LWE concrete hardness estimator guarantees
that a successful ML attack of the lattice PUF will require the infeasible
2^128 CPU operations. Several classes of empirical ML attacks, including
support vector machine, logistic regression, and deep neural networks, are
used: in all attacks, the prediction error remains above 49.76% after 1 million
training CRPs.

integrate deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). To this end, hybrid
integration of deterministic solid-state SPSs, such as those based on InAs/GaAs
quantum dots (QDs), is highly promising. However, the spectral and spatial
randomness inherent in the QDs pose a serious challenge for scalable
implementation of multiple identical SPSs on a silicon CMOS chip. To overcome
this challenge, we have been investigating a new hybrid integration technique
called transfer printing, which is based on a pick-and-place operation and
allows for the integration of desired QD SPSs on any locations on the silicon
CMOS chips at will. Nevertheless, even in this scenario, in-situ fine tuning
for perfect wavelength matching among the integrated QD SPSs will be required
for interfering photons from the dissimilar sources. Here, we demonstrate
in-situ wavelength tuning of QD SPSs integrated on a CMOS silicon chip. To
thermally tune the emission wavelengths of the integrated QDs, we augmented the
QD SPSs with optically driven heating pads. The integration of all the
necessary elements was performed using transfer printing, which largely
simplified the fabrication of the three-dimensional stack of micro/nanophotonic
structures. We further demonstrate in-situ wavelength matching between two

the system volume while achieving high performance. An attractive approach to
power biomedical implants is to use wireless power transfer (WPT) with
ultrasound. To receive the ultrasonic energy, a piezoelectric transducer is
implemented, which is designed to have the resonance frequency at the frequency
of the ultrasonic wave. To extract the received energy from the transducer, an
energy rectification circuit is typically required. The commonly used rectifier
is called a synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) rectifier, which
employs an inductor to increase the energy efficiency. However, the employment
of inductor limits the system miniaturization since it usually needs to be
around 1's mH. The synchronized switch harvesting on capacitors (SSHC)
rectifier was recently proposed to be used on vibration energy harvesting and
this architecture achieves inductor-less fully integrated design. In a
vibration energy harvesting system, the piezoelectric transducer usually has
large inherent capacitance and low resonant frequency. But the piezoelectric
transducer used in ultrasonic WPT typically has very small capacitance and much
higher resonant frequency. In this paper, the performance of a SSHC rectifier
used in ultrasonic WPT is analyzed. The analysis covers system size and
performance. Based on the analysis, this paper presents an important design
consideration on designing a SSHC rectifier to be used in ultrasonic WPT, which
is the allowed maximal ON resistance in the capacitor-to-capacitor charging
loop in function of the transducer capacitance, transducer resonant frequency
and the number of SSHC stages.

gradient potential (LP) that is generated by an external magnetic field. In the
absence of the LP, the system has topological states that exhibit a
magnetization plateau for a uniform external magnetic field. These topological
states have a finite integer Chern number and their stability is clarified by
an equivalent spinless fermion system derived by a Jordan-Wigner
transformation. We show that the LP, which is nothing but a constant electric
field in the spinless fermion system, destabilizes the topological states,
because it induces localization called Wannier-Stark (WS) localization. We
clarify the phase diagram in the presence of the LP and on-site diagonal
disorder. To this end, we carefully study edge excitations under the open
boundary condition, which are a hallmark of the topological order. We find a
very interesting phenomenon indicating existence of a quasi-edge modes that
take the place of the genuine edge modes in certain parameter regions. This is
a precursor of the WS localization realized in topological states. Finally, we
investigate many-body localization induced by a sufficiently strong LP or
disorder. To this end, we study the energy-level statistics for whole energy
levels, and find unexpected extended-state regimes located in intermediate
potential-gradient and weak on-site disorder regimes. We verify this phenomenon
by calculating variance of the entanglement entropy. The present system is
closely related to quantum Hall state in two dimensions, and therefore our
findings can be observed not only in experiments on ultra-cold atomic gases but

conditions on dataset and teacher network, we prove that when the gradient is
small at every data sample, each teacher node is \emph{specialized} by at least
one student node \emph{at the lowest layer}. For two-layer network, such
specialization can be achieved by training on any dataset of \emph{polynomial}

parametric assumption of the input (like Gaussian). Our theory suggests that
teacher nodes with large fan-out weights get specialized first when the

However, to date it is still unclear where its exceptional performance comes
from. In this paper, we show that there is a strong norm bias in the MIPS
problem, which means that the large norm items are very likely to become the
result of MIPS. Then we explain the good performance of ip-NSW as matching the
norm bias of the MIPS problem - large norm items have big in-degrees in the
ip-NSW proximity graph and a walk on the graph spends the majority of
computation on these items, thus effectively avoids unnecessary computation on
small norm items. Furthermore, we propose the ip-NSW+ algorithm, which improves
ip-NSW by introducing an additional angular proximity graph. Search is first
conducted on the angular graph to find the angular neighbors of a query and
then the MIPS neighbors of these angular neighbors are used to initialize the
candidate pool for search on the inner-product proximity graph. Experiment
results show that ip-NSW+ consistently and significantly outperforms ip-NSW and

quiescent galaxies in the Coma and Abell 2147 clusters in the SDSS legacy
galaxy sample and followed them up using a new high-throughput Binospec
spectrograph at the 6.5m MMT. Several of them exhibit signs of the recently
finished ram pressure stripping. Here we describe our data analysis approach
that uses spectroscopic and photometric measurements with a dedicated set of
stellar population models, which include realistic chemical enrichment and star
formation histories. From our analysis we can precisely estimate stellar
mass-to-light ratios and dark matter content of UDGs.

been discussed alongside the elusive liquid-liquid critical point hidden behind
the limit of homogeneous nucleation. This has inspired numerous scenarios that
attempt to explain water anomalies. Despite recent breakthrough experiments
eliminating several of thous scenarios, we lacked a tool to localize the
spinodal and the liquid-liquid critical point. We constructed a unique equation
of state combining the famous Speedy's equation and the liquid-liquid critical
point to remove that deficit and to review these explanations. For the first
time, the proposed equation of state independently depicts the spinodal in the
presence of the liquid-liquid critical point and demonstrates that the
explanation for water anomalies based on the reentrance of the spinodal is not
valid; this feature (reentering the spinodal) was solely predicted based on the
curved density surface caused by the existence of the second critical point.
However, the critical point alone is not sufficient to explain the shape of the
density surface of water. In the new equation, hydrogen bond cooperativity is
important to force the critical point to exist outside of zero temperature.
Together with mounting evidence for the existence of a compressibility maximum
behind the homogeneous nucleation limit at positive pressure, the findings
practically exclude all explanations for water anomalies except for the
existence of the liquid-liquid critical point at positive pressure. Finally, an
extensive study of heat capacity demonstrated profound disagreement between the
two major experimental heat capacity datasets and identified the more accurate

of training data and output labels. While the success of deep learning mostly
relies on supervised training, important properties cannot be inferred
efficiently from end-to-end annotations alone, for example causal relations or
domain-specific invariances. We present a general technique to supplement
supervised training with prior knowledge expressed as relations between
training instances. We illustrate the method on the task of visual question
answering to exploit various auxiliary annotations, including relations of
equivalence and of logical entailment between questions. Existing methods to
use these annotations, including auxiliary losses and data augmentation, cannot
guarantee the strict inclusion of these relations into the model since they
require a careful balancing against the end-to-end objective. Our method uses
these relations to shape the embedding space of the model, and treats them as
strict constraints on its learned representations. In the context of VQA, this
approach brings significant improvements in accuracy and robustness, in
particular over the common practice of incorporating the constraints as a soft
regularizer. We also show that incorporating this type of prior knowledge with

perturbatively. The effect of Coulomb interaction on diffusively moving
electrons in the normal state has been known before, but in the superconducting
state both diffuson and the screened Coulomb interaction are modified.
Therefore, the correction to the density of states in the superconducting state
exhibits an energy dependence different from that of the normal state. There is
a dip structure in the correction part because the interaction has a peak at
twice the energy of the superconducting gap. The Coulomb interaction and the
superconducting fluctuation cannot be treated separately because the density
fluctuation is coupled to the phase fluctuation in the superconducting state.
This coupling results in the absence of divergence around the gap edge in the
correction part, which suggests the validity of this perturbation calculation.

The adaptive structural learning method of Deep Belief Network (DBN) can
realize a high classification capability while searching the optimal network
structure during the training. The method can find the optimal number of hidden
neurons of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) by neuron
generation-annihilation algorithm to train the given input data, and then it
can make a new layer in DBN by the layer generation algorithm to actualize a
deep data representation. Moreover, the learning algorithm of Adaptive RBM and
Adaptive DBN was extended to the time-series analysis by using the idea of LSTM
(Long Short Term Memory). In this paper, our proposed prediction method was
applied to Moving MNIST, which is a benchmark data set for video recognition.
We challenge to reveal the power of our proposed method in the video
recognition research field, since video includes rich source of visual
information. Compared with the LSTM model, our method showed higher prediction
performance (more than 90% predication accuracy for test data).

  Non-Gated Acquisitions","Accepted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To develop a framework to reconstruct large-scale volumetric dynamic
MRI from rapid continuous and non-gated acquisitions, with applications to
pulmonary and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging.
  Theory and Methods: The problem considered here requires recovering
hundred-gigabytes of dynamic volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of
k-space data, acquired continuously over several minutes. This reconstruction
is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as
memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage
intrinsic three dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones,
with ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire
acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (1) A compressed representation
using multi-scale low rank matrix factorization that constrains the
reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (2) Stochastic
optimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize
communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D
cones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D
radial trajectory. We compare it with ""soft-gated"" dynamic reconstruction for
DCE and respiratory resolved reconstruction for pulmonary imaging.
  Results: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in
gating based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or
non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper image features.
  Conclusion: We demonstrated a method that can reconstruct massive 3D dynamic
image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation setting.

spatially averaged quantities and thus becomes positive if the average
expansion of the Universe accelerates. This conclusion is reevaluated here by
considering exact light propagation in a simple toy-model with average
accelerated expansion. The toy-model and light propagation setup is explicitly
designed for concordance between spatial averages and averages along light
rays. While it is verified that redshift-distance relations are well described
by average quantities in this setup, it is found that the redshift drift is
not. Specifically, the redshift drift is negative despite the on-average
late-time accelerated expansion of the model. This result implies that
measuring redshift drift signals at low redshifts gives the potential for
directly falsifying the backreaction conjecture. However, the results are based
on a toy-model so it is in principle possible that the result is an artifact
and that redshift drift is in reality well described by spatially averaged
quantities. The result therefore highlights the importance of developing
\emph{exact} solutions to the Einstein equations which exhibit average
accelerated expansion without local expansion so that the relation between
spatial averages and observations can be firmly established.

experimental observation and the configuration interaction calculation at the
$L_{2,3}$ and $M_{2,3}$ edges of ferromagnetic iron, we suggest that the
integrated MCD signal in terms of the transferred energy could be used to
estimate the local spin moment even in the case where the application of the
spin sum-rule in X-ray absorption is questionable. We also point out that
XRS-MCD signal could be observed at the $M_{1}$ edge with a magnitude
comparable to that at the $M_{2,3}$ edge, although the spin-orbit coupling is

However, although some uses require a collective behavior, other need a more

are still poorly understood. Here we use nanoscale-uniform binary random dense
mixtures with different proportions of oxide magnetic nanoparticles with
low$/$high anisotropy as a valuable tool to explore the crossover from
individual to collective behavior. Two different anisotropy scenarios have been
studied in two series of binary compacts: M1, comprising maghemite
($\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles of different sizes (9.0 nm $/$ 11.5 nm)
with barely a factor of 2 between their anisotropy energies and M2, mixing
equally-sized pure maghemite (low-anisotropy) and Co-doped maghemite
(high-anisotropy) nanoparticles with a large difference in anisotropy energy
(ratio $>$ 8). Interestingly, while the M1 series exhibits collective behavior
typical of strongly-coupled dipolar systems, the M2 series presents a more
complex scenario where different magnetic properties resemble either
""individual-like"" or ""collective"", crucially emphasizing that the collective
character must be ascribed to specific properties and not to the system as a
whole. The strong differences between the two series, offer new insight
(systematically ratified by simulations) into the subtle interplay between
dipolar interactions, local anisotropy and sample heterogeneity, to determine
the behavior of dense assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles.

generation, where the underlying spatial structure and the rendering on the
structure can be independently controlled respectively, yet using no tuple
supervision. The setting is significant since tuple supervision is costly and
sometimes even unavailable. However, the task is highly unconstrained and thus
ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose to introduce an auxiliary domain
which shares a common underlying-structure space with the target domain, and we
make a partially shared latent space assumption. The key idea is to encourage
the partially shared latent variable to represent the similar underlying
spatial structures in both domains, while the two domain-specific latent
variables will be unavoidably arranged to present renderings of two domains
respectively. This is achieved by designing two parallel generative networks
with a common Progressive Rendering Architecture (PRA), which constrains both
generative networks' behaviors to model shared underlying structure and to
model spatially dependent relation between rendering and underlying structure.
Thus, we propose DSRGAN (GANs for Disentangling Underlying Structure and
Rendering) to instantiate our method. We also propose a quantitative criterion
(the Normalized Disentanglability) to quantify disentanglability. Comparison to
the state-of-the-art methods shows that DSRGAN can significantly outperform

carriers in the current sheet originate in the polar caps as electron-positron
pairs, and are carried along field lines that enter the equatorial current
sheet beyond the magnetospheric Y-point. In this work we investigate further
the charge replenishment of the ECS. We discovered that the flow of pairs from
the rims of the polar caps cannot supply both the electric charge and the
electric current of the ECS. The ECS must contain an extra amount of positronic
(or electronic depending on orientation) electric current that originates in
the stellar surface and flows outwards along the separatrices. We develop an
iterative hybrid approach that self-consistently combines ideal force-free
electrodynamics in the bulk of the magnetosphere with particle acceleration
along the ECS. We derive analytic approximations for the orbits of the
particles, and obtain the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere for various
values of the pair-formation multiplicity parameter kappa. For realistic values
kappa >> 1, the magnetosphere is practically indistinguishable from the ideal
force-free one, and therefore, the calculation of the spectrum of high-energy
radiation must be based on analytic approximations for the distribution of the
accelerating electric field in the ECS.

H\alpha/H\beta }$, IRX turns out to be independent on galaxy stellar mass, the
Balmer decrement does show a strong mass dependence at fixed IRX. We find the
discrepancy, parameterized by the color excess ratio $R_{\rm EBV} \equiv
E(B-V)_{\rm IRX}/E(B-V)_{\rm H\alpha/H\beta }$, is not dependent on the
gas-phase metallicity and axial ratio but on the specific star formation rate

probed by the Balmer decrement becomes increasingly larger than the global
(stellar) attenuation of SFGs with decreasing SSFR surface density. This can be
understood in the context of an enhanced fraction of intermediate-age stellar
populations that are less attenuated by dust than the HII region-traced young
population, in conjunction with a decreasing dust opacity of the diffuse ISM
when spreading over a larger spatial extent. Once the SSFR surface density of
an SFG is known, the conversion between attenuation of nebular and stellar

dusty star-forming regions in the host galaxy or multiple images due to strong
gravitational lensing. The Mg$_{\rm II}$ absorption and the potential
Ly$\alpha$ line features have been identified at $z=2.33$ in the near-infrared
spectroscopy towards J0100+2802, and a simple mass model fitting well
reproduces the positions and flux densities of the quadruple system, both of
which are consistent with the latter interpretation. Although a high-resolution
map taken in the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) on board Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) shows a morphology with an apparently single component, in our
fiducial lens mass model it can simply be explained by a $\sim50$ pc scale
offset between the ALMA and HST emission regions. In this case, the
magnification factor for the observed HST emission is obtained to $\sim450$,
reducing the intrinsic $M_{\rm BH}$ estimate to even below $10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$.
The confirmation or the rejection of the gravitational lensing scenario is
important for our understanding of the super-massive black holes in the early

facilitating software developers to retrieve existing code fragments from
available open-source repositories given a user query. Despite the existing
efforts in improving the effectiveness of code retrieval, there are still two
main issues hindering them from being used to accurately retrieve satisfiable
code fragments from large-scale repositories when answering complicated
queries. First, the existing approaches only consider shallow features of
source code such as method names and code tokens, but ignoring structured
features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control-flow graphs (CFGs) of
source code, which contains rich and well-defined semantics of source code.
Second, although the deep learning-based approach performs well on the
representation of source code, it lacks the explainability, making it hard to
interpret the retrieval results and almost impossible to understand which
features of source code contribute more to the final results.
  To tackle the two aforementioned issues, this paper proposes MMAN, a novel
Multi-Modal Attention Network for semantic source code retrieval. A
comprehensive multi-modal representation is developed for representing
unstructured and structured features of source code, with one LSTM for the
sequential tokens of code, a Tree-LSTM for the AST of code and a GGNN (Gated
Graph Neural Network) for the CFG of code. Furthermore, a multi-modal attention
fusion layer is applied to assign weights to different parts of each modality
of source code and then integrate them into a single hybrid representation.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on a large-scale real-world dataset show
that our proposed model can accurately retrieve code snippets and outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods.

many researchers from the fields of bio- and chemo-informatics. Among these
models, invertible flow-based approaches are not fully explored yet. In this
paper, we propose a powerful invertible flow for molecular graphs, called graph
residual flow (GRF). The GRF is based on residual flows, which are known for
more flexible and complex non-linear mappings than traditional coupling flows.
We theoretically derive non-trivial conditions such that GRF is invertible, and
present a way of keeping the entire flows invertible throughout the training
and sampling. Experimental results show that a generative model based on the
proposed GRF achieves comparable generation performance, with much smaller
number of trainable parameters compared to the existing flow-based model.

appearing on the edge of the network. Processing tasks on the edge of the
network can effectively solve the problems of personal privacy leaks and server
overload. As a result, it has attracted a great deal of attention and made
substantial progress. This progress includes efficient convolutional neural
network (CNN) models such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet. However, all of these
networks appear as a common network model and they usually need to identify
multiple targets when applied. So the size of the input is very large. In some
specific cases, only the target needs to be classified. Therefore, a small
input network can be designed to reduce computation. In addition, other
efficient neural network models are primarily designed for mobile phones.
Mobile phones have faster memory access, which allows them to use group
convolution. In particular, this paper finds that the recently widely used
group convolution is not suitable for devices with very slow memory access.
Therefore, the EdgeCNN of this paper is designed for edge computing devices
with low memory access speed and low computing resources. EdgeCNN has been run
successfully on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ at a speed of 1.37 frames per second. The
accuracy of facial expression classification for the FER-2013 and RAF-DB
datasets outperforms other proposed networks that are compatible with the

connected and widespread across condensed matter. The first refers to the
inability of a system to satisfy competing interactions in the presence of
spatial constraints. The second, in its more general sense, represents a
prescription for the minimization of the topological charges in a constrained
system. Both can lead to manifolds of high susceptibility and non-trivial,
constrained disorder where exotic behaviors can appear and even be designed
deliberately. In this Colloquium, we describe the emergence of geometric
frustration and the ice rule in soft condensed matter. This Review excludes the
extensive developments of mathematical physics within the field of geometric
frustration, but rather focuses on systems of confined micro- or mesoscopic
particles that emerge as a novel paradigm exhibiting spin degrees of freedom.
In such systems, geometric frustration can be engineered artificially by
controlling the spatial topology and geometry of the lattice, the position of
the individual particle units, or their relative filling fraction. These
capabilities enable the creation of novel and exotic phases of matter, and also
potentially lead towards technological applications related to memory and logic
devices that are based on the motion of topological defects. We review the
rapid progress in theory and experiments and discuss the intimate physical
connections with other frustrated systems at different length scales.

NP-hard. Consequently, there is an ongoing research effort to devise efficient
heuristics. The majority of heuristics have been developed for the constrained
sample mean problem that assumes a solution of predefined length. In contrast,
research on the unconstrained sample mean problem is underdeveloped. In this
article, we propose a generic average-compress (AC) algorithm for solving the
unconstrained problem. The algorithm alternates between averaging (A-step) and
compression (C-step). The A-step takes an initial guess as input and returns an
approximation of a sample mean. Then the C-step reduces the length of the
approximate solution. The compressed approximation serves as initial guess of
the A-step in the next iteration. The purpose of the C-step is to direct the
algorithm to more promising solutions of shorter length. The proposed algorithm
is generic in the sense that any averaging and any compression method can be

investigated the stress dependence and the irreversible reduction of the

ranging between 16 T and 19 T on wires that were resin-impregnated similarly to
the wires in the Rutherford cables of accelerator magnets. The scope was to
predict the degradation of the cable under stress from a single-wire

defined as the stress level corresponding to a permanent reduction of the
critical current by 5$\%$ with respect to its initial value, was found to
depend on the applied magnetic field. This observation allowed us to shed light

Methods: We carry out an updated simulation of TESS detections in the southern

this simulation to cover the expected Year 4 of the mission when TESS will

energies guided by a complete and minimal chiral Lagrangian up to
next-to-leading order. It is pointed out that beyond the well-known
leading-order term, there is only one contribution at next-to-leading order.
This contribution is flavor symmetric. Therefore the corresponding low-energy
constant can be determined in any strangeness sector. As functions of this
low-energy constant, we calculate the decay widths and Dalitz distributions for
the decays of decuplet baryons to octet baryons, pions, and photons and for the
weak decay of the Omega baryon to a cascade baryon, an electron, and an
anti-neutrino.

  Approximation Theorem",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We present a numerical scheme for computation of Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) weights, which stems from the Universal Approximation Theorem, avoiding
laborious iterations. The proposed algorithm adheres to the underlying theory,
is highly fast, and results in remarkably low errors when applied for
regression and classification of complex data-sets, such as the Griewank
function of multiple variables $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{100}$ with random
noise addition, and MNIST database for handwritten digits recognition, with
$7\times10^4$ images. The same mathematical formulation is found capable of
approximating highly nonlinear functions in multiple dimensions, with low
errors (e.g. $10^{-10}$) for the test-set of the unknown functions, their
higher-order partial derivatives, as well as numerically solving Partial
Differential Equations. The method is based on the calculation of the weights
of each neuron in small neighborhoods of the data, such that the corresponding
local approximation matrix is invertible. Accordingly, optimization of
hyperparameters is not necessary, as the number of neurons stems directly from
the dimensionality of the data, further improving the algorithmic speed. Under
this setting, overfitting is inherently avoided, and the results are
interpretable and reproducible. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is of
class P with
$\mathcal{O}(mn^2)+\mathcal{O}(\frac{m^3}{n^2})-\mathcal{O}(\log(n+1))$
computing time, with respect to the observations $m$ and features $n$, in
contrast with the NP-Complete class of standard algorithms for ANN training.
The performance of the method is high, irrespective of the size of the dataset,
and the test-set errors are similar or smaller than the training errors,
indicating the generalization efficiency of the algorithm.

(DM) identify solution(s) of interest (SOI) achieving satisfactory trade-offs
among multiple conflicting criteria. This can be realised by leveraging DM's
preference information in evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO). No
consensus has been reached on the effectiveness brought by incorporating
preference in EMO (either a priori or interactively) versus a posteriori
decision making after a complete run of an EMO algorithm. Bearing this
consideration in mind, this paper i) provides a pragmatic overview of the
existing developments of preference-based EMO; and ii) conducts a series of
experiments to investigate the effectiveness brought by preference
incorporation in EMO for approximating various SOI. In particular, the DM's
preference information is elicited as a reference point, which represents
her/his aspirations for different objectives. Experimental results demonstrate
that preference incorporation in EMO does not always lead to a desirable
approximation of SOI if the DM's preference information is not well utilised,
nor does the DM elicit invalid preference information, which is not uncommon
when encountering a black-box system. To a certain extent, this issue can be
remedied through an interactive preference elicitation. Last but not the least,
we find that a preference-based EMO algorithm is able to be generalised to
approximate the whole PF given an appropriate setup of preference information.

the prompt escape into the interplanetary medium of flare-accelerated particles
produced by solar eruptive events. According to the standard model for such
events, however, particles accelerated by the flare reconnection should remain
trapped in the flux rope comprising the coronal mass ejection. The particles
should reach the Earth only much later, along with the bulk ejecta. To resolve
this paradox, we have extended our previous axisymmetric model for the escape
of flare-accelerated particles to fully three-dimensional (3D) geometries. We
report the results of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal system that
consists of a bipolar active region embedded in a background global dipole
field structured by solar wind. Our simulations show that multiple magnetic
reconnection episodes occur prior to and during the CME eruption and its
interplanetary propagation. In addition to the episodes that build up the flux
rope, reconnection between the open field and the CME couples the closed corona
to the open interplanetary field. Flare-accelerated particles initially trapped
in the CME thereby gain access to the open interplanetary field along a trail
blazed by magnetic reconnection. A key difference between these 3D results and
our previous calculations is that the interchange reconnection allows
accelerated particles to escape from deep within the CME flux-rope. We estimate
the spatial extent of the particle-escape channels. The relative timings
between flare acceleration and release of the energetic particles through
CME/open-field coupling are also determined. All our results compare favourably

the benefits of deep reinforcement learning for high-level decision making
requires special architectures to deal with multiple variable-length sequences
of different object types, such as vehicles, lanes or traffic signs. At the
same time, the architecture has to be able to cover interactions between
traffic participants in order to find the optimal action to be taken. In this

optimization accounting for linearized buckling criteria. The method relies on
the use of preconditioned iterative solvers for all the systems involved in the

modes from a coarse discretization. The strategy shows three main benefits:
first, the computational cost for the eigenvalue analyses is drastically cut.
Second, artifacts due to local stress concentrations are alleviated when
computing modes on the coarse scale. Third, the ability to select a reduced set
of important global modes and filter out less important local ones. As a
result, designs with improved buckling resistance can be generated with a
computational cost little more than that of a corresponding compliance
minimization problem solved for multiple loading cases. Examples of 2D and 3D
structures discretized by up to some millions of degrees of freedom are solved

post--processing procedure is suggested in order to reinforce the optimized

of samples with pixel-level labels, which becomes the major difficulty in their
real-world applications. To reduce the labeling cost, unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) approaches are proposed to transfer knowledge from labeled
synthesized datasets to unlabeled real-world datasets. Recently, some
semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. One of the most popular approaches in
semi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method. However, when
applying the entropy minimization to UDA for semantic segmentation, the
gradient of the entropy is biased towards samples that are easy to transfer. To
balance the gradient of well-classified target samples, we propose the maximum
squares loss. Our maximum squares loss prevents the training process being
dominated by easy-to-transfer samples in the target domain. Besides, we
introduce the image-wise weighting ratio to alleviate the class imbalance in
the unlabeled target domain. Both synthetic-to-real and cross-city adaptation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The code is

However, establishing fabrication processes to shape a new material into the

networks with output being regression. Such networks take high dimensional
input image data, and they produce affordances such as the curvature of the

by allowing a neural network prediction to deviate from the label with
tolerance $\Delta$. The source of tolerance can be either contractual or from
limiting factors where two entities may label the same data with slightly
different numerical values. The tolerance motivates the use of a non-standard
loss function where the loss is set to $0$ so long as the prediction-to-label
distance is less than $\Delta$. We further extend the loss function and define
a new provably robust criterion that is parametric to the allowed output
tolerance $\Delta$, the layer index $\tilde{l}$ where perturbation is
considered, and the maximum perturbation amount $\kappa$. During training, the
robust loss is computed by first propagating symbolic errors from the
$\tilde{l}$-th layer (with quantity bounded by $\kappa$) to the output layer,
followed by computing the overflow between the error bounds and the allowed
tolerance. The overall concept is experimented in engineering a direct

with thermal winds, driven by X-ray irradiation of the outer accretion disc.
Thermal winds produce mass outflow rates that can exceed the accretion rate in
the disc. We study the impact of this mass loss on the stability and
lightcurves of X-ray binaries subject to the thermal-viscous instability, which
drives their outbursts. Strong mass loss could shut off outbursts early, as
proposed for the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg. We use an analytical model for
thermal (Compton) wind mass loss. Scattering in the strong wind expected of
long Porb systems enhances the irradiation heating of the outer disc, keeping
it stable against the thermal-viscous instability. This accounts very well for
the existence of persistently bright systems with large discs such as Cyg X-2,
1E 1740.7-2942, or GRS 1758-258. Wind mass loss shortens the outburst, as
expected, but insufficiently to explain the rapid decay timescale of black hole
X-ray binary outbursts. However, varying irradiation due to scattering in the
wind produces lightcurves with plateaus in long Porb systems like GRO J1655-40.
Mass loss is not a major driver for the outburst dynamics up to luminosities
0.1-0.2 L_Edd. Higher luminosities may produce stronger mass loss but their
study is complicated since the wind becomes opaque. Magnetic winds seem more
promising to explain the fast decay timescales generically seen in black hole
X-ray binaries. Thermal winds can play an important role in the outburst
dynamics through the varying irradiation heating. This may be evidenced by
relating changes in wind properties, X-ray spectra or luminosity, with changes
in the optical emission that traces the outer disc. Simulations should enable
more accurate estimates of the dependence of the irradiation onto the disc as a
function of irradiation spectrum, radius and disc wind properties.

selection/mutation mechanism. However, the associated selection functions and
mutation kernels usually depend on tuning parameters that are of first
importance for the efficiency of the algorithm. A standard way to address this
problem is to apply Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) methods, which
consist in exploiting the information given by the history of the sample to
tune the parameters. This article is concerned with variance estimation in such
ASMC methods. Specifically, we focus on the case where the asymptotic variance
coincides with the one of the ""limiting"" Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm as
defined by Beskos et al. (2016). We prove that, under natural assumptions, the
estimator introduced by Lee and Whiteley (2018) in the nonadaptive case (i.e.,
SMC) is also a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance for ASMC
methods. To do this, we introduce a new estimator that is expressed in terms of
coalescent tree-based measures, and explain its connection with the previous
one. Our estimator is constructed by tracing the genealogy of the associated
Interacting Particle System. The tools we use connect the study of Particle
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and the variance estimation problem in SMC
methods. As such, they may give some new insights when dealing with complex
genealogy-involved problems of Interacting Particle Systems in more general
scenarios.

dense images can enhance sparse point clouds. However, fusion is challenging
because 2D and 3D data live in different spaces. In this work, we propose
MVPNet (Multi-View PointNet), where we aggregate 2D multi-view image features
into 3D point clouds, and then use a point based network to fuse the features
in 3D canonical space to predict 3D semantic labels. To this end, we introduce
view selection along with a 2D-3D feature aggregation module. Extensive
experiments show the benefit of leveraging features from dense images and
reveal superior robustness to varying point cloud density compared to 3D-only
methods. On the ScanNetV2 benchmark, our MVPNet significantly outperforms prior
point cloud based approaches on the task of 3D Semantic Segmentation. It is
much faster to train than the large networks of the sparse voxel approach. We
provide solid ablation studies to ease the future design of 2D-3D fusion
methods and their extension to other tasks, as we showcase for 3D instance
segmentation.

state-transition systems with inputs and outputs, such as ioco and uioco in the
area of model-based testing, and alternating simulation and alternating-trace
containment originating from game theory and formal verification. Several
papers have compared these independently developed relations, but these
comparisons make assumptions (e.g., input-enabledness), pose restrictions
(e.g., determinism - then they all coincide), use different models (e.g.,
interface automata and Kripke structures), or do not deal with the concept of
quiescence. In this paper, we present the integration of the ioco/uioco theory
of model-based testing and the theory of alternating refinements, within the
domain of non-deterministic, non-input-enabled interface automata. A standing
conjecture is that ioco and alternating-trace containment coincide. Our main
result is that this conjecture does not hold, but that uioco coincides with a
variant of alternating-trace containment, for image finite interface automata
and with explicit treatment of quiescence. From the comparison between ioco
theory and alternating refinements, we conclude that ioco and the original
relation of alternating-trace containment are too strong for realistic
black-box scenarios. We present a refinement relation which can express both
uioco and refinement in game theory, while being simpler and having a clearer
observational interpretation.

objective is to jointly select the quantizers and synthesize the controller to
strike an optimal balance between control performance and quantization cost.
When the innovation signal is quantized instead of the measurement, the problem
is decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller
synthesis, and the other for optimal quantizer selection. The optimal
controller is found by solving a Riccati equation and the optimal quantizer
selection policy is found by solving a linear program (LP)- both of which can

we are able to reason about the effect of a single feature on an output

give a degradation of around 55% from the pristine value at room temperature.
Using a kinetic theory model, the density of irradiation-induced point defects
is estimated based on the measured changes in thermal diffusivity as a function
of dose. These predictions are compared with point defect and dislocation loop
densities observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Molecular
dynamics (MD) predictions are combined with the TEM observations to estimate
the density of point defects associated with defect clusters too small to be
probed by TEM. When these ""invisible"" defects are accounted for, the total
point defect density agrees well with that estimated from TGS for a range of
doses spanning 3 orders of magnitude. Kinetic theory modelling is also used to
estimate the thermal diffusivity degradation expected due to TEM-visible and
invisible defects. Finely distributed invisible defects appear to play a much
more important role in the thermal diffusivity reduction than larger
TEM-visible dislocation loops. This work demonstrates the capability of TGS, in
conjunction with kinetic theory models, to provide rapid, quantitative insight

important topic in the research of complex system. Numerous existing
vulnerability measures have been proposed to solve such problems, however, most
of these methods have their own shortcomings and limitations. Therefore, a new
entropy-based approach is proposed in this paper to address such problems. This
measure combines the internal factors and external factors for each communities
which can give the quantitative description of vulnerability of community. The
internal factors contain the complexity degree of community and the number of
edges inside the community, and the external factors contain the similarity
degree between chosen community and other communities and the number of nodes
outside the community. Considering community vulnerability from the perspective
of entropy provides a new solution to such problem. Due to sufficient
consideration of community information, more reasonable vulnerability result
can be obtained. In order to show the performance and effectiveness of this
proposed method, one example network and three real-world complex network is
used to compare with some exiting methods, and the sensitivity of weight
factors is analysed by Sobol' indices. The experiment results demonstrate the
reasonableness and superiority of this proposed method.

spherical and cylindrical core-shell nanostructures, we demonstrate that the
resonant infrared absorption can be not only very efficient, i.e., with the
absorption cross sections exceeding geometrical ones, but also broadband with
the spectral width being of the order of the resonant wavelength. We obtain
simple analytical expressions for the absorption resonances in spherical and

analyses over experimental results. We demonstrate PlanAlyzer's utility on a

has attracted much attention in recent years because of low-cost and desired
photocatalytic performance characteristics such as high charge separation
efficiency and broad visible light absorption. In this study, we used
time-dependent density functional theory and wave function analysis to evaluate
the charge separation characteristics of phosphorus-, oxygen- and sulfur-doped
g-C3N4 upon photon excitation based on electron-hole pair distances,
electron-hole pair overlaps, and charge transfer amounts. The lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital of doped heptazine rings was shifted downward to facilitate
electron transfer from undoped to doped heptazine rings upon photon excitation.
Generally, the phosphorus dopant yielded relatively high charge transfer, high
electron-hole pair separations, and low electron-hole overlap compared with the
oxygen and sulfur dopants. In a low concentration, the sulfur dopant had the
similar performance as the phosphorus dopant did. Furthermore, the phosphorus
dopant attracted photon excited electrons, whereas the oxygen and sulfur
dopants contributed to electron-hole pair separation. The dopants concentrated
in one heptazine ring exhibited high charge separation performance than those
dopants distributed among multiple heptazine rings in g-C3N4; the simulation
results suggested that doping configurations are more crucial than doping
concentrations with respect to charge separation efficiency in nonmetal-doped

model on a D-Wave device, encoded on $L \times L$ lattices with $L \le 32$.
Analyzing the residual energy and deviation from maximal magnetization in the
final classical state, we find an optimal $L$ dependent annealing rate $v$ for
which the two quantities are minimized. The results are well described by a
phenomenological model with two powers of $v$ and $L$-dependent prefactors to
describe the competing effects of reduced quantum fluctuations (for which we
see evidence of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism) and increasing noise impact when
$v$ is lowered. The same scaling form also describes results of numerical
solutions of a transverse-field Ising model with the spins coupled to noise
sources. We explain why the optimal annealing time is much longer than the
coherence time of the individual qubits.

spatial parton distributions, is one of the main remaining challenges of modern
nuclear physics. These new parton distribution and fragmentation functions
encode the motion and the position of partons and are often referred to as
three-dimensional distributions describing the three-dimensional (3D) structure
of the nucleon. Understanding of the production mechanism and performing
phenomenological studies compatible with factorization theorems using minimal
model assumptions are goals of analysis of the experimental data. HERMES and
COMPASS Collaborations and experiments at Jefferson Lab have collected a wealth
of polarized and unpolarized Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS)
data. These data play a crucial role in current understanding of nucleon
spin-phenomena as they cover a broad kinematical range. The Jefferson Lab 12
GeV upgrade data on polarized and unpolarized SIDIS will have remarkably higher
precision at large parton fractional momentum $x$ compared to the existing
data. We argue that both experimental and phenomenological communities will
benefit from development of a comprehensive extraction framework that will
facilitate extraction of 3D nucleon structure, help understand various
assumptions in extraction and data analysis, help to insure the model
independence of the experimental data and validate the extracted functions. In
this review we present the latest developments in the field of the spin
asymmetries and discuss different components involved in precision extraction

illustrate the performance of the new method on two distinct datasets and show
that it is robust to missing values and, at the same time, provides results

applications. This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an
IoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The
crowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area
using the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi
probe request packets (""Wi-Fi probes"" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices
to solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd
size may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental
uncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation.
Moreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals
is time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors,
stereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified
calibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the
crowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd
estimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities.
Then, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different
stakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To
verify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the
Wellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch
Re:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that
stereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85\% and high precision
detection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration
algorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the
Wi-Fi-only approach.

non-native spoken English data in this paper. The data used for speaker
enrolment and verification is mainly taken from the BULATS test, which assesses
English language skills for business. Performance of systems trained on
relatively limited amounts of BULATS data, and standard large speaker
verification corpora, is compared. Experimental results on large-scale test
sets with millions of trials show that the best performance is achieved by
adapting the imported model to non-native data. Breakdown of impostor trials
across different first languages (L1s) and grades is analysed, which shows that
inter-L1 impostors are more challenging for speaker verification systems.

take into account the increasing magnitude of processes operating in human

feedback entanglement with those in the physical, chemical and biological
systems of the planet. However, current state-of-the-art Earth System Models do
not represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the
biogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic Integrated Assessment Models
typically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design
principles for constructing World-Earth Models (WEM) for Earth system analysis
of the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (World) - ecological (Earth)
co-evolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open
simulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs
based on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to
flexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g. carbon
cycle dynamics), socio-metabolic/economic (e.g. economic growth) and
socio-cultural processes (e.g. voting on climate policies or changing social
norms) and their feedback interactions, and are based on elementary entity
types, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the
epistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of
the Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and
methodologies used for describing socio-metabolic/economic and socio-cultural
processes in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought. To
illustrate the capabilities of the framework, we present an exemplary and
highly stylized WEM implemented in copan:CORE that illustrates how endogenizing
socio-cultural processes and feedbacks could fundamentally change macroscopic

associated with daytime lighting conditions do not hold any longer. Nighttime
is not only about low-light and dense noise, but also about glow/glare, flares,
non-uniform distribution of light, etc. One of the possible solutions is to
train a network on night stereo images in a fully supervised manner. However,
to obtain proper disparity ground-truths that are dense, independent from
glare/glow, and have sufficiently far depth ranges is extremely intractable. To
address the problem, we introduce a network joining day/night translation and
stereo. In training the network, our method does not require ground-truth
disparities of the night images, or paired day/night images. We utilize a
translation network that can render realistic night stereo images from day
stereo images. We then train a stereo network on the rendered night stereo
images using the available disparity supervision from the corresponding day
stereo images, and simultaneously also train the day/night translation network.
We handle the fake depth problem, which occurs due to the unsupervised/unpaired
translation, for light effects (e.g., glow/glare) and uninformative regions
(e.g., low-light and saturated regions), by adding structure-preservation and
weighted-smoothness constraints. Our experiments show that our method
outperforms the baseline methods on night images.

search phase which increases the training complexity and may substantially
increase the computational cost. Additionally, due to the separate search
phase, these approaches are unable to adjust the regularization strength based
on model or dataset size. Automated augmentation policies are often found by
training small models on small datasets and subsequently applied to train
larger models. In this work, we remove both of these obstacles. RandAugment has
a significantly reduced search space which allows it to be trained on the
target task with no need for a separate proxy task. Furthermore, due to the
parameterization, the regularization strength may be tailored to different

agent makes decisions of whether to stop or continue and what to report at each
period. The principal, on the other hand, chooses decision rules consisting of
an allocation rule and a set of payment rules to maximize her ex-ante expected
payoff. In order to influence the agent's stopping decision, one of the
terminal payment rules is posted-price, i.e., it depends only on the realized
stopping time of the agent. We define the incentive compatibility in this
dynamic environment in terms of Bellman equations, which is then simplified by
establishing a one-shot deviation principle. Given the optimality of the
stopping rule, a sufficient condition for incentive compatibility is obtained
by constructing the state-dependent payment rules in terms of a set of
functions parameterized by the allocation rule. A necessary condition is
derived from envelope theorem, which explicitly formulates the state-dependent
payment rules in terms of allocation rules. A class of monotone environment is
considered to characterize the optimal stopping by a threshold rule. The
posted-price payment rules are then pinned down in terms of the allocation rule
and the threshold function up to a constant. The incentive compatibility
constraints restrict the design of the posted-price payment rule by a regular
condition.

  clustering for security analytics",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays processing of Big Security Data, such as log messages, is commonly
used for intrusion detection purposed. Its heterogeneous nature, as well as
combination of numerical and categorical attributes does not allow to apply the
existing data mining methods directly on the data without feature
preprocessing. Therefore, a rather computationally expensive conversion of
categorical attributes into vector space should be utilised for analysis of
such data. However, a well-known k-modes algorithm allows to cluster the
categorical data directly and avoid conversion into the vector space. The
existing implementations of k-modes for Big Data processing are ensemble-based
and utilise two-step clustering, where data subsets are first clustered
independently, whereas the resulting cluster modes are clustered again in order
to calculate metamodes valid for all data subsets. In this paper, the novel
frequency-based distance function is proposed for the second step of
ensemble-based k-modes clustering. Besides this, the existing feature
discretisation method from the previous work is utilised in order to adapt
k-modes for processing of mixed data sets. The resulting k-metamodes algorithm
was tested on two public security data sets and reached higher effectiveness in
comparison with the previous work.

architecture called IPC-Net to improve the state-of-the-art point cloud

allowing the model to produce more accurate segmentations compared to the
PointNet architecture. In general, our approach outperforms PointNet on every

Euclidean DSF have been stated for $d=2$ and conjectured for $d \ge 3$ (see
further): it should be a tree for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and a countable union of
disjoint trees for $d \ge 4$. Moreover, it should not contain bi-infinite
branches whatever the dimension $d$. In this paper, we construct the Hyperbolic
Directed Spanning Forest (HDSF) and we give a complete description of its
topological properties, which are radically different from the Euclidean case.
Indeed, for any dimension, the hyperbolic DSF is a tree containing infinitely
many bi-infinite branches, whose asymptotic directions are investigated. The
strategy of our proofs consists in exploiting the Mass Transport Principle,
which is adapted to take advantage of the invariance by isometries. Using
appropriate mass transports is the key to carry over the hyperbolic setting
ideas developed in percolation and for spanning forests. This strategy provides
an upper-bound for horizontal fluctuations of trajectories, which is the key
point of the proofs. To obtain the latter, we exploit the representation of the
forest in the hyperbolic half space.

different categories. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduled adaptive
maximum-margin (SAM) formulation that infers triplet-specific constraints
during training, therefore organising instances by adaptively enforcing
inter-category and inter-modality correlations. This is supported by a
scheduled adaptive margin function, that is smoothly activated, replacing a
static margin by an adaptively inferred one reflecting triplet-specific
semantic correlations while accounting for the incremental learning behaviour
of neural networks to enforce category cluster formation and enforcement.

allow the broader community to test new ideas at the bottom of the market,
creating new capabilities which find their way to larger missions. Currently,
NASA Astrophysics does not provide flight opportunities that would allow
technology maturation of instrument systems or concepts of operations. Without
flight opportunities to mature technologies, missions hosted on SmallSats are
likely to be considered high risk, and face long odds being selected for

after the Earth Sciences InVEST call. Such AO would help reduce the new
technology risk for science missions of any size. We also suggest that NASA
provides additional science-driven SmallSat opportunities at the ~$12M funding

re-structures the solicitation AOs so that SmallSats do not compete with other

from statistical physics: (a) moment closure, (b) pair approximation of
adaptive network processes, and (c) thermodynamic limit of the resulting
stochastic process. As an example of use, we develop a stochastic agent-based
model with heterogeneous households that invest in either a fossil-fuel or
renewables-based sector while allocating labor on a competitive market. Using
the adaptive voter model, the model describes agents as social learners that
interact on a dynamic network. We apply the approximation methods to derive a
set of ordinary differential equations that approximate the macro-dynamics of
the model. A comparison of the reduced analytical model with numerical
simulations shows that the approximation fits well for a wide range of
parameters. The proposed method makes it possible to use analytical tools to
better understand the dynamical properties of models with heterogeneous agents
on adaptive networks. We showcase this with a bifurcation analysis that
identifies parameter ranges with multi-stabilities. The method can thus help to
explain emergent phenomena from network interactions and make them
mathematically traceable.

Dante, a multiscale flu forecasting model that learns rather than prescribes
spatial, temporal, and surveillance data structure. Forecasts at the Health and
Human Services (HHS) regional and national scales are generated as linear
combinations of state forecasts with weights proportional to US Census
population estimates, resulting in coherent forecasts across nested geographic
scales. We retrospectively compare Dante's short-term and seasonal forecasts at
the state, regional, and national scales for the 2012 through 2017 flu seasons
in the US to the Dynamic Bayesian Model (DBM), a leading flu forecasting model.
Dante outperformed DBM for nearly all spatial units, flu seasons, geographic
scales, and forecasting targets. The improved performance is due to Dante
making forecasts, especially short-term forecasts, more confidently and
accurately than DBM, suggesting Dante's improved forecast scores will also
translate to more useful forecasts for the public health sector. Dante

computationally efficient alternative to solve conjugate heat transfer between
a fluid and a solid, accompanied by phase change in some constituents of the
solid phase. In the model presented here it is assumed that the solid can be
represented as an homogeneous medium, with its thermophysical properties
depending on the temperature. The impingement freezing model is conceived to be
valid for highly processed vegetarians products or meat such as sausages, mince
or ham freezing. Furthermore, this approach is much simpler in terms of
computational cost whilst it still captures the complexity of continuous
freezing under industrial setting. The methodology is implemented as a new
solver in the widely used open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
library OpenFOAM. Overall, highly non-linear freezing behaviour was found due
to the phase change inside the solid and the associated heat of fusion. We
studied the effect of high fluid Reynolds numbers as well as investigating the
optimal distance between the jet and the solid surface for different speeds of
the conveyor. We found that the maximum freezing is obtained positioning the
jet at a distance H = 7.2D (where D is the diameter of the impinging jet) and
setting the speed of the conveyor such that the P\'eclet number of the solid is
$\text{Pe}_{\text{s}}=8244$. The methodology developed allows to obtain

$1$-ipms more generally. We give two lower bounds on $p_{\star}$ that
significantly improve on the previous bounds. Furthermore, motivated by the
Russo--Seymour--Welsh lemmas, we define a $1$-independent critical probability
for long paths and determine its value for the line and ladder lattices.
Finally, for finite graphs $G$ we study $f_{1,G}(p)$ (respectively
$F_{1,G}(p)$), the infimum (resp. supremum) over all $\mu\in
\mathcal{M}_{1,\geqslant p}(G)$ (resp. all $\mu \in \mathcal{M}_{1,\leqslant
p}(G)$) of the probability that $\mathbf{G}_{\mu}$ is connected. We determine
$f_{1,G}(p)$ and $F_{1,G}(p)$ exactly when $G$ is a path, a complete graph and
a cycle of length at most $5$.
  Many new problems arise from our work, which are discussed in the final
section of the paper.

The block-structured domain partitioning is flexible enough to handle complex

unprecedented replicability crisis which uncovered several issues. Among
others, statistical inference is too often viewed as an isolated procedure
limited to the analysis of data that have already been collected. We build on
and further develop an idea proposed by Gelman and Carlin (2014) termed
""prospective and retrospective design analysis"". Rather than focusing only on
the statistical significance of a result and on the classical control of type I
and type II errors, a comprehensive design analysis involves reasoning about
what can be considered a plausible effect size. Furthermore, it introduces two
relevant inferential risks: the exaggeration ratio or Type M error (i.e., the
predictable average overestimation of an effect that emerges as statistically
significant), and the sign error or Type S error (i.e., the risk that a
statistically significant effect is estimated in the wrong direction). Another
important aspect of design analysis is that it can be usefully carried out both
in the planning phase of a study and for the evaluation of studies that have
already been conducted, thus increasing researchers' awareness during all
phases of a research project. We use a familiar example in psychology where the
researcher is interested in analyzing the differences between two independent
groups. We examine the case in which the plausible effect size is formalized as
a single value, and propose a method in which uncertainty concerning the
magnitude of the effect is formalized via probability distributions. Through
several examples, we show that even though a design analysis requires big
effort, it has the potential to contribute to planning more robust and
replicable studies. Finally, future developments in the Bayesian framework are
discussed.

generalization errors, even when powerful hierarchical representation models
based on convolutional neural networks have been employed. This could be
attributed to limited training data and large distribution gap in train and
test domain datasets. In this paper, we propose a multi-level self-supervised
learning model for domain adaptation of semantic segmentation. Exploiting the
idea that an object (and most of the stuff given context) should be labeled
consistently regardless of its location, we generate spatially independent and
semantically consistent (SISC) pseudo-labels by segmenting multiple sub-images
using base model and designing an aggregation strategy. Image level pseudo
weak-labels, PWL, are computed to guide domain adaptation by capturing global
context similarity in source and domain at latent space level. Thus helping
latent space learn the representation even when there are very few pixels
belonging to the domain category (small object for example) compared to rest of
the image. Our multi-level Self-supervised learning (MLSL) outperforms existing
state-of art (self or adversarial learning) algorithms. Specifically, keeping
all setting similar and employing MLSL we obtain an mIoU gain of 5:1% on GTA-V
to Cityscapes adaptation and 4:3% on SYNTHIA to Cityscapes adaptation compared
to existing state-of-art method.

with internal states that evolve with linear stochastic dynamics using a finite
set of mobile agents. We approach the problem from the infinite-horizon
perspective, looking for periodic movement schedules for the agents. Under
linear dynamics and some standard assumptions on the noise distribution, the
optimal estimator is a Kalman-Bucy filter and the mean estimation error is a
function of its covariance matrix, which evolves as a differential Riccati
equation. It is shown that when the agents are constrained to move only over a
line and they can see at most one target at a time, the movement policy that
minimizes the mean estimation error over time is such that the agent is always
either moving with maximum speed or dwelling at a fixed position. This type of
trajectory can be fully defined by a finite set of parameters. For periodic
trajectories, under some observability conditions, the estimation error
converges to a steady state condition and the stochastic gradient estimate of
the cost with respect to the trajectory parameters of each agent and the global
period can be explicitly computed using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis. A
gradient-descent approach is used to compute locally optimal parameters. This
approach allows us to deal with a very long persistent monitoring horizon using
a small number of parameters.

correlation function $C(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)$ of the coherent pion emission,
whether the coherent source is expanding or static. The onset of this
long-range azimuthal correlation can be traced back to the asymmetric initial
transverse profile of the coherent source, owing to the interference in
coherent emission. We further construct a partially coherent pion-emitting
source by incorporating a chaotic emission component. From the experimental
data of the two-pion Hanbury-Brown-Twiss correlations in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}\!=\!7\,$TeV, we extract a coherent fraction of pion emission, which
increases with increasing charged-particle multiplicity, as an input of the
partially coherent source model. The ridge structure is observed in the
correlation function $C(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)$ for the partially coherent

the larger degrees of coherence. The results in this work are meaningful for
fully understanding the collectivity in the small system of pp collisions.

The key idea is to augment the original labeled dataset with unlabeled data
paired with the model's prediction (i.e. the pseudo-parallel data). While
self-training has been extensively studied on classification problems, in
complex sequence generation tasks (e.g. machine translation) it is still
unclear how self-training works due to the compositionality of the target
space. In this work, we first empirically show that self-training is able to
decently improve the supervised baseline on neural sequence generation tasks.
Through careful examination of the performance gains, we find that the
perturbation on the hidden states (i.e. dropout) is critical for self-training
to benefit from the pseudo-parallel data, which acts as a regularizer and
forces the model to yield close predictions for similar unlabeled inputs. Such
effect helps the model correct some incorrect predictions on unlabeled data. To
further encourage this mechanism, we propose to inject noise to the input
space, resulting in a ""noisy"" version of self-training. Empirical study on
standard machine translation and text summarization benchmarks shows that noisy
self-training is able to effectively utilize unlabeled data and improve the
performance of the supervised baseline by a large margin.

exponent s, with 1 < s < 3, so that the energy density is finite, but s is
small enough to observe genuine long-range effects. The analytic solutions are
obtained by introducing an ansatz for the dependence of the field on space and

can be explicitly solved. The solutions are initially localized and they
delocalize progressively as time evolves. Depending on the value of s the

nonlinearity, non-Gaussianity and model uncertainty. For this problem, the
Bayesian model averaged particle filter (BMAPF) is perhaps one of the most
efficient solutions. Major advances of BMAPF have been made, while it still
lacks a generic and practical approach to design the model set. This paper
fills in this gap by proposing a generic data-driven method for BMAPF model set
design. Unlike existent methods, the proposed solution does not require any
prior knowledge on the parameter value of the true model; it only assumes that
a small number of noisy observations are pre-obtained. The Bayesian
optimization (BO) method is adapted to search the model components, each of
which is associated with a specific segment of the pre-obtained dataset.The
average performance of these model components is guaranteed since each one's
parameter value is elaborately tuned via BO to maximize the marginal
likelihood. The diversity in the model components is also ensured, as different
components match the different segments of the pre-obtained dataset,
respectively. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

relying on a priori knowledge of the imaging point spread function (PSF)
coupled to sparsity priors on the object to image can provide super-resolution
in photoacoustic (PA) or in ultrasound (US) imaging. Here, we experimentally
show that such reconstruction also leads to super-resolution in both PA and US
imaging with arrays having much less elements than used conventionally (sparse
arrays). As a proof of concept, we obtained super-resolution PA and US
cross-sectional images of microfluidic channels with only 8 elements of a
128-elements linear array using a reconstruction approach based on a linear
propagation forward model and assuming sparsity of the imaged structure.
Although the microchannels appear indistinguishable in the conventional
delay-and-sum images obtained with all the 128 transducer elements, the applied
sparsity-constrained model-based reconstruction provides super-resolution with
down to only 8 elements. We also report simulation results showing that the
minimal number of transducer elements required to obtain a correct
reconstruction is fundamentally limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. The
proposed method can be straigthforwardly applied to any transducer geometry,
including 2D sparse arrays for 3D super-resolution PA and US imaging.

meet the tremendous increase in mobile data traffic, a new design consuming
less memory for the FDA-DM-based PLS transmission is urgently demanded. In this
paper, an analytical symmetrical multi-carrier FDA model is proposed in three
dimensions, namely, range, azimuth angle, and elevation angle, which differs
from the conventional analytical approach with only range and azimuth angle
considered. Then, a single-point (SP) artificial noise (AN) aided FDA-DM scheme
is proposed, which reduces memory consumption of FDA-DM systems significantly
compared with the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) and singular value
decomposition (SVD) approaches. Moreover, the PLS performance of the proposed
low-memory-consumption FDA-DM scheme is analyzed in fluctuating two-ray (FTR)
fading channels for the first time, including bit error rate (BER), secrecy
rate (SR), and secrecy outage probability (SOP). More importantly, the
closed-form expressions for the lower bound of the average SR and the upper
bound of the SOP are derived, respectively. The effectiveness of the analytical
expressions is verified by numerical simulations. This work opens a way to
lower the memory requirements for the DM-based PLS transmission of 5G and

the Bag constant. To check the physical acceptability and stability of the
stellar system based on the obtained solutions, we have performed various
physical tests. It is shown that the model satisfies all the stability
criteria, including nonsingular nature of the density and pressure, implies
stable nature. Here, the Bag constant for different strange star candidates are

the properties of different black hole models, especially their behavior under
(axial) gravitational perturbation. Here, we study the quasinormal modes of
black holes in Weyl gravity. We derive the master equation describing the
quasinormal radiation by using a relation between the Schwarzschild-anti de
Sitter black holes and Weyl solutions, and also the conformal invariance
property of the Weyl action. It will be observed that the quasinormal mode
spectra of the Weyl solutions deviate from those of the Schwarzschild black
hole due to the presence of an additional linear $r$-term in the metric
function. We also consider the evolution of the Maxwell field on the background
spacetime and obtain the master equation of electromagnetic perturbations.
Then, we use the WKB approximation and asymptotic iteration method to calculate
the quasinormal frequencies. Finally, the time evolution of modes is studied
through the time-domain integration of the master equation.

the flux cannot be separately conserved in any of these spaces individually.
Then objects propagating in a vicinity of a wormhole in one space must feel
influence of objects propagating in the other space. We show this in the cases
of the scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field. The case of gravity is
perhaps the most interesting. Namely, by studying the orbits of stars around
the black hole at the center of our galaxy, we could soon tell if this black
hole harbors a traversable wormhole. In particular, with a near future
acceleration precision of $10^{-6} m/s^2$, a few solar masses star orbiting
around Sgr A* on the other side of the wormhole at the distance of a few
gravitational radii would leave detectable imprint on the orbit of the S2 star
on our side. Alternatively, one can expect the same effect in black hole binary
systems, or a black hole - star binary systems. Another result that we find
very interesting is that gravitational perturbations can be felt even on the
other side of the non-traversable wormhole.

sample consists of a randomly selected vertex (the star center) and its

is either the expected number of samples (unit cost) or the expected number of
star centers plus star points (linear cost) until a vertex in the target set is

expected unit and linear costs of SSR, SSC, and SSS on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER)

better than SSR under unit cost for low-density ER graphs, while SSS is notably
better than SSR/SSC under linear cost for low- to moderate-density ER graphs.
Simulations on twelve ""real-world"" graphs shows the cost approximations to be
of variable quality: the SSR and SSC approximations are uniformly accurate,

NewHope is a promising key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the

indistinguishability (IND)-chosen ciphertext attack secure KEM by applying the
Fujisaki-Okamoto transform to an IND-chosen plaintext attack secure public key
encryption, accurate calculation of decryption failure rate (DFR) is required
to guarantee resilience against attacks that exploit decryption failures.
However, the current upper bound of DFR on NewHope is rather loose because the
compression noise, the effect of encoding/decoding of NewHope, and the
approximation effect of centered binomial distribution are not fully
considered. Furthermore, since NewHope is a Ring-LWE based cryptosystem, there
is a problem of error dependency among error coefficients, which makes accurate
DFR calculation difficult. In this paper, we derive much tighter upper bound on
DFR than the current upper bound using constraint relaxation and union bound.
Especially, the above-mentioned factors are all considered in derivation of new
upper bound and the centered binomial distribution is not approximated to
subgaussian distribution. In addition, since the error dependency is
considered, the new upper bound is much closer to the real DFR than the
previous upper bound. Furthermore, the new upper bound is parameterized by
using Chernoff-Cramer bound in order to facilitate calculation of new upper
bound for the parameters of NewHope. Since the new upper bound is much lower
than the DFR requirement of PQC, this DFR margin is used to improve the
security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope. As a result, the security level
of NewHope is improved by 7.2 % or bandwidth efficiency is improved by 5.9 %.

assessing and modelling threats in respect to cyber-physical systems. For
example, the vulnerability of individual system components can be described
using multiple factors, such as complexity, technological maturity, and the
availability of tools to aid an attack. Such information is useful for
determining attack risk, but much of it is challenging to acquire automatically
and instead must be collected through expert assessments. However, most experts
inherently carry some degree of uncertainty in their assessments. For example,
it is impossible to be certain precisely how many tools are available to aid an
attack. Traditional methods of capturing subjective judgements through choices
such as \emph{high}, \emph{medium} or \emph{low} do not enable experts to
quantify their uncertainty. However, it is important to measure the range of
uncertainty surrounding responses in order to appropriately inform system
vulnerability analysis. We use a recently introduced interval-valued
response-format to capture uncertainty in experts' judgements and employ
inferential statistical approaches to analyse the data. We identify key
attributes that contribute to hop vulnerability in cyber-systems and
demonstrate the value of capturing the uncertainty around these attributes. We
find that this uncertainty is not only predictive of uncertainty in the overall
vulnerability of a given system component, but also significantly informs
ratings of overall component vulnerability itself. We propose that these
methods and associated insights can be employed in real world situations,
including vulnerability assessments of cyber-physical systems, which are
becoming increasingly complex and integrated into society, making them
particularly susceptible to uncertainty in assessment.

it possible to take into account the influence of the relativism on the field
emission current. It is especially noted that the consideration of this
correction is necessary in the case of sufficiently strong electric fields and
relatively large interelectrode distances. It should be stressed that this
correction is valid for fixed interelectrode distances that decrease with
increasing electric field strength. It means that for the electric field
strength of 0.1 to 1 GV/m the interelectrode distance should not exceed values
of 1 to 0.1 cm. First in the article it is spoken in detail about finding of
the electron wave function. Next the field emission current calculations are
given. As a result the transmission coefficient of the potential step from the
Klein-Gordon equation within the framework of the Fowler-Nordheim approximation
is found. It is shown that in the case of the interelectrode distance less than
1 cm, an analytical expression for the field electron emission current density
is obtained. The conclusion that usually relativistic correction does not
exceed a tenth of a percent is made. But in the case of the field electron
emission from pulsars (where the work function and electric field strength are
much higher) the contribution of the relativistic correction about 10 % has

advocates a new neural architecture evaluation scheme, which aims to determine
which architecture would perform better instead of accurately predict the

\textbf{relativistic} architecture performance predictor in NAS (ReNAS). We
encode neural architectures into feature tensors, and further refining the
representations with the predictor. The proposed relativistic performance
predictor can be deployed in discrete searching methods to search for the
desired architectures without additional evaluation. Experimental results on

space) neural architectures and their corresponding validation performance is
already enough for learning an accurate architecture performance predictor. The
accuracies of our searched neural architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and

show the priority of the proposed method.

  Driver Control Model",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a new self-driving framework that uses a human driver
control model, whose feature-input values are extracted from images using deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The development of image processing
techniques using CNNs along with accelerated computing hardware has recently
enabled real-time detection of these feature-input values. The use of human
driver models can lead to more ""natural"" driving behavior of self-driving
vehicles. Specifically, we use the well-known two-point visual driver control
model as the controller, and we use a top-down lane cost map CNN and the YOLOv2
CNN to extract feature-input values. This framework relies exclusively on
inputs from low-cost sensors like a monocular camera and wheel speed sensors.
We experimentally validate the proposed framework on an outdoor track using a
1/5th-scale autonomous vehicle platform.

  and Risk",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Earthquake research in the last few decades has led to considerable advances
in seismic hazard and risk modeling across academia, industry, and government.
Technological advances such as high performance computing and visualization can
further facilitate earthquake hazard and risk research. This work utilizes the
CAVE of the Marquette Visualization Laboratory to visualize seismic hazards and
risk by integrating hazard characterization, structural modeling, and emergency
response. Building upon the framework of performance-based earthquake
engineering, site-specific ground motions, which link seismic hazards to
structural responses, serve as loading inputs to structural models. The
resulting structural responses can then be translated into damage states of
building elements in the immediate room environment based on fragility
functions. To illustrate, we display a map of the Los Angeles region with
ground motions for the Mw7.8 ShakeOut scenario, create a virtual room in a
residential building subjected to such earthquake shaking, and simulate
emergency response in this immersive environment. The illustrative
visualization can be extended to various scenarios and help communicate site-
and structure-specific hazards and risk to the general public.

behind their biological counterparts in performance, scalability, and
robustness. A distinctive hallmark of the brain is its ability to automatically
discover and model objects, at multiscale resolutions, from repeated exposures
to unlabeled contextual data and then to be able to robustly detect the learned
objects under various nonideal circumstances, such as partial occlusion and
different view angles. Replication of such capabilities in a machine would
require three key ingredients: (i) access to large-scale perceptual data of the
kind that humans experience, (ii) flexible representations of objects, and
(iii) an efficient unsupervised learning algorithm. The Internet fortunately
provides unprecedented access to vast amounts of visual data. This paper
leverages the availability of such data to develop a scalable framework for
unsupervised learning of object prototypes--brain-inspired flexible, scale, and
shift invariant representations of deformable objects (e.g., humans,
motorcycles, cars, airplanes) comprised of parts, their different
configurations and views, and their spatial relationships. Computationally, the
object prototypes are represented as geometric associative networks using
probabilistic constructs such as Markov random fields. We apply our framework
to various datasets and show that our approach is computationally scalable and
can construct accurate and operational part-aware object models much more
efficiently than in much of the recent computer vision literature. We also
present efficient algorithms for detection and localization in new scenes of
objects and their partial views.

tackle the sequential processing problem in Monkey Algorithm and simulating the
natural parallel behavior of monkeys. Therefore, a P system with active
membranes is constructed by providing a codification for Monkey Algorithm
within the context of a cell-like P system, defining accordingly the elements
of the model - membrane structure, objects, rules and the behavior of it. The
proposed algorithm has modeled the natural behavior of climb process using
separate membranes, rather than the original algorithm. Moreover, it introduced
the membrane migration process to select the best solution and the time stamp
was added as an additional stopping criterion to control the timing of the
algorithm. The results indicate a substantial solution for the time consumption
problem, significant representation of the natural behavior of monkeys, and
considerable chance to reach the best solution in the context of
meta-heuristics purpose. In addition, experiments use the commonly used
benchmark functions to test the performance of the algorithm as well as the
expected time of the proposed P Monkey optimization algorithm and the
traditional Monkey Algorithm running on population size. The unit times are
calculated based on the complexity of algorithms, where P Monkey takes a time
unit to fire rule(s) over a population size n; as soon as, Monkey Algorithm
takes a time unit to run a step every mathematical equation over a population

back hole horizon includes the mass parameter of the black hole, angular
momentum, energy and also outgoing mass of the emitted particle. Besides,
considering the effect of GUP into account, the modified Hawking radiation of
