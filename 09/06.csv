viscosity essentially does not influence the time evolution of the system, thus
these solutions are particularly adept tools to study the effect of bulk
viscosity alone, which always results in a slower decrease of energy density as

different scenarios for the bulk viscosity and find qualitatively different

exchangeability representation theorem. Three new theorems delineate the extent
of the usefulness of such distributions, and we show why it may not be
appropriate to extend the frequency mimicking assertions for a specified value

allowed to change across the domain wall, modeling more complicated

However, in the above context, we show that inflating bubbles are never

inflating universes by tunneling from flat space. In contrast, we do find good

their single asymptotic region, also have an additional large semi-classical
region located behind both past and future event horizons. Furthermore, without
fine-tuning model parameters, using multiple domain walls we find Euclidean

fixed horizon size, and thus at fixed Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Indeed, with
our symmetries and in our class of models, such solutions provide the unique

large scale mass overdensities, most sight lines through protoclusters in a

  States",,,,,"hep-th gr-qc hep-ph math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We extend the investigation of the structure of the late-time wavefunction of
the universe to a class of toy models of scalars with time-dependent masses and
polynomial couplings, which contains general massive scalars in FRW
cosmologies. We associate a universal integrand to each Feynman diagram
contributing to the wavefunction of the universe. For certain (light) masses,
such an integrand satisfies recursion relations involving differential
operators, connecting states with different masses and having, as a seed, the
massless scalar (which describes a conformally coupled scalar as a special
case). We show that it is a degenerate limit of the canonical form of a
generalisation of the cosmological polytopes describing the wavefunction for
massless scalars. Intriguingly, the flat-space scattering amplitude appears as
a higher codimension face: it is encoding the leading term in the Laurent
expansion as the total energy is taken to zero, with the codimension of the
face providing the order of the total energy pole. The same connection between
the other faces and the Laurent expansion coefficients holds for the other
singularities of the wavefunction of the universe, all of them connectable to
flat-space processes. As the degenerate limit is taken, some of the
singularities of the canonical form of the polytope collapse onto each other
generating higher order poles. Finally, we consider the mass as a perturbative
coupling, showing that the contribution to the wavefunction coming from graphs
with mass two-point couplings can be identified with a degenerate limit of the
canonical form of the cosmological polytope, if the perturbative expansion is
done around the conformally coupled state; or as double degenerate limit of the
canonical form of the extension of the cosmological polytopes introduced in the
present paper, if the perturbative expansion is done around minimally coupled
states.

of our approach is the concept of motion style, in particular for facial

essential factor beyond visual accuracy in face editing applications. Our
method is based on a recurrent generative adversarial network that captures the
spatiotemporal co-activation of facial expressions, and enables generating and
modifying the facial expressions of the target actor while preserving their

unsupervised manner using cycle-consistency and mouth expression losses, and
synthesize photorealistic video frames using a layered neural face renderer.
Our approach generates temporally coherent results, and handles dynamic

and electrical crosstalk between detector channels belonging to the same
particle event.
  In order to quantify the crosstalk generated by a single channel on its
neighbours, the standard method used so far are calibrated electrical pulses in
order to quantify the crosstalk between individual frontend preamplifier
channels.
  However due to grounding imperfections, cross-couplings via bias voltage
supplies and imperfect electromagnetic shielding, this method introduces biases
and is not precise.
  A new approach is the use of emulated scintillation light over optical fibre
bundles in order to effectively generate scintillation light in clustered
channels.
  This method is based on generation of quasi time-coherent light with similar
time profiles as scintillation light.
  Theoretically, and based on linear superposition, pulsing a single channel
with calibrated light would be sufficient to measure the crosstalk in the
surrounding channels.
  However, non-linear effects in real detector frontends with energy
measurements over cluster sizes like 3x3 can add up to significant errors.
  Non-linearity is for example due to preamplifier supply voltage drop in the
distribution and GND return lines, in particular if power is provided over long
cables.
  This can generate locally reduced or increased signal amplitudes depending on
cumulative signal intensity.
  The presented octal light ALED~(Analogue LED) pulser prototype emulates
scintillation light with individually tunable light amplitudes in 8 channels.
  It can be used for pulsing single channels, or for clustered channels with a
predefined amplitude profile.
  Unbiased single channel crosstalk and non-linear side-effects can be
determined for single and multichannel situations.

to operate in a ""background-free"" regime in the region of interest (ROI) after
analysis cuts for the full 100$\,$kg$\cdot$yr target exposure of the

around $Q_{\beta\beta}$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ search, to extract a precise
measurement of the half-life of the double-beta decay mode with neutrinos
($2\nu\beta\beta$) and in order to identify the location of residual
impurities. The latter will permit future experiments to build strategies in

this article the background decomposition prior to analysis cuts is presented

reason is that no detailed study of the magnetic and rotational evolution of
this population has yet been performed. Using newly determined rotational
periods, modern magnetic measurements, and atmospheric parameters determined
via spectroscopic modelling, we have derived fundamental parameters, dipolar
oblique rotator models, and magnetospheric parameters for 56 early B-type
stars. Comparison to magnetic A- and O-type stars shows that the range of
surface magnetic field strength is essentially constant with stellar mass, but
that the unsigned surface magnetic flux increases with mass. Both the surface
magnetic dipole strength and the total magnetic flux decrease with stellar age,
with the rate of flux decay apparently increasing with stellar mass. We find
tentative evidence that multipolar magnetic fields may decay more rapidly than
dipoles. Rotational periods increase with stellar age, as expected for a
magnetic braking scenario. Without exception, all stars with H$\alpha$ emission
originating in a CM are 1) rapid rotators, 2) strongly magnetic, and 3) young,

to precisely time biological functions. Underlying these biochemical clocks are
chemical reactions and transport processes, which are inherently stochastic.
Understanding the physical basis for robust biochemical oscillations in the
presence of fluctuations has thus emerged as an important problem. In a
previous paper [C. del Junco and S. Vaikuntanathan, Phys. Rev. E 101, 012410
(2020)], we explored this question using the non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics of single-ring Markov state models of biochemical networks that
support oscillations. Our finding was that they can exploit non-equilibrium
driving to robustly maintain the period and coherence of oscillations in the
presence of randomness in the rates. Here, we extend our work to Markov state
models consisting of a large cycle decorated with multiple small cycles. These
additional cycles are intended to represent alternate pathways that the
oscillator may take as it fluctuates about its average path. Combining a
mapping to single-cycle networks based on first passage time distributions with
our previously developed theory, we are able to make analytical predictions for
the period and coherence of oscillations in these networks. One implication of
our predictions is that a high energy budget can make different network
topologies and arrangements of rates degenerate as far as the period and
coherence of oscillations is concerned. Excellent agreement between analytical
and numerical results confirms that this is the case. Our results suggest that
biochemical oscillators can be more robust to fluctuations in the path of the
oscillator when they have a high energy budget.

potential advantages over classical methods. In practice, a particularly
important kind of manipulation is to ""purify"" the quantum resources, since they
are inevitably contaminated by noise and thus often lose their power or become
unreliable for direct usage. Here we prove fundamental limitations on how
effectively generic noisy resources can be purified enforced by the laws of
quantum mechanics, which universally apply to any reasonable kind of quantum
resource. More explicitly, we derive nontrivial lower bounds on the error of
converting any full-rank noisy state to any target pure resource state by any
free protocol (including probabilistic ones)---it is impossible to achieve
perfect resource purification, even probabilistically. Our theorems indicate
strong limits on the efficiency of distillation, a widely used type of resource
purification routine that underpins many key applications of quantum

explicit lower bounds on the resource cost of magic state distillation, a
leading scheme for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation.

studied probabilistically, i.e. in terms of the evolution of probability

the dynamics of ensembles (statistical mechanics) and systems with uncertainty
in the initial conditions.
  Delay differential equations (DDEs) are a particular class of deterministic
systems, distinguished by an explicit dependence of the dynamics on past
states. A probabilistic approach to DDEs is lacking. The main problems we
consider in developing such an approach are (1) to characterize the evolution
of probability distributions for DDEs, i.e. develop an analog of the
Perron-Frobenius operator; (2) to characterize invariant probability
distributions for DDEs; and (3) to develop a framework for the application of
ergodic theory to delay equations, with a view to a probabilistic understanding
of DDEs whose time evolutions are chaotic. We develop a variety of approaches
to each of these problems, employing both analytical and numerical methods.
  In transient chaos, a system evolves erratically during a transient period
that is followed by asymptotically regular behavior. Transient chaos in delay
equations has not been reported or investigated before. We find numerical
evidence of transient chaos (fractal basins of attraction and long chaotic
transients) in some DDEs, including the Mackey-Glass equation. Transient chaos
in DDEs can be analyzed numerically using a modification of the

with both parts exhibiting remarkable properties. Our main result is that the
time of existence can be controlled in terms of the
$H^{2^+}(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of the wave-part of the initial data and various
Sobolev and H\""{o}lder norms of the transport-part of the initial data, the
latter comprising the initial vorticity and entropy. The wave-part regularity
assumptions are optimal in the scale of Sobolev spaces: shocks can instantly
form if one only assumes a bound for the $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of the
wave-part of the initial data. Our proof relies on the assumption that the
transport-part of the initial data is more regular than the wave-part, and we
show that the additional regularity is propagated by the flow, even though the
transport-part of the flow is deeply coupled to the rougher wave-part. To
implement our approach, we derive several results of independent interest: i)
sharp estimates for the acoustic geometry, i.e., the geometry of sound cones;
ii) Strichartz estimates for quasilinear sound waves coupled to vorticity and
entropy; and iii) Schauder estimates for the transport-div-curl-part. Compared

that the quasilinear PDE systems under study exhibit multiple speeds of
propagation and that elliptic estimates for various components of the fluid are

prescriptions, models with CO WD primaries $\lesssim 0.7\,M_\odot$ typically
leave the R CrB phase with total masses $\approx 0.6-0.7\,M_\odot$, roughly

matter (DM) halos. These halos possess internal spin, `lambda', which is
insignificant rotationally but does affect interactions between the baryonic
and DM components. While statistics of prograde and retrograde spinning halos
in galaxies is not available at present, the existence of such halos is
important for galaxy evolution. In the previous works, we analyzed dynamical
and secular evolution of stellar bars in prograde spinning halos and the DM
response to the bar perturbation, and found that it is modified by the resonant
interactions between the bar and the DM halo orbits. In the present work, we
follow the evolution of stellar bars in retrograde halos. We find, that this
evolution differs substantially from evolution in rigid unresponsive halos,
discussed in the literature. First, we confirm that the bar instability is
delayed progressively along the retrograde `lambda' sequence. Second, the bar
evolution in the retrograde halos differs also from that in the prograde halos,
in that the bars continue to grow substantially over the simulation time of 10
Gyr. The DM response is also substantially weaker compared to this response in
the prograde halos. Third, using orbital spectral analysis of the DM orbital
structure, we find a phenomenon we call the orbit reversal --- when retrograde
DM orbits interact with the stellar bar, reverse their streaming and
precession, and become prograde. This process dominates the inner halo region
adjacent to the bar and allows these orbits to be trapped by the bar, thus
increasing efficiency of angular momentum transfer by the Inner Lindblad
Resonance. We demonstrate this reversal process explicitly in a number of
examples.

immediate progenitors of quiescent galaxies, although their origin and nature
are debated. Were they formed in slow secular processes or in rapid
merger-driven starbursts? Addressing this question would provide fundamental
insight into how quenching occurs. We explore the location of the general
population of galaxies with respect to fundamental star-forming and structural
relations, identify compact SFGs based on their stellar core densities, and
study three diagnostics of the burstiness of star formation: 1) Star formation
efficiency, 2) interstellar medium (ISM), and 3) radio emission. The overall
distribution of galaxies in the fundamental relations points towards a smooth
transition towards quiescence while galaxies grow their stellar cores, although
some galaxies suddenly increase their specific star-formation rate when they
become compact. From their star formation efficiencies compact and extended
SFGs appear similar. In relation to the ISM diagnostic, by studying the CO
excitation, the density of the neutral gas, and the strength of the ultraviolet
radiation field, compact SFGs resemble galaxies located in the upper envelope
of the SFGs main sequence, although yet based on a small sample size. Regarding
the radio emission diagnostic we find that galaxies become increasingly compact
as the starburst ages, implying that at least some compact SFGs are old
starbursts. We suggest that compact SFGs could be starburts winding down and
eventually crossing the main sequence towards quiescence.

relation using the image positions and flux ratios from eleven quadruple-image
strong gravitational lenses (quads) in the mass range $10^{6} - 10^{10}

subhalos and line of sight halos, marginalizes over nuisance parameters
describing the lens macromodel, accounts for finite source effects on lensing
observables, and simultaneously constrains the normalization and logarithmic
slope of the mass-concentration relation, and the normalization of the subhalo
mass function. At $z=0$, we constrain the concentration of $10^{8} M_{\odot}$
halos $c=12_{-5}^{+6}$ at $68 \%$ CI, and $c=12_{-9}^{+15}$ at $95 \%$ CI. For
a $10^{7} M_{\odot}$ halo, we obtain $68 \%$ ($95 \%$) constraints

verification of concurrent systems. Given their tremendous computational
complexity, practical approaches have relied on techniques such as reachability
relaxations, e.g., allowing for negative intermediate counter values. It is
natural to question their feasibility for VASS enriched with primitives that
typically translate into undecidability. Spurred by this concern, we pinpoint
the complexity of integer relaxations with respect to arbitrary classes of
affine operations.
  More specifically, we provide a trichotomy on the complexity of integer
reachability in VASS extended with affine operations (affine VASS). Namely, we
show that it is NP-complete for VASS with resets, PSPACE-complete for VASS with
(pseudo-)transfers and VASS with (pseudo-)copies, and undecidable for any other
class. We further present a dichotomy for standard reachability in affine VASS:
it is decidable for VASS with permutations, and undecidable for any other
class. This yields a complete and unified complexity landscape of reachability
in affine VASS. We also consider the reachability problem parameterized by a
fixed affine VASS, rather than a class, and we show that the complexity
landscape is arbitrary in this setting.

$\epsilon(\nu)$ completely specifies the detailed structure of the frequency
eigenvalues. In practice, however, this function of frequency is reduced to a
single scalar $\epsilon$, defined, particularly by observers, as the intercept
of a least-squares fit to the frequencies against radial order, or via the
central value of this function. The procedure by which this is done is not
unique. We derive a few simple expressions relating various observational
estimators of $\epsilon$ for radial modes to each other, and to the underlying
theoretical object. In particular we demonstrate that a ``reduced' functional
parameterisation is both insensitive to mis-estimations of $\Delta\nu$, and
easy to evaluate locally in terms of both observational and theoretical
quantities. It has been shown previously that such a local definition of
$\epsilon$ can distinguish between stars on the ascending part of the red giant
branch and those in the red clump. We find that this sensitivity to
evolutionary stage arises from differences in the local frequency derivative of
the underlying phase function, a consequence of differences in internal
structure. By constructing an HR-like diagram out of purely seismic
observables, we provide a unified view of the \textit{Kepler} asteroseismic
sample, as well as the initial results from \textit{TESS}. We investigate how
various astrophysical quantities and modelling parameters affect the morphology
of isochrones on this seismic diagram. We also show that $\epsilon$ can be used
as an independent input when deriving stellar parameters from global
asteroseismic quantities.

Thermalization of charged decay products, i.e., electrons, $\alpha$-particles,

$\gamma$-ray thermalization processes are also properly calculated by taking
the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of each decay into account. We show that the
$\beta$-decay heating rate at later times approaches a power-law decline as
$\propto t^{-2.8}$, which agrees with the result of Waxman et al. (2019). We
present a new analytic model to calculate macronova light curves, in which the
density structure of the ejecta is accounted for. We demonstrate that the
observed bolometric light curve and temperature evolution of the macronova
associated with GW170817 are reproduced well by the $\beta$-decay heating rate
with the solar r-process abundance pattern. We interpret the break in the
observed bolometric light curve around a week as a result of the diffusion wave
crossing a significant part of the ejecta rather than a thermalization break.
We also show that the time-weighted integral of the bolometric light curve
(Katz integral) is useful to provide an estimate of the total r-process mass
from the observed data, which is independent of the highly uncertain radiative
transfer. For the macronova in GW170817, the ejecta mass is robustly estimated
as $\approx 0.05M_{\odot}$ for $A_{\rm min}\leq 72$ and $85\leq A_{\rm min}\leq
130$ with the solar r-process abundance pattern. The code for computation of
the heating rate and light curve for given initial nuclear abundances is

adversarial attacks in real world applications such as those deployed in
cyber-physical systems (CPS) are of increasing concern. Numerous studies have
investigated the mechanisms of attacks on the RL agent's state space.
Nonetheless, attacks on the RL agent's action space (AS) (corresponding to
actuators in engineering systems) are equally perverse; such attacks are
relatively less studied in the ML literature. In this work, we first frame the
problem as an optimization problem of minimizing the cumulative reward of an RL
agent with decoupled constraints as the budget of attack. We propose a
white-box Myopic Action Space (MAS) attack algorithm that distributes the
attacks across the action space dimensions. Next, we reformulate the
optimization problem above with the same objective function, but with a
temporally coupled constraint on the attack budget to take into account the
approximated dynamics of the agent. This leads to the white-box Look-ahead
Action Space (LAS) attack algorithm that distributes the attacks across the
action and temporal dimensions. Our results shows that using the same amount of
resources, the LAS attack deteriorates the agent's performance significantly
more than the MAS attack. This reveals the possibility that with limited
resource, an adversary can utilize the agent's dynamics to malevolently craft
attacks that causes the agent to fail. Additionally, we leverage these attack
strategies as a possible tool to gain insights on the potential vulnerabilities
of DRL agents.

down to disk scales. We find that 14/37 (38%) of the YSOs are detected in

to have steeper inclinations (> 60 degree) than those with azimuthal

polarization morphologies and disk properties consistent with dust
self-scattering in optically thick disks. The remaining sources may be instead
tracing magnetic fields. Their inferred field directions from rotating the

is defined inductively by $\{0\}=0$, $\{1\}=1$, and $\{n\}=s\{n-1\}+t\{n-2\}$

the form $\prod_i n_i/\prod_j k_j$ has a Lucas analogue obtained by replacing
each factor with the corresponding Lucas polynomial. There has been interest in
deciding when such expressions, which are a priori only rational functions, are
actually polynomials in $s,t$. The approaches so far have been combinatorial.
We introduce a powerful algebraic method for answering this question by
factoring $\{n\}=\prod_{d|n} P_d(s,t)$, where we call the polynomials
$P_d(s,t)$ Lucas atoms. This permits us to show that the Lucas analogues of the
Fuss-Catalan and Fuss-Narayana numbers for all irreducible Coxeter groups are
polynomials in $s,t$. Using gamma expansions, a technique which has recently
become popular in combinatorics and geometry, one can show that the Lucas atoms
have a close relationship with cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_d(q)$. Certain
results about the $\Phi_d(q)$ can then be lifted to Lucas atoms. In particular,
one can prove analogues of theorems of Gauss and Lucas, deduce reduction
formulas, and evaluate the $P_d(s,t)$ at various specific values of the
variables.

evolution of a bipolar-jet RG in a persistent crosswind through hundreds of
Myr. We confirm traditional jet-bending models, while noting that our NAT
exhibits a transitional morphology reminiscent of wide-angle radio tails. Once
deflected, jets remain internally stable, but are intermittently disrupted by
external disturbances induced by the NAT dynamics itself. The disruptions
enhance jet and tail magnetic fields. Disrupted jet plasma is heterogeneously
mixed with denser wind plasma, yielding patchy, filamentary tails that grow
longer at a rate exceeding the wind speed. Such fast tail extension could, for
example, allow NAT tails to overtake extraneous ICM features, such as shocks
and shear layers downwind of where the tails first form. Those events, in turn,
could generate enhanced radio emissions within the ICM features themselves that
do not follow the geometrical extension of the tails past the encounter.
Analysis of synthetic radio observations reveals an extended time period once
the NAT has developed in which it displays a nearly steady-state morphology
with integrated fluxes that are roughly constant, along with a self-similar,
curved integrated spectrum. In an appendix, we outline a simple analytic jet
trajectory formalism with one adjustable parameter, using it to illustrate
explicit trajectories that extend the classic bending model to arbitrary
jet-wind orientations.

for the global inversion of data acquired at different spatial resolution. The
method has its roots in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but involves the use
of linear operators to transform and degrade the synthetic spectra of a highly

sampling, alignment and image rotation of each of the data sets. We have
carried out a list of numerical experiments to show that our method allows
extracting spatial information from two simulated datasets that have gone
through two different telescope apertures and that are sampled in different
spatial grids. Our results show that each dataset contributes in the inversion
by constraining information at the spatial scales that are present in each of
the datasets, without any negative effects derived from the combination of
multiple resolution data. This method is especially relevant for chromospheric
studies that attempt at combining datasets acquired with different telescopes

Here we analyse the available Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations to
determine accurately the spectral and temporal variation properties of the CSPN
of NGC 2392. The X-ray emission can be described by an absorbed thermal plasma
model with temperature 26$^{+8}_{-5}$ MK and X-ray luminosity
(8.7$\pm$1.0)$\times$10$^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. No long-term variability is
detected in the X-ray emission level, but the Chandra light curve is suggestive
of short-term variations with a period $\sim$0.26 days. The possible origins of
this X-ray emission are discussed. X-ray emission from the coronal activity of
a companion or shocks in the stellar wind can be ruled out. Accretion of
material from an unseen main-sequence companion onto the CSPN or from the CSPN
wind onto a white dwarf companion are the most plausible origins for its hard
X-ray emission, although the mismatch between the rotational period of the CSPN
and the modulation time-scale of the X-ray emission seems to preclude the
former possibility.

constructing the total weak-lensing signal from contributions of the matter
density in thin disk slices. The prediction of this model is successfully
tested against numerical simulation with ray tracing, and found to be accurate
within at least 5 per cent in the tails at redshift 1 and opening angle of 10
arcmin and even more so with increasing source redshift and opening angle. An
accurate analytical approximation to the theory is also provided for practical
implementation. The lensing kernel that mixes physical scales along the
line-of-sight tends to reduce the domain of validity of this theoretical
approach compared to the three dimensional case of cosmic densities in
spherical cells. This effect is shown to be avoidable if a nulling procedure is
implemented in order to localise the lensing line-of-sight integrations in a
tomographic analysis. Accuracy in the tails is thus achieved within a percent

verify the linearity correction to the GALEX data. We find that the linearity
correction is valid for magnitudes brighter than 15.95 and 16.95 for the Far
Ultraviolet (FUV) and Near Ultraviolet (NUV) bands, respectively. We also use
DA white dwarfs beyond 250 pc to calculate extinction coefficients in the FUV
and NUV bands; $R_{\rm FUV}=8.01 \pm 0.07$ and $R_{\rm NUV}=6.72 \pm 0.04$.
These are consistent with the predicted extinction coefficients for Milky Way
type dust in the FUV, but smaller than predictions in the NUV. With well
understood optical spectra and state-of-the-art model atmosphere analysis,
these white dwarfs currently provide the best constraints on the extinction
coefficients for the GALEX data.

databases, due to its potential to significantly reduce resource usage and
response times, at the cost of a small approximation error. We consider random
sampling for answering the ubiquitous class of group-by queries, which first
group data according to one or more attributes, and then aggregate within each
group after filtering through a predicate. The challenge with group-by queries
is that a sampling method cannot focus on optimizing the quality of a single
answer (e.g. the mean of selected data), but must simultaneously optimize the
quality of a set of answers (one per group).
  We present CVOPT, a query- and data-driven sampling framework for a set of
group-by queries. To evaluate the quality of a sample, CVOPT defines a metric
based on the norm (e.g. $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$) of the coefficients of
variation (CVs) of different answers, and constructs a stratified sample that
provably optimizes the metric. CVOPT can handle group-by queries on data where
groups have vastly different statistical characteristics, such as frequencies,
means, or variances. CVOPT jointly optimizes for multiple aggregations and
multiple group-by clauses, and provides a way to prioritize specific groups or
aggregates. It can be tuned to cases when partial information about a query
workload is known, such as a data warehouse where queries are scheduled to run
periodically.
  Our experimental results show that CVOPT outperforms current state-of-the-art
on sample quality and estimation accuracy for group-by queries. On a set of
queries on two real-world data sets, CVOPT yields relative errors that are 5x
smaller than competing approaches, under the same space budget.

that the Auriga simulations do produce sufficient stellar mass for GC
candidates at radii and metallicities that are typical for the MW GC system
(GCS). We also find varying mass-ratios of the simulated GC candidates relative
to the observed mass in the MW and M31 GC systems for different bins of
galactocentric radius-metallicity (r$_{\text{gal}}$ -[Fe/H]). Overall, the
Auriga simulations produce GC candidates with higher metallicities than the MW
and M31 GCS and they are found at larger radii than observed. The Auriga
simulations would require bound cluster formation efficiencies higher than ten
percent for the metal-poor GC candidates, and those within the Solar radius
should experience negligible destruction rates to be consistent with
observations. GC candidates in the outer halo, on the other hand, should either
have low formation efficiencies, or experience high mass loss for the Auriga
simulations to produce a GCS that is consistent with that of the MW or M31.
Finally, the scatter in the metallicity as well as in the radial distribution
between different Auriga runs is considerably smaller than the differences
between that of the MW and M31 GCSs. The Auriga model is unlikely to give rise
to a GCS that can be consistent with both galaxies.

We revisit the ""cloud crushing problem"" in a large survey of simulations

anisotropic Braginskii conduction and viscosity (with saturation). We explore a
wide range of parameters including cloud size, velocity, ambient temperature
and density, as well as a variety of magnetic field configurations and cloud
turbulence. We find that realistic magnetic fields and turbulence have weaker
effects on cloud survival; the most important physics is radiative cooling and
conduction. Self-gravity and self-shielding are important for clouds which are
initially Jeans-unstable, but largely irrelevant otherwise.
Non-self-gravitating, realistically magnetized clouds separate into four
regimes: (1) At low column densities, clouds evaporate rapidly via conduction.
(2) A ""failed pressure confinement"" regime, where the ambient hot gas cools too
rapidly to provide pressure confinement for the cloud. (3) An ""infinitely
long-lived"" regime, in which the cloud lifetime becomes longer than the cooling
time of gas swept up in the leading bow shock, so the cloud begins to accrete
and grow. (4) A ""classical cloud destruction"" regime, where clouds are
eventually destroyed by instabilities. In the final regime, the cloud lifetime
can exceed the naive cloud-crushing time owing to conduction-induced
compression. However, small and/or slow-moving clouds can also evaporate more
rapidly than the cloud-crushing time. We develop simple analytic models that
explain the simulated cloud destruction times in this regime.

Here, a new method is presented which integrates predictive deep learning

users on a German website to investigate the influence of notice position, type
of choice, and content framing on consent. We find that users are more likely
to interact with a notice shown in the lower (left) part of the screen. Given a
binary choice, more users are willing to accept tracking compared to mechanisms
that require them to allow cookie use for each category or company
individually. We also show that the wide-spread practice of nudging has a large
effect on the choices users make. Our experiments show that seemingly small
implementation decisions can substantially impact whether and how people
interact with consent notices. Our findings demonstrate the importance for
regulation to not just require consent, but also provide clear requirements or
guidance for how this consent has to be obtained in order to ensure that users
can make free and informed choices.

T1-weighted MR protocol is used. There has, however, been little work
addressing the problem of domain adaptation when image intensities or patient
orientation differ markedly between the training set and an unseen test set. To
overcome the domain shift we propose to apply extensive intensity augmentation
in addition to geometric augmentation during training. We explored both style
transfer and a novel intensity remapping approach as intensity augmentation
strategies. For our experiments, we trained a 3D U-net on T1-weighted scans and
tested on T2-weighted scans. By applying intensity augmentation we increased
segmentation performance from a DSC of 0.71 to 0.90. This performance is very
close to the baseline performance of training and testing on T2-weighted scans
(0.92). Furthermore, we applied our network to an independent test set made up
of publicly available scans acquired using a T1-weighted TWIST sequence and a
different coil configuration. On this dataset we obtained a performance of
0.89, close to the inter-observer variability of the ground truth segmentations
(0.92). Our results show that using intensity augmentation in addition to
geometric augmentation is a suitable method to overcome the intensity domain

explain quantitatively the relation between the light-shift and the duration of

extract the most information from the maps. We focus on quadratic-estimator
based lensing reconstruction methods that are fast to implement, and compare
new more-optimally filtered estimators with various estimators that have
previously been used in the literature. Input CMB maps can be optimally
inverse-signal-plus-noise filtered using conjugate gradient (or other)
techniques to account for the noise anisotropy. However, lensing
reconstructions from these filtered input maps have an anisotropic response to
the lensing signal and are difficult to interpret directly. We describe a
second-stage filtering of the lensing maps and analytic response model that can
be used to construct lensing power spectrum estimates that account for the
anisotropic response and noise inhomogeneity in an approximately optimal way
while remaining fast to compute. We compare results for simulations of upcoming
Simons Observatory and CMB Stage-4 experiments to show the robustness of the
more optimal lensing reconstruction pipeline and quantify the improvement
compared to less optimal estimators. We find a substantial improvement in
reconstructed lensing power variance between optimal anisotropic and isotropic
filtering of CMB maps, and up to 30% improvement in variance by using the
additional filtering step on the reconstruction potential map. Our approximate
analytic response model is unbiased to within a small percent-level additional

intended for the growth inhibition of cancer cells; however, it is challenging
to detect the efficacy of such drugs in early stages of treatment. A unique
method to assess the impact of anti-cancerous drugs on cancerous cells/tissues
is to probe the nanoscale structural alterations. In this paper, we study the
effect of different anti-cancerous drugs on ovarian tumorigenic cells, using
their nanoscale structural alterations as a biomarker. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) imaging on thin cell sections is performed to obtain their
nanoscale structures. The degree of nanoscale structural alterations of
tumorigenic cells and anti-cancerous drug treated tumorigenic cells are
quantified by using the recently developed inverse participation ratio (IPR)
technique. Results show an increase in the degree of nanoscale fluctuations in
tumorigenic cells relative to non-tumorigenic cells; then a nearly reverse of
the degree of fluctuation of tumorigenic cells to that of non-tumorigenic
cells, after the anti-cancerous drugs treatment. These results support that the
effect of anti-cancerous drugs in cancer treatment can be quantified by using
the degree of nanoscale fluctuations of the cells via TEM imaging. Potential
applications of the technique for cancer treatment are also discussed.

population is of interest to scientists. However, researchers are usually
constrained by available covariate information. Analysts can often collect much
fewer variables from population samples than from experimental samples, which
has limited applicability of existing approaches that assume rich covariate
data from both experimental and population samples. In this article, we examine
how to select covariates necessary for generalizing experimental results under
such data constraints. In our concrete context of a large-scale development
program in Uganda, although more than 40 pre-treatment covariates are available
in the experiment, only 8 of them were also measured in a target population. We
propose a method to estimate a separating set -- a set of variables affecting
both the sampling mechanism and treatment effect heterogeneity -- and show that
the population average treatment effect (PATE) can be identified by adjusting
for estimated separating sets. Our algorithm only requires a rich set of
covariates in the experimental data, not in the target population, by
incorporating researcher-specific constraints on what variables are measured in
the population data. Analyzing the development experiment in Uganda, we show
that the proposed algorithm can allow for the PATE estimation in situations

focuses on these questions in the context of graphical coordination games where

the agents follow log-linear learning, a well-known distributed learning

characterize how both (i) the sophistication of the attack strategies (static

can be leveraged by an adversary to degrade system performance. Focusing on the
set of adversarial policies that induce stochastically stable states, our
findings demonstrate that the relative importance between sophistication and

particular, sophistication far outweighs informational awareness with regards
to degrading system-level damage when the adversary's influence power is
relatively weak. However, the opposite is true when an adversary's influence
power is more substantial.

a second delayed pulse from a reflection off the ice surface. This allows for a

rare-earth spacer layer - formal valence counting suggests that these materials
have monovalent Ni1+ cations with the same 3d electron count as Cu2+ in the

theory to show that the electronic structure of RNiO2 (R = La, Nd), while
similar to the cuprates, includes significant distinctions. Unlike cuprates
with insulating spacer layers between the CuO2 planes, the rare-earth spacer
layer in the infinite-layer nickelate supports a weakly-interacting
three-dimensional 5d metallic state. This three-dimensional metallic state
hybridizes with a quasi-two-dimensional, strongly correlated state with 3dx2-y2
symmetry in the NiO2 layers. Thus, the infinite-layer nickelate can be regarded
as a sibling of the rare earth intermetallics, well-known for heavy Fermion
behavior, where the NiO2 correlated layers play an analogous role to the 4f
states in rare-earth heavy Fermion compounds. This unique Kondo- or
Anderson-lattice-like ""oxide-intermetallic"" replaces the Mott insulator as the

  2010-2011 through the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in Russia",,,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: There is limited information on the volume of
influenza-associated mortality in Russia.
  Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al.,
Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory
causes, circulatory causes, and for certain infectious and parasitic diseases
(available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat))
linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2,
A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of
Influenza (RII) on levels of ILI/ARI consultations and the percent of
respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B),
adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza
circulation and temporal trends.
  Results: For the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 seasons, influenza circulation
was associated with an average annual 11106 (95% CI (4321,17892)) deaths for
circulatory causes, 4552 (3744,5360) deaths for respiratory causes, and 343
(63,624) deaths for certain infectious and parasitic diseases, with influenza
A/H3N2 being responsible for the majority of influenza-associated respiratory
deaths and influenza B making a substantial contribution to
influenza-associated mortality for circulatory causes.
  Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality
burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths. Those results support
the potential utility of influenza vaccination (with the role played by
influenza B in circulatory mortality pointing to the benefit of quadrivalent
influenza vaccines), as well as of administration of antiviral drugs for
high-risk individuals during periods of active influenza circulation.

  IEEE ISIT 2019",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Byzantine distributed quickest change detection (BDQCD) is studied, where
a fusion center monitors the occurrence of an abrupt event through a bunch of
distributed sensors that may be compromised. We first consider the binary
hypothesis case where there is only one post-change hypothesis and prove a
novel converse to the first-order asymptotic detection delay in the large mean
time to a false alarm regime. This converse is tight in that it coincides with
the currently best achievability shown by Fellouris et al.; hence, the optimal
asymptotic performance of binary BDQCD is characterized. An important
implication of this result is that, even with compromised sensors, a 1-bit link
between each sensor and the fusion center suffices to achieve asymptotic
optimality. To accommodate multiple post-change hypotheses, we then formulate
the multi-hypothesis BDQCD problem and again investigate the optimal
first-order performance under different bandwidth constraints. A converse is
first obtained by extending our converse from binary to multi-hypothesis BDQCD.
Two families of stopping rules, namely the simultaneous $d$-th alarm and the
multi-shot $d$-th alarm, are then proposed. Under sufficient link bandwidth,
the simultaneous $d$-th alarm, with $d$ being set to the number of honest
sensors, can achieve the asymptotic performance that coincides with the derived
converse bound; hence, the asymptotically optimal performance of
multi-hypothesis BDQCD is again characterized. Moreover, although being shown
to be asymptotically optimal only for some special cases, the multi-shot $d$-th
alarm is much more bandwidth-efficient and energy-efficient than the
simultaneous $d$-th alarm. Built upon the above success in characterizing the
asymptotic optimality of the BDQCD, a corresponding leader-follower Stackelberg
game is formulated and its solution is found.

estimating the optimal model for any given number of components is an NP-hard

introduce AutoGMM, a Python algorithm for automatic Gaussian mixture modeling,

consistent with the picture that satellite galaxies closely trace the

  subharmonic oscillations in a bubble oscillator",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Period doubling route to chaos is one of the well-known characteristics of
nonlinear oscillators. A bubble is a highly nonlinear oscillator that exists in
various phenomena and applications ranging from material science and underwater
acoustics to medical ultrasound. The occurrence of period doubling (PD) in the
oscillations of the bubbles is concomitant with the generation of 1/2 order
subharmonics (SHs). SH oscillations are used to monitor the bubble activity and
are employed as a measure of stable cavitation. As bubbles are intravascular
contrast agents, SH oscillations are used in diagnostic ultrasound to increase
the contrast of the blood vessels to the tissue. Despite the importance of PD
in a bubble oscillator, the dynamical behavior of the bubble during stable SH
and ultra-harmonic (UH) oscillations have not thoroughly studied yet. In this
work, through applying a comprehensive bifurcation method, we study the
nonlinear radial oscillations of the bubble oscillator as a function of
ultrasound driving pressure. The frequency of the driving force is chosen as
the linear resonance frequency (fr) and linear SH resonance frequency (fsh=2fr)
of the bubble. Results show that, when the bubble is sonicated with 2fr, PD
doubling occurrence is more likely to result in non-destructive oscillations.
The evolution of the bubble stable P2 dynamics forms the shape of a bow-tie for
bubbles with an initial diameter of 740nm and above. When f=2fr, the phase
portrait of the P2 attractor is distinctly different from a P2 attractor when
f=fr, and SH component of the backscattered pressure is maximum. When sonicated
by 2fr, due to lower oscillation amplitude and gentler bubble collapse, the
bubble can sustain stable P2 oscillations for a longer duration and over a
broader range of applied acoustic pressure.

check the performance of the model a detailed comparison between the calculated

three different models; M1, M2, and M3 that fit the CLAS, MAMI, and both CLAS

investigating the significance of individual nucleon resonances and the
predicted beam-target helicity asymmetry $E$ that has been measured by the CLAS

interactions between neutron stars, which is quantified by the tidal
deformability. Multiple merger events are required to probe the equation of
state over a range of neutron star masses. The more events included in the
analysis, the stronger the constraints on the equation of state. In this paper,
we build on previous work to explore the constraints that LIGO and Virgo are
likely to place on the neutron star equation of state by combining the first
forty binary neutron star detections, a milestone we project to be reached
during the first year of accumulated design-sensitivity data. We carry out
Bayesian inference on a realistic mock dataset of binaries to obtain posterior
distributions for neutron star tidal parameters. In order to combine posterior
samples from multiple observations, we employ a random forest regressor, which
allows us to efficiently interpolate the likelihood distribution. Assuming a
merger rate of 1540 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a LIGO-Virgo detector network
operating for one year at the sensitivity of the third-observation run, plus an
additional eight months of design sensitivity, we find that the radius of a 1.4

the same time, the pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density can be
constrained to $\sim 45$ % at 90% confidence. Finally, we add an appendix

distribution of the maximum neutron star mass allowed by the equation of state.

however, these networks are still optimized via discrete methods (e.g. gradient
descent). In this paper, we explore a different direction: namely, we propose a
novel framework for learning in which the parameters themselves are solutions
of ODEs. By viewing the optimization process as the evolution of a
port-Hamiltonian system, we can ensure convergence to a minimum of the
objective function. Numerical experiments have been performed to show the
validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

shifted the snowline outward. We identified 18/18 Class 0 and 9/10 Class I
post-burst sources from N$_2$H$^+$, and 7/17 Class 0 and 1/8 Class I post-burst

evolution of burst frequency or disk evolution. In the former case, assuming
that refreeze-out timescales are 1000 yr for \ce{H2O} and 10,000 yr for CO, we
found that the intervals between bursts increases from 2400 yr in the Class 0

algorithm for non-convex empirical risk minimization problems over a
peer-to-peer network of nodes, which is in sharp contrast to the existing DSGT
only for convex problems. To ensure exact convergence and handle the variance
among decentralized datasets, each node performs a stochastic gradient (SG)
tracking step by using a mini-batch of samples, where the batch size is
designed to be proportional to the size of the local dataset. We explicitly
evaluate the convergence rate of DSGT with respect to the number of iterations
in terms of algebraic connectivity of the network, mini-batch size, gradient
variance, etc. Under certain conditions, we further show that DSGT has a
network independence property in the sense that the network topology only
affects the convergence rate up to a constant factor. Hence, the convergence
rate of DSGT can be comparable to the centralized SGD method. Moreover, a
linear speedup of DSGT with respect to the number of nodes is achievable for
some scenarios. Numerical experiments for neural networks and logistic
regression problems on CIFAR-10 finally illustrate the advantages of DSGT.

practice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often
judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information

events whose effect can be effectively quantified and modeled to help minimize
human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we
develop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic

statistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit
forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such
as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities. The proposed model and
approach is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two
Australian companies. Discussions focus on a thorough analysis of the

scalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks
where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents
funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the
endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by
relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path
contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a
transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. However, in
deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users
for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when
routing transactions, users first guess a path, then check if it supports the
transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate
of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give
substantial improvements in success rate at the expense of privacy. In this
work, we study whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off
privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose
noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of
graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate
either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get
large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy
by sacrificing a little utility.

(LC) joint model of bond-occupation variables interacting with $q$-flow
variables, and formulate a LC algorithm that is found to be in the same
dynamical universality as the celebrated Swendsen-Wang algorithm. This leads to
a theoretical unification for all the representations, and numerically, one can
apply the most efficient algorithm in one representation and measure physical
quantities in others. Moreover, by using the LC scheme, we construct a
hierarchy of geometric objects that contain as special cases the $q$-flow
clusters and the backbone of FK clusters, the exact values of whose fractal
dimensions in two dimensions remain as an open question. Our work not only
provides a unified framework and an efficient algorithm for the Potts model,
but also brings new insights into rich geometric structures of the FK clusters.

The PAH abundance increase is driven particularly by the interplay between
shattering and accretion (dust growth). The fast aromatization guarantees that

i.e. identical to their antiparticles, would be a manifestation of new physics
with profound implications for particle physics and cosmology. Majorana
neutrinos would generate neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay,
a matter-creating process without the balancing emission of antimatter. So far,
0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay has eluded detection. The GERDA collaboration searches
for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge by operating bare germanium
detectors in an active liquid argon shield. With a total exposure of 82.4
kg$\cdot$yr, we observe no signal and derive a lower half-life limit of
T$_{1/2}$ > 0.9$\cdot$10$^{26}$ yr (90% C.L.). Our T$_{1/2}$ sensitivity
assuming no signal is 1.1$\cdot$10$^{26}$ yr. Combining the latter with those
from other $0{\nu}\beta\beta$ decay searches yields a sensitivity to the
effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.07 - 0.16 eV, with corresponding
sensitivities to the absolute mass scale in $\beta$ decay of 0.15 - 0.44 eV,
and to the cosmological relevant sum of neutrino masses of 0.46 - 1.3 eV.

their vector competence and thus effectively stopping local dengue
transmission.The behavior of infected and uninfected mosquitoes is assumed to
be driven by a compartmental system enriched with the presence of an internal
control source term standing for releases of infected mosquitoes, distributed
in time. We model and design an optimal releasing control strategy with the
help of a least square problem. In a nutshell, one wants to minimize the number
of uninfected mosquitoes at a given horizon of time, under some relevant
biological constraints. We derive properties of optimal controls, highlight a
limit problem providing useful asymptotic properties of optimal controls. We
numerically illustrate the relevance of our approach.

where hidden features (patterns) trained to a normal model, which is only
activated by some specific input (called triggers), trick the model into
producing unexpected behavior. In this paper, we create covert and scattered
triggers for backdoor attacks, invisible backdoors, where triggers can fool
both DNN models and human inspection. We apply our invisible backdoors through
two state-of-the-art methods of embedding triggers for backdoor attacks. The
first approach on Badnets embeds the trigger into DNNs through steganography.
The second approach of a trojan attack uses two types of additional
regularization terms to generate the triggers with irregular shape and size. We
use the Attack Success Rate and Functionality to measure the performance of our
attacks. We introduce two novel definitions of invisibility for human
perception; one is conceptualized by the Perceptual Adversarial Similarity
Score (PASS) and the other is Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS). We show that the proposed invisible backdoors can be fairly effective
across various DNN models as well as four datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,

functionality for the normal users, and invisibility scores for the

can effectively thwart the state-of-the-art trojan backdoor detection
approaches, such as Neural Cleanse and TABOR.

properties associated with this transition, including maxima in the
superconducting critical temperature and in resistivity. In the present paper,
we report new measurements, employing new uniaxial stress apparatus and new
measurements of the low-temperature elastic moduli, of the strain at which this
Lifshitz transition occurs: a longitudinal strain $\varepsilon_{xx}$ of
$(-0.44\pm0.06)\cdot10^{-2}$, which corresponds to a B$_{1g}$ strain
$\varepsilon_{xx} - \varepsilon_{yy}$ of $(-0.66\pm0.09)\cdot10^{-2}$. This is
considerably smaller than the strain corresponding to a Lifshitz transition in
density functional theory calculations, even if the spin-orbit coupling is
taken into account. Using dynamical mean-field theory we show that electronic
correlations reduce the critical strain. It turns out that the orbital
anisotropy of the local Coulomb interaction on the Ru site is furthermore
important to bring this critical strain close to the experimental number, and
thus well into the experimentally accessible range of strains.

integrated information that describes which nodes in the neighborhood are

Optical flow based techniques generalize but are suitable only for short

dimensional latent space, achieving long-range predictions. However, these
latent representations are often non-interpretable, and therefore difficult to
manipulate. This work poses video prediction and interpolation as unsupervised
latent structure inference followed by a temporal prediction in this latent

supervision such as keypoints or poses. Further, as each landmark can be mapped
to a coordinate indicating where a semantic part is positioned, we can reliably
interpolate within the coordinate domain to achieve predictable motion
interpolation. Given an image decoder capable of mapping these landmarks back

an optical power as low as 1mW. This makes PC-ToF especially viable for

  Question Answering",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many algorithms for Knowledge-Based Question Answering (KBQA) depend on
semantic parsing, which translates a question to its logical form. When only
weak supervision is provided, it is usually necessary to search valid logical
forms for model training. However, a complex question typically involves a huge
search space, which creates two main problems: 1) the solutions limited by
computation time and memory usually reduce the success rate of the search, and
2) spurious logical forms in the search results degrade the quality of training
data. These two problems lead to a poorly-trained semantic parsing model. In
this work, we propose an effective search method for weakly supervised KBQA
based on operator prediction for questions. With search space constrained by
predicted operators, sufficient search paths can be explored, more valid
logical forms can be derived, and operators possibly causing spurious logical
forms can be avoided. As a result, a larger proportion of questions in a weakly
supervised training set are equipped with logical forms, and fewer spurious
logical forms are generated. Such high-quality training data directly
contributes to a better semantic parsing model. Experimental results on one of
the largest KBQA datasets (i.e., CSQA) verify the effectiveness of our
approach: improving the precision from 67% to 72% and the recall from 67% to
72% in terms of the overall score.

magnitude of the GALAH DR2 ($V<14$ mag) and intermediate Galactic latitude of
the star sample. Stars in the four populations share equivalent [$\alpha$/Fe]

$-1.3<{\rm[Fe/H]}\leq -0.5$ dex and age $9<\tau\leq13$ Gyr are assumed to have
different birth places relative to the metal rich and younger ones. With the

robot task programs are challenging to write, because they rely on multiple
actions to succeed, including human-robot interactions. Unfortunately,
interactions are prone to fail, because a human may perform the wrong action
(e.g., if the robot's request is not clear). Moreover, when the robot cannot
directly observe the human action, it may not detect the failure until several
steps after it occurs. Therefore, writing fault-tolerant robot tasks is beyond
the ability of non-experts.
  This paper presents a principled approach to detect and recover from a broad
class of failures that occur in end-user programs on service mobile robots. We
present a two-tiered Robot Task Programming Language (RTPL): 1) an expert
roboticist uses a specification language to write a probabilistic model of the
robot's actions and interactions, and 2) a non-expert then writes an ordinary
sequential program for a particular task. The RTPL runtime system executes the
task program sequentially, while using the probabilistic model to build a
Bayesian network that tracks possible, unobserved failures. If an error is
observed, RTPL uses Bayesian inference to find the likely root cause of the
error, and then attempts to re-execute a portion of the program for recovery.
  Our empirical results show that RTPL 1) allows complex tasks to be written
concisely, 2) correctly identifies the root cause of failure, and 3) allows
multiple tasks to recover from a variety of errors, without task-specific
error-recovery code.

(ABPs) in the presence of fuel (or 'food') sources is studied. It is an
established fact that within confined stationary systems, the activity of ABPs
generates density profiles that are enhanced in regions of low activity, which
is generally referred to as 'anti-chemotaxis'. We demonstrate that -- contrary
to common believes -- in non-stationary setups, emerging here as a result of
short fuel bursts, our model ABPs do instead exhibit signatures of chemotactic
behavior. In direct competition with inactive, but otherwise identical Brownian
particles (BPs), the ABPs are shown to fetch a larger amount of food. From a
biological perspective, the ability to turn active would, despite of the
absence of sensoric devices, encompass an evolutionary advantage.

projects, and also one of the most frequent human intelligence tasks in
crowdsourcing platforms. ML has mixed success in such tasks depending on the
nature of the problem, while crowd-based classification has proven to be
surprisingly effective, but can be expensive. Recently, hybrid text
classification algorithms, combining human computation and machine learning,
have been proposed to improve accuracy and reduce costs. One way to do so is to
have ML highlight or emphasize portions of text that it believes to be more
relevant to the decision. Humans can then rely only on this text or read the
entire text if the highlighted information is insufficient. In this paper, we
investigate if and under what conditions highlighting selected parts of the
text can (or cannot) improve classification cost and/or accuracy, and in
general how it affects the process and outcome of the human intelligence tasks.
We study this through a series of crowdsourcing experiments running over
different datasets and with task designs imposing different cognitive demands.
Our findings suggest that highlighting is effective in reducing classification
effort but does not improve accuracy - and in fact, low-quality highlighting
can decrease it.

  based on a fluorescent bicolor sensor",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Searching for neutrinoless double beta decays ($\beta\beta0\nu$) is the only
practical way to establish if the neutrinos are their own antiparticles. Due to
the smallness of neutrino masses, the lifetime of $\beta\beta0\nu$ is expected
to be at least ten orders of magnitude smaller than the noise associated with
the natural radioactive chains. A positive identification of $\beta\beta0\nu$
decays requires, ultimately, finding a signal that cannot be mimicked by
radioactive backgrounds. This signal could be the observation of the daughter
atom in the decay, since no known background processes induce a Z+2
transformation. In particular, the $\beta\beta0\nu$ decay of Xe-136 could be
established by detecting the doubly ionised daughter atom, Ba$^{2+}$. Such a
detection could be achieved via a sensor made of a monolayer of molecular
indicators. The Ba$^{2+}$ would be captured by one of the molecules in the
sensor, and the presence of the single chelated indicator would be subsequently
revealed by a strong fluorescent response from repeated interrogation with a
laser system. Here we describe a fluorescent bicolor indicator that binds
strongly to Ba$^{2+}$ and shines very brightly, shifting its emission colour
from green to blue when chelated in dry medium, thus allowing the unambiguous
identification of single barium atoms in the sensor, and permitting a positive
identification of the $\beta\beta0\nu$ decay of Xe-136 in a gas chamber, that
could led to a background-free experiment.

separators, are well-known techniques to decompose a graph into smaller units

was bounded above by the sum of the size of the separator plus the treewidth of
disjoint components, and this was obtained by the heuristic of filling in all
edges of the separator making it into a clique.
  In this paper, we present a new, tighter upper bound on the treewidth of a
graph obtained by only partially filling in the edges of a separator. In
particular, the method completes just those pairs of separator vertices that
are adjacent to a common component, and indicates a more effective heuristic
than filling in the entire separator. We discuss the relevance of this result
for combinatorial algorithms and give an example of how the tighter bound can
be exploited in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems.

across curricula,, and existing network structures cannot be applied in such a

design a novel network structure called Dynamic Agent-number Network (DyAN) to

such elusive and possibly short-lasting events requires a fast reaction and a

MAGIC, as a Cherenkov telescope, belongs to the latter category. The search for
transients by MAGIC is possible thanks to an automatic alert system listening
to the alerts sent by the Gamma-ray Coordinate Network (GCN). In this
contribution we describe the MAGIC alert system, which was designed mainly for
the follow-up of Gamma-Ray Bursts in its initial conception. The alert system
was recently updated in a multi-messenger context, receiving alerts also from

performing fast follow-up observations is challenging for IACTs, which have a
narrow field of view and limited duty cycle. Despite this, MAGIC plays a major
role in the search for Very High Energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission
from GRBs: this is possible thanks to its fast repositioning speed, low energy
threshold and high sensitivity at the lowest energies. In 2013 the MAGIC GRB
automatic procedure was upgraded, increasing the number of GRBs followed in the
prompt and early afterglow phases and decreasing dramatically hardware failures
during fast repositioning. Currently, only GRB 190114C was firmly detected in
the VHE band, while for other GRBs no significant detection was achieved. In
such a case, upper limits (ULs) can give insight into the physics driving such
eluding sources, especially on their emission mechanisms. In this contribution
we report on the status of the GRB follow-up with MAGIC and focus on the ULs

they may not fully comply with Caminada and Amgoud's rationality postulates of
strict closure and indirect consistency. For some special cases, the DeLP

microscale concentration into a reactive component, given by the eigenfunction
of the advection-diffusion operator, the associated eigenvalue which represents
the macroscopic effective reaction rate, and a non-reactive component. The
latter can be then upscaled with a two-scale asymptotic expansion and the final
macroscopic equation is obtained for the leading order. The same method can
also be used to overcome another classical assumption, namely of non solenoidal
velocity fields, such as the case of deposition of charged colloidal particles
driven by electrostatic potential forces. The whole upscaling procedure, which
consists in solving three cell problems, is implemented for arbitrarily complex

energetic proton component to account for $\gamma$-ray emission by neutral pion
decay. A quantitative assessment of the proton spectral distribution
necessitates full accounting of the local and background radiation fields in
the lobes; indeed, doing so in our recent analysis of the spectral energy
distribution of the Fornax A lobes considerably weakened previous conclusions
on the hadronic origin of the emission measured by the Fermi satellite. We
present the results of similar analyses of the measured radio, X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray emission from the lobes of Centaurus A, Centaurus B, and NGC 6251.
The results indicate that the measured $\gamma$-ray emission from these lobes
can be accounted for by Compton scattering of the radio-emitting electrons off
the superposed radiation fields in the lobes; consequently, we set upper bounds
on the energetic proton contents of the lobes.

  Factor Disentanglement","International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a family of novel hierarchical Bayesian deep auto-encoder models
capable of identifying disentangled factors of variability in data. While many
recent attempts at factor disentanglement have focused on sophisticated
learning objectives within the VAE framework, their choice of a standard normal
as the latent factor prior is both suboptimal and detrimental to performance.
Our key observation is that the disentangled latent variables responsible for
major sources of variability, the relevant factors, can be more appropriately
modeled using long-tail distributions. The typical Gaussian priors are, on the
other hand, better suited for modeling of nuisance factors. Motivated by this,
we extend the VAE to a hierarchical Bayesian model by introducing hyper-priors
on the variances of Gaussian latent priors, mimicking an infinite mixture,
while maintaining tractable learning and inference of the traditional VAEs.
This analysis signifies the importance of partitioning and treating in a
different manner the latent dimensions corresponding to relevant factors and
nuisances. Our proposed models, dubbed Bayes-Factor-VAEs, are shown to
outperform existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of
latent disentanglement across several challenging benchmark tasks.

Here, we simulate a number of catalogues of mock FRB observations, and use MCMC

cosmological constraints are limited by the current uncertainty on the the

current cosmological constraints allows one to constrain $f_{\rm d}(z)$, and
possibly its redshift evolution. Combining CMB + BAO + SNe + $H_0$ constraints
with just 100 FRBs (with redshifts), we find a typical constraint on the mean
diffuse gas fraction of a few percent. A detection of this nature would
alleviate the ""missing baryon problem"", and therefore highlights the value of
localisation and spectroscopic followup of future FRB detections.

misspecification by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant weights matrices

provides a safeguard against the misspecification that might arise from
unobserved heterogeneity. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are
derived in a framework where the true value of each parameter remains fixed as
the total number of parameters increases. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to

core-collapse supernovae if its magnitude reaches $10^{15}\,\rm{G}$, which is a
typical value for a magnetar. In the presence of fast rotation, such a strong
magnetic field can drive powerful jet-like explosions if it has the large-scale
coherence of a dipole. The topology of the magnetic field is, however, probably
much more complex with strong multipolar and small-scale components and the
consequences for the explosion are so far unclear. We investigate the effects
of the magnetic field topology on the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae and
the properties of forming proto-neutron star (PNS) by comparing pre-collapse
fields of different multipolar orders and radial profiles. Using axisymmetric
special relativistic MHD simulations and a two-moment neutrino transport, we
find that higher multipolar magnetic configurations lead to generally less
energetic explosions, slower expanding shocks and less collimated outflows.
Models with a low order multipolar configuration tend to produce more oblate
PNS, surrounded in some cases by a rotationally supported toroidal structure of
neutron-rich material. Moreover, magnetic fields which are distributed on
smaller angular scales produce more massive and faster rotating central PNS,
suggesting that higher-order multipolar configurations tend to decrease the
efficiency of the magnetorotational launching mechanism. Even if our dipolar
models systematically display a far more efficient extraction of the rotational
energy of the PNS, fields distributed on smaller angular scales are still
capable of powering magnetorotational explosions and shape the evolution of the
central compact object.

straightforward because the video data does not contain explicit information as
to which runners appear in each of the videos. There is no direct supervision
of the model in tracking athletes, only filtering steps to remove irrelevant
detections. Other factors of concern include occlusion of runners and harsh
illumination. To this end, we identify two methods for runner identification at
different points of the event, for determining their trajectory. One is scene
text detection which recognizes the runners by detecting a unique 'bib number'
attached to their clothes and the other is person re-identification which
detects the runners based on their appearance. We train our method without
ground truth but to evaluate the proposed methods, we create a ground truth
database which consists of video and frame interval information where the
runners appear. The videos in the dataset was recorded by nine cameras at
different locations during the a marathon event. This data is annotated with
bib numbers of runners appearing in each video. The bib numbers of runners
known to occur in the frame are used to filter irrelevant text and numbers
detected. Except for this filtering step, no supervisory signal is used. The

discrepancy between the world averages and the SM predictions of
$R_D$-$R_{D^*}$ comes down from $4.1\sigma$ to $3.1\sigma$. Here we do a global

find that there are seven allowed new physics solutions, each with different
Lorentz structure. Further we show that it is possible to distinguish between
them by means of the five observables: the $\tau$ polarization fraction in the
decay $B \rightarrow D \tau \bar{\nu}$, the precision measurement of $R_D$, the
forward-backward asymmetries in the decays $B \rightarrow (D,D^*) \tau

independent predictions for short clips, which are then pooled heuristically to
assign an action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may
characterize the underlying action---many are common across multiple
actions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be
unfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative
pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all
short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To identify
these useful features, we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that
are known to be irrelevant, for example, they are sampled either from datasets
that are unrelated to our actions of interest or are CNN features produced via
random noise as input. With the features from the video as a positive bag and
the irrelevant features as the negative bag, we cast an objective to learn a
(nonlinear) hyperplane that separates the unknown useful features from the rest
in a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine
setup. We use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for
the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the
support vectors in a max-margin framework, they can be treated as a weighted
average pooling of the features from the bags, with zero weights given to
non-support vectors. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep
learning framework. We report results from experiments on eight computer vision
benchmark datasets spanning a variety of video-related tasks and demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across these tasks.

spin-controlled chiral surface wave, allowing the reflected harmonic photons to
gain orbital angular momentum (OAM). These effects produce intense optical
vortices in the extreme ultraviolet regime - an area of significant fundamental

two kinds of approaches applicable to the thin shell and thick shell regimes,

large objects, the scalar field can be assumed to propagate from a thin shell
of the object instead of the whole body, which simplifies the problem. On the

in any stellar radiative zone. We want to study the non-linear evolution of the
instability of a toroidal field stored in a stably stratified layer, in
spherical symmetry and in the absence of rotation. In particular, we intend to
quantify the suppression of the instability as a function of the
Brunt-V\""ais\""ala ($\omega_{\rm BV}$) and the Alfv\'en ($\omega_{\rm A}$)
frequencies. We use the MHD equations as implemented in the anelastic
approximation in the EULAG-MHD code and perform a large series of numerical
simulations of the instability exploring the parameter space for the
$\omega_{\rm BV}$ and $\omega_{\rm A}$. We show that beyond a critical value
gravity strongly suppress the instability, in agreement with the linear
analysis. The intensity of the initial field also plays an important role:
weaker fields show much slower growth rates. Moreover, in the case of very low
gravity, the fastest growing modes have a large characteristic radial scale, at
variance with the case of strong gravity, where the instability is
characterized by horizontal displacements.
  Our results illustrate that the anelastic approximation can efficiently
describe the evolution of toroidal field instability in stellar interiors. The
suppression of the instability as a consequence of increasing values of
$\omega_{\rm BV}$ might play a role to explain the magnetic desert in Ap/Bp
stars since weak fields are only marginally unstable in the case of strong
gravity.

wide range of applications. Many methods have been developed to characterize
and estimate the complexity of networks. However, there has been little
research with statistical guarantees. In this paper, we develop a statistical
theory of graph complexity in a general model of random graphs, the so-called
graphon model.
  Given a graphon, we endow the latent space of the nodes with the neighborhood
distance that measures the propensity of two nodes to be connected with similar
nodes. Our complexity index is then based on the covering number and the
Minkowski dimension of (a purified version of) this metric space. Although the
latent space is not identifiable, these indices turn out to be identifiable.
This notion of complexity has simple interpretations on popular examples of
random graphs: it matches the number of communities in stochastic block models;
the dimension of the Euclidean space in random geometric graphs; the regularity
of the link function in H\""older graphon models.
  From a single observation of the graph, we construct an estimator of the
neighborhood-distance and show universal non-asymptotic bounds for its risk,
matching minimax lower bounds. Based on this estimated distance, we compute the
corresponding covering number and Minkowski dimension and we provide optimal
non-asymptotic error bounds for these two plug-in estimators.

uncertainty relation} is a generic term for various trade-off relations in
nature. In this letter, we improve the Kennard-Robertson uncertainty relation,
and clarify how much coherence we need to implement quantum measurement under
conservation laws. Our approach systematically improves and reproduces the
previous various refinements of the Kennard-Robertson inequality. As a direct
consequence of our inequalities, we improve a well-known limitation of quantum
measurements, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase-Ozawa theorem. This improvement gives an
asymptotic equality for the necessary and sufficient amount of coherence to
implement a quantum measurement with the desired accuracy under conservation
laws.

conducted interviews with nine students who identified with a range of

explaining many observational phenomena related to the propagation of Galactic
cosmic rays, such as broken power-law energy spectra, secondary-to-primary

challenges from recent observations. In particular, such observations on the
large-scale anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays show that the dipole direction

that the large-scale regular magnetic field, which leads to an anisotropic
diffusion of cosmic rays, has not been included in the model provided by the
public numerical packages. In this work, we propose two numerical schemes to
solve the $3$-dimensional anisotropic transport equation: the pseudo source

imaging where the tracer consists of ironoxide nanoparticles. The key idea is
to measure the particle response to a temporally changing external magnetic
field to compute the spatial concentration of the tracer inside the object. A
decent mathematical model demands for a data-driven computation of the system
function which does not only describe the measurement geometry but also encodes
the interaction of the particles with the external magnetic field. The physical
model of this interaction is given by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation. The determination of the system function can be seen as an inverse
problem of its own which can be interpreted as a calibration problem for MPI.
In this contribution the calibration problem is formulated as an inverse
parameter identification problem for the LLG equation. We give a detailed

agents are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. In this work,
we show how such samples can be generalised from White-box and Grey-box attacks
to a strong Black-box case, where the attacker has no knowledge of the agents,
their training parameters and their training methods. We use
sequence-to-sequence models to predict a single action or a sequence of future
actions that a trained agent will make. First, we show our approximation model,
based on time-series information from the agent, consistently predicts RL
agents' future actions with high accuracy in a Black-box setup on a wide range
of games and RL algorithms. Second, we find that although adversarial samples
are transferable from the target model to our RL agents, they often outperform
random Gaussian noise only marginally. This highlights a serious methodological
deficiency in previous work on such agents; random jamming should have been
taken as the baseline for evaluation. Third, we propose a novel use for
adversarial samplesin Black-box attacks of RL agents: they can be used to
trigger a trained agent to misbehave after a specific time delay. This appears
to be a genuinely new type of attack. It potentially enables an attacker to use
devices controlled by RL agents as time bombs.

distinct velocities, fast and slow. We obtained phase diagrams demonstrating
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) upon varying the activity and
concentration of each species, and extended current kinetic theory of
active/passive mixtures to active/active mixtures. We discovered two regimes of
behavior quantified through the participation of each species in the dense
phase compared to their monodisperse counterparts. In regime I (active/passive
and active/weakly-active), we found that the dense phase was segregated by
particle type into domains of fast and slow particles. Moreover, fast particles
were suppressed from entering the dense phase while slow particles were
enhanced entering the dense phase, compared to monodisperse systems of all-fast
or all-slow particles. These effects decayed asymptotically as the activity of
the slow species increased, approaching the activity of the fast species until
they were negligible (regime II). In regime II, the dense phase was
homogeneously mixed and each species participated in the dense phase as if it
were it a monodisperse system; each species behaved as if it weren't mixed at
all. Finally, we collapsed our data defining two quantities that measure the
total activity of the system. We thus found expressions that predict, a priori,
the percentage of each particle type that participates in the dense phase

The system consists of $N$ neurons, each spiking randomly with rate depending
on its membrane potential. At its spiking time, the potential of the spiking
neuron is reset to $0$ and all other neurons receive an additional amount of
potential which is a centred random variable of order $ 1 / \sqrt{N}.$ In
between successive spikes, each neuron's potential follows a deterministic
flow. We prove the convergence of the system, as $N \to \infty$, to a limit
nonlinear jumping stochastic differential equation driven by Poisson random
measure and an additional Brownian motion $W$ which is created by the central
limit theorem. This Brownian motion is underlying each particle's motion and
induces a common noise factor for all neurons in the limit system.
Conditionally on $W,$ the different neurons are independent in the limit
system. This is the {\it conditional propagation of chaos} property. We prove
the well-posedness of the limit equation by adapting the ideas of Graham (1992)

our framework. The uniqueness of the limit is deduced from the exchangeability

fully perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), adapted for memory
applications, were numerically investigated by the resolution of the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the macrospin approach. Both damping-like
and the field-like spin transfer torque terms were taken into account in the
simulations, as well as the contribution of the second order uniaxial
anisotropy term (K2), which has been recently revealed in MgO-based pMTJs. An
in-plane applied magnetic field balances the out of plane symmetry of the pMTJ
and allows the signal detection. Using this model, we assessed the states of
the free layer magnetization as a function of strength of K2 and polar theta_H
angle of the applied field (varied from 90 to 60 deg.). There are two stable
states, with the magnetization in-plane or out of plane of the layer, and two
dynamic states with self-sustained oscillations, called in-plane precession
state (IPP) or out of plane precession state (OPP). The IPP mode, with
oscillation frequencies up to 7 GHz, appears only for positive voltages if
theta_H = 90 deg. However, it shows a more complex distribution when the field
is slightly tilted out of plane. The OPP mode is excited only if K2 is
considered and reaches a maximum oscillation frequency of 15 GHz. Large areas
of dynamic states with high frequencies are obtained for strong values of the
field-like torque and K2, when applying a slightly tilted external field toward
the out of plane direction. The non-zero temperature does not modify the phase
diagrams, but reduces drastically the power spectral density peak amplitudes.

because water is a strict requirement for life as we know it. However, oceans
are dynamic habitats---and some oceans may be better hosts for life than
others. In Earth's ocean, circulation transports essential nutrients such as
phosphate and is a first-order control on the distribution and productivity of
life. Of particular importance is upward flow from the dark depths of the ocean
in response to wind-driven divergence in surface layers. This `upwelling'
returns essential nutrients that tend to accumulate at depth via sinking of
organic particulates back to the sunlit regions where photosynthetic life
thrives. Ocean dynamics are likely to impose constraints on the activity and
atmospheric expression of photosynthetic life in exo-oceans as well, but we
lack an understanding of how ocean dynamics may differ on other planets. We
address this issue by exploring the sensitivity of ocean dynamics to a suite of
planetary parameters using ROCKE-3D, a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Our
results suggest that planets that rotate slower and have higher surface
pressure than Earth may be the most attractive targets for remote life
detection because upwelling is enhanced under these conditions, resulting in
greater nutrient supply to the surface biosphere. Seasonal deepening of the
mixed layer on high obliquity planets may also enhance nutrient replenishment
from depth into the surface mixed layer. Efficient nutrient recycling favors
greater biological activity, more biosignature production, and thus more
detectable life. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of
considering oceanographic phenomena for exoplanet life detection and motivate
future interdisciplinary contributions to the emerging field of
exo-oceanography.

modeling integer-valued time series with outliers. The proposed specification
is based on a heavy-tailed mixture of negative binomial distributions that
features an observation-driven dynamic equation for the conditional
expectation. The existence of a unique stationary and ergodic solution for the
class of autoregressive processes is shown under a general contraction
condition. The estimation of the model can be easily performed by Maximum
Likelihood given the closed form of the likelihood function. The strong
consistency and the asymptotic normality of the estimator are formally derived.
Two examples of specifications illustrate the flexibility of the approach and
the relevance of the theoretical results. In particular, a linear dynamic
equation and a score-driven equation for the conditional expectation are
considered. The score-driven specification is shown to be particularly
appealing as it delivers a robust filtering method that attenuates the impact
of outliers. An empirical application to the time series of narcotics

However, the generality and validity of the effective temperature is not yet

far from back-to-back region of $e^+ e^-$ annihilation in leading order pQCD
using existing fragmentation function fits and standard collinear
factorization, focusing on the large transverse momentum region where
transverse momentum is comparable to the hard scale (the center-of-mass
energy). We compare with standard transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD)
fragmentation function-based predictions intended for the small transverse
momentum region with the aim of testing the expectation that the two types of
calculation roughly coincide at intermediate transverse momentum. We find
significant tension, within the intermediate transverse momentum region,
between calculations done with existing non-perturbative TMD fragmentation
functions and collinear factorization calculations if the center-of-mass energy
is not extremely large. We argue that $e^+ e^-$ measurements are ideal for
resolving this tension and exploring the large-to-small transverse momentum
transition, given the typically larger hard scales ($\gtrsim 10$ GeV) of the
process as compared with similar scenarios that arise in semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering and fixed-target Drell-Yan measurements.

build prediction models from medical images. However, overfitting is a
significant issue in conventional radiomics, where a large number of radiomic
features are directly used to train and test models that predict genotypes or
clinical outcomes. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised
learning pipeline composed of an autoencoder for representation learning of
radiomic features and a Gaussian mixture model based on minimum message length
criterion for clustering. By incorporating probabilistic modeling, disease
heterogeneity has been taken into account. The performance of the proposed
pipeline was evaluated on an institutional MRI cohort of 108 patients with
colorectal cancer liver metastases. Our approach is capable of automatically
selecting the optimal number of clusters and assigns patients into clusters
(imaging subtypes) with significantly different survival rates. Our method
outperforms other unsupervised clustering methods that have been used for
radiomics analysis and has comparable performance to a state-of-the-art imaging
biomarker.

  Journal articles","Quantitative Science Studies, to appear",,,,"cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although bibliometrics are normally applied to journal articles when used to
support research evaluations, conference papers are at least as important in
fast-moving computing-related fields. It is therefore important to assess the
relative advantages of citations and altmetrics for computing conference papers
to make an informed decision about which, if any, to use. This paper compares
Scopus citations with Mendeley reader counts for conference papers and journal
articles that were published between 1996 and 2018 in 11 computing fields and
had at least one US author. The data showed high correlations between Scopus
citation counts and Mendeley reader counts in all fields and most years, but
with few Mendeley readers for older conference papers and few Scopus citations
for new conference papers and journal articles. The results therefore suggest
that Mendeley reader counts have a substantial advantage over citation counts
for recently-published conference papers due to their greater speed, but are
unsuitable for older conference papers.

applicability as tools of reasoning about sentence syntax and semantics. The
focal point is narrowed to Dutch, a language exhibiting a large degree of word
order variability. In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of
that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on
Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched
with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity. An
algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type
sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete,
data-driven lexical types. Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar
instantiation. The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment
process by a neural architecture. A novel application of a self-attentive
sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it
constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus
exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary. The second
revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural
ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results
suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance.

point--generally induces the singularity in the density of states (DOS), but no
isolated critical point yields strict divergence of the DOS in three
dimensions, differently from the lower dimensional cases. In view of the band
structure as a smooth hypersurface on the reciprocal space, we discuss the
minimal deformation of the band structure that yields non-divergent but large
sharp DOS peaks in three dimensions. By ""pushing down"" the energy level at the
second order saddle point (maximum), a continuous closed loop of saddle points
(sphere of maxima) encircling the original position of the saddle point
(maximum) emerges, with which the DOS peak is formed. Being high dimensional
features, the saddle loop and extremum shell thus formed are difficult to
locate with standard band structure analysis on linear ${\bf k}$-point paths.
The Lifshitz transition occurring over a linear or planar manifold is discussed
as an indicator of such features. We also find that the celebrated DOS peak in
the recently discovered superconducting hydride H$_{3}$S originates from the
saddle loop. On this basis, we successfully extract the minimal model that
explains how the DOS peak is formed. Our theory characterizes a large class of
DOS peaks sometimes found in the three dimensional electronic structures,
building a basis for profound understanding of their origins.

sample corresponding to $1.3~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$of $pp$ collision data recorded
with the LHCb detector in 2017. This measurement exploits $B^+\to J/\psi
(e^+e^-)K^+$ decays, where one of the electrons is fully reconstructed and
paired with the kaon, while the other electron is reconstructed using only the
information of the vertex detector. Despite this partial reconstruction,
kinematic and geometric constraints allow the $B^+$-meson mass to be
reconstructed and the signal to be well separated from backgrounds. This in

composition of their relativistic jets are still under debate. If the jets are
Poynting flux dominated rather than baryon dominated, a coherent radio flare
from magnetic re-connection events might be expected with the prompt gamma-ray
emission. There are two competing models for the central engines of GRBs; a
black hole or a newly formed milli-second magnetar. If the central engine is a
magnetar it is predicted to produce coherent radio emission as persistent or
flaring activity. In this paper, we present the deepest limits to date for this
emission following LOFAR rapid response observations of GRB 180706A. No
emission is detected to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 1.7 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz in
a two-hour LOFAR observation starting 4.5 minutes after the gamma-ray trigger.
A forced source extraction at the position of GRB 180706A provides a marginally
positive (1 sigma) peak flux density of $1.1 \pm 0.9$ mJy. The data were
time-sliced into different sets of snapshot durations to search for FRB like
emission. No short duration emission was detected at the location of the GRB.
We compare these results to theoretical models and discuss the implications of
a non-detection.

variant tracking paradigms, either learning a model of the object's appearance
exclusively online or matching the object with the target in an offline-trained
embedding space. Despite the recent success, each method agonizes over its
intrinsic constraint. The online-only approaches suffer from a lack of
generalization of the model they learn thus are inferior in target regression,
while the offline-only approaches (e.g., convolutional siamese trackers) lack
the target-specific context information thus are not discriminative enough to
handle distractors, and robust enough to deformation. Therefore, we propose an
online module with an attention mechanism for offline siamese networks to
extract target-specific features under L2 error. We further propose a filter
update strategy adaptive to treacherous background noises for discriminative
learning, and a template update strategy to handle large target deformations
for robust learning. Effectiveness can be validated in the consistent
improvement over three siamese baselines: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamMask.
Beyond that, our model based on SiamRPN++ obtains the best results over six
popular tracking benchmarks and can operate beyond real-time.

this paper, we take a first step towards the development of machine learning

show that the objective is nondecreasing and satisfies $\alpha$-submodularity,

allow a simple and efficient greedy algorithm to enjoy approximation guarantees

that our algorithm outsources to humans those samples in which the prediction

Multi-objective multi-agent systems (MOMAS) explicitly consider the possible
trade-offs between conflicting objective functions. We argue that, in MOMAS,
such compromises should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these
compromises have for the users of a system. As is standard in multi-objective
optimisation, we model the user utility using utility functions that map value
or return vectors to scalar values. This approach naturally leads to two
different optimisation criteria: expected scalarised returns (ESR) and
scalarised expected returns (SER). We develop a new taxonomy which classifies
multi-objective multi-agent decision making settings, on the basis of the
reward structures, and which and how utility functions are applied. This allows
us to offer a structured view of the field, to clearly delineate the current
state-of-the-art in multi-objective multi-agent decision making approaches and
to identify promising directions for future research. Starting from the
execution phase, in which the selected policies are applied and the utility for
the users is attained, we analyse which solution concepts apply to the
different settings in our taxonomy. Furthermore, we define and discuss these
solution concepts under both ESR and SER optimisation criteria. We conclude
with a summary of our main findings and a discussion of many promising future
research directions in multi-objective multi-agent systems.

robustified with respect to unmodeled disturbances (e.g., wheel slip or packet
loss) in a manner conducive to real-time synthesis. As such, this paper
formulates robust barrier functions for a general class of disturbed

problem, as fine-grained expression is typically tangled with other facial

of expression manipulation, and use predicted global expression, landmarks or
action units (AUs) as a guidance. However, the prediction may be inaccurate,
which limits the performance of transferring fine-grained expression. Instead
of using an intermediate estimated guidance, we propose to explicitly transfer
facial expression by directly mapping two unpaired input images to two
synthesized images with swapped expressions. Specifically, considering AUs
semantically describe fine-grained expression details, we propose a novel
multi-class adversarial training method to disentangle input images into two
types of fine-grained representations: AU-related feature and AU-free feature.
Then, we can synthesize new images with preserved identities and swapped
expressions by combining AU-free features with swapped AU-related features.
Moreover, to obtain reliable expression transfer results of the unpaired input,
we introduce a swap consistency loss to make the synthesized images and
self-reconstructed images indistinguishable. Extensive experiments show that
our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art expression manipulation methods
for transferring fine-grained expressions while preserving other attributes
including identity and pose.

detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of a star similar to the Sun
in spectral type and activity level. It is crucial to estimate if this
conclusion remain true for other stars with current correction methods. We
built realistic time series in RV and chromospheric emission for old
main-sequence F6-K4 stars. The stellar parameters are spectral type, activity
level, rotation period, cycle period and amplitude, latitude coverage, and spot
constrast, which we chose to be in ranges that are compatible with our current
knowledge. This very large set of synthetic time series allowed us to study the
effect of the parameters on the RV jitter and how the different contributions
to the RV are affected in this first analysis of the data set. The RV jitter
was used to provide a first-order detection limit for each time series and
different temporal samplings. We find that the coverage in latitude of the
activity pattern and the cycle amplitudes have a strong effect on the RV
jitter, as has stellar inclination. RV jitter trends with B-V and LogR'HK are
similar to observations, but activity cannot be responsible for RV jitter
larger than 2-3 m/s for very quiet stars: this observed jitter is therefore
likely to be due to other causes. We show that based on the RV jitter that is
associated with each time series and using a simple criterion, a planet with
one Earth mass and a period of one to two years probably cannot be detected
with current analysis techniques, except for the lower mass stars in our
sample, but many observations would be required. The effect of inclination is
critical. The results are very important in the context of future RV follow-ups
of transit detections of such planets. A significant improvement of analysis
techniques and/or observing strategies must be made to reach such low detection

when the linear growth of the plasmoid instability is not sufficiently fast to

leading order approximation for the current sheet width at disruption takes the
form of a power-law multiplied by a logarithmic factor, and from that, the
scaling relations for the wavenumber and the linear growth rate of the dominant

effort-related arousals (RERAs) which are very subtle respiratory events that
do not meet the criteria for apnea or hypopnea, and are more challenging to
detect. Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on a bidirectional long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) classifier and 465 multi-domain features, extracted
from multimodal clinical time series. The features consist of a set of
physiology-inspired features (n = 75), obtained by multiple steps of feature
selection and expert analysis, and a set of physiology-agnostic features (n =
390), derived from scattering transform. Results: The proposed algorithm is
validated on the 2018 PhysioNet challenge dataset. The overall performance in
terms of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is 0.50 on the
hidden test dataset. This result is tied for the second-best score during the
follow-up and official phases of the 2018 PhysioNet challenge. Conclusions: The
results demonstrate that it is possible to automatically detect subtle
non-apneic/non-hypopneic arousal events from PSG recordings. Significance:
Automatic detection of subtle respiratory events such as RERAs together with
other non-apneic/non-hypopneic arousals will allow detailed annotations of
large PSG databases. This contributes to a better retrospective analysis of
sleep data, which may also improve the quality of treatment.

modalities. Most of the existing gait recognition methods take silhouettes or
articulated body models as gait features. These methods suffer from degraded
recognition performance when handling confounding variables, such as clothing,
carrying and viewing angle. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel
AutoEncoder framework, GaitNet, to explicitly disentangle appearance, canonical
and pose features from RGB imagery. The LSTM integrates pose features over time
as a dynamic gait feature while canonical features are averaged as a static
gait feature. Both of them are utilized as classification features. In
addition, we collect a Frontal-View Gait (FVG) dataset to focus on gait
recognition from frontal-view walking, which is a challenging problem since it
contains minimal gait cues compared to other views. FVG also includes other
important variations, e.g., walking speed, carrying, and clothing. With
extensive experiments on CASIA-B, USF, and FVG datasets, our method
demonstrates superior performance to the SOTA quantitatively, the ability of
feature disentanglement qualitatively, and promising computational efficiency.
We further compare our GaitNet with state-of-the-art face recognition to
demonstrate the advantages of gait biometrics identification under certain

and molecular transitions of many species the interstellar medium (ISM),
circumgalactic medium (CGM), and intergalactic medium, within phases spanning a
wide range of ionization, density, temperature, and molecular gas fraction.
Far-UV space telescopes have enabled detailed studies of the ISM in the Milky
Way thanks to absorption features appearing in the UV spectra of hot stars and
yielding fundamental insights into the composition and physical characteristics
of all phases of the ISM along with the processes that influence them. However,
we have yet to design a spectrometer able to observe the full UV domain at
resolving power R>10^5 with a signal-to-noise ratio SNR>500. Such a resolution
is necessary to resolve lines from both the cold molecular hydrogen and the
warm metal ions with a turbulent velocity of about 1 km s-1, and to
differentiate distinct velocity components. Future UV spectroscopic studies of
the Milky Way ISM must revolutionize our understanding of the ISM as a
dynamical, unstable, and magnetized medium, and rise to the challenge brought
forward by current theories. Another interesting prospect is to transpose the
same level of details that has been reached for the Milky Way to the ISM in
external galaxies, in particular in metal-poor galaxies, where the ISM chemical
composition, physical conditions, and topology change dramatically, with
significant consequences on the star-formation properties. Finally, we need to
be able to perform statistical analyses of background quasar lines of sight
intersecting the CGM of galaxies at various redshifts and to comprehend the
role of gas exchanges and flows for galaxy evolution.

ground for the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism in the Standard Model. Any
significant deviations from the expectation would be indirect evidence of
physics beyond the Standard Model. In view of improved measurements from LHCb
and BESIII experiments, we re-analyze the Cabibbo-favored $D \to P\!P$ and
$V\!P$ decays in the topological diagram approach. By assuming certain
SU(3)-breaking effects in the tree-type amplitudes, we make predictions for
both branching fractions and CP asymmetries of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed
decay modes. While the color-allowed and -suppressed amplitudes are preferred
to scale by the factor dictated by factorization in the $P\!P$ modes, no such
scaling is required in the $V\!P$ modes. The $W$-exchange amplitudes are found
to change by 10\% to 50\% and depend on whether $d\overline{d}$ or
$s\overline{s}$ pair directly emerges from $W$-exchange. The predictions of
branching fractions are generally improved after these SU(3) symmetry breaking
effects are taken into account. We show in detail how the tree-type,
QCD-penguin, and weak penguin-annihilation diagrams contribute and modify CP
asymmetry predictions. Future measurements of sufficiently many direct CP
asymmetries will be very useful in removing a discrete ambiguity in the strong
phases as well as discriminating among different theory approaches. In
particular, we predict $a_{CP}(K^+K^-)-a_{CP}(\pi^+\pi^-) = (-1.14 \pm 0.26)
\times 10^{-3}$ or $(-1.25 \pm 0.25) \times 10^{-3}$, consistent with the
latest data, and $a_{CP}(K^+K^{*-})-a_{CP}(\pi^+\rho^-) = (-1.52 \pm 0.43)
\times 10^{-3}$, an attractive and measurable observable in the near future.
Moreover, we observe that such CP asymmetry differences are dominated by
long-distance penguin-exchange through final-state rescattering.

between 1978 and 2017 in psychology, where controlled empirical studies have
played a predominant role in research. To help appreciate this broad context,
the paper provides two case studies in detail, where specific
visualization-related topics were examined in the discipline of psychology as
well as the field of visualization. Following a brief discussion on some latest
developments in psychology, it outlines challenges and opportunities in making
new discoveries about visualization through empirical studies.

for light transmitted through a hole in the moving opaque screen or,
consequently, through a moving open end of the telescope barrel). We show that
this typical textbook statement is incorrect. The aberration of starlight seems
to be one of the simplest phenomena of astronomical observations. The lack of
symmetry, between the cases when either the source or detector is moving is
shown clearly on the basis of the separation of binary stars. Such aberration
is not observed. We have shown that the fact that we do not see myriads of
widely separated binaries in wild gyration does not require any fundamental
change of outlook, but it does require that aberration of ""distant"" stars

are proposed for uplink control channels in unlicensed bands. These schemes
address high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) under non-contiguous resource
allocation in the frequency domain and reduce the maximum PAPR to 3 dB. The
first scheme allows the users to transmit a small amount of uplink control
information (UCI) such as acknowledgment signals and does not introduce a
trade-off between PAPR and co-channel interference (CCI). The second scheme,
which enables up to 21 UCI bits for a single user or 11 UCI bits for three
users in an interlace, is based on a new theorem introduced in this paper. This
theorem leads distinct CSs compatible with a wide variety of resource
allocations while capturing the inherent relationship between CSs and
Reed-Muller (RM) codes, which makes CSs more useful for practical systems. The
numerical results show that the proposed schemes maintain the low-PAPR benefits
without increasing the error rate for non-contiguous resource allocations in
the frequency domain.

acknowledged as an effective way to achieve acceleration on a variety of
platforms, and DNN weight pruning is a straightforward and effective method.
There are currently two mainstreams of pruning methods representing two
extremes of pruning regularity: non-structured, fine-grained pruning can
achieve high sparsity and accuracy, but is not hardware friendly; structured,
coarse-grained pruning exploits hardware-efficient structures in pruning, but
suffers from accuracy drop when the pruning rate is high. In this paper, we
introduce PCONV, comprising a new sparsity dimension, -- fine-grained pruning
patterns inside the coarse-grained structures. PCONV comprises two types of
sparsities, Sparse Convolution Patterns (SCP) which is generated from
intra-convolution kernel pruning and connectivity sparsity generated from
inter-convolution kernel pruning. Essentially, SCP enhances accuracy due to its
special vision properties, and connectivity sparsity increases pruning rate
while maintaining balanced workload on filter computation. To deploy PCONV, we
develop a novel compiler-assisted DNN inference framework and execute PCONV
models in real-time without accuracy compromise, which cannot be achieved in
prior work. Our experimental results show that, PCONV outperforms three
state-of-art end-to-end DNN frameworks, TensorFlow-Lite, TVM, and Alibaba

iteration. Specifically, the novel class of proposal distributions, called
Plateau distributions, do not overlap, thus ensuring that the multiple trials
are drawn from different regions of the state space. Furthermore, the Plateau
proposal distributions allow for a bespoke adaptation procedure that lends
itself to a Markov chain with efficient problem dependent state space
exploration and improved burn-in properties. Simulation studies show that our

such as targeted drug delivery, where the microrobot will be expected to
navigate in a fluid through channels carrying a payload. Alternatively, in many
cases, such a payload does not have to be physically bound to the swimmer, but
may be instead manipulated and steered through the channel by the microrobot.
We investigate this problem of contactless manipulation of a microparticle by
mobile microswimmer in a fluid at low Reynolds number. We consider a model of a
magnetically actuated artificial microswimmer, whose locomotion through a fluid
induces a disturbance velocity field in the fluid, that then acts to propel a
cargo particle in its vicinity. The problem investigated in this paper is
therefore one of coupled locomotion-manipulation of two bodies in a fluid. The
magnetic swimmer's motion is actuated by an externally applied magnetic field
of constant strength but whose direction rotates at a constant rate in a plane.
The swimmer propels itself in the direction perpendicular to this plane if the
frequency associated with the periodic magnetic field is above a critical
frequency. Below this critical frequency, the swimmer tumbles in place without
net locomotion. The coupled fluid-swimmer-cargo particle dynamics are solved
numerically using the method of Stokesian dynamics. The induced motion of the
cargo particle is shown to be controllable. This is achieved by switching the
planes of rotation of the magnetic field and switching frequency of the
magnetic field above and below the critical frequency. While a swimmer with a
specific geometry has been used in the model, the results of this paper are
applicable to swimmers with other geometries and means of propulsion. The
results of this paper show that microswimmers can be utilized as mobile
manipulators of microparticles in a fluid.

of three new application scenarios in the fifth generation cellular networks.
In this work, we aim to reduce the user experienced delay through prediction
and communication co-design, where each mobile device predicts its future
states and sends them to a data center in advance. Since predictions are not
error-free, we consider prediction errors and packet losses in communications
when evaluating the reliability of the system. Then, we formulate an
optimization problem that maximizes the number of URLLC services supported by
the system by optimizing time and frequency resources and the prediction
horizon. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method,
and show that the tradeoff between user experienced delay and reliability can
be improved significantly via prediction and communication co-design.
Furthermore, we carried out an experiment on the remote control in a virtual
factory, and validated our concept on prediction and communication co-design
with the practical mobility data generated by a real tactile device.

students in the academic settings. Nowadays, abundant data is stored in
educational institutions about students which can help to discover insight on
how students are learning and how to improve their performance ahead of time
using data mining techniques. In this paper, we developed a student performance
prediction model that predicts the performance of high school students for the
next semester for five courses. We modeled our prediction system as a
multi-label classification task and used support vector machine (SVM), Random
Forest (RF), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Mult-layer perceptron (MLP) as
base-classifiers to train our model. We further improved the performance of the
prediction model using state-of-the-art partitioning schemes to divide the
label space into smaller spaces and use Label Powerset (LP) transformation
method to transform each labelset into a multi-class classification task. The
proposed model achieved better performance in terms of different evaluation
metrics when compared to other multi-label learning tasks such as binary
relevance and classifier chains.

Voltmeter, Ammeter, Multi-meter) is using to measure the power quality in the

position that means if someone wants to check the power distribution status,
the person needs to go to the computer to check. In this project, a system
would be made to monitoring the power status by 5G New Radio (NR) Network
application with android smartphone. Since 5G NR Network can provide a
theoretical peak download capacity of 20 Gigabits per second. It would be more
convenient to monitoring the power status in different place by checking though

  influence of greenhouse effect and L\'evy noise",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An abrupt climatic transition could be triggered by a single extreme event,
an $\alpha$-stable non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is regarded as a type of noise to
generate such extreme events. In contrast with the classic Gaussian noise, a
comprehensive approach of the most probable transition path for systems under
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise is still lacking. We develop here a probabilistic
framework, based on the nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation, to investigate the
maximum likelihood climate change for an energy balance system under the
influence of greenhouse effect and L\'evy fluctuations. We find that a period
of the cold climate state can be interrupted by a sharp shift to the warmer one
due to larger noise jumps, and the climate change for warming $1.5\rm ^oC$
under an enhanced greenhouse effect generates a step-like growth process. These
results provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of abrupt
climate transitions triggered by a L\'evy process.

for short BCH codes. In this work, we extend these results to much larger
families of algebraic block codes, by performing message passing with graph
neural networks. The parameters of the sub-network at each variable-node in the
Tanner graph are obtained from a hypernetwork that receives the absolute values
of the current message as input. To add stability, we employ a simplified
version of the arctanh activation that is based on a high order Taylor
approximation of this activation function. Our results show that for a large
number of algebraic block codes, from diverse families of codes (BCH, LDPC,
Polar), the decoding obtained with our method outperforms the vanilla belief
propagation method as well as other learning techniques from the literature.

events in videos acquired by fixed videocameras on highways. The events of
interest consist in a specific sequence of situations that occur in the video,
as for instance a vehicle stopping on the emergency lane. Hence, the detection
of these events requires to analyze a temporal sequence in the video stream. We
compare different approaches that exploit architectures based on Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A first
approach extracts vectors of features, mostly related to motion, from each
video frame and exploits a RNN fed with the resulting sequence of vectors. The
other approaches are based directly on the sequence of frames, that are
eventually enriched with pixel-wise motion information. The obtained stream is
processed by an architecture that stacks a CNN and a RNN, and we also
investigate a transfer-learning-based model. The results are very promising and
the best architecture will be tested online in real operative conditions.

  Organic Frameworks Integrated on Graphene","12 pages",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two dimensional (2D) materials exhibit superior properties in electronic and
optoelectronic fields. The wide demand for high performance optoelectronic
devices promotes the exploration of diversified 2D materials. Recently, 2D
covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as next-generation layered
materials with predesigned pi electronic skeletons and highly ordered
topological structures, which are promising for tailoring their optoelectronic
properties. However, COFs are usually produced as solid powders due to
anisotropic growth, making them unreliable to integrate into devices. Here, by
selecting tetraphenylethylene (TPE) monomers with photoelectric activity, we
designed and synthesized photosensitive 2D COFs with highly ordered topologies
and grew 2D COFs in situ on graphene to form well ordered COF graphene
heterostructures. Ultrasensitive photodetectors were successfully fabricated
with the COFETBC TAPT graphene heterostructure and exhibited an excellent
overall performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area and the polarity
selectivity of COFs, the photosensing properties of the photodetectors can be
reversibly regulated by specific target molecules. Our research provides new
strategies for building advanced functional devices with programmable material
structures and diversified regulation methods, paving the way for a generation
of high performance applications in optoelectronics and many other fields.

effective in enhancing the detection sensitivity, yet fails to precisely and
dynamically control the location of the preconcentrated biomolecule plug to
ensure overlap with the sensing region (e.g. immobilized molecular probes).
Here, we used electrothermal (ET) stirring as a means of controlling the
location of a preconcentrated biomolecule plug. The applied microfluidic device
consisted of a Nafion membrane to induce the CP, and an array of individually
addressable microscale heaters for active local ET stirring. The experimental
results demonstrated that such a novel platform enabled active control of the
location of the preconcentrated plug of target biomolecules, ensuring its
overlap with the functionalized microparticles, ultimately yielding enhanced
detection sensitivity and binding kinetics. This was demonstrated using
avidin-biotin particles as a simple bead-based bioassay model.
