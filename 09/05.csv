Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1866, combining the analysis of its
best-studied Cepheids with that of a very accurate colour-magnitude diagram
(CMD) obtained from the most recent Hubble Space Telescope photometry. We use a
Bayesian method based on new PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks with
overshooting and rotation to obtain ages and initial rotation velocities of
five well-studied Cepheids of the cluster. We find that four of the five
Cepheids belong to an initially slowly rotating young population (of $ 176 \pm
5$ Myr), while the fifth one is significantly older, either $ 288 \pm 20$ Myr
for models with high initial rotational velocity ($\omega_\mathrm{i} \sim
0.9$), or $ 202 \pm 5$ Myr for slowly rotating models. The complementary
analysis of the CMD rules out the latter solution while strongly supporting the
presence of two distinct populations of $\sim$176 Myr and $\sim$288 Myr,
respectively. Moreover, the observed multiple main sequences and the turn-offs
indicate that the younger population is mainly made of slowly rotating stars,
as is the case of the four younger Cepheids, while the older population is made
mainly of initially fast rotating stars, as is the case of the fifth Cepheid.
Our study not only reinforces the notion that some young clusters like NGC 1866
harbor multiple populations, but gives also hints that the first population,
the older, may inherit the angular momentum from the parent cloud while stars
of the second one, the younger, do not.

theory for self-consistent second-order single-neuron statistics in
block-structured sparse random networks of spiking neurons. In particular, the
theory predicts the neuron-level autocorrelation times, also known as intrinsic
timescales, of the neuronal activity. The theory is based on an extension of
dynamic mean-field theory from rate networks to spiking networks, which is
validated via simulations. It accounts for both static variability, e.g. due to
a distributed number of incoming synapses per neuron, and temporal fluctuations
of the input. We apply the theory to balanced random networks of generalized
linear model neurons, balanced random networks of leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons, and a biologically constrained network of leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons. For the generalized linear model network with an error function
nonlinearity, a novel analytical solution of the colored noise problem allows
us to obtain self-consistent firing rate distributions, single-neuron power
spectra, and intrinsic timescales. For the leaky integrate-and-fire networks,
we derive an approximate analytical solution of the colored noise problem,
based on the Stratonovich approximation of the Wiener-Rice series and a novel
analytical solution for the free upcrossing statistics. Again closing the
system self-consistently, in the fluctuation-driven regime this approximation
yields reliable estimates of the mean firing rate and its variance across
neurons, the inter-spike interval distribution, the single-neuron power
spectra, and intrinsic timescales.

The scary impact of cyber attacks in the industrial world calls for tools to

this opportunity, but current research is lacking cost-effective solutions
verticalized for the industrial domain. This work proposes ICSrange, a
simulation-based cyber range platform for Industrial Control Systems. ICSrange
adopts Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies to virtualize an enterprise
network connected to Industrial Control Systems. ICSrange is the outcome of a
preliminary study intended to investigate challenges and opportunities to build
a configurable and extensible cyber range with simulated industrial processes.
Literature shows that testbeds based on realistic mock-ups are effectively
employed to develop complex exploits like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs),
hence motivating their usage to train and test security in ICS. We prove the
effectiveness of ICSrange through the execution of a multi-staged attack that
breaches an enterprise network and progressively intrudes a simulated ICS with
water tanks. The attack mimics lateral movements as observed in APTs.

a common outcome of strong energy release during magnetic reconnection, e.g.,
in solar flares, kinetic simulations have not been able to provide definite
evidence of power-laws in energy spectra of non-relativistic reconnection. By
means of 3D large-scale fully kinetic simulations, we study the formation of
power-law electron energy spectra in non-relativistic low-$\beta$ reconnection.
We find that both the global spectrum integrated over the entire domain and
local spectra within individual regions of the reconnection layer have
power-law tails with a spectral index $p \sim 4$ in the 3D simulation, which
persist throughout the non-linear reconnection phase until saturation. In
contrast, the spectrum in the 2D simulation rapidly evolves and quickly becomes
soft. We show that 3D effects such as self-generated turbulence and chaotic
magnetic field lines enable the transport of high-energy electrons across the
reconnection layer and allow them to access several main acceleration regions.
This leads to a sustained and nearly constant acceleration rate for electrons
at different energies. We construct a model that explains the observed
power-law spectral index in terms of the dynamical balance between particle
acceleration and escape from main acceleration regions, which are defined based
upon a threshold for the curvature drift acceleration term. This result could
be important for explaining the formation of power-law energy spectrum in solar

normal to the plane and an antiferromagnetic mode where each dipole is $\pi$
out of phase with its nearest neighbor. The excitation, which can consist of a
single photon, is then released from the protected subradiant eigenmode by
controlling the Zeeman level shifts of the atoms. Hence, an original localized
excitation which emits in all directions is transferred to a delocalized
subradiance-protected excitation, with a probabilistic emission of a photon
only along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the atoms. This protected
spreading and directional emission could potentially be used to link stages in
a quantum information or quantum computing architecture.

for the formation of at least some gas giant exoplanets, particularly massive
or distant gas giants. With regard to close-in gas giants, Boss (2017) used the
$\beta$ cooling approximation to calculate hydrodynamical models of inner gas
disk instability, finding that provided disks with low values of the initial
minimum Toomre stability parameter (i.e., $Q_i < 2$ inside 20 au) form,
fragmentation into self-gravitating clumps could occur even for $\beta$ as high
as 100 (i.e., extremely slow cooling). Those results implied that the evolution
of disks toward low $Q_i$ must be taken into account. This paper presents such
models: initial disk masses of 0.091 $M_\odot$ extending from 4 to 20 au around
a 1 $M_\odot$ protostar, with a range (1 to 100) of $\beta$ cooling parameters,
the same as in Boss (2017), but with all the disks starting with $Q_i = 2.7$,
i.e., gravitationally stable, and allowed to cool from their initial outer disk
temperature of 180 K to as low as 40 K. All the disks eventually fragment into
at least one dense clump. The clumps were again replaced by virtual
protoplanets (VPs) and the masses and orbits of the resulting ensemble of VPs
compare favorably with those of Boss (2017), supporting the claim that disk
instability can form gas giants rapidly inside 20 au, provided that
sufficiently massive protoplanetary disks exist.

supernovae explosions, but their complex hydrodynamics is still not well
understood. These flames are affected not only by the RT instability, but also
by the turbulence it generates. Both processes can increase the flame speed by
stretching and wrinkling the flame. This makes it hard to choose a subgrid
model for the flame speed in full star Type Ia or Iax simulations. Commonly
used subgrid models get around this difficulty by assuming that either the RT
instability or turbulence is dominant and sets the flame speed. In previous
work, we evaluated the physical assumptions and predictive abilities of these
two types of models by analysing a large parameter study of 3D direct numerical
simulations of RT unstable flames. Surprisingly, we found that the flame
dynamics is dominated by the RT instability and that RT unstable flames are
very different from turbulent flames. In particular, RT unstable flames are
thinner rather than thicker when turbulence is strong. In addition, none of the
turbulent flame speed models adequately predicted the flame speed. We also
showed that the RT flame speed model failed when the RT instability was strong,
suggesting that geometrical burning effects also influence the flame speed.
However, these results depended on simulations with $Re\lesssim720$. In this
paper, we extend the parameter study to higher Reynolds number and show that
the basic conclusions of our previous study still hold when the RT-generated
turbulence is stronger.

define $R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)$ to be the smallest integer $n$ such that in
any $r$-coloring of the edges of $K_n$ there exists a path-matching of color
$i$ and order at least $p_i$ for some $i\in [r]$. Our main result is that for

\[R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)= p_1- (r-1) +
\sum_{i=2}^{r}\left\lceil\frac{p_i}{3}\right\rceil.\] Perhaps surprisingly, we
show that when $p_1<2r-2$, it is possible that $R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)$ is
larger than $p_1- (r-1) + \sum_{i=2}^{r}\left\lceil\frac{p_i}{3}\right\rceil$,

\leq R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)\leq \left\lceil

that in every $r$-coloring of $K_n$ there is a monochromatic path-matching of
order at least $3\left\lfloor\frac{n}{r+2}\right\rfloor$, which is essentially
best possible. We also determine $R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)$ in all cases when
the number of colors is at most 4.
  The proof of the main result uses a minimax theorem for path-matchings
derived from a result of Las Vergnas (extending Tutte's 1-factor theorem) to
show that the value of $R^{PM}(p_1, \dots, p_r)$ depends on the block sizes in
covering designs (which can be also formulated in terms of monochromatic
1-cores in colored complete graphs). Then we obtain the result above by giving
estimates on the block sizes in covering designs in the arbitrary (non-uniform)

Aiming to unveil what kinds of stars and supernovae can create magnetars, we
have performed a state-of-the-art spatially resolved spectroscopic X-ray study

1E 1841-045, 1E 161348-5055, and SGR 0526-66, respectively. The three SNRs are
O- and Ne-enhanced and are evolving in the interstellar medium with densities
of >1--2 cm$^{-3}$. The metal composition and dense environment indicate that
the progenitor stars are not very massive. The progenitor masses of the three
magnetars are constrained to be < 20 Msun (11--15 Msun for Kes 73, < 13 Msun
for RCW 103, and ~13 --17 Msun for N49). Our study suggests that magnetars are
not necessarily made from very massive stars, but originate from stars that
span a large mass range. The explosion energies of the three SNRs range from
$10^{50}$ erg to ~2$\times 10^{51}$ erg, further refuting that the SNRs are
energized by rapidly rotating (millisecond) pulsars. We report that RCW 103 is
produced by a weak supernova explosion with significant fallback, as such an
explosion explains the low explosion energy (~$10^{50}$ erg), small observed
metal masses ($M_{\rm O}\sim 4\times 10^{-2}$ Msun and $M_{\rm Ne}\sim 6\times
10^{-3}$ Msun), and sub-solar abundances of heavier elements such as Si and S.
Our study supports the fossil field origin as an important channel to produce
magnetars, given the normal mass range ($M_{\rm ZAMS} < 20$ Msun) of the
progenitor stars, the low-to-normal explosion energy of the SNRs, and the fact
that the fraction of SNRs hosting magnetars is consistent with the magnetic OB
stars with high fields.

supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 103 (G332.4-00.4) containing the Central Compact
Object 1E 161348-5055. The high resolution Chandra X-ray images reveal enhanced
emission in the south-eastern and north-western regions. Equivalent width line
images of Fe L, Mg, Si, and S using XMM-Newton data were used to map the
distribution of ejecta. The SNR was sectioned into 56 regions best
characterized by two-component thermal models. The harder component (kT~0.6
keV) is adequately fitted by the VPSHOCK non-equilibrium ionization model with
an ionization timescale ~ 1E11-1E12 cm^-3 s, and slightly enhanced abundances
over solar values. The soft component (kT~0.2 keV), fitted by the APEC model,
is well described by plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium with
abundances consistent with solar values. Assuming a distance of 3.1 kpc and a
Sedov phase of expansion into a uniform medium, we estimate an SNR age of 4.4
kyr, a swept-up mass M_sw=16 f_s^{-1/2} D_{3.1}^{5/2} solar masses, and a low
explosion energy E=3.7E49 f_s^{-1/2} D_{3.1}^{5/2} erg. This energy could be an
order of magnitude higher if we relax the Sedov assumption, the plasma has a
low filling factor, the plasma temperature is under-estimated, or if the SNR is
expanding into the progenitor's wind-blown bubble. Standard explosion models
did not match the ejecta yields. By comparing the fitted abundances to the most
recent core-collapse nucleosynthesis models, our best estimate yields a
low-mass progenitor around 12-13 solar masses, lower than previously reported.
We discuss degeneracies in the model fitting, particularly the effect of
altering the explosion energy on the progenitor mass estimate.

For high-dimensional simulation data, it also shows superior performance to
simultaneously estimate K and feature sparsity parameter. Finally, we evaluated

of these cosmogenic neutrinos depends on multiple parameters, describing the
sources and propagation of UHECRs. In our recent paper (van Vliet et al. 2019),
we show that a `sweet spot` occurs at a neutrino energy of $E_{\nu} \sim 1$
EeV. At that energy the flux mainly depends on two parameters, the source
evolution and the fraction of protons in UHECRs at Earth for $E_p \gtrsim 30$
EeV. Therefore, with current upper limits on the cosmogenic neutrino flux at
$E_{\nu} \sim 1$ EeV and assuming a certain source class, a constraint on the
composition of UHECRs can be obtained. This constraint is independent of
hadronic interaction models and indicates that the combination of a large
proton fraction and a strong source evolution is disfavored. Upcoming neutrino
experiments will be able to constrain the fraction of protons in UHECRs even
further, and for any realistic model for the evolution of UHECR sources.

masters, including Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Edvard
Munch. As these paintings age, their cadmium yellow paints are undergoing
severe fading, flaking, and discolouration. These effects are associated with
photodegradation, the light-facilitated reactions of CdS with oxygen, moisture,
and even the paint binding medium. The use of common optical and X-ray methods
to characterize the physical state of the pigment is challenging due to the
mixing of the various components of the paint at length scales smaller than
their resolution. Here, we present an atomic-scale structural and chemical
analysis of the CdS pigment in Edvard Munch's The Scream (c. 1910, Munch
Museet), enabled by new electron microscope detector technologies. We show that
the CdS pigment consists of clusters of defective nanoparticles ~5-10 nm in
diameter. It is known from the modern use of such particles in photocatalysis
that they are inherently vulnerable to photodegradation. Chlorine doping and a
polytype crystal structure further enhance the sensitivity of the CdS pigment
to photodegradation. In addition to The Scream, we have also observed this
inherently unstable pigment structure in Henri Matisse's Flower Piece (1906,

structures and impurities described here can now be used to predict which

inspired by the Fibonacci recurrence, $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$, until a
decomposition without consecutive terms is reached; whoever makes the last move
wins. We look at a game resulting from a generalization of the Fibonacci
numbers, the Fibonacci Quilt sequence. These arise from the two-dimensional
geometric property of tiling the plane through the Fibonacci spiral. Beginning
with 1 in the center, we place integers in the squares of the spiral such that
each square contains the smallest positive integer that does not have a
decomposition as the sum of previous terms that do not share a wall. This
sequence eventually follows two recurrence relations, allowing us to construct
a variation on the Zeckendorf Game, the Fibonacci Quilt Game. While some
properties of the Fibonaccis are inherited by this sequence, the nature of its
recurrence leads to others, such as Zeckendorf's theorem, no longer holding; it
is thus of interest to investigate the generalization of the game in this
setting to see which behaviors persist. We prove, similar to the original game,
that this game also always terminates in a legal decomposition, give a lower
bound on game lengths, show that depending on strategies the length of the game
can vary and either player could win, and give a conjecture on the length of a

quantitative estimates remain uncertain because of a poor understanding of
changes in convective dynamics. This uncertainty is addressed here by analyzing
idealized convection-permitting simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium
in long-channel geometry. Across a wide range of climates, the thermodynamic
contribution to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows
near-surface moisture, and the dynamic contribution is positive and small, but
sensitive to domain size. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated with
precipitation extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors
strong vertical motion at levels where the vertical saturation specific
humidity gradient is large, and mass flux profiles collapse to a common shape
across climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate. The
collapse, robust to changes in microphysics and turbulence schemes, implies a
thermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite
substantial convergence aloft and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined
by the pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode
to vertical velocities from entraining plume models reveals that the small
dynamic mode in channel simulations (<~2 %/K) is caused by opposing
height-dependences of vertical velocity and density, together with the
buffering influence of cloud-base buoyancies that vary little with surface
temperature. These results reinforce an emerging picture of the response of
extreme tropical precipitation rates to warming: a thermodynamic mode of about
7 %/K dominates, with a minor contribution from changes in dynamics.

determining the minimal number of tests required by a given strategy to achieve
a given precision. In the case of homogeneous strategies, we can even derive an
analytical formula. Furthermore, we propose a general recipe to verifying pure
quantum states in the adversarial scenario by virtue of protocols for the
nonadversarial scenario. Thanks to this recipe, the resource cost for verifying
an arbitrary pure state in the adversarial scenario is comparable to the
counterpart for the nonadversarial scenario, and the overhead is at most three
times for high-precision verification. Our recipe can readily be applied to
efficiently verify bipartite pure states, stabilizer states, hypergraph states,
weighted graph states, and Dicke states in the adversarial scenario, even if

future large-scale cosmic-ray observatories. It has recently been shown that
this kind of instrumentation can provide a resolution of the energy and of the
shower maximum on the level of other cosmic-ray detection methods. Due to the
dominant geomagnetic nature of the air-shower radio emission in the traditional
frequency band of 30 to 80 MHz, the amplitude and polarization of the radio
signal strongly depend on the azimuth and zenith angle of the arrival
direction. Thus, the estimation of the efficiency and subsequently of the
aperture of an antenna array is more complex than for particle or
Cherenkov-light detectors. We have built a new efficiency model based on
utilizing a lateral distribution function as a shower model, and a
probabilistic treatment of the detection process. The model is compared to the
data measured by the Tunka Radio Extension (Tunka-Rex), a digital antenna array
with an area of about 1 km$^2$ located in Siberia at the Tunka Advanced
Instrument for Cosmic rays and Gamma Ray Astronomy (TAIGA). Tunka-Rex detects
radio emission of air showers using trigger from air-Cherenkov and particle
detectors. The present study is an essential step towards the measurement of
the cosmic-ray flux with Tunka-Rex, and is important for radio measurements of
air showers in general.

the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo
optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates
elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the
QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The
model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed
phase for a set of water clusters with an MAE binding energy error of less than
0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3,200 samples. For force learning on
the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art

can be described by a subspace of a vector space. The subspace representation
has been employed for pattern-set recognition, and its tensor representation

do not use discriminative information of the tensors, degrading the
classification accuracy. In this case, generalized difference subspace (GDS)
provides an enhanced subspace representation by reducing data redundancy and
revealing discriminative structures. Since GDS does not handle tensor data, we
propose a new projection called n-mode GDS, which efficiently handles tensor
data. We also introduce the n-mode Fisher score as a class separability index
and an improved metric based on the geodesic distance for tensor data
similarity. The experimental results on gesture and action recognition show
that the proposed method outperforms methods commonly used in the literature

robot in the graph (but the graph is unknown to robots). We provide three novel
deterministic algorithms, two for arbitrary graphs and one for arbitrary trees,
in a synchronous setting where all robots perform their actions in every time
step. For arbitrary graphs, our first algorithm is based on a DFS traversal and
guarantees $O(\min(m,k\Delta))$ steps runtime using $\Theta(\log
(\max(k,\Delta)))$ bits at each robot, where $m$ is the number of edges and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. The second algorithm for arbitrary
graphs is based on a BFS traversal and guarantees $O( \max(D,k) \Delta
(D+\Delta))$ steps runtime using $O(\max(D,\Delta \log k))$ bits at each robot,
where $D$ is the diameter of the graph. The algorithm for arbitrary trees is
also based on a BFS travesal and guarantees $O(D\max(D,k))$ steps runtime using
$O(\max(D,\Delta \log k))$ bits at each robot. Our results are significant
improvements compared to the existing results established in the {\em local
communication} model where a robot can communication only with other robots
present at the same node. Particularly, the DFS-based algorithm is optimal for
both memory and time in constant-degree arbitrary graphs. The BFS-based
algorithm for arbitrary trees is optimal with respect to runtime when $k\leq

with the generation of random weights and biases as these are difficult to set

drawn from an interval which is fixed before or adapted during the learning
process. Due to the different functions of the weights and biases, selecting
them both from the same interval is not a good idea. Recently more
sophisticated methods of random parameters generation have been developed, such
as the data-driven method proposed in \cite{Anon19}, where the sigmoids are
placed in randomly selected regions of the input space and then their slopes
are adjusted to the local fluctuations of the target function. In this work, we
propose an extended version of this method, which constructs iteratively the
network architecture. This method successively generates new hidden nodes and
accepts them if the training error decreases significantly. The threshold of
acceptance is adapted to the current training stage. At the beginning of the
training process only those nodes which lead to the largest error reduction are
accepted. Then, the threshold is reduced by half to accept those nodes which
model the target function details more accurately. This leads to faster
convergence and more compact network architecture, as it includes only
""significant"" neurons. Several application examples are given which confirm
this thesis.

debris cloud of mass or order 1e9 kg, peaking on UT 2019 May 24+/-$12. This is
56 days before perihelion and at a heliocentric distance of 1.9 AU. We consider
potential mechanisms of disintegration. Tidal disruption is ruled-out, because
the comet has not passed within the Roche sphere of any planet. Impact
disruption is implausible, because the comet orbit is highly inclined
(inclination 105.1 deg) and disruption occurred far above the ecliptic, where
asteroids are rare. The back-pressure generated by sublimation (0.02 to 0.4
N/m2) is orders of magnitude smaller than the reported compressive strength (30
to 150 N/m2) of cometary material and, therefore, is of no importance. The
depletion of volatiles by sublimation occurs too slowly to render the nucleus
inactive on the timescale of infall. However, we find that the e-folding
timescale for spin-up of the nucleus by the action of sublimation torques is
shorter than the infall time, provided the nucleus radius is smaller than 0.4
km. Thus, the disintegration of C/2019 J2 is tentatively interpreted as the
rotational disruption of a sub-kilometer nucleus caused by outgassing torques.

the existence of a gapless Chiral Density Wave (CDW), i.e. an axion-like
acoustic mode of an irrotational and dissipationless Hamiltonian perfect fluid,
that is a correlated fermion/anti-fermion pair excitation of the Fermi-Dirac
sea. In $D\!=\!2$ dimensions the chiral superfluid effective action coincides
with that of the Schwinger model as $e\rightarrow 0$, and the CDW acoustic mode
is precisely the Schwinger boson. Since this identity holds also at zero chiral
chemical potential, the Dirac vacuum itself may be viewed as a quantum
superfluid state. The CDW collective boson is a $U(1)$ chiral phase field,
which is gapless as a result of a novel, non-linear realization of Goldstone's
theorem, extended to this case of symmetry breaking by an anomaly. A new local
form of the axial anomaly bosonic effective action in any $D$ even spacetime is
given, consistent with superfluidity, and its quantization is shown to be
required by the anomalous Schwinger terms in fermion current commutators. In
QED$_4$ this collective Goldstone mode appears as a massless pole in the axial

$\mathcal{P}=\frac{|\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}|^2}{|\Psi_{\mathcal{B}}|^2}$, with
$\Psi_{\mathcal{B,N}}$ solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation corresponding

Sitter for both up- and down-tunnelling agrees with the original result based
on Euclidean instanton methods. Expanding on the work of Fischler, Morgan and
Polchinski we find that the Minkowski to de Sitter transition is possible as in
the original Euclidean approach of Farhi, Guth and Guven. We further generalise

points for the classical motion of the wall in de Sitter to de Sitter
transitions. We address several challenges for the viability of the Minkowski

other ambiguities of the Euclidean approach. We briefly discuss the

cavities in addition to molecular shells with expansion velocities of a few km
s$^{-1}$. The pressure owing to stellar winds primarily drives these expanding
shells and sweeps up the surrounding matter to distances of a few pc. The
column densities of shells are enhanced by a minimum of 14% for one region to a
maximum of 88% for another region with respect to the column densities within
their central cavities. No active star formation - including molecular
condensations, protostars, or ionized gas - is found inside the cavities,
whereas such features are observed around the molecular shells. Although the
expansion of ionized gas is considered an effective mechanism to trigger star
formation, the dynamical ages of the HII regions in our sample are generally
not sufficiently long to do so efficiently. Overall, our results hint at the
possible importance of negative W-R wind-driven feedback on the gas-deficient

at the qualitative level, establishing a quantitative statement is more
challenging. In this work we take new steps towards quantifying symmetry
violation in EFTs with gravity. First, we evaluate global charge violation by
microscopic black holes present in a thermal system, which represents an
irreducible, universal effect at finite temperature. Second, based on general
QFT considerations, we propose that local symmetry-violating processes should
be faster than black hole-induced processes at any sub-Planckian temperature.
Such a proposal can be seen as part of the ""swampland"" program to constrain
EFTs emerging from quantum gravity. Considering an EFT perspective, we
formulate a conjecture which requires the existence of operators violating
global symmetry and places quantitative bounds on them. We study the interplay
of our conjecture with emergent symmetries in QFT. In models where gauged
U(1)'s enforce accidental symmetries, we find that constraints from the Weak
Gravity Conjecture can ensure that our conjecture is satisfied. We also study
the consistency of the conjecture with QFT models of emergent symmetries such

the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies. This assembly history should
be detectable in the orbital and chemical properties of stars. The H3 Survey is
obtaining spectra for 200,000 stars, and, when combined with Gaia data, is
providing detailed orbital and chemical properties of Galactic halo stars.
Unlike previous surveys of the halo, the H3 target selection is based solely on
magnitude and Gaia parallax; the survey therefore provides a nearly unbiased
view of the entire stellar halo at high latitudes. In this paper we present the
distribution of stellar metallicities as a function of Galactocentric distance
and orbital properties for a sample of 4232 kinematically-selected halo giants
to 100 kpc. The stellar halo is relatively metal-rich, [Fe/H]=-1.2, and there
is no discernable metallicity gradient over the range $6<R_{\rm gal}<100$ kpc.
However, the halo metallicity distribution is highly structured including
distinct metal-rich and metal-poor components at $R_{\rm gal}<10$ kpc and
$R_{\rm gal}>30$ kpc, respectively. Metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]$<-2$ are a
small population of the halo at all distances and orbital categories. We
associate the ""in-situ"" stellar halo with stars displaying thick-disk chemistry
on halo-like orbits; such stars are confined to $|z|<10$ kpc. The majority of
the stellar halo is resolved into discrete features in orbital-chemical space,
suggesting that the bulk of the stellar halo formed from the accretion and
tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies. (ABRIDGED)

cluster lying in the vicinity of the giant branch and 1--2 magnitudes
fainter/brighter than the main-sequence turn-off in the cluster color-magnitude
diagram and which cover an area on the sky of $\sim$4.1 deg$^{2}$ centered on
the cluster. We traced back the orbit of NGC 6362 in a realistic Milky-Way
potential, using the \texttt{GravPot16} package, for 3 Gyrs. The orbit shows
that the cluster shares similar orbital properties as the inner disk, having
peri-/apo-galactic distances, and maximum vertical excursion from the Galactic
plane inside the corotation radius (CR), moving inwards from CR radius to visit
the inner regions of the Milky Way. The dynamical history of the cluster
reveals that it has crossed the Galactic disk several times in its lifetime and
has recently undergone a gravitational shock, $\sim 15.9$ Myr ago, suggesting
that less than 0.1\% of its mass has been lost during the current disk-shocking
event. Based on the cluster's orbit and position in the Galaxy, we conclude
that the possible extended star debris candidates are a combined effect of the
shocks from the Galactic disk and evaporation from the cluster. Lastly, the
evolution of the vertical component of the angular momentum shows that the
cluster is strongly affected dynamically by the Galactic bar potential.

the Standard Model. In this paper we consider a typical minimal scenario in
which it gets spontaneously broken by scalar triplets. Such a realization has
been scrutinized over the past few decades chiefly in the context of collider
studies. In this work we take a complementary approach and investigate whether
the model can be probed via the search for a stochastic gravitational wave
background induced by the phase transition in which $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L
\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ is broken down to the Standard Model gauge
symmetry group. A prerequisite for gravitational wave production in this
context is a first-order phase transition, the occurrence of which we find in a
significant portion of the parameter space. Although the produced gravitational
waves are typically too weak for a discovery at any current or future detector,
upon investigating correlations between all relevant terms in the scalar
potential, we have identified values of parameters leading to observable
signals. This indicates that, given a certain moderate fine-tuning, the minimal
left-right symmetric model with scalar triplets features another powerful probe
which can lead to either novel constraints or remarkable discoveries in the
near future. Let us note that some of our results, such as the full set of
thermal masses, have to the best of our knowledge not been presented before and

these symmetries (together with a component of global hypercharge) can be
consistently gauged, if the Standard Model (SM) fermion content is augmented by
three chiral SM singlet states. Within this framework of $U(1)$ extensions of
the SM one generically expects flavour non-universality to emerge in the
charged leptons, in such a way that naturally prevents lepton flavour
violation, by aligning the mass and weak eigenbases. For quarks, all the SM
Yukawa couplings responsible for their observed masses and mixings arise at the
renormalisable level. We perform fits to show that models in this class can
explain $R_{K^{(\ast)}}$ and the other neutral current $B$ anomaly data if we
introduce a heavy vector-like quark to mediate the required quark flavour
violation, while simultaneously satisfying other constraints from direct
$Z^\prime$ searches at the LHC, $B_s$ meson mixing, a number of electroweak
precision observables, and neutrino trident production. Within this
symmetry-motivated framework of models, we find interesting implications for
the flavour anomalies; notably, any axial couplings of the $Z^\prime$ to

composed of two merging groups with a total halo mass of $\log{(M_{\rm

a Virgo-like cluster ($>10^{14} M_{\odot}$). We compare the CO line widths and
the CO luminosities with galaxies in other (proto)clusters ($n_{\rm gal}=91$)
and general fields ($n_{\rm gal}=80$) from other studies. The 4C23.56
protocluster galaxies have CO line widths and luminosities comparable to other
protocluster galaxies on average. On the other hand, the CO line widths are on
average broader by $\approx50\%$ compared to field galaxies, while the median
CO luminosities are similar. The broader line widths can be attributed to both
effects of unresolved gas-rich mergers and/or compact gas distribution, which
is supported by our limited but decent angular resolution observations and the
size estimate of three galaxies. Based on these results, we argue that gas-rich
mergers may play a role in the retention of the specific angular momentum to a
value similar to that of field populations during cluster assembly, though we

Recent studies have found a relation between the ratio of lines originating
from the second and first vibrationally excited state, denoted as $v2/v1$, and
the emitting radius of CO. In disks around Herbig Ae stars the vibrational
excitation is low when CO lines come from close to the star, and high when
lines only probe gas at large radii (more than 5 AU). We aim to find
explanations for the observed trends between CO vibrational ratio, emitting
radii, and NIR excess, and identify their implications in terms of the physical
and chemical structure of inner disks around Herbig stars. Slab models and full
disk thermo chemical models are calculated. Simulated observations from the
models are directly compared to the data. Broad CO lines with low vibrational
ratios are best explained by a warm (400-1300 K) inner disk surface with
gas-to-dust ratios below 1000; no CO is detected within/at the inner dust rim,
due to dissociation at high temperatures. In contrast, explaining the narrow
lines with high vibrational ratios requires an inner cavity of a least 5 AU in
both dust and gas, followed by a cool (100-300 K) molecular gas reservoir with
gas-to-dust ratios greater than 10000 at the cavity wall. In all cases the CO
gas must be close to thermalization with the dust. The high gas-to-dust ratios
needed to explain high $v2/v1$ in narrow CO lines for a subset of group I disks
can naturally be interpreted as due to the dust traps that have been proposed
to explain millimeter dust cavities. The broad lines seen in most group II
objects indicate a very flat disk in addition to inner disk substructures
within 10 AU that can be related to the substructures recently observed with

features has been shown to be an accurate and transferable approach to the
prediction of post-Hartree-Fock correlation energies. Previous applications of
MOB-ML employed Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which provides good
prediction accuracy with small training sets; however, the cost of GPR training
scales cubically with the amount of data and becomes a computational bottleneck
for large training sets. In the current work, we address this problem by
introducing a clustering/regression/classification implementation of MOB-ML. In
a first step, regression clustering (RC) is used to partition the training data
to best fit an ensemble of linear regression (LR) models; in a second step,
each cluster is regressed independently, using either LR or GPR; and in a third
step, a random forest classifier (RFC) is trained for the prediction of cluster
assignments based on MOB feature values. Upon inspection, RC is found to
recapitulate chemically intuitive groupings of the frontier molecular orbitals,
and the combined RC/LR/RFC and RC/GPR/RFC implementations of MOB-ML are found
to provide good prediction accuracy with greatly reduced wall-clock training
times. For a dataset of thermalized geometries of 7211 organic molecules of up
to seven heavy atoms, both implementations reach chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol
error) with only 300 training molecules, while providing 35000-fold and
4500-fold reductions in the wall-clock training time, respectively, compared to
MOB-ML without clustering. The resulting models are also demonstrated to retain
transferability for the prediction of large-molecule energies with only
small-molecule training data. Finally, it is shown that capping the number of
training datapoints per cluster leads to further improvements in prediction
accuracy with negligible increases in wall-clock training time.

(SM) with two additional Higgs doublets with small vacuum expectation values.
The additional Higgs fields interact with SM fermions through complex Yukawa
couplings, leading to new sources of CP violation. We propose a simple flavor
model with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ or less Yukawa couplings for quarks and charged
leptons, consistent with current flavor constraints. To generate neutrino
masses and the baryon asymmetry, right-handed neutrinos in the $\sim 0.1-10$
TeV range couple to the ""Higgs Troika."" The new Higgs doublet masses could be
near the TeV scale, allowing for asymmetric decays into Standard Model lepton
doublets and right-handed neutrinos. The asymmetry in lepton doublets is then
processed into a baryon asymmetry, similar to leptogenesis. Since the masses of
the new fields are near the TeV scale, there is potentially a rich high energy
collider phenomenology, including observable deviations in the 125 GeV Higgs
decay into muons and taus, as well as detectable low energy signals such as the
electron EDM or $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$. Hence, this is in principle a
testable model for generation of baryon asymmetry, similar in that respect to

in strongly correlated quantum systems. They apply under different conditions,
but do not cover the full range of many-body models. It is hence desirable to
further expand the toolbox. Here, we propose to use quasiparticle properties to
detect quantum phase transitions. The approach is independent from the choice
of boundary conditions, and it does not assume a particular lattice structure.
The probe is hence suitable for, e.g., fractals and quasicrystals. The method
requires that one can reliably create quasiparticles in the considered systems.
In the simplest cases, this can be done by a pinning potential, while it is
less straightforward in more complicated systems. We apply the method to
several rather different examples, including one that cannot be handled by the
commonly used probes, and in all the cases we find that the numerical costs are
low. This is so, because a simple property, such as the charge of the anyons,
is sufficient to detect the phase transition point. For some of the examples,
this allows us to study larger systems and/or further parameter values compared
to previous studies.

Aubry-Andr\'e model. Even though this model exhibits the same duality relation
as the one-dimensional version, its localisation properties are found to be
substantially more complex. In particular, partially extended single-particle
states appear for arbitrarily strong quasiperiodic modulation. They are
concentrated on a network of low-disorder lattice lines, while the rest of the
lattice hosts localised states. This spatial separation protects the localised
states from delocalisation, so no mobility edge emerges in the spectrum.
Instead, localised and partially extended states are interspersed, giving rise
to an unusual type of mixed spectrum and enabling complex dynamics even in the
absence of interactions. A striking example is ballistic transport across the
low-disorder lines while the rest of the system remains localised. This
behaviour is robust against disorder and other weak perturbations. Our model is
thus directly amenable to experimental studies and promises fascinating
many-body localisation properties.

the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is very puzzling: young clusters are all
compact, while the oldest systems show both small and large sizes. It is
commonly interpreted as due to a population of binary black holes driving a
progressive expansion of cluster cores. Here we propose, instead, that it is
the natural consequence of the fact that only relatively low-mass clusters have
formed in the last ~3 Gyr in the LMC and only the most compact systems survived
and are observable. The spread in size displayed by the oldest (and most
massive) clusters, instead, can be explained in terms of initial conditions and
internal dynamical evolution. To quantitatively explore the role of the latter,
we selected a sample of five coeval and old LMC clusters with different sizes,
and we estimated their dynamical age from the level of central segregation of
blue straggler stars (the so-called dynamical clock). Similarly to what found
in the Milky Way, we indeed measure different levels of dynamical evolution
among the selected coeval clusters, with large-core systems being dynamically
younger than those with small size. This behaviour is fully consistent with
what expected from internal dynamical evolution processes over timescales
mainly set by the structure of each system at formation.

image captioning systems. Popular metrics, such as BLEU and CIDEr, are based
solely on text matching between reference captions and machine-generated
captions, potentially leading to biased evaluations because references may not
fully cover the image content and natural language is inherently ambiguous.
Building upon a machine-learned text-image grounding model, TIGEr allows to
evaluate caption quality not only based on how well a caption represents image
content, but also on how well machine-generated captions match human-generated
captions. Our empirical tests show that TIGEr has a higher consistency with
human judgments than alternative existing metrics. We also comprehensively
assess the metric's effectiveness in caption evaluation by measuring the
correlation between human judgments and metric scores.

to deliver features, e.g., image recognition, that require high prediction
accuracy. Such models can be both computation and memory-intensive, even for
newer mobile devices, and are therefore commonly hosted in powerful remote
servers. However, current cloud-based inference services employ static model
selection approach that can be suboptimal for satisfying application SLAs
(service level agreements), as they fail to account for inherent dynamic mobile
environment.
  We introduce a cloud-based technique called ModiPick that dynamically selects
the most appropriate model for each inference request, and adapts its selection
to match different SLAs and execution time budgets that are caused by variable
mobile environments. The key idea of ModiPick is to make inference speed and
accuracy trade-offs at runtime with a pool of managed deep learning models. As
such, ModiPick masks unpredictable inference time budgets and therefore meets
SLA targets, while improving accuracy within mobile network constraints. We
evaluate ModiPick through experiments based on prototype systems and through
simulations. We show that ModiPick achieves comparable inference accuracy to a
greedy approach while improving SLA adherence by up to 88.5%.

converges almost surely to a deterministic limit evolution. We prove a
large-deviation principle on path space for the empirical measure, by
exploiting a one-to-one mapping between the hard-rod system and a system of
non-interacting particles on a shorter domain. The large-deviation principle
naturally identifies a gradient-flow structure for the limit evolution, with
clear interpretations for both the driving functional (an `entropy') and the
dissipation, which in this case is the Wasserstein dissipation.
  This study is inspired by recent developments in the continuum modelling of
multiple-species interacting particle systems with finite-size effects; for
such systems many different modelling choices appear in the literature, raising
the question how one can understand such choices in terms of more microscopic

Cartan's moving frame method to the problem of the equivalence of submanifolds
under a Lie group action. We adopt a general definition of a moving frame as an
equivariant map from the space of submanifolds to the group itself and
introduce two algorithms, which simplify the construction of such maps. The
first algorithm is applicable when the group factors as a product of two
subgroups $G=BA$, allowing us to use moving frames and differential invariants
for the groups $A$ and $B$ in order to construct a moving frame and
differential invariants for $G$. This approach produces the relations among the
invariants of $G$ and its subgroups. We use the groups of the projective, the
affine and the Euclidean transformations on the plane to illustrate the
algorithm. We also introduce a recursive algorithm, allowing, provided the
group action satisfies certain conditions, to construct differential invariants
order by order, at each step normalizing more and more of the group parameters,
at the end obtaining a moving frame for the entire group. The development of
this algorithm has been motivated by the applications of the moving frame
method to the problems of the equivalence and symmetry of polynomials under
linear changes of variables. In the complex or real case these problems can be
reduced and, in theory, completely solved as the problem of the equivalence of
submanifolds. Its solution however involves algorithms based on the Gr\""obner
basis computations, which due to their complexity, are not always feasible.
Nevertheless, some interesting new results were obtained, such as a
classification of ternary cubics and their groups of symmetries, and the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a homogeneous polynomial in three
variables to be equivalent to $x^n+y^n+z^n.$

high-resolution stellar spectra in and around each cluster using the

velocities and positions of the stars observed in each cluster were used as

velocity dispersion of $2.44^{+0.37}_{-0.21}\ {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, corresponding
to a total mass of $7.6^{+2.5}_{-1.3}\times10^4\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $V$-band
$M/L$ ratio of $0.22^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ in solar units. For NGC 1846, the

both clusters, though in neither cluster does rotation alter our mass estimates
significantly. We critically compare our findings with those of previous

enables joint estimation in a flexible manner, as we make no assumptions on the
directionality of influence across the data types or the extent of network
similarity across the sample groups and platforms. In addition, our model
formulation allows the number of variables and number of subjects to differ
across the data types, and only requires that we have data for the same set of

an application to gene expression levels and metabolite abundances on subjects

analyze this problem for synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training
of deep learning models, we developed a performance model of computation time

Server (PS), peer-to-peer (P2P), and Ring allreduce (RA). To complement and
corroborate our analytical models with quantitative results, we evaluated the

successfully decouple network usage from the number of workers in the system.

at the parameter server side. While P2P systems fare better than 1PS systems,
they still suffer from significant network bottleneck. Finally, RA systems also
excel by virtue of overlapping computation time and communication time, which
PS and P2P architectures fail to achieve.

medical datasets which require high-cost and time-consuming annotations.
Furthermore, medical datasets are usually imbalanced, a condition that often
hinders classifiers performance. The aim of this paper is to learn the
distribution of the minority class to synthesise new samples in order to
improve lesion detection in mammography. Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) can efficiently generate breast masses. They are
trained on increasing-size subsets of one mammographic dataset and used to
generate diverse and realistic breast masses. The effect of including the
generated images and/or applying horizontal and vertical flipping is tested in
an environment where a 1:10 imbalanced dataset of masses and normal tissue
patches is classified by a fully-convolutional network. A maximum of ~ 0:09
improvement of F1 score is reported by using DCGANs along with flipping
augmentation over using the original images. We show that DCGANs can be used

Thus, portable muon detectors may be useful to 1) study seasonal and short-term
middle atmosphere dynamics, especially in locations where data is lacking such
as mid-latitudes; and 2) improve the calibration of the effective temperature
coefficient for different opacity conditions. Furthermore, we highlight the
importance of assessing the impact of temperature on muon rate variations when
considering geophysical applications. Depending on latitude and opacity
conditions, this effect may be large enough to hide subsurface density
variations due to changes in groundwater content, and should therefore be
removed from the time-series.

  decomposition process",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Requirement decomposition is a widely accepted Systems Engineering practice
for Requirements Engineering. Getting the requirements correct at the very
beginning of the lifecycle is crucial for the success of engineering a correct
system. This is especially the case for safety-critical complex systems, where
incorrect or clashing requirements can lead to accidents. While there is a
large volume of work on the formal verification for the bottom-up composition
of requirements, there are very few works on how these requirements are
rigorously decomposed top-down in the first place. This paper tackles this
problem. Inspired by Contract-Based Design, we develop a formalism for
requirement decomposition, which can mathematically guarantee a satisfactory
system implementation if certain conditions are respected. A systematic
methodology is then designed to semi-automatically search for the optimal
sub-requirements and guarantee their correctness upon definition. The proposed
approach is supported by existing formal methods (i.e., Reachability Analysis
and Constraint Programming) that have been applied to other areas. Finally, we
support our findings through a case study on a cruise control system to
illustrate the usability of the proposed approach.

it possible for people to search for products through conversations when they
have purchase needs. During the interactions, the system could ask questions on
certain aspects of the ideal products to clarify the users' needs. For example,
previous work proposed to ask users the exact characteristics of their ideal
items before showing results. However, users may not have clear ideas about
what an ideal item looks like, especially when they have not seen any item. So
it is more feasible to facilitate the conversational search by showing example
items and asking for feedback instead. In addition, when the users provide
negative feedback for the presented items, it is easier to collect their
detailed feedback on certain properties (aspect-value pairs) of the
non-relevant items. By breaking down the item-level negative feedback to
fine-grained feedback on aspect-value pairs, more information is available to
help clarify users' intents. So in this paper, we propose a conversational
paradigm for product search driven by non-relevant items, based on which
fine-grained feedback is collected and utilized to show better results in the
next iteration. We then propose an aspect-value likelihood model to incorporate
both positive and negative feedback on fine-grained aspect-value pairs of the

better than state-of-the-art product search baselines without using feedback

leverages the unique characteristics of fonts. The key idea is that font images
are synthetic and can therefore be controlled by the learning algorithm. We
design an integrated rendering and learning process so that the visual feature
from one image can be used to reconstruct another image with different text.
The resulting feature captures important font design details while is robust to
nuisance factors such as text. We propose a novel attention mechanism to
re-weight the visual feature for joint visual-text modeling. We combine the

multiple instance learning setting to automatically mine probable true positive

second stage trains a smaller capacity model, i.e., shallower and more
generalizable, with the mined ROIs to perform localized analyses to classify
fractures. During inference, our method detects hip and pelvic fractures in one
pass by chaining the probability outputs of the two stages together. We
evaluate our method on 4 410 PXRs, reporting an area under the ROC curve value
of 0.975, the highest among state-of-the-art fracture detection methods.

account the shock age, preshock density, and magnetic field. For preshock
densities $10^3$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, the the predicted shifts of line centers,
and the line widths, of the H$_2$ lines range from 20-2, and 30-4 km/s,
respectively. The a priori models are compared to the observed line profiles,
showing that clumps C and G can be explained by shocks into gas with density
10$^3$ to $2\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and strong magnetic fields. For clump B2 (a
fainter region near clump B), the H$_2$ spectrum requires a J-type shock into
moderate density (~100 cm$^{-3}$) with the gas accelerated to 100 km/s from its
pre-shock location. Clump B1 requires both a magnetic-dominated C-type shock

segmentation provides useful imaging biomarkers in evaluating atherosclerotic
lesions and plaque progression time-efficiently. To quantify vessel wall
features, drawing lumen and outer wall contours of the artery of interest is
required. To alleviate manual labor in contour drawing, some computer-assisted
tools exist, but manual preprocessing steps, such as region of interest
identification and boundary initialization are needed. In addition, the prior
knowledge of the ring shape of vessel wall is not taken into consideration in
designing the segmentation method. In this work, trained on manual vessel wall
contours, a fully automated artery localization and vessel wall segmentation
system is proposed. A tracklet refinement algorithm is used to robustly
identify the centerlines of arteries of interest from a neural network
localization architecture. Image patches are extracted from the centerlines and
segmented in a polar coordinate system to use 3D information and to overcome
problems such as contour discontinuity and interference from neighboring
vessels. From a carotid artery dataset with 116 subjects (3406 slices) and a
popliteal artery dataset with 5 subjects (289 slices), the proposed system is
shown to robustly identify the artery of interest and segment the vessel wall.
The proposed system demonstrates better performance on the carotid dataset with
a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.824, compared with traditional vessel wall
segmentation methods, Dice of 0.576, and traditional convolutional neural
network approaches, Dice of 0.747. This vessel wall segmentation system will
facilitate research on atherosclerosis and assist radiologists in image review.

using a gauge invariant effective field theory approach combined with a global

chemical systems, often avoiding the steep computational cost of usual
electronic structure methods. However, it often requires higher than 2-body
terms to achieve quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose the Polarized
MBE (PolBE) method where each MBE energy contribution is treated as an
embedding problem. In each energy term, a smaller fragment is embedded into a
larger, polarized environment and only a small region is treated at the
high-level of theory using embedded mean-field theory. The role of polarized
environment was found to be crucial in providing quantitative accuracy at the
2-body level. PolBE accurately predicts non-covalent interaction energies for a
number of systems, including CO$_2$, water, and hydrated ion clusters, with a
variety of interaction mechanisms, from weak dispersion to strong
electrostatics considered in this work. We further demonstrate that the PolBE
interaction energy is predominantly pairwise unlike the usual vacuum MBE which
requires higher-order terms to achieve similar accuracy. We numerically show
that PolBE often performs better than other widely used embedded MBE methods
such as the electrostatically embedded MBE. Owing to the lack of expensive
diagonalization of Fock matrices and its embarrassingly parallel nature, PolBE
is a promising way to access condensed phase systems with hybrid density
functionals that are difficult to treat with currently available methods.

interesting because the low mass and nearly Standard Model couplings of the
$125\,{\rm GeV}$ Higgs boson, $H$, are protected by approximate scale symmetry.
Another important but so far under-appreciated feature of these models is that
a sum rule bounds the masses of the new charged and neutral Higgs bosons
appearing in {\em all} these models to be below about $500\,{\rm GeV}$.
Therefore, they are within reach of LHC data currently or soon to be in hand.
Also so far unnoticed of these models, certain cubic and quartic Higgs scalar
couplings vanish at the classical level. This is due to spontaneous breaking of
the scale symmetry. These couplings become nonzero from explicit scale breaking
in the Coleman-Weinberg loop expansion of the effective potential. In a
two-Higgs doublet GW model, we calculate $\lambda_{HHH} \simeq
2(\lambda_{HHH})_{\rm SM} = 64\,{\rm GeV}$. This corresponds to $\sigma(pp \to
HH) \cong 15$--$20\,{\rm fb}$, its {\em minimum} value for $\sqrt{s} =
13$--$14\,{\rm TeV}$ at the LHC. It will require at least the $27\,{\rm TeV}$
HE-LHC to observe this cross section. We also find $\lambda_{HHHH} \simeq
4(\lambda_{HHHH})_{\rm SM} = 0.129$, whose observation in $pp \to HHH$ requires
a $100\,{\rm TeV}$ collider. Because of the above-mentioned sum rule, these
results apply to {\em all} GW models. In view of this unpromising forecast, we
stress that LHC searches for the new relatively light Higgs bosons of GW models
are by far the surest way to test them in this decade.

probability to eventually detect the particle after an arbitrary number of
detection attempts. It is demonstrated that this total detection probability is
less than unity in symmetric systems, where it is possible to find initial
states which are shielded from the detector by destructive interference,
so-called dark states. The identification of physically equivalent initial
states yields an upper bound for $P_{\rm det}$ in terms of the reciprocal of
the number $\nu$ of physically equivalent states. The relevant subgroup of the
system's symmetry operations is found to be the stabilizer of the detection
state. Using this, we prove that all bright, i.e. surely detectable, states are
symmetric with respect to the stabilizer. This implies that $P_{\rm det}$ can
be obtained from a diagonalization of the ""symmetrized"" Hamiltonian, instead of
having to find all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.

sphere typically accelerated strongly over a streamwise distance of one

Spheres with sufficient net upward force lifted off of the wall once released
before descending back towards the wall. These spheres mostly translated with
the fluid above the wall, undergoing saltation or resuspension, with minimal
rotation about all axes. By contrast, spheres that did not lift off after
release mainly slid along the wall. As they propagated downstream, they began
to roll forward with occasional lift-off events of smaller magnitude. All of

models to estimate solute concentrations, which were used in Archie's model to
compute bulk electrical conductivities at near-zero frequency. These bulk

conductivities, E4D simulated the real and complex electrical potential signals

through a synthetic tracer-transport model simulating tracer concentration and
electrical impedances for four frequencies. Later, SIP inversion estimated bulk
electrical conductivities by matching electrical impedances for each specified
frequency. The estimated bulk electrical conductivities were consistent with
the simulated tracer concentrations from the PFLOTRAN-SIP forward model.

massive clusters with ages down to (at least) 2 Gyr. This finding is important

provide much stronger constraints (e.g. on potential age spreads within the

shorter than their ergodicity time -- the most clear example being the Solar

defined by the evolution of the 4-point out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), of
integrable systems which are weakly perturbed by an external noise, a setting
that has proven to be illuminating in the classical case. In analogy to the
tangent space in classical systems, we derive a linear superoperator equation
which dictates the OTOC dynamics. We find that i) in the semi-classical limit
the quantum Lyapunov exponent is given by the classical one: it scales as
$\epsilon^{1/3}$, with $\epsilon$ being the variance of the random drive,
leading to short Lyapunov times compared to the diffusion time (which is $\sim
\epsilon^{-1}$). ii) in the highly quantal regime the Lyapunov instability is
suppressed by quantum fluctuations, and iii) for sufficiently small
perturbations the $\epsilon^{1/3}$ dependence is also suppressed -- another
purely quantum effect which we explain. These essential features of the problem
are already present in a rotor that is kicked weakly but randomly. Concerning
quantum limits on chaos, we find that quasi-integrable systems are relatively
good scramblers in the sense that the ratio between the Lyapunov exponent and

spectrum, optical emission can be very different in $f_{\nu}$ log slope, and in
flux relative to $\gamma$-rays,depending on model parameter values. The model
only allows a small set of $f_{\nu}$ log slopes in the optical -thereby
allowing a clear path to verification or falsification. Measurements of prompt
GRB emission in the optical thus far give no useful information about the
spectral shape within the band, and therefore cannot be used to evaluate such
predictions.
  We describe an experiment that responds to GRB alerts with a fast-slewing

compound Mn$_2$CoAl, evidence of spin-gapless behaviour in thin films has
typically been inferred from magnetotransport measurements. The spin gapless
state is however fragile, and further, band structure calculations indicate
that even a small amount of atomic disorder may destroy it. To explore the
impact of disorder on the properties of Mn$_2$CoAl, we have undertaken an
experimental study of the structural, magnetotransport and optical properties
from the far infrared to the UV, on DC magnetron sputtered Mn$_2$CoAl thin
films. A very short mean free path, of the order of a lattice spacing, is
extracted from the DC transport data. A room temperature resistivity of 200
$\mu$$\Omega$cm along with a small and negative temperature coefficient of
resistance between 4 and 400 K was measured. We note that parameters of this
magnitude are often observed in disordered metals. We find this behaviour is
well described by a weak localisation model, a result that is supported by a
large Drude contribution to the optical response, where a high scattering rate
is derived, which is equal to the value derived from the DC conductivity and
Hall effect data. We also note the strong similarities between the
magnetotransport behaviour reported for Mn$_2$CoAl films in the literature,
including ours. We conclude that, based on comparisons between the experimental
data, and recent band structure calculations that explicitly include disorder,
as-prepared Mn$_2$CoAl films are best described as a disordered metal, rather
than a spin gapless semiconductor.

hybridize and gap out, which can be probed by a set of Wilson loops. Our

will be taking images and(R~50)spectra of faint interplanetary dust structures
present in the habitable zone of nearby sunlike stars (~10 pc) and within the
snow-line of more distant ones(~20pc), down to dust density levels commensurate
with that of the solar system zodiacal cloud. Reaching contrast levels
below~10-7 for the first time, CGI will cross an important threshold in debris
disks physics, accessing disks with low enough optical depths that their
structure is dominated by transport phenomena than collisions. Hence, CGI
results will be crucial for determining how exozodiacal dust grains are
produced and transported in low-density disks around mature stars.
Additionally, CGI will be able to measure the brightness level and constrain
the degree of asymmetry of exozodiacal clouds around individual nearby sunlike
stars in the optical, at the ~10x solar zodiacal emission level. This
information will be extremely valuable for optimizing the observational
strategy of possible future exo-Earth direct imaging missions, especially those

community, literature comparing them is sparse but indicates a methodological
bias. While invivo data sets can ascertain the level of agreement between
tools, ground-truth is required to establish accuracy, and investigate the
sources of discrepancy. We present a novel approach to benchmarking GABA
quantification tools, using several series of phantom experiments with iterated
GABA concentration. Each series presents a different set of background
metabolites and environmental conditions allowing comparison of not only
individual estimates, but the ability of tools to characterise changes in GABA
across a range of potential confounds. The methodology of the phantom
experiments is presented, as well as characterisation of the data. We also
perform an initial comparative analysis of several common MRS quantification
tools and in-house code, to illustrate utility of the dataset and the potential
bias introduced by different quantification methods. The GABA-to-NAA ratios
reported by each tool are compared to the ground-truth, and estimation accuracy
is assessed by linear regression of this relationship. While the linearity of
GABA-to-NAA gradients is generally captured by all of the tools, a large
variation in the slope, offset and environmental stability of the gradient is
observed. The primary driver of differences in linear combination modelling is
the choice of basis function. However, tools employing a common basis and
pre-processing still produce differences on the order of 4%. Less-strictly
parametrised fitting approaches appear to improve the robustness of
quantification, but accurate modelling of edit efficiency calculations is still
necessary to avoid systematic offsets. In general, the level of variation

$\log(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}) = 4.25\pm0.10$, which yields a stellar radius $R =
310 \pm 70 R_{\odot}$. To fit the full spectrum, two additional components are
required: a blue excess that can be fitted either by a hot blackbody (T
$\gtrsim 20,000$ K) or a power law (spectral index $\alpha \approx 4$) and is
likely due to X-ray emission reprocessed in the outer accretion disk or the
donor star; and a red excess that is well fitted by a blackbody with a
temperature of $\sim 1100$ K, and is likely due to warm dust in the vicinity of
SN2010da. The presence of a red supergiant in this system implies an orbital
period of at least 0.8-2.1 years, assuming Roche lobe overflow. Given the large
donor-to-compact object mass ratio, orbital modulations of the radial velocity
of the red supergiant are likely undetectable. However, the radial velocity

We first show that for a $C^1$ generic diffeomorphism, a Dirac invariant
measure whose \emph{statistical basin of attraction} is dense in some open set
and has positive Lebesgue measure, must be supported in the orbit of a sink. We
then construct an example of a $C^1$-diffeomorphism having a Dirac invariant
measure, supported on a hyperbolic fixed point of saddle type, whose
statistical basin of attraction is a nowhere dense set with positive Lebesgue
measure. Our technique can be applied also to construct a $C^1$ diffeomorphism

dense.

value and the physical temperature $\Tph$ were employed in this study. The
normalized $q$-expectation value was expanded as a series of the value $(1-q)$,
where the absolute value $|1-q|$ is the measure of the deviation from the BG

smaller than that at $q'$ for $q>q'$. The sigma mass at $q$ is lighter than
that at $q'$ for $q>q'$ at low physical temperature, and the sigma mass at $q$
is heavier than that at $q'$ for $q>q'$ at high physical temperature. The pion
mass at $q$ is heavier than that at $q'$ for $q>q'$. The difference between the
pion masses at different values of $q$ is small for $\Tph \le 200$ MeV. That is

  Extraction","Accepted by WWW2020. Code available at

perfectly labeled data is limited, despite their success in label-sufficient
scenarios. Instead of seeking more instance-level labels from human annotators,
here we propose to annotate frequent surface patterns to form labeling rules.
These rules can be automatically mined from large text corpora and generalized
via a soft rule matching mechanism. Prior works use labeling rules in an exact
matching fashion, which inherently limits the coverage of sentence matching and
results in the low-recall issue. In this paper, we present a neural approach to
ground rules for RE, named NERO, which jointly learns a relation extraction
module and a soft matching module. One can employ any neural relation
extraction models as the instantiation for the RE module. The soft matching
module learns to match rules with semantically similar sentences such that raw
corpora can be automatically labeled and leveraged by the RE module (in a much
better coverage) as augmented supervision, in addition to the exactly matched
sentences. Extensive experiments and analysis on two public and widely-used
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NERO framework,
comparing with both rule-based and semi-supervised methods. Through user
studies, we find that the time efficiency for a human to annotate rules and
sentences are similar (0.30 vs. 0.35 min per label). In particular, NERO's
performance using 270 rules is comparable to the models trained using 3,000
labeled sentences, yielding a 9.5x speedup. Moreover, NERO can predict for
unseen relations at test time and provide interpretable predictions. We release
our code to the community for future research.

resources cause a robot to incur non-negative costs over the paths traveled,
which are occasionally zero-valued. This is intended to capture problems in
which a robot must manage resources such as visibility of threats, availability
of communications, and access to valuable measurements. This leaves freedom for
tie-breaking with respect to lower-priority resources; at the bottom of the
hierarchy is a strictly positive quantity consumed by the robot, such as
distance traveled, energy expended or time elapsed. We compare our method with
two other multi-objective approaches, a naive weighted sum method and an

  effects on the intensity of triboluminescence","19 pages, 6figures",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growing threat of energy crisis and the increasing need to power
microelectronic devices, people are seeking potential alternative energies that
can replace the conventional sources such as fossil fuels. Due to its simple
structure, low cost, and high performance, the triboelectric nanogenerator
(TENG) which is based on the contact electrification has become one of the most
promising candidates. Although plays a crucial role in determining the amount
of charge transfer of TENG, the fundamental mechanism that underlies the charge
transfer in the contact electrification of insulator-insulator contacts has
still not been completely understood. In this paper, the dynamics of charge
transfer in the contact electrification is investigated by observing the
triboluminescence of the sliding contacts and a theoretical model is proposed
for the electrification of insulator-insulator contacts. In the present
""Capacitor model"", the electron tunneling is assumed to be the dominating
mechanism in the electrification and the driving force for the electron
transfer is the contact potential difference, and thus, the electrification is
considered as a charging process of the capacitor formed by the contact
surfaces. The consistency between the predictions by the present model and the
experiments may confirm again that the electron transfer is the dominant
process in the contact electrification of insulator-insulator contacts.

much data is necessary to adequately fit a model. Non-asymptotic
characterizations of the performance of system identification methods provide
this knowledge. Such characterizations are available for several algorithms
performing open-loop identification. Often times, however, data is collected in
closed-loop. Application of open-loop identification methods to closed-loop
data can result in biased estimates. One method used by subspace identification
techniques to eliminate these biases involves first fitting a long-horizon
autoregressive model, then performing model reduction. The asymptotic behavior
of such algorithms is well characterized, but the non-asymptotic behavior is
not. This work provides a non-asymptotic characterization of one particular
variant of these algorithms. More specifically, we provide non-asymptotic upper
bounds on the generalization error of the produced model, as well as high
probability bounds on the difference between the produced model and the finite

a steady proliferation of diagnostic models and subcategories, that seems to be
inspired by the principle of ""divide and inflate"". This approach is in contrast
with experimental evidence, which suggests on one hand that traumas of various
kind are often present in the anamnesis of patients and, on the other, that the
gene variants implicated are shared across a wide range of diagnoses. In this
work I propose a holistic approach, built with tools borrowed from the field of
Artificial Intelligence. My model is based on two pillars. The first one is
trauma, which represents the attack to the mind, is psychological in nature and
has its origin in the environment. The second pillar is dissociation, which
represents the mind defence in both physiological and pathological conditions,
and incorporates all other defence mechanisms. Damages to dissociation can be
considered as another category of attacks, that are neurobiological in nature
and can be of genetic or environmental origin. They include, among other
factors, synaptic over-pruning, abuse of drugs and inflammation. These factors
concur to weaken the defence, represented by the neural networks that implement
the dissociation mechanism in the brain. The model is subsequently used to
interpret five mental conditions: PTSD, complex PTSD, dissociative identity
disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Ideally, this is a first step
towards building a model that aims to explain a wider range of
psychopathological affections with a single theoretical framework. The last
part is dedicated to sketching a new psychotherapy for psychological trauma.

projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO), can provide efficient representation
of certain linear operators in high dimensional spaces. This paper focuses on
the efficient representation of tensor network operators with long-range
pairwise interactions such as the Coulomb interaction. For MPOs, we find that
all existing efficient methods exploit a peculiar ""upper-triangular low-rank""
(UTLR) property, i.e. the upper-triangular part of the matrix can be well
approximated by a low-rank matrix, while the matrix itself can be full-rank.
This allows us to convert the problem of finding the efficient MPO
representation into a matrix completion problem. We develop a modified
incremental singular value decomposition method (ISVD) to solve this
ill-conditioned matrix completion problem. This algorithm yields equivalent MPO
representation to that developed in [Stoudenmire and White, Phys. Rev. Lett.
2017]. In order to efficiently treat more general tensor network operators, we
develop another strategy for compressing tensor network operators based on
hierarchical low-rank matrix formats, such as the hierarchical off-diagonal
low-rank (HODLR) format, and the $\mathcal{H}$-matrix format. Though the
pre-constant in the complexity is larger, the advantage of using the
hierarchical low-rank matrix format is that it is applicable to both MPOs and
PEPOs. For the Coulomb interaction, the operator can be represented by a linear
combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ MPOs/PEPOs, each with a
constant bond dimension, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is the
accuracy of the low-rank truncation. Neither the modified ISVD nor the
hierarchical low-rank algorithm assumes that the long-range interaction takes a
translation-invariant form.

of internal and spacetime symmetries, the assumption of the existence of a
positive definite invariant scalar product on the Lie algebra of the internal
group is essential. If one instead allows the scalar product to be positive
semi-definite, this opens new possibilities for unification of gauge and
spacetime symmetries. It follows from theorems on the structure of Lie
algebras, that in the case of unified symmetries, the degenerate directions of
the positive semi-definite invariant scalar product have to correspond to local
symmetries with nilpotent generators. In this paper we construct a workable
minimal toy model making use of this mechanism: it admits unified local
symmetries having a compact -- U(1) -- component, a Lorentz -- SL(2,C) --
component, and a nilpotent component gluing these together. The construction is
such that the full unified symmetry group acts locally and faithfully on the
matter field sector, whereas the gauge fields which would correspond to the
nilpotent generators can be transformed out from the theory, leaving gauge
fields only with compact charges. It is shown that already the ordinary Dirac
equation admits an extremely simple prototype example for the above gauge field
elimination mechanism: it has a local symmetry with corresponding eliminable
gauge field, related to the dilatation group. The outlined symmetry unification
mechanism can be used to by-pass the Coleman--Mandula and related no-go
theorems in a way that is fundamentally different from supersymmetry. In
particular, the mechanism avoids invocation of super-coordinates or extra
dimensions for the underlying spacetime manifold.

compare the performance of the new methods to those of existing methods in
Monte Carlo studies. The credibility of such Monte Carlo studies is often
limited because of the freedom the researcher has in choosing the design. In
recent years a new class of generative models emerged in the machine learning
literature, termed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can be used to
systematically generate artificial data that closely mimics real economic
datasets, while limiting the degrees of freedom for the researcher and
optionally satisfying privacy guarantees with respect to their training data.
In addition if an applied researcher is concerned with the performance of a
particular statistical method on a specific data set (beyond its theoretical
properties in large samples), she may wish to assess the performance, e.g., the
coverage rate of confidence intervals or the bias of the estimator, using
simulated data which resembles her setting. Tol illustrate these methods we
apply Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to compare a number of different estimators for
average treatment effects under unconfoundedness in three distinct settings
(corresponding to three real data sets) and present a methodology for assessing
the robustness of the results. In this example, we find that (i) there is not
one estimator that outperforms the others in all three settings, so researchers
should tailor their analytic approach to a given setting, and (ii) systematic
simulation studies can be helpful for selecting among competing methods in this
situation.

simultaneously in order to get better speed and performance than handling each

hard parameter sharing where a subset of the parameters is shared among tasks
while other parameters are task-specific; or (ii) soft parameter sharing where
all parameters are task-specific but they are jointly regularized. Both methods
suffer from limitations: the shared hidden layers of the former are difficult
to optimize due to the competing objectives while the complexity of the latter
grows linearly with the increasing number of tasks. To mitigate those
drawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, where we explicitly construct an
auxiliary module to mimic the soft parameter sharing for assisting the
optimization of the hard parameter sharing layers in the training phase. In
particular, the auxiliary module takes the outputs of the shared hidden layers
as inputs and is supervised by the auxiliary task loss. During training, the
auxiliary module is jointly optimized with the MTL network, serving as a
regularization by introducing an inductive bias to the shared layers. In the
testing phase, only the original MTL network is kept. Thus our method avoids
the limitation of both categories. We evaluate the proposed auxiliary module on

Recently, it was demonstrated that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can

of the attention models is to locate on the most informative parts of the

most existing visual attention mechanisms regard the question as a whole. They
ignore the word-level semantics where each word can have different attentions
and some words need no attention. Neither do they consider the semantic
structure of the sentences. Although the Extended Soft Attention (E-SA) model
for video question answering leverages the word-level attention, it performs
poorly on long question sentences. In this paper, we propose the heterogeneous
tree-structured memory network (HTreeMN) for video question answering. Our
proposed approach is based upon the syntax parse trees of the question
sentences. The HTreeMN treats the words differently where the \textit{visual}
words are processed with an attention module and the \textit{verbal} ones not.
It also utilizes the semantic structure of the sentences by combining the
neighbors based on the recursive structure of the parse trees. The
understandings of the words and the videos are propagated and merged from
leaves to the root. Furthermore, we build a hierarchical attention mechanism to
distill the attended features. We evaluate our approach on two datasets. The
experimental results show the superiority of our HTreeMN model over the other
attention models especially on complex questions. Our code is available on

interstellar emissions that span the electromagnetic spectrum. The standard
modelling of CR propagation and production of the associated emissions is based
on a steady-state assumption, where the CR source spatial density is described
using a smoothly varying function of position that does not evolve with time.
While this is a convenient approximation, reality is otherwise where primary
CRs are produced in and about highly localised regions, e.g., supernova
remnants, which have finite lifetimes. In this paper we use the latest version
of the GALPROP CR propagation code to model time-dependent CR injection and
propagation through the ISM from a realistic three-dimensional discretised CR
source density distribution, together with full three-dimensional models for
the other major ISM components, and make predictions of the associated

over time, its small-signal stability is determined by the energy of
perturbations accumulated in the system. To analyze this perturbation energy,
this paper proposes a novel physically motivated Lyapunov modal analysis (LMA)
framework, which combines selective modal analysis with the spectral
decompositions of specially chosen Lyapunov functions. This approach allows the
modal interactions in dynamical systems to be characterized and estimated in
connection with specific state variables. Conventional participation factors
characterize the relative contribution of the system modes and state variables
to the evolution of states and modes, respectively. In contrast, the proposed
Lyapunov participation factors characterize similar contributions to
corresponding Lyapunov functions, which determine the integral energy
associated with the states and modes on an infinite or finite time interval.
This allows the estimation of modal interactions in terms of total energy
produced by their mutual actions over time. Using a two-area four-machines
power system, we demonstrate that LMA reliably identifies resonant modal
interactions, merging of modes, and loss of stability, even for a linear model,
and associates them with certain state variables. The Lyapunov participation
factors corresponding to the selected part of the system spectrum can be
calculated independently and serve as a basis for rapid real-time calculations
of critical mode behaviors in large-scale dynamical systems.

checking optimality of bandit algorithms, considers arm size fixed as sample
size goes to infinity. We show that when arm size increases polynomially with
sample size, a surprisingly smaller lower bound is achievable. This is because
the larger experimentation costs when there are more arms permit regret savings
by exploiting the best performer more often. In particular we are able to
construct a UCB-Large algorithm that adaptively exploits more when there are
more arms. It achieves the smaller lower bound and is thus optimal. Numerical

not correct for arm size, and better than Thompson sampling.

Since the theoretical discovery in 1937, the exotic particle has long been
searched in particle physics. In the last few decades, however, it has
attracted renewed interest in condensed matter physics, where it can be
realized as an elementary excitation (quasiparticle) in quantum states of
matter. In this review, we discuss another platform for Majorana fermions, the
quantum spin liquid, in which interacting magnetic moments remain disordered
down to the lowest temperature under strong quantum fluctuations. They are
characterized by topological entanglement and fractional excitations, whose
possible application to topological quantum computation is recently discussed
intensively. As a prime candidate for such exotic states, we here focus on the
Kitaev magnets, a subgroup of the spin-orbit Mott insulators. After a brief
overview of the Kitaev model and the fractionalization of spins in the exact
ground state, we review recent explosive development in this rapidly growing
field, with a focus on numerical solutions of the Kitaev model at finite
temperatures and the comparison with experiments. The key concept is thermal
fractionalization --- two types of fractional excitations manifest themselves
at largely different temperatures. This leads to distinct thermodynamics and
spin dynamics in a variety of experimentally measurable quantities. We discuss
such peculiar behaviors as the signatures of fractional quasiparticles, in
careful comparison with the available experimental data for the candidate
materials of the Kitaev magnets. Our review gives an overview of the current
status of the identification of Majorana fermions in the Kitaev magnets, which
would serve as a basis for further experimental and theoretical studies toward
the manipulation of the exotic particles for topological quantum computation.

Considering
the difficulties in data collection and labeling in some specific tasks,
existing approaches generally use models pre-trained on a large source domain

from source domain are simply discarded in the fine-tuning process. We argue
that the source datasets could be better utilized and benefit fine-tuning. This
paper firstly introduces the concept of general discrimination to describe
ability of a network to distinguish untrained patterns, and then experimentally
demonstrates that general discrimination could potentially enhance the total
discrimination ability on target domain. Furthermore, we propose a novel and
light-weighted method, namely soft fine-tuning. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
which directly replaces optimization objective by a loss function on the target
domain, soft fine-tuning effectively keeps general discrimination by holding
the previous loss and removes it softly. By doing so, soft fine-tuning improves
the robustness of the network to data bias, and meanwhile accelerates the
convergence. We evaluate our approach on several visual recognition tasks.
Extensive experimental results support that soft fine-tuning provides
consistent improvement on all evaluated tasks, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art significantly. Codes will be made available to the public.

spatial and temporal attention to extract representative local features. While
correlations between parts are ignored in the previous methods, to leverage the

exploit the pose alignment connection and the feature affinity connection to
construct an adaptive structure-aware adjacency graph, which models the
intrinsic relations between graph nodes. We perform feature propagation on the
adjacency graph to refine regional features iteratively, and the neighbor
nodes' information is taken into account for part feature representation. To
learn compact and discriminative representations, we further propose a novel
temporal resolution-aware regularization, which enforces the consistency among
different temporal resolutions for the same identities. We conduct extensive

different from these normal fluids because its rotation is quantized. Even if a
container of superfluid is rotating, the fluid itself remains still until a
critical velocity is reached. Beyond the critical velocity, all the particles
conspire to suddenly pick up an angular momentum of $\hbar$ each and forms a
quantized vortex. As a result, a superfluid is known to increase its rotation
by a total angular momentum of $N\hbar$. In this letter, we show that
exciton-polariton superfluid can split into an irrotational part and a
rotational part. The relative ratio between the two states can be controlled by
either pump beam's power or spot size. Consequently, angular momentum of

propagation of light through the atmosphere and detector noise at the receiver,

increase cross-talk between modes, and correspondingly increase the symbol
error ratio (SER) of the system. In order to overcome these obstacles, we
develop a state-of-the-art generative machine learning (GML) and convolutional
neural network (CNN) system in combination, and demonstrate its efficacy in a
free-space optical (FSO) communications setting. The system corrects for the
distortion effects due to turbulence and reduces detector noise, resulting in
significantly lowered SERs and cross-talk at the output of the receiver, while
requiring no feedback. This scheme is straightforward to scale, and may provide
a concrete and cost effective technique to establishing long range classical
and quantum communication links in the near future.

are then accepted or rejected by the Metropolis algorithm based on DFT

improved on the fly by training to enhance the sampling, whereby the training

challenges to the inverse problem of reconstructing the 3D structure due to the

sensitivity to the misaligned geometry caused by the movement of object

method to utilize the entire dataset for simultaneous 3D structural
reconstruction across slices through total variation regularization within

borrowing both within and between slices, contrasting with the traditional

from reactors is fit unconstrained and found compatible with the expectations.
The null-hypothesis of observing a signal from the mantle is excluded at a

signal of $21.2 ^{+9.6}_{-9.0} ({\rm stat})^{+1.1}_{-0.9} ({\rm sys})$ TNU

heat is $38.2 ^{+13.6}_{-12.7}$ TW, corresponding to a convective Urey ratio of
0.78$^{+0.41}_{-0.28}$. These values are compatible with different geological
models, however there is a 2.4$\sigma$ tension with those which predict the
lowest concentration of heat-producing elements. By fitting the data with a
constraint on the reactor antineutrino background, the existence of a
hypothetical georeactor at the center of the Earth having power greater than
2.4 TW at 95% C.L. is excluded. Particular attention is given to all analysis

do not require many training injections/data to guarantee good detection
efficiency and low false alarm probability. In fact, we only need to train one
CNN on signal/noise maps in a single 150 Hz band; afterwards, the CNN can
distinguish signals/noise well in any band, though with different efficiencies
and false alarm probabilities due to the non-stationary noise in LIGO/Virgo. We
demonstrate that we can control the false alarm probability for the CNNs by
selecting the optimal threshold on the outputs of the CNN, which appears to be
frequency dependent. Finally we compare the detection efficiencies of the
networks to a well-established algorithm, the Generalized FrequencyHough (GFH),
which maps curves in the time/frequency plane to lines in a plane that relates
to the initial frequency/spindown of the source. The networks have similar
sensitivities to the GFH but are orders of magnitude faster to run and can
detect signals to which the GFH is blind. Using the results of our analysis, we
propose strategies to apply CNNs to a real search using LIGO/Virgo data to
overcome the obstacles that we would encounter, such as a finite amount of

  elemental Tellurium",,,"10.1073/pnas.1905524116",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent progress in understanding the electronic band topology and emergent
topological properties encourage us to reconsider the band structure of
well-known materials including elemental substances. Controlling such a band
topology by external field is of particular interest from both fundamental and
technological view point. Here we report the pressure-induced topological phase
transition from a semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal in elemental tellurium
probed by transport measurements. Pressure variation of the periods of
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, as well as oscillations phases, shows an
anomaly around the pressure theoretically predicted for topological phase
transition. This behavior can be well understood by the pressure-induced band
deformation and resultant band crossing effect. Moreover, effective cyclotron
mass is reduced toward the critical pressure, potentially reflecting the
emergence of massless linear dispersion. The present result paves the way for
studying the electronic band topology in well-known compounds and topological
phase transition by the external field.

  nonlinearities in a finite depth fluid",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The object of this study is to investigate the effect of viscosity on
propagation of free-surface waves in an incompressible viscous fluid layer of
arbitrary depth. While we provide a more detailed study of properties of linear
surface waves, the description of fully nonlinear waves in terms of KdV-like
equations is discussed. In the linear case, we find that in shallow enough
fluids, no surface waves can propagate. Even in any thicker fluid layers,
propagation of very short and very long waves is forbidden. When wave
propagation is possible, only a single propagating mode exists for any given
horizontal wave number. The numerical results show that there can be two types
of non-propagating modes. One type is always present, and there exist always
infinitely many of such modes at the same parameters. In contrast, there can be
zero, one or two modes belonging to the other type. Another significant feature
is that KdV-like equations describing propagating nonlinear viscous surface
waves may not exist since viscosity gives rise to a new wave number that cannot
be small at the same time as the original one. Nonetheless, we propose a
reasonable nonlinear description in terms of 1+1 variate functions that makes
possible successive approximations.

timing about the decay events on the LOR. Traditional PET image reconstruction
has not taken the timing information into account, only used the timing
information for coincidence judgments. The high timing resolution PET detectors
provide very precise TOF information, then TOF image reconstruction method
which utilizes the timing information of PET detectors is so crucial for the
TOF PET system. We take advantage of timing information provided by a pair of
TOF PET detectors, and then reconstruct the activity distribution from the
limited-view projection data. Since the image reconstruction from the
limited-view data is an under-determined problem mathematically, conventional
algorithms cannot achieve the exact reconstruction of the limited-view problem.
In this work, we propose a half-analytic and half-iterative method named DF/LBM
(Direct Fourier and Logarithmic Barrier Method) to solve the limited-view
problem with the TOF information. The least square solution is obtained via DFM
(Direct Fourier Method), and then a convex optimization method named
logarithmic barrier method is employed to correct the least square solution.
The substance of the convex optimization is defining the components in the
null-space to satisfy some prior information (TV minimization), while the least
square solution has no components in the null-space. Applying this method to
Zubal phantom, the artifact generated by the least square solution is
eliminated, and PSNR is 30.6112, 34.8751 and 38.8998 when the timing resolution
is unused, 200ps and 100ps respectively and 16 views from $-45$ to $45$ are

oscillator at squeezed states. However, only if entanglement is allowed in the
reservoir qubit can we stabilise the oscillator at a wider set of squeezed
states. This thus provides a proof for the necessity of involving entanglement
in the reservoir qubits input to the oscillator, as regard to the stabilisation
of quantum states in the proposed system setting. On the other hand, this
system setup can be in turn used to estimate the coupling strength between the
oscillator and reservoir qubits. We further demonstrate that entanglement in
the reservoir input qubits contributes to the corresponding quantum Fisher

indispensable role in the improvement of estimation precision in quantum

With micro-geographic point-level data, however, such information is inevitably
affected by locational errors, that can be generated intentionally by the data

procedures. This unfortunate circumstance can potentially limit the use of the
spatial econometric modelling framework for the analysis of micro data. Indeed,
some recent contributions (see e.g. Arbia, Espa and Giuliani 2016) have shown
that the presence of locational errors may have a non-negligible impact on the

homochirality of the molecular and supramolecular configurations of organic

completely separates the circular and linear polarization channels. The
polarization modulator consists of a patterned liquid-crystal quarter-wave
plate inside the spectrograph slit, which also constitutes the first optical
element of the instrument. This configuration eliminates cross-talk between
linear and circular polarization, which is crucial because linear polarization
signals are generally much stronger than the circular polarization signals.

This problem arises in chemical engineering as the maximization of the product

follows from the Pontryagin maximum principle that the optimal controls are
piecewise constant in the considered case. We focus on a parametrization of
optimal controls in terms of switching times in order to estimate the cost

derived by blending the pre-computed optimal control laws based on the linear
Bellman combination method. Coefficients that determine how to blend the

conducted basketball throwing tasks. In these experiments, subjects were asked
to throw a basketball into a hoop placed at different throwing distances. The

Brinkman law, is not solenodial, as its divergence is a function of the
nutrient and the phase field variable, i.e., solution-dependent, and
frictionless boundary conditions are prescribed for the velocity to avoid
imposing unrealistic constraints on the divergence relation. In this paper we
give a first result on the existence of weak and stationary solutions to the
CHB model with singular potentials, specifically the double obstacle potential

the physically relevant interval. New difficulties arise from the interplay
between the singular potentials and the solution-dependent source terms, but

error for the approximation of multivariate periodic functions belonging to

trigonometric polynomials computed from sampling values. The used sampling
schemes are suitable sets of rank-1 lattices that can be constructed in an
extremely efficient way. Furthermore, the structure of the sampling schemes
allows for fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. We present and discuss one
FFT algorithm and analyze the worst case $L_\infty$ error for this specific

  Using this general result we work out very weak requirements on the RHKS that
allow for a simple upper bound on the sampling numbers in terms of
approximation numbers, where the approximation error is measured in the
$L_\infty$ norm. Tremendous advantages of this estimate are its pre-asymptotic
validity as well as its simplicity and its specification in full detail. It
turns out, that approximation numbers and sampling numbers differ at most
slightly. The occurring multiplicative gap does not depend on the spatial
dimension $d$ and depends at most logarithmically on the number of used linear
information or sampling values, respectively. Moreover, we illustrate the
capability of the new sampling method with the aid of specific highly popular
source spaces, which yields that the suggested algorithm is nearly optimal from
different points of view. For instance, we improve tractability results for the
$L_\infty$ approximation for sampling methods and we achieve almost optimal
sampling rates for functions of dominating mixed smoothness.
  Great advantages of the suggested sampling method are the constructive
methods for determining sampling sets that guarantee the shown error bounds,

large-scale image classification. In contrast, there have been limited works
focusing on architecture search for object detection, mainly because the costly
ImageNet pre-training is always required for detectors. Training from scratch,
as a substitute, demands more epochs to converge and brings no computation
saving. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce a practical neural architecture
transformation search(NATS)algorithm for object detection in this paper.
Instead of searching and constructing an entire network, NATS explores the
architecture space on the base of existing network and reusing its weights. We
propose a novel neural architecture search strategy in channel-level instead of
path-level and devise a search space specially targeting at object detection.
With the combination of these two designs, an architecture transformation
scheme could be discovered to adapt a network designed for image classification
to task of object detection. Since our method is gradient-based and only
searches for a transformation scheme, the weights of models pretrained
inImageNet could be utilized in both searching and retraining stage, which
makes the whole process very efficient. The transformed network requires no
extra parameters and FLOPs, and is friendly to hardware optimization, which is
practical to use in real-time application. In experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of NATSon networks like ResNet and ResNeXt. Our transformed
networks, combined with various detection frameworks, achieve significant

the representation of proprioceptive inputs, which we take to be joint angles

to a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with a 2D lattice on the output. With
unrestricted, all-to-all connections, the map is not capable of representing
the input space while preserving the topological relationships, because the
intrinsic dimensionality of the body posture space is too large. Hence, we use
a method we developed previously for tactile inputs (Hoffmann, Straka et al.

restricted so they only learn to represent specific parts of the input space.
This is in line with the receptive fields of neurons in somatosensory areas

interdependencies as directed graphs fail to discriminate the rich variety of
modes of information flow that can coexist within a system. This, in turn,
creates problems with attempts to operationalise the concepts of 'dynamical
complexity' or `integrated information.' To address this shortcoming, we
combine concepts of partial information decomposition and integrated
information, and obtain what we call Integrated Information Decomposition, or
$\Phi$ID. We show how $\Phi$ID paves the way for more detailed analyses of
interdependencies in multivariate time series, and sheds light on collective
modes of information dynamics that have not been reported before. Additionally,
$\Phi$ID reveals that what is typically referred to as 'integration' is
actually an aggregate of several heterogeneous phenomena. Furthermore, $\Phi$ID
can be used to formulate new, tailored measures of integrated information, as
well as to understand and alleviate the limitations of existing measures.

solutions of electrically neutral spherical colloid particles. Each colloid
particle consists of a 'central' charge that is situated at the center and
compensating peripheral charges (grafted to it) that are fixed or fluctuating
relative to the central charge. In the framework of the random phase
approximation, we obtain a general expression for electrostatic free energy of
solution and analyze it for different limiting cases. In the limit of infinite
number of peripheral charges, when they can be modelled as a continual charged
cloud, we obtain an asymptotic behavior of the electrostatic potential of a
point-like test charge in a salt colloid solution at long distances,
demonstrating the crossover from its monotonic decrease to damped oscillations
with a certain wavelength. We show that the obtained crossover is determined by
certain Fisher-Widom line. For the same limiting case, we obtain an analytical
expression for the electrostatic free energy of a salt-free solution. In the
case of nonzero salt concentration, we obtain analytical relations for the
electrostatic free energy in two limiting regimes. Namely, when the ionic
concentration is much higher than the colloid concentration and the effective
size of charge cloud is much bigger than the screening lengths that are
attributed to the salt ions and the central charges of colloid particles. The
proposed theory could be useful for theoretical description of the phase

the best-sampled NS-LMXBs. We use these to fit a power-law correlation index
$\beta = 0.37^{+0.42}_{-0.40}$ between observed radio and X-ray luminosities (
$L_\mathrm{R}\propto L_\mathrm{X}^{\beta}$). However, our monitoring revealed a

$L_\mathrm{R} \sim 4 \times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ during the first three
reported observations, and up to a factor of 4 lower $L_\mathrm{R}$ during
later radio observations. Nonetheless, the average radio luminosity of IGR
J17591$-$2342 is still one of the highest among NS-LMXBs, and we discuss
possible reasons for the wide range of radio luminosities observed in such
systems during outburst. We found no evidence for radio pulsations from IGR

conversion, i.e., the ground-state parity of the superconductor is converted to
the charge occupation on a tunnel-coupled auxiliary quantum dot. We describe
how certain error mechanisms degrade the quality of the parity-to-charge

pulse, (ii) incomplete charge Rabi oscillations due to slow charge noise, and
(iii) charge relaxation due to phonon emission and absorption. To describe
these effects, we use simple model Hamiltonians based on the ideal Kitaev

superconductors wherever possible. In general, the effects of the error
mechanisms can be minimized by choosing a smooth shape and an optimal strength
for the readout tunnel pulse. In a case study based on InAs heterostructure
device parameters, we estimate that the parity-to-charge conversion error is
mainly due to slow charge noise for weak tunnel pulses and leakage for strong
tunnel pulses.

Nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes specifically have the potential to
provide both good ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties. This study
shows that the previously neglected nanoscale composition of the polymer
electrolyte close to the electrode surface has an important effect on impedance
measurements, despite its negligible extent compared to the bulk electrolyte.
Using standard stainless steel blocking electrodes, the impedance of lithium
salt-doped poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (ISO) exhibited a marked
decrease upon thermal processing of the electrolyte. In contrast, covering the
electrode surface with a low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) brush
resulted in higher and more reproducible conductivity values, which were
insensitive to the thermal history of the device. A qualitative model of this
effect is based on the hypothesis that ISO surface reconstruction at the
different electrode surfaces leads to a change in the electrostatic double
layer, affecting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. As a main
result, PEO-brush modification of electrode surfaces is beneficial for the
robust electrolyte performance of PEO-containing block-copolymers and may be
crucial for their accurate characterization and use in Li-ion batteries.

demonstrates that their stellar populations are old, and that the star
formation activity did not last longer than 2 Gyr in these systems. A few
mechanisms that may lead to such a rapid quenching have been investigated by
means of hydrodynamic simulations, without providing any final assessment so
far. This is the first in a series of papers aimed at analysing the roles of
stellar feedback, ram pressure stripping, host-satellite tidal interactions and
reionization in cleaning the lowest-mass Milky Way companions of their cold
gas, by using high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We
simulate an isolated ultrafaint dwarf galaxy loosely modeled after Bootes I,
and examine whether or not stellar feedback alone could drive a substantial
fraction of the ambient gas out from the shallow potential well. In contrast to
simple analytical estimates, but in agreement with previous hydrodynamical
studies, we find that most of the cold gas reservoir is retained. Conversely, a
significant fraction of the metal-enriched stellar ejecta crosses the
boundaries of the computational box with velocities exceeding the local escape
velocity and is, thus, likely lost from the system. Although the total energy
output from multiple supernova explosions exceeds the binding energy of the
gas, no galactic-scale outflow develops in our simulations and as such, most of
the ambient medium remains trapped within the weak potential well of the model
galaxy. It seems thus unavoidable that, in order to explain the dearth of gas
in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, we will have to resort to environmental effects.

invariant kinetic mixing, $\sin\chi$, and gauge non-invariant mass mixing,
$\delta M^2$, between the hypercharge and the new gauge boson $Z'$. These
represent a priori incalculable but phenomenologically important parameters of
the theory. They become calculable if there exist spontaneously or softly
broken symmetries which forbid them at tree level but allow their generation at
the loop level. We discuss various symmetries falling in this category in the
context of the gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models and their interplay with lepton
mixing. It is shown that one gets phenomenologically inconsistent lepton mixing
parameters if these symmetries are exact. Spontaneous breaking of these
symmetries can lead to consistent lepton mixing and also generates finite and
calculable values of these parameters at one or two loop order depending on the
underlying symmetry. We calculate these parameters in two specific cases: (i)
the standard seesaw model with $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry broken by the masses of
the right-handed neutrinos and (ii) in a model containing a pair of vectorlike
charged leptons which break $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry. In case (i), the
right-handed neutrinos are the only source of gauge mixing. The kinetic mixing
parameters are suppressed and vanish if the right-handed neutrinos decouple
from the theory. In contrast, there exists a finite gauge mixing in case (ii)
which survives even when the masses of vectorlike leptons are taken to
infinity, exhibiting non-decoupling behaviour. The seesaw model discussed here
represents a complete framework with practically no kinetic mixing and hence
can survive a large number of experimental probes used to rule out specific
ranges in the coupling $g^\prime$ and mass $M_{Z^\prime}$. The model can
generate non-universality in tau decays, which can be tested in future

Ramsey in 1928, has become a
cornerstone in the economic growth theory. Combined with the Solow model in the
1950s by the economists Cass (1965) and Koopmans (1965), it is still one of the
most used neoclassical growth models. Due to its general and universal
structure, it is widely used in various applications. Thus, many versions,
including the effects of taxation, government spendings and population growth
exist (see amongs others Sorger (2002), Barro (1990), and Acemoglu (2009)).
  The central idea in the Ramsey model is the endogenous saving rate, which is
determined within the optimization process in the model via a lifetime utility
maximization approach in the consuming sector. Though originally only time
dependent, the Ramsey model has been spatialized in the last two decades in the
context of the Economic Geography, started by Krugman (1991). The first who
introduced a spatial version of the Ramsey model was Brito (2001). This local
version of the spatial Ramsey model assumes that the capital accumulation
process in time and space can be modeled as a heat equation, with a local
diffusion operator to describe the mobility of capital across space. This
assumption has not been contested until today.

  Analysis","Accepted by MIML2019",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated skin lesion analysis is very crucial in clinical practice, as skin
cancer is among the most common human malignancy. Existing approaches with deep
learning have achieved remarkable performance on this challenging task,
however, heavily relying on large-scale labelled datasets. In this paper, we
present a novel active learning framework for cost-effective skin lesion
analysis. The goal is to effectively select and utilize much fewer labelled
samples, while the network can still achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our
sample selection criteria complementarily consider both informativeness and
representativeness, derived from decoupled aspects of measuring model certainty
and covering sample diversity. To make wise use of the selected samples, we
further design a simple yet effective strategy to aggregate intra-class images
in pixel space, as a new form of data augmentation. We validate our proposed
method on data of ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Classification Challenge for two tasks.
Using only up to 50% of samples, our approach can achieve state-of-the-art
performances on both tasks, which are comparable or exceeding the accuracies
with full-data training, and outperform other well-known active learning
methods by a large margin.

dissimilar materials. The discrete adhesive interface is regularised over a
finite width. Due to the use of a regularised crack model for the bulk
material, an interaction between the length scales of the crack and the
interface can occur. An analytic one-dimensional analysis has been carried out
to quantify this effect and a correction is proposed, which compensates
influences due to the regularisation in the bulk material. For
multi-dimensional analyses this approach cannot be used straightforwardly, as
is shown, and a study has been undertaken to numerically quantify the
compensation factor due to the interaction. The aim is to obtain reliable and
universally applicable results for crack propagation along interfaces between
dissimilar materials, such that they are independent from the regularisation
width of the interface. The method has been tested and validated on three
benchmark problems. The compensation is particularly relevant for phase-field
analyses in heterogeneous materials, where cohesive failure in the constituent
materials as well as adhesive failure at interfaces play a role.

t_3, \ldots , t_N)$ of length $n$ and track count $N$ is a multi-set of $N$
strings of length $n$ with characters drawn from a common alphabet of size
$\sigma_U$. Given two multi-track strings $\mathcal{T} = (t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots
, t_N)$ and $ \mathcal{P} = (p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots , p_N)$ of length $n$ and
track count $N$, there is a \textit{full-permuted-match} between $\mathcal{P}$
and $\mathcal{T}$ if $t_{r_i} = p_i$ for all $i \in \{1,2,3,\ldots N \}$ and
some permutation $(r_1, r_2, r_3\ldots,r_N)$ of $(1, 2, 3,\ldots,N)$, we denote
this $\mathcal{P}\asymp\mathcal{T}$.
  Efficient algorithms for some full-permuted-match problems on multi-track
strings have recently been presented. In this paper we show a reduction from a
multi-track string of length $n$ and track count $N$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U$, to a single-track string of length $2n-1$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U^N$. Through this reduction we allow any string algorithm to be used
on multi-track string problems using $\asymp$ as the match relation. For
polynomial time algorithms on single-track strings of length $n$ there is a
multiplicative penalty of not more than $\mathcal{O}(N)$-time for the same
algorithm on mt-strings of length $n$ and track count $N$.

configurational force, generated at the sliding sleeve constraint and
proportional to the square of the bending moment realized there, has been so
far investigated only under quasi-static setting and is now confirmed (through
a variational argument) to be present within a dynamic framework. The deep
influence of configurational forces on the dynamics is shown both theoretically
(through the development of a dynamic nonlinear model in which the rod is
treated as a nonlinear spring, obeying the Euler elastica, with negligible
inertia) and experimentally (through a specifically designed experimental
set-up). During the nonlinear dynamics, the elastic rod may slip alternatively
in and out from the sliding sleeve, becoming a sort of nonlinear oscillator
displaying a motion eventually ending with the rod completely injected into or
completely ejected from the sleeve. The present results may find applications
in the dynamics of compliant and extensible devices, for instance, to guide the

individually and could be simultaneously loaded into computer memory, allowing
for rapid calculation of the pressure field for different phase offsets used
for beam steering and aberration correction. We simulated the pressure
distribution for 431 sonications in 32 patients, applied the phase and
magnitude values used during treatment, and estimated the resulting temperature
rise. We systematically varied the relationship between CT-derived skull
density and the acoustic attenuation and sound speed to obtain the best
agreement between the predictions and MR temperature imaging (MRTI). The
optimization was validated with simulations of 396 sonications from 40
additional treatments. After optimization, the predicted and measured heating
agreed well (R2: 0.74 patients 1-32; 0.71 patients 33-72). The dimensions and
obliquity of the heating in the simulated temperature maps correlated well with
the MRTI (R2: 0.62, 0.74 respectively), but the measured heating was more
spatially diffuse. The energy needed to achieve ablation varied by an order of
magnitude (3.3-36.1 kJ). While this element-wise approach requires more
computation time up front, it can be performed in parallel. It allows for rapid
calculation of the three-dimensional heating at the focus for different phase
and magnitude values on the array. We also show how this approach can be used
to optimize the relationship between CT-derived skull density and acoustic
properties. While the relationships found here need further validation in a

available unpaired ones. We first represent SMI through the density ratio
function, where the expectation is approximated by the samples from marginals
and its assignment parameters. The objective is formulated using the optimal
transport problem and quadratic programming. Then, we introduce the
Least-Squares Mutual Information with Sinkhorn (LSMI-Sinkhorn) algorithm for
efficient optimization. Through experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed method can estimate the SMI without a large number of paired samples.
Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed LSMI-Sinkhorn algorithm on
various types of machine learning problems such as image matching and photo

the multidimensional version of the Langevin equation, where the parameter
$\Theta$ is a matrix and $G$ is a general, not necessarily Gaussian,

equations, we construct an estimator for the matrix $\Theta$. Moreover, we
prove the consistency of the estimator and derive its limiting distribution

researches on DNN quantization develop from inference to training, laying a
foundation for the online training on accelerators. However, existing schemes

incomplete quantization that still adopts high precision FP in some parts of

tough problem. Fraud users often exploit the vulnerability of payment platforms

users. There are many challenges for fraud detection in practice. Traditional
fraud detection methods require a large-scale manually labeled dataset, which
is hard to obtain in reality. Manually labeled data cost tremendous human
efforts. Besides, the continuous and rapid evolution of fraud users makes it
hard to find new fraud patterns based on existing detection rules. In our work,
we propose a real-world data oriented detection paradigm which can detect fraud
users and upgrade its detection ability automatically. Based on the new
paradigm, we design a novel fraud detection model, FraudJudger, to analyze
users behaviors on digital payment platforms and detect fraud users with fewer
labeled data in training. FraudJudger can learn the latent representations of
users from unlabeled data with the help of Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE).
Furthermore, FraudJudger can find new fraud patterns from unknown users by
cluster analysis. Our experiment is based on a real-world electronic payment

can achieve better detection performance with only 10% labeled data.

constrain the properties of the zonal flows in the outer envelopes of these
planets. A simplified dynamic equation, sometimes called the thermal wind or
thermo-gravitational wind equation, establishes a link between zonal flows and
the related buoyancy perturbation, which in turn can be exploited to yield the
dynamic gravity perturbation. Whether or not the action of the dynamic gravity
perturbation needs to be explicitly included in this equation, an effect we
call the Dynamic Self Gravity (DSG), has been a matter of intense debate. We
show that, under reasonable assumptions, the equation can be solved (semi)
analytically. This allows us to quantify the impact of the DSG on each gravity
harmonic, practically independent of the zonal flow or the details of the
planetary interior model. The impact decreases with growing spherical harmonic
degree l. For degrees l=2 to about l=4, the DSG is a first order effect and
should be taken into account in any attempt of inverting gravity measurements
for zonal flow properties. For degrees of about l=5 to roughly l=10, the
relative impact of DSG is about 10% and thus seems worthwhile to include, in
particular since this comes at little extra costs with the method presented
here. For yet higher degrees, is seems questionable whether gravity
measurements or interior models will ever reach the required precision
equivalent of the DSG impact of only a few percent of less.

reduce the PAPR of mixed-numerology OFDM signals. The first scheme is an
original enhanced iterative clipping-and-error-filtering (ICEF) approach that
cancels efficiently the INI along with PAPR reduction. This allows to achieve
efficient PAPR reduction while being compatible with well-known windowed
overlap-and-add (WOLA) processing. The second scheme is based on
fast-convolution (FC) processing, where PAPR reduction is embedded in the FC
filtering carried out using overlapping processing blocks. This allows one to
use any existing block-wise PAPR reduction method to reduce the composite
signals' PAPR with arbitrary BWP waveforms, and it is thus especially well
suited for processing mixed-numerology composite waveforms carrying multiple
BWPs with different OFDM numerologies. The performance of the proposed
algorithms is evaluated in the 5G NR context, and the essential performance

to deduce physical parameters of the jet and the intergalactic medium. We use
LOFAR to image the long-wavelength radio emission of the high-redshift blazar
S5 0836+710 on arcsecond scales between 120 MHz and 160 MHz. The LOFAR image
shows a compact unresolved core and a resolved emission region about 1.5 arcsec
to the southwest of the radio core. This structure is in general agreement with
previous higher-frequency radio observations with MERLIN and the VLA. The
southern component shows a moderately steep spectrum with a spectral index of
about $\gtrsim -1$ while the spectral index of the core is flat to slightly
inverted. In addition, we detect for the first time a resolved steep-spectrum
halo with a spectral index of about $-1$ surrounding the core. The
arcsecond-scale radio structure of S5 0836+710 can be understood as an FR
II-like radio galaxy observed at a small viewing angle. The southern component
can be interpreted as the region of the approaching jet's terminal hotspot and
the halo-like diffuse component near the core can be interpreted as the
counter-hotspot region. From the differential Doppler boosting of both
features, we can derive the hotspot advance speed to $(0.01-0.036)$ c. At a
constant advance speed, the derived age of the source would exceed the total
lifetime of such a powerful FR II-like radio galaxy substantially. Thus, the
hotspot advance speed must have been higher in the past in agreement with a
scenario in which the originally highly relativistic jet has lost collimation
due to the growth of instabilities and has transformed into an only mildly
relativistic flow. Our data suggest that the density of the intergalactic
medium around this distant ($z=2.22$) AGN could be substantially higher than
the values typically found in less distant FR II radio galaxies.

closely mounted reference magnetometer and a specific calibration procedure, it
is possible to compensate for the external magnetic field disturbances caused,
e.g., by the local transportation operated with dc power supplies. The field
compensation occurs only shortly after the calibrating coils are energized. In
this case, the leakage of the coil's magnetic flux to the reference sensor due
to the cancellation of the time-varying compensating field was negligible. When
using 60 cm coils and reference sensor in 2.5 m distance, we were able to
calculate magnetometer gains with a standard deviation of 91 ppm. We show that
an overall uncertainty of 0.1% can be achieved.

sources performed with the Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso in Italy. Electron antineutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$) are detected in an
organic liquid scintillator through the inverse $\beta$-decay reaction. In the
present work we set model-independent upper limits in the energy range 1.8-16.8
MeV on neutrino fluxes from unknown sources that improve our previous results,
on average, by a factor 2.5. Using the same data set, we first obtain
experimental constraints on the diffuse supernova $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes in the
previously unexplored region below 8 MeV. A search for $\bar{\nu}_e$ in the
solar neutrino flux is also presented: the presence of $\bar{\nu}_e$ would be a
manifestation of a non-zero anomalous magnetic moment of the neutrino, making
possible its conversion to antineutrinos in the strong magnetic field of the
Sun. We obtain a limit for a solar $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux of 384 cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
(90% C.L.), assuming an undistorted solar $^{8}$B neutrinos energy spectrum,
that corresponds to a transition probability $p_{ \nu_e \rightarrow
\bar\nu_{e}}<$ 7.2$\times$10$^{-5}$ (90% C.L.) for E$_{\bar {\nu}_e}$ $>$ 1.8
MeV. At lower energies, by investigating the spectral shape of elastic
scattering events, we obtain a new limit on solar $^{7}$Be-$\nu_e$ conversion
into $\bar{\nu}_e$ of $p_{ \nu_e \rightarrow \bar \nu_{e}}<$ 0.14 (90% C.L.) at
0.862 keV. Last, we investigate solar flares as possible neutrino sources and
obtain the strongest up-to-date limits on the fluence of neutrinos of all
flavor neutrino below 3-7 ,MeV. Assuming the neutrino flux to be proportional
to the flare's intensity, we exclude an intense solar flare as the cause of the
observed excess of events in run 117 of the Cl-Ar Homestake experiment.

help, we observe that most viewers make extensive use of summaries to re-engage

stories requires, first, modeling the dynamics of the plot and, second,
extracting relevant sequences. In this paper, we tackle plot modeling by
considering the social network of interactions between the characters involved
in the narrative: substantial, durable changes in a major character's social
environment suggest a new development relevant for the summary. Once
identified, these major stages in each character's storyline can be used as a
basis for completing the summary with related sequences. Our algorithm combines
such social network analysis with filmmaking grammar to automatically generate
character-oriented video summaries of TV series from partially annotated data.
We carry out evaluation with a user study in a real-world scenario: a large
sample of viewers were asked to rank video summaries centered on five
characters of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, a few weeks before the
new, sixth season was released. Our results reveal the ability of
character-oriented summaries to re-engage viewers in television series and
confirm the contributions of modeling the plot content and exploiting stylistic

A
commonly-used parametric approach, called {\it scalar-on-function regression},
uses the $\ltwo$ inner product to map functional predictors into scalar
responses. This method can perform poorly when predictor functions contain
undesired phase variability, causing phases to have disproportionately large
influence on the response variable. One past solution has been to perform
phase-amplitude separation (as a pre-processing step) and then use only the
amplitudes in the regression model. Here we propose a more integrated approach,
termed elastic functional regression model (EFRM), where phase-separation is
performed inside the regression model, rather than as a pre-processing step.
This approach generalizes the notion of phase in functional data, and is based
on the norm-preserving time warping of predictors. Due to its invariance
properties, this representation provides robustness to predictor phase
variability and results in improved predictions of the response variable over
traditional models. We demonstrate this framework using a number of datasets
involving gait signals, NMR data, and stock market prices.

on the same hemisphere of the star. Continued RV follow-up of systems with
small planets will improve our understanding of the link between inner

between gravity and pressure to machine precision. Quasi-stationary convection
in slab-geometry preserves gas energy (internal plus kinetic) on average
despite strong local up- and down-drafts. By contrast, a more standard
numerical scheme is demonstrated to result in substantial gains of energy
within a short time on purely numerical grounds. The test is further used to
point out the role of dimensionality, viscosity, and Rayleigh number for
compressible convection. Applications to a young sun in 2D and 3D, covering a
part of the inner radiative zone as well as the outer convective zone,
demonstrate that the scheme meets its initial design goal. Comparison with

explaining the absence of macroscopic position superpositions, currently being
tested for in the laboratory. The theory of trace dynamics provides a possible
theoretical origin for spontaneous localisation. We have recently proposed how
to employ non-commutative geometry to include gravity in trace dynamics, and
suggested the emergence of classical space-time geometry via spontaneous
localisation. In our theory, which we call non-commutative matter gravity, a
black hole arises from the spontaneous localisation of an entangled state of a
large number of `atoms of space-time-matter [STM]'. Prior to localisation, the
non-commutative curvature of an STM atom is described by the spectral action of
non-commutative geometry. By using the techniques of statistical thermodynamics
from trace dynamics, we show that the gravitational entropy of a Schwarzschild
black hole results from the microstates of the entangled STM atoms and is given
(subject to certain assumptions) by the classical Euclidean gravitational
action. This action, in turn, equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy

the potential to use the lower-cost, more widespread and accessible FFF-based

here, where only the outer surface of the printed polymer frame is converted to
ceramic. Here the FFF-based 3-D printed sample is coated with a preceramic
polymer and then it is converted into the corresponding PDC sample with a high
temperature pyrolysis process. A screening experiment is performed on
commercial filaments to obtain ceramic 3-D prints by surface coating both hard
thermoplastics: poly lactic acid (PLA), polycarbonate (PC), nylon alloys,

constant $g$. We analyze the consequences of this unusual dependence for the
amplitude and temporal shape of a spin-echo in a number of different
experimental situations. When the coupling $g$ is distributed inhomogeneously,
we find that the effective spin-echo relaxation time measured in a saturation

When the spin linewidth is larger than the resonator bandwidth, the Fourier

that the temporal shape of the echo becomes dependent on the repetition time of

The structural study revealed change in the local environment of the Fe
tetrahedrons depending on substitution: a reduction of the Fe-Fe and
Fe-Ch(chalcogen) bond lengths and a tendency for the six out of eight bond
angles to approach values for a regular tetrahedron suggesting a reduction of
structural distortions with substitution. With increasing substitution, a
lowering of the superconducting transition temperature Tc was observed; the
percolation threshold for the SC state is located at the substitution z = 1.2.
The SC state was found to coexist with the AFM state that persists in all
samples independent of substitution. The temperature of the transition into the
AFM state TN shows a monotonous decrease indicating a weakening of the AFM
interactions with increasing substitution. The AFM phase exhibits an
iron-vacancy-ordered structure below the structural transition at Ts. The
temperature Ts shows a non-monotonous variation: a decrease with increasing z
up to 1.3, followed by an increase for further increasing z. The suppression of
the superconductivity with substitution is accompanied by a significant
reduction of the density of states at the Fermi energy and a weakening of the

laws of quantum mechanics to perform elementary logic operations. Existing
programming models for quantum computing were designed with fault-tolerant
hardware in mind, envisioning standalone applications. However, near-term
quantum computers are susceptible to noise which limits their standalone
utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum
devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are
used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion.
This {\it modus operandi} calls out for a programming model and a high-level
programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous
quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm.
Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension
specification, called QCOR, that enables single-source quantum-classical
programming. Programs written using the QCOR library and directives based
language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary
executables. After defining the QCOR's programming model, memory model, and
execution model, we discuss how QCOR enables variational, iterative, and feed
forward quantum computing. QCOR approaches quantum-classical computation in a
hardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices
of high performance computing (HPC). The high level of abstraction in the
developed language is intended to accelerate the adoption of quantum computing
by researchers familiar with classical HPC.

non-reciprocities across a wide range of magnetic layer thicknesses (from 4 to
26 nm) in Pt/Co/Ir, Pt/Co/Pt, and Ir/Co/Pt stacks. We find the expected sign
change in the iDMI when inverting the stack order, and a negligible iDMI for
the symmetric Pt/Co/Pt. We additionally extract a difference in surface
anisotropies and find a large contribution due to the formation of different
crystalline phases of the Co, which is corroborated using nuclear magnetic
resonance and high-resolution transmission-electron-microscopy measurements.
These insights will open up new avenues to investigate, quantify and

Hubbard model by exact diagonalization. The model is relevant to organic
crystals, transition metal oxides, or ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We
implement numerical pump-probe measurements to calculate time-dependent
conductivity and single-particle spectral functions. In general, short optical
excitation induces a metallic behavior imprinted as a Drude peak in
conductivity or an in-gap density of states. In a Mott insulator, we find that
the induced Drude peak oscillates at the pump frequency and its second
harmonic. The former comes from the oscillation of currents, and the latter
from the interference of single- and three-photon excited states. In a band
insulator, the Drude peak oscillates only at the pump frequency, and quantities
such as the double occupancy do not oscillate. The absence of the second
harmonic oscillation is due to the degeneracy of multi-photon excited states.
The in-gap density of states in both insulators correlates with the Drude
weight and the energy absorption for weak pumping. Strong pumping leads to
saturation of the in-gap density of states and to suppression of the Drude
weight in the Mott regime. We have also checked that the above features are
robust for insulators in the intermediate parameter range. Our study
demonstrates the distinct natures of the multi-photon excited states in two
different insulators.

complete key proofs about privacy for well-typed programs. We then show how to
extend Duet to support realistic machine learning applications and recent
variants of differential privacy which result in improved accuracy for many
practical differentially private algorithms. Finally, we implement several

before been automatically verified by a language-based tool, and we present

anisotropic Fermi arcs and local domain which break rotational symmetry in the

disorder to explain these features, we show that many features of the pseudogap

underlying signal with incomplete or missing information about their ordering,
which can be modeled in terms of an unknown permutation. Previous work on the
case of a single noisy measurement vector has exposed two main challenges: 1) a
high requirement concerning the \emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\snr$), i.e.,
approximately of the order of $n^{5}$, and 2) a massive computational burden in
light of NP-hardness in general.
  In this paper, we study the case of \emph{multiple} noisy measurement vectors
(MMVs) resulting from a \emph{common} permutation and investigate to what
extent the number of MMVs $m$ facilitates permutation recovery by ""borrowing
strength"". The above two challenges have at least partially been resolved
within our work. First, we show that a large stable rank of the signal
significantly reduces the required snr which can drop from a polynomial in $n$
for $m = 1$ to a constant for $m = \Omega(\log n)$, where $m$ denotes the
number of MMVs and $n$ denotes the number of measurements per MV. This bound is
shown to be sharp and is associated with a phase transition phenomenon. Second,
we propose a computational scheme for recovering the unknown permutation in
practice. For the ""oracle case"" with the known signal, the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator reduces to a linear assignment problem whose global optimum can
be obtained efficiently. For the case in which both the signal and permutation
are unknown, the problem is reformulated as a bi-convex optimization problem
with an auxiliary variable, which can be solved by the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Numerical experiments based on the proposed
computational scheme confirm the tightness of our theoretical analysis.

to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. We find

Nevertheless, faithfully reconstructing the image from limited data still poses
a challenging task. Recent low-rank reconstruction methods exhibit superiority
in providing a high-quality image. However, none of them employ the routinely
acquired calibration data for improving image quality in parallel magnetic
resonance imaging. In this work, an image reconstruction approach named
STDLR-SPIRiT was proposed to explore the simultaneous two-directional
low-rankness (STDLR) in the k-space data and to mine the data correlation from
multiple receiver coils with the iterative self-consistent parallel imaging
reconstruction (SPIRiT). The reconstruction problem was then solved with a
singular value decomposition-free numerical algorithm. Experimental results of
phantom and brain imaging data show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of suppressing artifacts and achieving the
lowest error. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits robust reconstruction even
when the auto-calibration signals are limited in parallel imaging. Overall the

referential entity in an image according to linguistic query, where the mapping
between the image region (proposal) and the query is unknown in the training
stage. In referring expressions, people usually describe a target entity in
terms of its relationship with other contextual entities as well as visual
attributes. However, previous weakly supervised REG methods rarely pay
attention to the relationship between the entities. In this paper, we propose a
knowledge-guided pairwise reconstruction network (KPRN), which models the
relationship between the target entity (subject) and contextual entity (object)
as well as grounds these two entities. Specifically, we first design a
knowledge extraction module to guide the proposal selection of subject and
object. The prior knowledge is obtained in a specific form of semantic
similarities between each proposal and the subject/object. Second, guided by
such knowledge, we design the subject and object attention module to construct
the subject-object proposal pairs. The subject attention excludes the unrelated
proposals from the candidate proposals. The object attention selects the most
suitable proposal as the contextual proposal. Third, we introduce a pairwise
attention and an adaptive weighting scheme to learn the correspondence between
these proposal pairs and the query. Finally, a pairwise reconstruction module
is used to measure the grounding for weakly supervised learning. Extensive
experiments on four large-scale datasets show our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Networks use the grim trigger punishment strategy, reverting to playing the
MSNE every stage forever if the other disobeys the device. We determine if

adding the orbital motions of three companions. We obtain an improved distance

relatively eccentric orbit. The orbit of this low-mass stellar companion is
compact, while the Brown Dwarfs are located in external orbits. DoAr21$c$ has
the strongest astrometric signature in the periodogram, while DoAr21$B$ has a

appear at a substantially smaller driving strength and enables various routes
to chaos. We identify three generic features in weakly dissipative classical

Most of the existing work has focused largely on modifying the variational cost
function to achieve this goal. We first show that these modifications, e.g.
beta-VAE, simplify the tendency of variational inference to underfit causing
pathological over-pruning and over-orthogonalization of learned components.
Second we propose a complementary approach: to modify the probabilistic model
with a structured latent prior. This prior allows to discover latent variable
representations that are structured into a hierarchy of independent vector
spaces. The proposed prior has three major advantages: First, in contrast to
the standard VAE normal prior the proposed prior is not rotationally invariant.
This resolves the problem of unidentifiability of the standard VAE normal
prior. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed prior encourages a disentangled
latent representation which facilitates learning of disentangled
representations. Third, extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate that the
prior significantly mitigates the trade-off between reconstruction loss and
disentanglement over the state of the art.

massive passive galaxies (MPGs, Mstar>10^11 Msun) and their environment in the
redshift range 0.5<z<0.8. Passive galaxies were selected on the basis of their
NUVrK colors (~900 objects), and the environment was defined as the galaxy
density contrast, delta, using the fifth nearest-neighbor approach. The
analysis of Sigma vs. delta was carried out in two stellar mass bins. In
galaxies with Mstar<2*10^11 Msun, no correlation between Sigma and delta is
observed. This implies that the accretion of satellite galaxies, which is more
frequent in denser environments and efficient in reducing the galaxy Sigma, is
not relevant in the formation and evolution of these systems. Conversely, in
galaxies with Mstar>2*10^11 Msun, we find an excess of MPGs with low Sigma and
a deficit of high-Sigma MPGs in the densest regions wrt other environments. We
interpret this result as due to the migration of some high-Sigma MPGs (<1% of
the total population of MPGs) into low-Sigma MPGs, probably through mergers or
cannibalism of small satellites. In summary, our results imply that the
accretion of satellite galaxies has a marginal role in the mass-assembly
history of most MPGs.
  We have previously found that the number density of VIPERS massive
star-forming galaxies (MSFGs) declines rapidily from z=0.8 to z=0.5, which
mirrors the rapid increase in the number density of MPGs. This indicates that
the MSFGs at z>0.8 migrate to the MPG population. Here, we investigate the
Sigma-delta relation of MSFGs at z>0.8 and find that it is consistent within 1
sigma with that of low-Sigma MPGs at z<0.8. Thus, the results of this and our
previous paper show that MSFGs at z>0.8 are consistent in terms of number and
environment with being the progenitors of low-Sigma MPGs at z<0.8.

dialogues. Previous works on neural text generation fused semantic and
structural information by encoding the entire sentence into a mixed hidden
representation. However, when a generated sentence becomes complicated, the
structure is difficult to be properly maintained. To alleviate this problem, we
explicitly separate the modeling process of semantic and structural
information. Intuitively, humans generate structured sentences by directly
connecting discourses with discourse markers (such as and, but, etc.).
Therefore, we propose a task that mimics this process, called discourse
transfer. This task represents a structured sentence as (head discourse,
discourse marker, tail discourse), and aims at tail discourse generation based
on head discourse and discourse marker. We also propose a corresponding model
called TransSent, which interprets the relationship between two discourses as a
translation1 from the head discourse to the tail discourse in the embedding
space. We experiment TransSent not only in discourse transfer task but also in
free text generation and dialogue generation tasks. Automatic and human
evaluation results show that TransSent can generate structured sentences with
high quality, and has certain scalability in different tasks.

automata theory introduced in 1957 by John Myhill. Its goal is to design a

state, then at some time (the ""firing time"") all copies enter a special ""firing
state"" simultaneously for the first time. FSSP has many variations and for many
of them we know minimal-time solutions (solutions having shortest firing time).
One of such variations is the FSSP for squares (denoted by SQ) in which copies
are placed in a square. In this paper we introduce a variation which we call
the FSSP for squares with k holes and denote by SH[k] by slightly modifying SQ
(k >= 1). In the variation, copies of a finite automaton are placed in a square

We show that SH[1] has a minimal-time solution. Moreover, for each problem
instance (a placement of copies in a square) C of SH[2], we determine the
minimum firing time of C (the minimum value of firing times of C by A where A
ranges over all solutions of SH[2]). The variation SQ was introduced and its
minimal-time solutions were found in 1970's. However, to find minimal-time
solutions of SH[k], a very simple modification of SQ, seems to be a very

harness the power of convolutional neural network model (CNN) on image

more than one imaging mode simultaneously -- has opened interesting new
perspectives in areas ranging from astronomy to medicine. Visible optics and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complementary advantages of resolution,
speed and depth of penetration, and as such would be attractive in combination.
In this paper, we take first steps towards marrying together optical and MR
imaging in a class of biocompatible particulate materials constructed out of
diamond. The particles are endowed with a high density of quantum defects
(Nitrogen Vacancy centers) that under optical excitation fluoresce brightly in
the visible, but also concurrently electron spin polarize. This allows the
hyperpolarization of lattice 13C nuclei to make the particles over three-orders
of magnitude brighter than in conventional MRI. Dual-mode optical and MR
imaging permits immediate access to improvements in resolution and
signal-to-noise especially in scattering environments. We highlight additional
benefits in background-free imaging, demonstrating lock-in suppression by
factors of 2 and 5 in optical and MR domains respectively. Ultimate limits
could approach as much as two orders of magnitude in each domain. Finally,
leveraging the ability of optical and MR imaging to simultaneously probe
Fourier-reciprocal domains (real and k-space), we elucidate the ability to
employ hybrid sub-sampling in both conjugate spaces to vastly accelerate
dual-image acquisition, by as much as two orders of magnitude in practically
relevant sparse-imaging scenarios. This is accompanied by a reduction in
optical power by the same factor. Our work suggests interesting possibilities
for the simultaneous optical and low-field MR imaging of targeted diamond

Nature of Order - wholeness is a recursive structure that recurs in space and
matter and is reflected in human minds and cognition. Based on the definition
of wholeness, a mathematical model of wholeness, together with its topological
representation, has been developed, and it is able to address not only why a
structure is beautiful, but also how much beauty the structure has. Given the
circumstance, this paper is attempted to argue for the wholeness as the
scientific foundation of sustainable urban design and planning, with the help
of the mathematical model and topological representation. We start by
introducing the wholeness as a mathematical structure of physical space that
pervasively exists in our surroundings, along with two fundamental laws -
scaling law and Tobler's law - that underlie the 15 properties for
characterizing and making living structures. We argue that urban design and
planning can be considered to be wholeness-extending processes, guided by two
design principles of differentiation and adaptation, to transform a space - in
a piecemeal fashion - into a living or more living structure. We further
discuss several other urban design theories and how they can be justified by
and placed within the theory of wholeness. With the wholeness as the scientific
foundation, urban design can turn into a rigorous science with creation of
living structures as the primary aim.
