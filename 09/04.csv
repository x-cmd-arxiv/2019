  Systems)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressing word embeddings is important for deploying NLP models in
memory-constrained settings. However, understanding what makes compressed
embeddings perform well on downstream tasks is challenging---existing measures
of compression quality often fail to distinguish between embeddings that
perform well and those that do not. We thus propose the eigenspace overlap
score as a new measure. We relate the eigenspace overlap score to downstream
performance by developing generalization bounds for the compressed embeddings
in terms of this score, in the context of linear and logistic regression. We
then show that we can lower bound the eigenspace overlap score for a simple
uniform quantization compression method, helping to explain the strong
empirical performance of this method. Finally, we show that by using the
eigenspace overlap score as a selection criterion between embeddings drawn from
a representative set we compressed, we can efficiently identify the better
performing embedding with up to $2\times$ lower selection error rates than the
next best measure of compression quality, and avoid the cost of training a
model for each task of interest.

transform was performed through the use of Daubechies Wavelet Family (Db1-Haar,
Db 6, Db8, Db10) allowing the decomposition of the initial audio signal into
sets of coefficients on which a set of features was extracted and analyzed
statistically in order to differentiate emotional states. ANNs proved to be a
system that allows an appropriate classification of such states. This study
shows that the extracted features using wavelet decomposition are enough to
analyze and extract emotional content in audio signals presenting a high

other kinds of classical frequency-time features. Accordingly, this paper seeks
to characterize mathematically the six basic emotions in humans: boredom,
disgust, happiness, anxiety, anger and sadness, also included the neutrality,

that are designed for the estimation of matrices from their marginals and
potentially exogenous information. This includes a general discussion of the
available methodology that provides edge probabilities as well as models that
are focussed on the reconstruction of edge values. Besides summarizing the
advantages, shortfalls and computational issues of the approaches, we put them
into a competitive comparison using the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication) MT 103 payment messages network (MT 103: Single

also fully observed which allows for an extensive competitive horse race of
methods. The comparison concerning the binary reconstruction is divided into an
evaluation of the edge probabilities and the quality of the reconstructed
degree structures. Furthermore, the accuracy of the predicted edge values is
investigated. To test the methods on different topologies, the application is
split into two parts. The first part considers the full MT 103 network, being
an illustration for the reconstruction of large, sparse financial networks. The
second part is concerned with reconstructing a subset of the full network,
representing a dense medium-sized network. Regarding substantial outcomes, it
can be found that no method is superior in every respect and that the preferred

advection due to streaming along magnetic field lines and resonant scattering
off self-excited Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) waves. Thus momentum is
transferred to the plasma via the frozen-in waves as a mediator assisting the
thermal pressure in driving a galactic wind. Galactic CRs (GCRs) are
accelerated by shock waves generated in supernova remnants (SNRs), and they
propagate from the disc into the halo. Therefore CR acceleration in the halo
strongly depends on the inner disc boundary conditions. We performed
hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds in flux tube geometry appropriate
for disc galaxies, describing the CR diffusive-advective transport in a
hydrodynamical fashion (by taking appropriate moments of the Fokker-Planck
equation) along with the energy exchange with self-generated MHD waves. Our
time-dependent CR hydrodynamic simulations confirm that the evolution of
galactic winds with feedback depends on the structure of the galactic halo. In
case of a wind-structured halo, the wind breaks down after the last super nova
(SN) has exploded. The mechanism described here offers a natural and elegant
solution to explain the power-law distribution of CRs between the `knee' and
the `ankle'. The transition will be naturally smooth, because the Galactic CRs
accelerated at SN shocks will be `post-accelerated' by shocks generated at the

by analyzing gender-based homophily -- the tendency for researchers to
co-author with individuals of the same gender. We develop and apply novel
methodology to the corpus of JSTOR articles, a broad scholarly landscape, which
we analyze at various levels of granularity. Most notably, for a precise
analysis of gender homophily, we develop methodology which explicitly accounts
for the fact that the data comprises heterogeneous intellectual communities and
that not all authorships are exchangeable. In particular, we distinguish three
phenomena which may affect the distribution of observed gender homophily in
collaborations: a structural component that is due to demographics and
non-gendered authorship norms of a scholarly community, a compositional
component which is driven by varying gender representation across
sub-disciplines and time, and a behavioral component which we define as the
remainder of observed gender homophily after its structural and compositional
components have been taken into account. Using minimal modeling assumptions,
the methodology we develop allows us to test for behavioral homophily. We find
that statistically significant behavioral homophily can be detected across the
JSTOR corpus and show that this finding is robust to missing gender indicators
in our data. In a secondary analysis, we show that the proportion of women
representation in a field is positively associated with the probability of
finding statistically significant behavioral homophily.

stars show that the stellar magnetic activity varies with the rotation rates of
the stars. The faster the star rotates, its magnetic activity gets stronger but
activity cycle period does not show a straightforward variation with the
rotation rate. For slowly rotating stars, the cycle period decreases with the
increase of rotation rate, while for the fast rotators dependency of cycle
period on rotation is presently quite complicated. We aim to provide an
explanation of these observational trends of stellar magnetic activity using a
dynamo model. We construct a theoretical dynamo model for stars of mass 1
$M_\odot$ based on the kinematic flux transport dynamo model including radial
pumping near the surface of the stars. The inclusion of this near surface
downward radial pumping is found to be necessary to match the observed surface
magnetic field in case of the Sun. The main ingredients of our dynamo model,
meridional circulation and differential rotation for stars are obtained from a
mean-field hydrodynamic model. Our model shows a decrease of cycle period with
increasing rotation rate in the slowly rotating regime and a slight increase of
cycle period with rotation rate for the rapid rotators. The strength of the
magnetic field is found to be increasing as the rotation rate of the star
increases. We also find that the parity of the stellar magnetic field changes
with rotation. According to our model, the parity flips to quadrupolar from
dipolar if the rotation period of the star is less than 17 days.

largely focused on span-periodic quasi-2D configurations that neglect the
influence lateral confinement has on the core flow. The present study is
concerned with the effect of flow confinement on Mach 2 laminar SBLI in
rectangular ducts. An oblique shock generated by a 2 degree wedge forms a
conical swept SBLI with sidewall boundary layers before reflecting from the
bottom wall of the domain. Multiple large regions of flow-reversal are observed
on the sidewalls, bottom wall and at the corner intersection. The main
interaction is found to be strongly three-dimensional and highly dependent on
the geometry of the duct. Comparison to quasi-2D span-periodic simulations
showed sidewalls strengthen the interaction by 31% for the baseline
configuration with an aspect ratio of one. The length of the shock generator
and subsequent trailing edge expansion fan position was shown to be a critical
parameter in determining the central separation length. By shortening the
length of the shock generator, control of the interaction and suppression of
the central interaction is demonstrated. Parametric studies of shock strength
and duct aspect ratio were performed to find limiting behaviours. For the
largest aspect ratio of four, three-dimensionality was visible across 30% of
the span width away from the wall. Topological features of the
three-dimensional separation are identified and shown to be consistent with
`owl-like' separations of the first kind. The reflection of the initial conical
swept SBLIs is found to be the most significant factor determining the flow
structures downstream of the main interaction.

linear circuits in a previous paper, by means of a systematic use of global
parametrizations of smooth planar curves. This makes it possible to formulate
reduced models in terms of homogeneous variables also in the nonlinear context:
contrary to voltages and currents (and also to fluxes and charges), homogeneous
variables qualify as state variables in reduced models of uncoupled circuits
without any restriction in the characteristics of devices. The inherent
symmetry of this formalism makes it possible to address in broad generality
certain analytical problems in nonlinear circuit theory, such as the
state-space problem and related issues involving impasse phenomena, as well as

higher dimensional information processing tasks suffer from rapid device
resource growth when beam splitters are used in a feed-forward manner.
Directionally-unbiased linear-optical devices have been introduced recently to
eliminate the directional bias, greatly reducing the numbers of required beam

spin-orbit coupling, and electron-electron interactions included via the
multi-orbital Hubbard-Hund Hamiltonian. We perform an extensive parameter sweep
and investigate different doping regimes including cases with only hole- or

bandstructures: a rather generic band derived for LaFeAsO but known to
represent standard DFT-obtained bands for iron-based superconductors, and a
band specifically tailored for FeSe which exhibits a notably different Fermi
surface compared to the generic case. It is found that for the generic FeSCs
band, even rather large SOC has negligible effect on the resulting gap
structure; the $s_{+-}$ (pseudo-)spin singlet pairing remains strongly favored
and SOC does not lead to any SOC-characteristic gap oscillations along the
various Fermi surfaces. By contrast in the strongly hole-doped case featuring
only hole-pockets around the $\Gamma$-point, the leading solution is $d$-wave
pseudo-spin singlet, but with a notable SOC-driven tendency towards helical
pseudo-spin triplet pairing, which may even become the leading instability. In
the heavily electron doped situation, featuring only electron pockets centered
around the $M$-point, the leading superconducting instabilities are pseudo-spin
singlets with SOC favoring the $s$-wave case as compared to $d$-wave pairing,

observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A
decoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received
codewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly
minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication
rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy
can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing
policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process
once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or
$-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a
1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate
function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly,
this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the
limit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI
coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay
channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the
event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the
distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are
much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in
that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$. It is
achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval
$\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as
fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.

handful of coronal activity cycles have been discovered. \ihor\ is the most
active and youngest star with known coronal cycles. It is also a young solar
analog, and we are likely facing the earliest cycles in the evolution of
solar-like stars, at an age (~600 Myr) when life appeared on Earth. Our aim is
to confirm the ~1.6 yr coronal cycle and characterize its stability over time.
We use X-ray observations of iota Hor to study the corona of a star
representing the solar past through variability, thermal structure, and coronal
abundances. We analyzed multi-wavelength observations of iota Hor using
XMM-Newton, TESS, and HST data. We monitored iota Hor throughout almost seven
years in X-rays and in two UV bands. The summed RGS and STIS spectra were used
for a detailed thermal structure model, and the determination of coronal
abundances. We studied rotation and flares in the TESS light curve. We find a
stable coronal cycle along four complete periods, more than covered in the Sun.
There is no evidence for a second longer X-ray cycle. Coronal abundances are
consistent with photospheric values, discarding any effects related to the
first ionization potential. From the TESS light curve we derived the first
photometric measurement of the rotation period (8.2 d). No flares were detected
in the TESS light curve of iota Hor. We estimate the probability of having
detected zero flares with TESS to be ~2%. We corroborate the presence of an
activity cycle of ~1.6 yr in iota Hor in X-rays, more regular than its Ca II
H&K counterpart. A decoupling of the activity between the northern and southern
hemispheres of the star might explain the disagreement. The inclination of the
system would result in an irregular behavior in the chromospheric indicators.
The more extended coronal material would be less sensitive to this effect.

central importance in quantum science and engineering. For example, it enables
secure quantum key distribution (QKD) relying on fundamental principles that
prohibit the ""cloning"" of unknown quantum states. While QKD is being
successfully deployed, its range is currently limited by photon losses and
cannot be extended using straightforward measure-and-repeat strategies without
compromising its unconditional security. Alternatively, quantum repeaters,
which utilize intermediate quantum memory nodes and error correction
techniques, can extend the range of quantum channels. However, their
implementation remains an outstanding challenge, requiring a combination of
efficient and high-fidelity quantum memories, gate operations, and
measurements. Here we report the experimental realization of memory-enhanced
quantum communication. We use a single solid-state spin memory integrated in a
nanophotonic diamond resonator to implement asynchronous Bell-state
measurements. This enables a four-fold increase in the secret key rate of
measurement device independent (MDI)-QKD over the loss-equivalent
direct-transmission method while operating megahertz clock rates. Our results
represent a significant step towards practical quantum repeaters and

processes which shape their morphology remain unclear. We conduct an
investigation into the formation, evolution and destruction of dense gas in the
center of a simulated, Perseus-like, cluster under the influence of a
spin-driven jet. We particularly study the role played by condensation of dense
gas from the diffuse intracluster medium, and the impact of direct uplifting of
existing dense gas by the jets, in determining the spatial distribution and
kinematics of the dense gas. We present a hydrodynamical simulation of an
idealised Perseus-like cluster using the adaptive mesh refinement code {\sc
ramses}. Our simulation includes a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that
self-consistently tracks its spin evolution via its local accretion, and in
turn drives a large-scale jet whose direction is based on the black hole's spin
evolution. We show that the formation and destruction of dense gas is closely
linked to the SMBH's feedback cycle, and that its morphology is highly variable
throughout the simulation. While extended filamentary structures readily
condense from the hot intra-cluster medium, they are easily shattered into an
overly clumpy distribution of gas during their interaction with the jet driven
outflows. Condensation occurs predominantly onto infalling gas located 5 - 15
kpc from the center during quiescent phases of the central AGN, when the local
ratio of the cooling time to free fall time falls below 20, i.e. when $t_{\rm
cool}/t_{\rm ff} < 20$. We find evidence for both condensation and uplifting of
dense gas, but caution that purely hydrodynamical simulations struggle to
effectively regulate the cluster cooling cycle and produce overly clumpy
distributions of dense gas morphologies, compared to observation.

performing highly complex tasks including locomotion in continuous

a set of previously unseen tasks. Generalization and overfitting in deep
reinforcement learning are not commonly addressed in current transfer learning
research. Conducting a comparative analysis without an intermediate
regularization step results in underperforming benchmarks and inaccurate
algorithm comparisons due to rudimentary assessments. In this study, we propose
regularization techniques in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control
through the application of sample elimination, early stopping and maximum
entropy regularized adversarial learning. First, the importance of the
inclusion of training iteration number to the hyperparameters in deep transfer
reinforcement learning will be discussed. Because source task performance is
not indicative of the generalization capacity of the algorithm, we start by
acknowledging the training iteration number as a hyperparameter. In line with
this, we introduce an additional step of resorting to earlier snapshots of
policy parameters to prevent overfitting to the source task. Then, to generate
robust policies, we discard the samples that lead to overfitting via a method
we call strict clipping. Furthermore, we increase the generalization capacity
in widely used transfer learning benchmarks by using maximum entropy
regularization, different critic methods, and curriculum learning in an
adversarial setup. Subsequently, we propose maximum entropy adversarial
reinforcement learning to increase the domain randomization. Finally, we
evaluate the robustness of these methods on simulated robots in target
environments where the morphology of the robot, gravity, and tangential
friction coefficient of the environment are altered.

intracluster medium (ICM) provides key constraints on the feeding and feedback
of supermassive black holes. Much understanding about AGN feedback is gained
from purely hydrodynamic models; however, whether such an approximation is
adequate for the magnetized, weakly collisional ICM needs to be critically
examined. For example, AGN-blown bubbles in hydrodynamic simulations are easily
disrupted by fluid instabilities, making it difficult to explain the coherence
of observed bubbles such as the northwest ghost bubble in Perseus. In order to
investigate whether magnetic tension and viscosity in realistic conditions
could preserve the bubble integrity, we performed the first
Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jet-inflated bubbles in a medium
with tangled magnetic field. We find that magnetic tension alone is
insufficient to prevent bubble deformation due to large velocity shear at early
stage of the evolution. Although unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity in tangled
magnetic field can have similar effects as isotropic viscosity, when the
pressure anisotropy is bounded by microscopic plasma instabilities, the level
of viscosity is substantially limited, thereby failing to prevent bubble
deformation as in the inviscid case. Our results suggest that Braginskii
viscosity is unlikely to be the primary mechanism for suppressing the fluid
instabilities for AGN bubbles, and it remains a challenging task to reproduce
smooth and coherent bubbles as observed. Because the dynamical influence and
heating of the ICM critically depend on the bubble morphology, our study
highlights the fundamental role of ""microphysics"" on the macroscopic properties
of AGN feedback processes.

In this work, we derive the fraction of angular momentum retained in the
stellar component of spirals, $f_j$, the global star formation efficiency
$f_M$, and the ratio of the asymptotic circular velocity ($V_{\rm flat}$) to
the virial velocity $f_V$, and their scatter, by fitting simultaneously the
observed stellar mass-velocity (Tully-Fisher), size-mass, and mass-angular
momentum (Fall) relations. We compare the goodness of fit of three models: (i)
where the logarithm of $f_j$, $f_M$, and $f_V$ vary linearly with the logarithm
of the observable $V_{\rm flat}$; (ii) where these values vary as a double
power law; and (iii) where these values also vary as a double power law but
with a prior imposed on $f_M$ such that it follows the expectations from widely
used abundance matching models. We conclude that the scatter in these fractions
is particularly small ($\sim 0.07$ dex) and that the linear model is by far
statistically preferred to that with abundance matching priors. This indicates
that the fundamental galaxy formation parameters are small-scatter single-slope
monotonic functions of mass, instead of being complicated non-monotonic
functions. This incidentally confirms that the most massive spiral galaxies
should have turned nearly all the baryons associated with their haloes into
stars. We call this the failed feedback problem.

mock JWST LFs, based on two different hydrodynamical cosmological simulations;
these have intrinsic luminosity functions (LFs) which turn over at different
scales and yet are fully consistent with present-day observations. We also
generate mock 21-cm power spectrum observations, using 1000h observations with
SKA1 and a moderate foreground model. Using only JWST data, we predict up to a
factor of 2-3 improvement (compared with HST) in the fractional uncertainty of
the star formation rate to halo mass relation and the scales at which the LFs
peak (i.e. turnover). Most parameters regulating the UV galaxy properties can
be constrained at the level of $\sim 10$% or better, if either (i) we are able
to better characterize systematic lensing uncertainties than currently
possible; or (ii) the intrinsic LFs peak at magnitudes brighter than $M_{\rm

mitigate degeneracies, and constrain all of our astrophysical parameters, even

efficiently determines local lens properties on the scale of the quasar
subcomponents, which are computationally intensive to obtain by free-form
model-based approaches. As only 40% of the small-scale subcomponent local lens
properties overlap within the 1-$\sigma$ confidence bounds, mass density
gradients on milli-arcsecond scales cannot be excluded. Hence, aiming at a
global reconstruction of the deflecting mass density distribution, increasingly
detailed observations require flexible free-form models that allow for density
fluctuations on milli-arcsecond scale to replace parametric ones, especially
for asymmetric lenses or lenses with localised inhomogeneities like B0128.

power both the AGN and the outflow, this gives a lower limit on the average
inflow rate of $\sim1.01\pm0.14~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, a rate which
simulations show can be achieved by bars, spiral arms and cold accretion. We
compare our disk dominated sample to a sample of nearby AGN with merger
dominated histories and show that the black hole accretion rates in our sample

smooth, planar inflow in a secular dominated system, which is both spinning up

that dominates the spectral energy distribution. We analysed ten years of
optical spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory for the blazar 3C
454.3, as well as gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The
optical spectra are dominated by a highly variable non-thermal synchrotron
continuum with a prominent Mg II broad emission line. The line flux was
obtained by spectral decomposition including significant contribution from the
Fe II pseudo-continuum. Three methods were used to characterise variations in
the line flux: (1) stacking of the continuum-subtracted spectra, (2)
subtracting the running mean light curves calculated for different timescales,
and (3) evaluating potential time delays via the discrete correlation function
(DCF). Despite very large variations in the gamma-ray and optical continua, the
line flux changes only moderately (< 0.1 dex). The data suggest that the line
flux responds to a dramatic change in the blazar activity from a very high
state in 2010 to a deep low state in 2012. Two interpretations are possible:
either the line flux is anti-correlated with the continuum or the increase in
the line luminosity is delayed by ~600 days. If this time delay results from
the reverberation of poorly constrained accretion disc emission in both the
broad-line region (BLR) and the synchrotron emitting blazar zone within a
relativistic jet, we would obtain natural estimates for the BLR radius
[R_{BLR,MgII} >~ 0.28 pc] and for the supermassive black hole mass [M_SMBH ~

that the number counts and internal properties of satellite galaxies within the
massive halo are sensitively regulated by a combination of local stellar
radiative feedback and strong tidal forces. Radiative feedback operates before
the first supernova explosions erupt and results in less tightly-bound
galaxies. Satellites are therefore more vulnerable to tidal stripping when they
accrete onto the main progenitor and are tidally disrupted on a significantly
shorter timescale. Consequently, the number of satellites with $M_{\rm \star} >
10^{7} \, \rm M_\odot$ within the parent system's virial radius drops by up to
$60 \%$ with respect to an identical simulation performed without stellar
radiative feedback. Radiative feedback also impacts the central galaxy, whose
effective radius increases by a factor $\lesssim 3$ due to the presence of a
more extended and diffuse stellar component. We suggest that the number of
satellites in the vicinity of massive high-redshift galaxies is an indication
of the strength of stellar radiative feedback and and can be anomalously low in
the extreme cosmic environments of high-redshift quasars.

Recent efforts mostly focused on detecting antisocial behavior after the fact,
by analyzing single comments in isolation. To provide more timely notice to
human moderators, a system needs to preemptively detect that a conversation is
heading towards derailment before it actually turns toxic. This means modeling
derailment as an emerging property of a conversation rather than as an isolated
utterance-level event.
  Forecasting emerging conversational properties, however, poses several
inherent modeling challenges. First, since conversations are dynamic, a
forecasting model needs to capture the flow of the discussion, rather than
properties of individual comments. Second, real conversations have an unknown
horizon: they can end or derail at any time; thus a practical forecasting model
needs to assess the risk in an online fashion, as the conversation develops. In
this work we introduce a conversational forecasting model that learns an
unsupervised representation of conversational dynamics and exploits it to
predict future derailment as the conversation develops. By applying this model
to two new diverse datasets of online conversations with labels for antisocial
events, we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art systems at forecasting
derailment.

range of such theories where ultraviolet divergences are transmogrified into
infrared scales, focusing particularly on the properties of Yukawa theory,

escape from the galaxies. In recent years, several relatively small samples of
""leaky"" galaxies have been uncovered, and clues have begun to emerge as to both
the indirect signposts of leakiness and of the conditions/processes that enable
the escape of ionizing radiation. In this paper we present the results of a
pilot program aimed to test a new technique for finding leaky galaxies---using
the weakness of the [SII] nebular emission-lines relative to typical
star-forming galaxies as evidence that the interstellar medium is
optically-thin to the Lyman continuum. We use the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph

Lyman edge in two out of three [SII]-weak star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.3$.
We show that these galaxies differ markedly in their properties from the class
of leaky ""Green-Pea"" galaxies at similar redshifts: our sample galaxies are
more massive, more metal-rich, and less extreme in terms of their stellar
population and the ionization state of the interstellar medium. Like the Green
Peas, they have exceptionally high star-formation rates per unit area. They
also share some properties with the known leaky galaxies at $z\sim3$, but are
significantly dustier. Our results validate a new way to identify local

mass function of BHs in several ways. In massive metal-poor stars, fast
rotation reduces the minimum zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass for a star to
undergo pair instability and pulsational pair instability. Moreover, stellar
winds are enhanced by rotation, peeling-off the entire hydrogen envelope. As a
consequence of these two effects, the maximum BH mass we expect from the
collapse a rotating metal-poor star is only $\sim{}45$ M$_\odot$, while the
maximum mass of a BH born from a non-rotating star is $\sim{}60$ M$_\odot$.
Furthermore, stellar rotation reduces the minimum ZAMS mass for a star to
collapse into a BH from $\sim{}18-25$ M$_\odot$ to $\sim{}13-18$ M$_\odot$.
Finally, we have investigated the impact of different core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) prescriptions on our results. While the threshold value of compactness
for direct collapse and the fallback efficiency strongly affect the minimum
ZAMS mass for a star to collapse into a BH, the fraction of hydrogen envelope
that can be accreted onto the final BH is the most important ingredient to
determine the maximum BH mass. Our results confirm that the interplay between

particles. Using numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we quantify the
nonequilibrium phase behavior as a function of density and activity. If we view
activity as the analog of attraction strength, the phase diagram exhibits
strong similarities to that of attractive colloids, exhibiting both aging,
glassy states and gel-like arrested states. The two types of dynamically
arrested states, glasses and gels, are distinguished by the appearance of
density heterogenities in the latter. In the infinitely persistent limit, we
show that a coarse-grained model based on the asymmetric exclusion process
quantitatively predicts the density profiles of the gel states. The predictions
remain qualitatively valid for finite rotation rates. Using these results, we
classify the activity-driven phases and identify the boundaries separating
them.

model (DEQ). Motivated by an observation that the hidden layers of many
existing deep sequence models converge towards some fixed point, we propose the
DEQ approach that directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding.
Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied)
feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically
backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation.
Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only
constant memory, regardless of the effective ""depth"" of the network. We
demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence
models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale
language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs
1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar
parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing
models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for
training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88% memory reduction in
our experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/deq .

the past in left-to-right language models gets vanished and predictions about
the future get formed. In contrast, for MLM, representations initially acquire
information about the context around the token, partially forgetting the token
identity and producing a more generalized token representation. The token

low-mass stars in the IMF) is confined to central galaxy regions with surface
mass density above $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot kpc^{-2}$, or, alternatively, within a

voids. For the mass profile, we measure the tangential shear profiles of
background galaxies to infer the excess surface mass density. The
signal-to-noise ratio for our lensing measurement ranges between 10.7 and 14.0
for the two void samples. We infer their 3D density profiles by fitting models
based on N-body simulations and find good agreement for void radii in the range
15-85 Mpc. Comparison with their galaxy profiles then allows us to test the
relation between mass and light at the 10%-level, the most stringent test to
date. We find very similar shapes for the two profiles, consistent with a
linear relationship between mass and light both within and outside the void
radius. We validate our analysis with the help of simulated mock catalogues and
estimate the impact of photometric redshift uncertainties on the measurement.
Our methodology can be used for cosmological applications, including tests of
gravity with voids. This is especially promising when the lensing profiles are
combined with spectroscopic measurements of void dynamics via redshift-space

tunably delivered by thermal dehydration of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4

absorbed in the medium. In the case of amplifying media super-luminal motion is
predicted as in the case of resonance. However, there is a lowest value in the
frequency ratio below which the pulse velocity tends to the sub-luminal region.
These new features of the SIT phenomenon open novel ways on how it may be
exploited for the control of electromagnetic wave radiation in two-level media.
This may be achieved by varying frequency ratio.

  Attenuation Map Generation using Deep Learning","Accepted at MICCAI 2019",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In PET/CT imaging, CT is used for PET attenuation correction (AC). Mismatch
between CT and PET due to patient body motion results in AC artifacts. In
addition, artifact caused by metal, beam-hardening and count-starving in CT
itself also introduces inaccurate AC for PET. Maximum likelihood reconstruction
of activity and attenuation (MLAA) was proposed to solve those issues by
simultaneously reconstructing tracer activity ($\lambda$-MLAA) and attenuation
map ($\mu$-MLAA) based on the PET raw data only. However, $\mu$-MLAA suffers
from high noise and $\lambda$-MLAA suffers from large bias as compared to the
reconstruction using the CT-based attenuation map ($\mu$-CT). Recently, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to predict the CT attenuation
map ($\mu$-CNN) from $\lambda$-MLAA and $\mu$-MLAA, in which an image-domain
loss (IM-loss) function between the $\mu$-CNN and the ground truth $\mu$-CT was
used. However, IM-loss does not directly measure the AC errors according to the
PET attenuation physics, where the line-integral projection of the attenuation
map ($\mu$) along the path of the two annihilation events, instead of the $\mu$
itself, is used for AC. Therefore, a network trained with the IM-loss may yield
suboptimal performance in the $\mu$ generation. Here, we propose a novel
line-integral projection loss (LIP-loss) function that incorporates the PET
attenuation physics for $\mu$ generation. Eighty training and twenty testing
datasets of whole-body 18F-FDG PET and paired ground truth $\mu$-CT were used.
Quantitative evaluations showed that the model trained with the additional
LIP-loss was able to significantly outperform the model trained solely based on
the IM-loss function.

evolution. Constraints on the BLR geometry and dynamics can be obtained from
velocity-resolved studies using reverberation mapping data (i.e. monitoring
data). However, monitoring data are observationally expensive and only
available for a limited sample of AGN, mostly confined to the local Universe.
Here we explore a new version of a Bayesian inference, physical model of the
BLR which uses an individual spectrum and prior information on the BLR size
from the radius-luminosity relation, to model the AGN BLR geometry and
dynamics. We apply our model to a sample of 11 AGN, which have been previously
modelled using monitoring data. Our single-epoch BLR model is able to constrain
some of the BLR parameters with inferred parameter values that agree within the
uncertainties with those determined from the modelling of monitoring data. We
find that our model is able to derive stronger constraints on the BLR for AGN
with broad emission lines that qualitatively have more substructure and more
asymmetry, presumably as they contain more information to constrain the
physical model. The performance of this model makes it a practical and
cost-effective tool to determine some of the BLR properties of a large sample
of low and high redshift AGN, for which monitoring data are not available.

motivated by insights into cortical encoding of speech production and
artifactual aspects specific to ECoG data acquisition. To do this, we impose
auxiliary losses on latent representations for articulatory movements, speech

Brain2Char achieves 10.6\%, 8.5\% and 7.0\% Word Error Rates (WER) respectively

This relationship has been linked to the number of signals a decision-maker
receives in a social network. But it is unclear if these same principles hold
when the pattern by which it receives these signals vary and when peer
influence is directed towards choices which are not optimal. To investigate
that, we manipulate social signal exposure in an online controlled experiment
using a game with human participants. Each participant in the game makes a
decision among choices with differing utilities. We observe the following: (1)
even in the presence of monetary risks and previously acquired knowledge of the
choices, decision-makers tend to deviate from the obvious optimal decision when
their peers make similar decision which we call the influence decision, (2)
when the quantity of social signals vary over time, the forwarding probability
of the influence decision and therefore being responsive to social influence
does not necessarily correlate proportionally to the absolute quantity of
signals. To better understand how these rules of peer influence could be used
in modeling applications of real world diffusion and in networked environments,
we use our behavioral findings to simulate spreading dynamics in real world
case studies. We specifically try to see how cumulative influence plays out in
the presence of user uncertainty and measure its outcome on rumor diffusion,
which we model as an example of sub-optimal choice diffusion. Together, our
simulation results indicate that sequential peer effects from the influence
decision overcomes individual uncertainty to guide faster rumor diffusion over
time. However, when the rate of diffusion is slow in the beginning, user
uncertainty can have a substantial role compared to peer influence in deciding
the adoption trajectory of a piece of questionable information.

of non-linear dependencies between data without explicitly constructing feature
vectors in high dimensional spaces. A major disadvantage of kernel methods is
their poor scalability: primitives such as kernel PCA or kernel ridge
regression generally take prohibitively large quadratic space and (at least)
quadratic time, as kernel matrices are usually dense. Some methods for speeding
up kernel linear algebra are known, but they all invariably take time
exponential in either the dimension of the input point set (e.g., fast

  Oblivious sketching has emerged as a powerful approach to speeding up
numerical linear algebra over the past decade, but our understanding of
oblivious sketching solutions for kernel matrices has remained quite limited,
suffering from the aforementioned exponential dependence on input parameters.
Our main contribution is a general method for applying sketching solutions
developed in numerical linear algebra over the past decade to a tensoring of
data points without forming the tensoring explicitly. This leads to the first
oblivious sketch for the polynomial kernel with a target dimension that is only
polynomially dependent on the degree of the kernel function, as well as the

enables achieving a zero-outage capacity greater than zero without channel
state information at the transmitter for $n \geq 2$. Furthermore, the results
are applied to characterize the worst- and best-case joint distribution for
zero-outage capacity with perfect channel state information everywhere. All
results are specialized to Rayleigh fading and compared to the standard

the nonthermal emission observed from a wide variety of astrophysical sources.
By means of fully-kinetic 2D and 3D PIC simulations, we investigate the
interplay between turbulence and reconnection in generating nonthermal
particles in magnetically-dominated pair plasmas. A generic by-product of the
turbulence evolution is the generation of a nonthermal particle spectrum with a
power-law energy range. The power-law slope $p$ is harder for larger
magnetizations and stronger turbulence fluctuations, and it can be as hard as
$p < 2$. The Larmor radius of particles at the high-energy cutoff is comparable
to the size $l$ of the largest eddies. Plasmoid-mediated reconnection, which
self-consistently occurs in the turbulent plasma, controls the physics of
particle injection. Then, particles are further accelerated by stochastic
scattering off turbulent fluctuations. The work done by parallel electric
fields - naturally expected in reconnection layers - is responsible for most of
the initial energy increase, and is proportional to the magnetization $\sigma$
of the system, while the subsequent energy gain, which dominates the overall
energization of high-energy particles, is powered by the perpendicular electric
fields of turbulent fluctuations. The two-stage acceleration process leaves an
imprint in the particle pitch-angle distribution: low-energy particles are
aligned with the field, while the highest energy particles move preferentially
orthogonal to it. The energy diffusion coefficient of stochastic acceleration
scales as $D_\gamma\sim 0.1\sigma(c/l)\gamma^2$, where $\gamma$ is the particle
Lorentz factor. This results in fast acceleration timescales $t_{acc}\sim
(3/\sigma)\,l/c$. Our findings have important implications for understanding
the generation of nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysical sources.

specification is absent and, as a result, the event data is less structured.
The thesis puts special emphasis on one application domain that fits this
description: the analysis of smart home data where sequences of daily
activities are recorded. In this thesis we propose a set of techniques to
analyze such data, which can be grouped into two categories of techniques. The
first category of methods focuses on preprocessing event logs in order to
enable process discovery techniques to extract insights into unstructured event
data. In this category we have developed the following techniques: - An
unsupervised approach to refine event labels based on the time at which the
event took place, allowing for example to distinguish recorded eating events
into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - An approach to detect and filter from
event logs so-called chaotic activities, which are activities that cause
process discovery methods to overgeneralize. - A supervised approach to
abstract low-level events into more high-level events, where we show that there
exist situations where process discovery approaches overgeneralize on the
low-level event data but are able to find precise models on the high-level
event data. The second category focuses on mining local process models, i.e.,
collections of process model patterns that each describe some frequent pattern,
in contrast to the single global process model that is obtained with existing
process discovery techniques. Several techniques are introduced in the area of
local process model mining, including a basic method, fast but approximate
heuristic methods, and constraint-based techniques.

constraints. The analysis shows that potential optima may be found at the end
of a sequence of easily-initialized separate stages of continuation, without
the need to seed the first stage of continuation with nonzero values for the
corresponding Lagrange multipliers. A key enabler of the proposed
generalization is the use of complementarity functions to define relaxed
complementary conditions, followed by the use of continuation to arrive at the
limit required by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory. As a result, a successful
search for optima is found to be possible also from an infeasible initial
solution guess. The discussion shows that the proposed paradigm is compatible
with the staged construction approach of the COCO software package. This is
evidenced by a modified form of the COCO core used to produce the numerical
results reported here. These illustrate the efficacy of the continuation
approach in locating stationary solutions of an objective function along
families of two-point boundary value problems and in optimal control problems.

exploration that is robust to drift. Rather than a global map, it uses local
metric volumes connected by relative pose estimates. This pose-graph does not
need to be globally consistent. Overlaps between the volumes are resolved
locally, rather than on the faulty estimate of space. We demonstrate our
representation with a frontier-based exploration approach, evaluate it under
different conditions and compare it with a commonly-used grid-based
representation. We show that, at the cost of longer exploration time, using the
proposed representation allows full coverage of space even for very large drift

possibly a nonthermal source consistent with models of Inverse Compton
scattering of dust IR photons by electrons accelerated at the shock. The new,
subarcsecond resolution Chandra data, while confirming the presence of the
XMM-Newton source, clearly indicate that the latter is neither extended nor
coincident with the IR arc and strongly suggest it is a background AGN.
Motivated by results published for the bow shock of BD+43 3654, we extended our
study to the radio domain, by analyzing archival EVLA data. We find no radio
emission from the AE Aur bow shock either. The corresponding upper limits for
the absorbed (unabsorbed) X-ray flux of 5.9(7.8)x10^-15 erg/cm^2/s (3 sigma)
and, in the radio range, of 2 mJy (1.4 GHz), and 0.4 mJy (5.0 GHz), are used to
put constraints on model predictions for particle acceleration within the bow
shock. In the ""classical"" framework of Diffusive Shock Acceleration, we find
that the predicted X-ray and radio emission by the bow shock is at least two
orders of magnitude below the current upper limits, consistent with the
systematic non-detections of up to 60 stellar bow shocks. The only exception so

continuous family of conformal field theories (CFT), a.k.a. the conformal
manifold. Along a one-dimensional locus on the conformal manifold, there can be
a transition point, across which the fermionic CFTs on the two sides differ by
stacking an invertible fermionic topological order (IFTO), point-by-point along
the locus. At every point on the conformal manifold, the order and disorder
operators have power-law two-point functions, but their critical exponents
cross over with each other at the transition point, where stacking the IFTO
leaves the fermionic CFT unchanged. We call this continuous transition on the
fermionic conformal manifold a topological transition. By gauging the fermion
parity, the IFTO stacking becomes a Kramers-Wannier duality between the
corresponding bosonic CFTs. Both the IFTO stacking and the Kramers-Wannier

analysis. A common set of techniques for link prediction rely on similarity
metrics which use the topology of the observed subnetwork to quantify the
likelihood of unobserved links. Recently, similarity metrics for link
prediction have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks whereby observations
about the network are adversarially modified to hide target links. We propose a
novel approach for increasing robustness of similarity-based link prediction by
endowing the analyst with a restricted set of reliable queries which accurately
measure the existence of queried links. The analyst aims to robustly predict a
collection of possible links by optimally allocating the reliable queries. We
formalize the analyst problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in which they
first choose the reliable queries, followed by an adversary who deletes a
subset of links among the remaining (unreliable) queries by the analyst. The
analyst in our model is uncertain about the particular target link the
adversary attempts to hide, whereas the adversary has full information about
the analyst and the network. Focusing on similarity metrics using only local
information, we show that the problem is NP-Hard for both players, and devise
two principled and efficient approaches for solving it approximately. Extensive
experiments with real and synthetic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

results show that light absorption in the visible spectral range is enhanced
upon heating in both minerals but the rate of change in opacity with

bridgmanite in the lowermost mantle is moderately transparent while
ferropericlase is highly opaque. Our measurements suggest a very low (< 1
W/m/K) and largely temperature-independent radiative conductivity in the
lowermost mantle, at odds with previous studies. This implies that the
radiative mechanism has not contributed significantly to cooling the Earth/s

Additionally, five industry-practical machine learning algorithms are evaluated
on total fraud cost savings in addition to traditional statistical metrics.
Finally, an ensemble of individual models is trained with a genetic algorithm
to attempt to generate higher cost efficiency than its components. Monte Carlo
performance distributions discerned random undersampling outperformed SMOTE in
lowering fraud costs, and that an ensemble was unable to outperform its
individual parts. Most notably,the F-1 Score, a traditional metric often used
to measure performance with imbalanced data, was uncorrelated with derived cost
efficiency. Assuming a realistic cost structure can be derived, cost-based
metrics provide an essential supplement to objective statistical evaluation.

minima $n$ and energy scale $K$ are the key parameters; for large $K$ and $n$,
particle rotation is strongly hindered, but for small $K$ and $n$ particle
rotation is nearly free. A series of systems are simulated and characterized
using fractal dimensions, structure factors, coordination number distributions,
bond-angle distributions and linear rheology. When particles rotate easily,
clusters restructure to favor dense packings. This leads to longer gelation
times and gels with strand-like morphology. The elastic moduli of such gels
scale as $G' \propto \omega^{0.5}$ at high shear frequencies $\omega$. In
contrast, hindered particle rotation inhibits restructuring and leads to rapid
gelation and diffuse morphology. Such gels are stiffer, with
$G'\propto\omega^{0.35}$. The viscous moduli $G''$ in the low-barrier and
high-barrier regimes scale according to exponents $0.53$ and $0.5$,
respectively. The crossover frequency between elastic and viscous behaviors
generally increases with the barrier to rotation. These findings agree

occurring damage effects that reduce gradually the transport capacity of the
structure. We introduce a global measure to determine the functionality of each

spacetimes. We consider a two-dimensional theory in which the action describing
matter is a ghost-free modification of the Polyakov action. For this purpose we
write the Polyakov action in a local form by using an auxiliary scalar field
and modify its kinetic term by including into it a non-local ghost-free form
factor. We demonstrate that the effective stress-energy tensor is modified and
we study its properties in a background of a two-dimensional black hole. We
obtain the expression for the contribution of the ghost-free auxiliary field to
the entropy of the black hole. We also demonstrate that if the back-reaction
effects are not taken into account, such a ghost-free modification of the
theory does not change the energy flux of the Hawking radiation measured at
infinity. We illustrate the discussed properties for black hole solution of a
2D dilaton gravity model which admits a rather complete analytical study.

computer vision with numerous applications in object recognition, robotics, and

generalized clustering problem for an image pair. In our formulation, several
local matching games are simultaneously carried out in different corresponding
block pairs under the guidance of a novel payoff function consisting of both
geometric and descriptive compatibility; the global matching results are
further iteratively refined by clustering and thresholding with respect to a

been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of

black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they
take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such
deep learning techniques are necessary for the complete integration of such

explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to
extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks
achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to
train three different networks with standard architectures and outline
similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment
brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain
human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that
they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts
of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and
also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models
to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these

to learn a feasible allocation that minimizes the expected loss. The problem is
challenging because the loss distribution and threshold value of each arm are

of discerning the true state of the world that generates their joint
observation profiles. To address this problem, we propose a novel distributed
learning rule wherein agents aggregate neighboring beliefs based on a
min-protocol, and the inter-communication intervals grow geometrically at a
rate $a \geq 1$. Despite such sparse communication, we show that each agent is
still able to rule out every false hypothesis exponentially fast with
probability $1$, as long as $a$ is finite. For the special case when
communication occurs at every time-step, i.e., when $a=1$, we prove that the
asymptotic learning rates resulting from our algorithm are network-structure
independent, and a strict improvement upon those existing in the literature. In
contrast, when $a>1$, our analysis reveals that the asymptotic learning rates
vary across agents, and exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the network
topology coupled with the relative entropies of the agents' likelihood models.
This motivates us to consider the problem of allocating signal structures to
agents to maximize appropriate performance metrics. In certain special cases,
we show that the eccentricity centrality and the decay centrality of the
underlying graph help identify optimal allocations; for more general scenarios,
we bound the deviation from the optimal allocation as a function of the
parameter $a$, and the diameter of the communication graph.

optimal control with high-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics. A
promising approach is to embed the high-dimensional observations into a
lower-dimensional latent representation space, estimate the latent dynamics
model, then utilize this model for control in the latent space. An important
open question is how to learn a representation that is amenable to existing
control algorithms? In this paper, we focus on learning representations for
locally-linear control algorithms, such as iterative LQR (iLQR). By formulating
and analyzing the representation learning problem from an optimal control
perspective, we establish three underlying principles that the learned
representation should comprise: 1) accurate prediction in the observation
space, 2) consistency between latent and observation space dynamics, and 3) low
curvature in the latent space transitions. These principles naturally
correspond to a loss function that consists of three terms: prediction,
consistency, and curvature (PCC). Crucially, to make PCC tractable, we derive
an amortized variational bound for the PCC loss function. Extensive experiments
on benchmark domains demonstrate that the new variational-PCC learning
algorithm benefits from significantly more stable and reproducible training,
and leads to superior control performance. Further ablation studies give
support to the importance of all three PCC components for learning a good

quasi-bound state in the continuum. Unlike conventional method relying on heavy
computation (ie, frequency scanning by FDTD), our approach is built upon leaky

constructing avoid-crossing (or crossing) of the eigenvalue for pair leaky

developed that attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in the incremental

An alternative paradigm is online learning in a single pass through the

learning. Streaming learning has been much less studied in the deep learning
community. In streaming learning, an agent learns instances one-by-one and can
be tested at any time, rather than only after learning a large batch. Here, we
revisit streaming linear discriminant analysis, which has been widely used in

radiotherapy treatment planning. Inconsistencies across oncologists and
prohibitive labor costs motivate automated approaches for this task. However,
leading approaches are only applied to radiotherapy computed tomography (RTCT)
images taken prior to treatment. This limits the performance as RTCT suffers
from low contrast between the esophagus, tumor, and surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we aim to exploit both RTCT and positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging modalities to facilitate more accurate GTV segmentation. By utilizing
PET, we emulate medical professionals who frequently delineate GTV boundaries
through observation of the RTCT images obtained after prescribing radiotherapy
and PET/CT images acquired earlier for cancer staging. To take advantage of
both modalities, we present a two-stream chained segmentation approach that
effectively fuses the CT and PET modalities via early and late 3D
deep-network-based fusion. Furthermore, to effect the fusion and segmentation
we propose a simple yet effective progressive semantically nested network
(PSNN) model that outperforms more complicated models. Extensive 5-fold
cross-validation on 110 esophageal cancer patients, the largest analysis to

particular, many recent causal discovery methods make use of independent,
non-Gaussian noise to achieve identifiability of the causal models. Existence
of hidden direct common causes, or confounders, generally makes causal
discovery more difficult; whenever they are present, the corresponding causal
discovery algorithms can be seen as extensions of overcomplete independent
component analysis (OICA). However, existing OICA algorithms usually make
strong parametric assumptions on the distribution of independent components,
which may be violated on real data, leading to sub-optimal or even wrong
solutions. In addition, existing OICA algorithms rely on the Expectation
Maximization (EM) procedure that requires computationally expensive inference
of the posterior distribution of independent components. To tackle these
problems, we present a Likelihood-Free Overcomplete ICA algorithm (LFOICA) that
estimates the mixing matrix directly by back-propagation without any explicit
assumptions on the density function of independent components. Thanks to its
computational efficiency, the proposed method makes a number of causal
discovery procedures much more practically feasible. For illustrative purposes,
we demonstrate the computational efficiency and efficacy of our method in two
causal discovery tasks on both synthetic and real data.

(RT). High intra- and inter-user variability makes this a particularly
difficult task for esophageal cancer. This motivates automated solutions, which
is the aim of our work. Because CTV delineation is highly context-dependent--it
must encompass the GTV and regional lymph nodes (LNs) while also avoiding
excessive exposure to the organs at risk (OARs)--we formulate it as a deep
contextual appearance-based problem using encoded spatial contexts of these
anatomical structures. This allows the deep network to better learn from and
emulate the margin- and appearance-based delineation performed by human
physicians. Additionally, we develop domain-specific data augmentation to
inject robustness to our system. Finally, we show that a simple 3D progressive
holistically nested network (PHNN), which avoids computationally heavy decoding
paths while still aggregating features at different levels of context, can
outperform more complicated networks. Cross-validated experiments on a dataset

Schwarzschild black hole. This consists of a purely hydrodynamical mechanism in
which, by breaking spherical symmetry, a radially accreting flow transitions
into an inflow-outflow configuration. The spherical symmetry is broken by
considering that the accreted material is more concentrated on an equatorial
belt, leaving the polar regions relatively under-dense. What we have found is a
flux-limited accretion regime in which, for a sufficiently large accretion
rate, the incoming material chokes at a gravitational bottleneck and the excess
flux is redirected by the density gradient as a bipolar outflow. The threshold
value at which the accreting material chokes is of the order of the mass
accretion rate found in the spherically symmetric case studied by Bondi and
Michel. We describe the choked accretion mechanism first in terms of a general
relativistic, analytic toy model based on the assumption of an
ultrarelativistic stiff fluid. We then relax this approximation and, by means
of numerical simulations, show that this mechanism can operate also for general
polytropic fluids. Interestingly, the qualitative inflow-outflow morphology
obtained appears as a generic result of the proposed symmetry break, across
analytic and numeric results covering both the Newtonian and relativistic
regimes. The qualitative change in the resulting steady state flow
configuration appears even for a very small equatorial to polar density
contrast ($\sim 0.1\,\%$) in the accretion profile. Finally, we discuss the
applicability of this model as a jet-launching mechanism in different
astrophysical settings.

of nuisance parameters is a persistent difficulty in particle physics
experiments. Where low-level effects are not amenable to simple
parameterization or re-weighting, analyses often rely on discrete simulation
sets to quantify the effects of nuisance parameters on key analysis
observables. Such methods may become computationally untenable for analyses
requiring high statistics Monte Carlo with a large number of nuisance degrees
of freedom, especially in cases where these degrees of freedom parameterize the
shape of a continuous distribution. In this paper we present a method for
treating systematic uncertainties in a computationally efficient and
comprehensive manner using a single simulation set with multiple and
continuously varied nuisance parameters. This method is demonstrated for the
case of the depth-dependent effective dust distribution within the IceCube

transactions over the insecure network. Nevertheless, this ability comes with
the cost of storing a large (distributed) ledger, which has become unsuitable
for personal devices of any kind. Although the simplified payment verification
(SPV) clients can address this storage issue, a Bitcoin SPV client has to rely
on other Bitcoin nodes to obtain its transaction history and the current
approaches offer no privacy guarantees to the SPV clients.
  This work presents $T^3$, a trusted hardware-secured Bitcoin full client that
supports efficient oblivious search/update for Bitcoin SPV clients without
sacrificing the privacy of the clients. In this design, we leverage the trusted
execution and attestation capabilities of a trusted execution environment (TEE)
and the ability to hide access patterns of oblivious random access memory
(ORAM) to protect SPV clients' requests from a potentially malicious server.
The key novelty of $T^3$ lies in the optimizations introduced to conventional
ORAM, tailored for expected SPV client usages. In particular, by making a
natural assumption about the access patterns of SPV clients, we are able to
propose a two-tree ORAM construction that overcomes the concurrency limitation
associated with traditional ORAMs. We have implemented and tested our system
using the current Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output database. Our experiment
shows that the system is feasible to be deployed in practice while providing
strong privacy and security guarantees to Bitcoin SPV clients.

rarefied gas flow, the ray effect is also associated with the discrete velocity
method (DVM). However, few studies have been carried out in the rarefied
community. In this paper, we take a detailed investigation of the ray effect in
the rarefied flow simulations. Starting from a few commonly used benchmark
tests, the root of the ray effect has been analyzed theoretically and validated
numerically. At the same time, the influence of the ray effect on the quality
of the numerical results of rarefied flow is estimated quantitatively. After
understanding the nature of the ray effect, the strategy to minimize the ray

and applied in the numerical simulations. An optimal velocity discretization
for DVM is problem dependent and can be hardly obtained in the complex flow

stochastic particle methods are free from the ray effect. In rarefied regimes,
the particle method seems more appropriate in the capturing of highly

specifically tailored to the desired machine learning task. The second step

M83. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to image
molecular species indicative of shocks (SiO, CH$_3$OH), dense cores
(N$_2$H$^+$), and photodissociation regions (CN and CCH), as well as a radio
recombination line (H41$\alpha$) tracing active star-forming regions. M83 has a
circumnuclear gas ring that is joined at two areas by gas streams from the
leading-edge gas lanes on the bar. We found elevated abundances of the shock
and dense-core tracers in one of the orbit-intersecting areas, and found peaks
of CN and H41$\alpha$ downstream. At the other orbit-intersection area, we
found similar enhancement of the shock tracers, but less variation of other
tracers, and no sign of active star formation in the stream. We propose that
the observed chemical variation or lack of it is due to the presence or absence
of collision-induced evolution of molecular clouds and induced star formation.
This work presents the most clear case of the chemical evolution in the
circumnuclear rings of barred galaxies, thanks to the ALMA resolution and
sensitivity.

makes GaN an ideal material for high-power and high-frequency electronics

performance and reliability of GaN-based HEMTs are limited by the high channel
temperature induced by Joule-heating in the device channel. High thermal
conductivity substrates integrated with GaN can improve the extraction of heat
from GaN based HEMTs and lower the device operating temperature. However,
heterogeneous integration of GaN with diamond substrates is not trivial and
presents technical challenges to maximize the heat dissipation potential
brought by the diamond substrate. In this work, two modified room temperature
surface activated bonding techniques are used to bond GaN and single crystal
diamond with different interlayer thicknesses. TDTR is used to measure the
thermal properties from room temperature to 480 K. A relatively large TBC of
the GaN-diamond interfaces with a 4nm interlayer was observed and material
characterization was performed to link the structure of the interface to the
TBC. Device modeling shows that the measured GaN-diamond TBC values obtained
from bonding can enable high power GaN devices by taking the full advantage of
the high thermal conductivity of single crystal diamond and achieve excellent
cooling effect. Furthermore, the room-temperature bonding process in this work
do not induce stress problem due to different coefficient of thermal expansion
in other high temperature integration processes in previous studies. Our work
sheds light on the potential for room-temperature heterogeneous integration of
semiconductors with diamond for applications of electronics cooling especially

with bounded linear rankwidth are MSO-transductions of paths -- a result that
shows a strong link between the properties of these graph classes considered
from the point of view of structural graph theory and from the point of view of
finite model theory. We take both views on classes with bounded linear
rankwidth and prove structural and model theoretic properties of these classes.
The structural results we obtain are the following.
  1) The number of unlabeled graphs of order $n$ with linear rank-width at
most~$r$ is at most $\bigl[(r/2)!\,2^{\binom{r}{2}}3^{r+2}\bigr]^n$.
  2) Graphs with linear rankwidth at most $r$ are linearly $\chi$-bounded.
Actually, they have bounded $c$-chromatic number, meaning that they can be
colored with $f(r)$ colors, each color inducing a cograph.
  3) To the contrary, based on a Ramsey-like argument, we prove for every
proper hereditary family $F$ of graphs (like cographs) that there is a class
with bounded rankwidth that does not have the property that graphs in it can be
colored by a bounded number of colors, each inducing a subgraph in $F$.
  From the model theoretical side we obtain the following results:
  1) A direct short proof that graphs with linear rankwidth at most $r$ are
first-order transductions of linear orders. This result could also be derived
from Colcombet's theorem on first-order transduction of linear orders and the
equivalence of linear rankwidth with linear cliquewidth.
  2) For a class $C$ with bounded linear rankwidth the following conditions are
equivalent: a) $C$ is stable, b) $C$ excludes some half-graph as a semi-induced
subgraph, c) $C$ is a first-order transduction of a class with bounded
pathwidth.
  These results open the perspective to study classes admitting low linear
rankwidth covers.

radio-selected blazars monitored over a $\sim$10 year span by the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory 40-m telescope, we identified 20 sources exhibiting
significant flux density variations on 4-day timescales. The sky distribution
of the variable sources is strongly dependent on the line-of-sight Galactic
H$\alpha$ intensities from the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper Survey, demonstrating
the contribution of interstellar scintillation (ISS) to their interday
variability. 21% of sources observed through sight-lines with H$\alpha$
intensities larger than 10 rayleighs exhibit significant ISS persistent over
the $\sim$10 year period. The fraction of scintillators is potentially larger
when considering less significant variables missed by our selection criteria,
due to ISS intermittency. This study demonstrates that ISS is still important
at 15 GHz, particularly through strongly scattered sight-lines of the Galaxy.
Of the 20 most significant variables, 11 are observed through the
Orion-Eridanus superbubble, photoionized by hot stars of the Orion OB1
association. The high-energy neutrino source TXS0506$+$056 is observed through

modeled naturally by the product of relation matrices, as the product of
diagonal matrices is commutative and hence invariant with the order of

BlockHolE, based on block circulant matrices. In BlockHolE, relation matrices
can be non-commutative, allowing composite relations to be modeled by matrix

their selection of actions to increase rewarding experiences in their
environments. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is
a leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in
reinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the
agent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function)
via learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods
have been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can
become intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has
motivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state,
effectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state
representations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning
coupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been
shown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this
explanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not
arise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in
the cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support
the learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations
can avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We
provide support for this conjecture through computational simulations,

theoretical approaches attempt to determine the coefficients in order for
regularized empirical objectives to be upper-bounds of true objectives,

over-conservative, especially in high-dimensional settings with large

variance-based regularization is $O(\sqrt{d \log n/n})$, where $d$ is the

algorithm that calculates regularization coefficient, one which results in
faster convergence of generalization error $O(\sqrt{\log n/n})$ and whose
leading term is independent of the dimension $d$. This faster convergence
without dependence on the size of the hypothesis space is achieved by means of
empirical hypothesis space reduction, which, with high probability,
successfully reduces a hypothesis space without losing the true optimum

enables acceleration of the convergence of generalization error.

non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction is developed for three-dimensional flows,
in which the idea of two-dimensional WENO-AO scheme on unstructured meshes
\cite{WENO-ao-3} is adopted. In the classical finite volume type WENO schemes,
the linear weights for the candidate stencils are obtained by solving linear
systems at Gaussian quadrature points of cell interface. For the
three-dimensional scheme, such operations at twenty-four Gaussian quadrature
points of a hexahedron would reduce the efficiency greatly, especially for the
moving-mesh computation. Another drawback of classical WENO schemes is the
appearance of negative weights with irregular local topology, which affect the
robustness of spatial reconstruction. In such three-dimensional WENO-AO scheme,
a simple strategy of selecting big stencil and sub-stencils for reconstruction
is proposed. With the reconstructed quadratic polynomial from big stencil and
linear polynomials from sub-stencils, the linear weights are chosen as positive
numbers with the requirement that their sum equals one and be independent of
local mesh topology. With such WENO reconstruction, a high-order gas-kinetic
scheme (HGKS) is developed for both three-dimensional inviscid and viscous
flows. Taken the grid velocity into account, the scheme is extended into the
moving-mesh computation as well. Numerical results are provided to illustrate
the good performance of such new finite volume WENO schemes. In the future,
such WENO reconstruction will be extended to the unstructured meshes.

many downstream applications. Existing methods of hypernymy discovery either
leverage textual patterns to extract explicitly mentioned hypernym-hyponym
pairs, or learn a distributional representation for each term of interest based
its context. These approaches rely on statistical signals from the textual
corpus, and their effectiveness would therefore be hindered when the signals
from the corpus are not sufficient for all terms of interest. In this work, we
propose to discover hypernymy in text-rich HINs, which can introduce additional
high-quality signals. We develop a new framework, named HyperMine, that
exploits multi-granular contexts and combines signals from both text and
network without human labeled data. HyperMine extends the definition of context
to the scenario of text-rich HIN. For example, we can define typed nodes and
communities as contexts. These contexts encode signals of different
granularities and we feed them into a hypernymy inference model. HyperMine
learns this model using weak supervision acquired based on high-precision
textual patterns. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperMine and the utility of modeling context
granularity. We further show a case study that a high-quality taxonomy can be
generated solely based on the hypernymy discovered by HyperMine.

access to two different communication modes: a local mode where communication
is only possible between specific pairs of nodes, and a global mode where
communication between any pair of nodes is possible. This can be motivated, for
instance, by wireless networks in which we combine direct device-to-device
communication (e.g., using WiFi) with communication via a shared infrastructure
(like base stations, the cellular network, or satellites).
  Typically, communication over short-range connections is cheaper and can be
done at a much higher rate. Hence, we are focusing here on the LOCAL model (in
which the nodes can exchange an unbounded amount of information in each round)
for the local connections while for the global communication we assume the
so-called node-capacitated clique model, where in each round every node can
exchange only $O(\log n)$-bit messages with just $O(\log n)$ other nodes.
  In order to explore the power of combining local and global communication, we
study the impact of hybrid communication on the complexity of computing
shortest paths in the graph given by the local connections. Specifically, for
the all-pairs shortest paths problem (APSP), we show that an exact solution can
be computed in time $\tilde O\big(n^{2/3}\big)$ and that approximate solutions
can be computed in time $\tilde \Theta\big(\!\sqrt{n}\big)$. For the
single-source shortest paths problem (SSSP), we show that an exact solution can
be computed in time $\tilde O\big(\!\sqrt{\mathsf{SPD}}\big)$, where
$\mathsf{SPD}$ denotes the shortest path diameter. We further show that a
$\big(1\!+\!o(1)\big)$-approximate solution can be computed in time $\tilde
O\big(n^{1/3}\big)$. Additionally, we show that for every constant
$\varepsilon>0$, it is possible to compute an $O(1)$-approximate solution in
time $\tilde O(n^\varepsilon)$.

these exotic phenomena, have remained unexplored. Here we report the first
experimental investigation of the phonons and mutual interactions between spin

three prominent Raman modes at room temperature: two A1g({\Gamma}) and one
E2g({\Gamma}) phonons. The doubly degenerate E2g({\Gamma}) mode reverses the
helicity of incident photon, indicating the pseudo-angular momentum and
chirality. Through analysis of temperature-dependent phonon energies and
lifetimes, which strongly diverge from the anharmonic model below Curie
temperature, we determine the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GeTe2. Such
interaction between lattice oscillations and spin significantly enhances the
Raman susceptibility, allowing us to observe two additional Raman modes at the

networking consumer industrial and autonomous systems exchange messages in the
real world in order to achieve their objectives. Parts of these systems are
comprised of short-range wireless networks in the form of clusters that
collectively cover a large geographical area. In these clusters, the nodes that
represent the cluster heads need to deal with two types of communications: one
is within the cluster and the other is from the cluster to the sink node. As
the number of clusters increases, it takes multiple hops for the cluster head
to forward data to the sink node, thus resulting in a low packet delivery rate
and throughput. To solve this problem, we propose a heterogeneous area network
in which the cluster head is equipped with two types of radios: the IEEE
802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 radios. The former is for the devices within the
cluster to communicate, whereas the latter is for the cluster heads to
communicate to the sink node. Although the IEEE 802.11 links increase the link
capacity, the IEEE 802.11 radio and the IEEE 802.15.4 radio might share the 2.4
GHz unlicensed band, thus giving rise to the inter-network collisions or
interference. To tackle this problem and to maintain decent Qualityof-Service
(QoS) for the network, we subsequently present two interference mitigation
techniques, in which a Blank Burst (BB) period is proposed so that the IEEE
802.15.4 radios can be suspended while the IEEE 802.11 radios are active.
Simulation results show the proposed two methods can effectively mitigate the
inter-network collisions and are superior to the existing technique, which uses
an adaptive aggregation technique to mitigate the inter-network collisions.

Subsequently, the streamflow-sediment links of five major river basins are
evaluated using the novel Multifractal Cross Correlation Analysis (MFCCA)
method of cross correlation studies. The results showed that the joint
persistence of streamflow and total suspended sediments (TSS) is approximately
the mean of the persistence of individual series. The streamflow displayed
higher persistence than TSS in 60 % of the stations while in majority of

is higher than seasonal cross correlation in majority of stations but at these

excitement, unfortunately, most software developers are not DL experts and
oftentimes have a difficult time following the booming DL research outputs. As
a result, it usually takes a significant amount of time for the latest superior
DL models to prevail in industry. This issue is further exacerbated by the
common use of sundry incompatible DL programming frameworks, such as

called Model Asset Exchange (MAX), that avails developers of easy access to
state-of-the-art DL models. Regardless of the underlying DL programming
frameworks, it provides an open source Python library (called the MAX
framework) that wraps DL models and unifies programming interfaces with our
standardized RESTful APIs. These RESTful APIs enable developers to exploit the
wrapped DL models for inference tasks without the need to fully understand
different DL programming frameworks. Using MAX, we have wrapped and
open-sourced more than 30 state-of-the-art DL models from various research
fields, including computer vision, natural language processing and signal

that are built on top of MAX, as well as the process of adding a DL model to
MAX.

attention due to its concise and efficient pipeline. Generally, proposal-free
methods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and
instance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances.
However, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two
sub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating
these two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple
separate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The
mutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To
this end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation
method that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based
on a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two
pixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity
pyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and
achieve mutual benefits. Moreover, incorporating with the learned affinity
pyramid, a novel cascaded graph partition module is presented to sequentially
generate instances from coarse to fine. Unlike previous time-consuming graph
partition methods, this module achieves $5\times$ speedup and 9% relative
improvement on Average-Precision (AP). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art

mass over time through the Hawking radiation process. Since the particle

runaway process that eventually leads to a violent explosion. It has been

However, their impact on gas dynamics and star formation in galaxies remains
controversial. We use a suite of global magnetohydrodynamical simulations of
isolated disc galaxies to study the influence of magnetic fields on the diffuse
and dense gas in the discs. We find that the magnetic field acts in multiple
ways. Stronger magnetised discs fragment earlier due to the shorter growth time
of the Parker instability. Due to the Parker instability in the magnetised
discs we also find cold ($T<50\,\mathrm{K}$) and dense
($n\sim10^3-10^4\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) gas several hundred pc above/below the
midplane without any form of stellar feedback. In addition, magnetic fields
change the fragmentation pattern. While in the hydrodynamical case, the disc
breaks up into ring-like structures, magnetised discs show the formation of
filamentary entities that extent both in the azimuthal and radial direction.
These kpc scale filaments become magnetically (super-)critical very quickly and
allow for the rapid formation of massive giant molecular clouds. Our
simulations suggest that major differences in the behaviour of star formation -
due to a varying magnetisation - in galaxies could arise.

delivery. Many approaches exist in the form of frameworks, methods and tools to
setup an individual composition for a best fit. The challenge is that large
organizations are heterogeneous and diverse, and hence there is no ""one size
fits all"" approach. To facilitate a systematic implementation of agile and
lean, this article proposes a transition kit based on abstraction. This kit
scouts and bundles state of the art methods and tools from the agile and lean
community to align them with governance and compliance aspects of the specific
enterprise. Coaching of the application of the transition kit ensures an
adequate instantiation. The instantiation handles business domain specific
aspects and standards. A coaching governance ensures continuous improvement. An
example of the systematic application of the transition approach as well as its
scaling is demonstrated through its application in the Volkswagen Group IT.

with a finite probability to undergo a critical transition due to the effects

mobile dislocation density will increase deterministically, leading to
electrical breakdown. Model parametrization is achieved via microscopic
analysis of OFHC Cu cathode samples from the CERN CLIC project, allowing the
creation and depletion rates of mobile dislocations to be estimated as a

condition for the overall energy includes the subdifferential of the

existence of a solution to the time-dependent variational inequality. To solve
the discretized variational inequality, we use mixed finite elements, where
mechanical displacement and dielectric displacement are unknowns, as well as
polarization (and, if included in the model, remanent strain). It is then

The lack of any supervision makes such approaches conceptually attractive. Yet,
their only core difference from (weakly) supervised projection-based CLWE
methods is in the way they obtain a seed dictionary used to initialize an
iterative self-learning procedure. The fully unsupervised methods have arguably
become more robust, and their primary use case is CLWE induction for pairs of
resource-poor and distant languages. In this paper, we question the ability of
even the most robust unsupervised CLWE approaches to induce meaningful CLWEs in
these more challenging settings. A series of bilingual lexicon induction (BLI)
experiments with 15 diverse languages (210 language pairs) show that fully
unsupervised CLWE methods still fail for a large number of language pairs
(e.g., they yield zero BLI performance for 87/210 pairs). Even when they
succeed, they never surpass the performance of weakly supervised methods
(seeded with 500-1,000 translation pairs) using the same self-learning
procedure in any BLI setup, and the gaps are often substantial. These findings
call for revisiting the main motivations behind fully unsupervised CLWE

in a variety of areas in recent history, natural language tasks remained mostly
unaffected, due to the compositional and combinatorial nature that makes them
notoriously hard to optimize. With the emerging field of Text-Based Games
(TBGs), researchers try to bridge this gap. Inspired by the success of RL
algorithms on Atari games, the idea is to develop new methods in a restricted
game world and then gradually move to more complex environments. Previous work
in the area of TBGs has mainly focused on solving individual games. We,
however, consider the task of designing an agent that not just succeeds in a
single game, but performs well across a whole family of games, sharing the same
theme. In this work, we present our deep RL agent--LeDeepChef--that shows
generalization capabilities to never-before-seen games of the same family with
different environments and task descriptions. The agent participated in
Microsoft Research's ""First TextWorld Problems: A Language and Reinforcement
Learning Challenge"" and outperformed all but one competitor on the final test
set. The games from the challenge all share the same theme, namely cooking in a
modern house environment, but differ significantly in the arrangement of the
rooms, the presented objects, and the specific goal (recipe to cook). To build
an agent that achieves high scores across a whole family of games, we use an
actor-critic framework and prune the action-space by using ideas from
hierarchical reinforcement learning and a specialized module trained on a
recipe database.

commonly used for statistical estimation (aka. Uncertainty Quantification) of
quantities of interests obtained from expensive computational models. PCE is a
data-driven regression-based technique that relies on spectral polynomials as
basis-functions. In this technique, the outputs of few numerical simulations
are used to estimate the PCE coefficients within a regression framework
combined with regularization techniques where the regularization parameters are
estimated using standard cross-validation as applied in supervised machine
learning methods.
  In the present work, we introduce an efficient method for estimating the PCE
coefficients combining Elastic Net regularization with a data-driven feature
ranking approach. Our goal is to increase the probability of identifying the
most significant PCE components by assigning each of the PCE coefficients a
numerical value reflecting the magnitude of the coefficient and its stability
with respect to perturbations in the input data. In our evaluations, the
proposed approach has shown high convergence rate for high-dimensional
problems, where standard feature ranking might be challenging due to the curse
of dimensionality.
  The presented method is implemented within a standard machine learning
library (Scikit-learn) allowing for easy experimentation with various solvers
and regularization techniques (e.g. Tikhonov, LASSO, LARS, Elastic Net) and
enabling automatic cross-validation techniques using a widely used and well
tested implementation. We present a set of numerical tests on standard
analytical functions, a two-phase subsurface flow model and a simulation
dataset for CO2 sequestration in a saline aquifer. For all test cases, the
proposed approach resulted in a significant increase in PCE convergence rates.

  The evolution of Dean vortices as the thermal transient passes is studied. It
is found that baroclinic vorticity generation dominates over a large period of

leads to a reversal of the counter-rotating vortex pair. The impact of this

the central regions, the RPSBs only show clear evidence of recently rapidly
suppressed star formation in their outer regions and an ongoing central
starburst. The radial profiles in mass-weighted age and stellar $v/\sigma$

sides of the module, actual limitations of conventional monofacial solar
modules can be overcome at almost no additional costs. Optimising large-scale
bifacial solar power plants with regard to minimum levelised cost of
electricity (LCOE), however, is challenging due to the vast amount of free
parameters such as module inclination angle and distance, module and land
costs, character of the surroundings, weather conditions and geographic
position. We present a detailed illumination model for bifacial PV modules in a
large PV field and calculate the annual energy yield exemplary for two
locations with different climates. By applying the Bayesian optimisation
algorithm we determine the global minimum of the LCOE for bifacial and
monofacial PV fields at these two exemplary locations considering land costs in
the model. We find that currently established design guidelines for mono- and
bifacial solar farms often do not yield the minimum LCOE. Our algorithm finds
solar panel configurations yielding up to 23 % lower LCOE compared to the
established configuration with the module tilt angle equal to the latitude and
the module distance chosen such that no mutual shading of neighboring solar
panels occurs at winter solstice. Our algorithm enables the user to extract
clear design guidelines for mono- and bifacial large-scale solar power plants
for most regions on Earth and further accelerates the development of
competitively viable photovoltaic systems.

roughly Neptune mass can create three (or more) rings in which dust
accumulates. We find that the relative spacing of these rings depends on the

principle, distinguishable by long-baseline, state-of-the-art ALMA

annuli, as well as in exterior circular domains, in punctured disks and in the

that, if the flow does not have any stagnation point, and if it satisfies
further conditions at infinity in the case of an exterior domain or at the
center in the case of a punctured disk or the punctured plane, then the flow is
circular, namely the streamlines are concentric circles. In other words, the
flow then inherits the radial symmetry of the domain. The proofs are based on
the study of the trajectories of the flow and the orthogonal trajectories of
the gradient of the stream function, which is shown to satisfy a semilinear
elliptic equation in the whole domain. In exterior or punctured domains, the
method of moving planes is applied to some almost circular domains located
between some streamlines of the flow, and the radial symmetry of the stream
function is shown by a limiting argument. The paper also contains two
Serrin-type results in simply or doubly connected bounded domains with free
boundaries. Here, the flows are further assumed to have constant norm on each
connected component of the boundary and the domains are then proved to be disks

programs' functionality. The set of functions invoked by a test is called the
trace of the test, and the action of obtaining a trace is called tracing. There
are many tracing tools since traces are useful for a variety of software
engineering tasks such as test generation, fault localization, and test
execution planning. A major drawback in using test traces is that obtaining
them, i.e., tracing, can be costly in terms of computational resources and
runtime. Prior work attempted to address this in various ways, e.g., by
selectively tracing only some of the software components or compressing the
trace on-the-fly. However, all these approaches still require building the
project and executing the test in order to get its (partial, possibly
compressed) trace. This is still very costly in many cases. In this work, we
propose a method to predict the trace of each test without executing it, based
only on static properties of the test and the tested program, as well as past
experience on different tests. This prediction is done by applying supervised
learning to learn the relation between various static features of test and
function and the likelihood that one will include the other in its trace. Then,
we show how to use the predicted traces in a recent automated troubleshooting
paradigm called Learn Diagnose and plan (LDP), instead of the actual,
costly-to-obtain, test traces. In a preliminary evaluation on real-world
open-source projects, we observe that our prediction quality is reasonable. In
addition, using our trace predictions in LDP yields almost the same results
comparing to when using real traces, while requiring less overhead.

attracted much attention, partially because they may be used for the
fault-tolerant quantum computation. It has been predicted that the Majorana
zero mode may exist in the vortex core of topological superconductors.
Recently, many iron-based superconductors are claimed to exhibit a
topologically nontrivial surface state, including Fe(Te,Se). Some previous
experiments through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have found zero-bias
conductance peaks (ZBCP) within the vortex cores of Fe(Te,Se). However, our
early experimental results have revealed the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM)
discrete quantum levels in about 20% vortices. In many other vortices, we
observed a dominant peak locating near zero bias. Here we show further study on
the vortex core state of many more vortices in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. In
some vortices, if we take a certain criterion of bias voltage window near zero
energy, we indeed see a zero energy mode. Some vortices exhibit zero energy
bound state peaks with relatively symmetric background, which cannot be
interpreted as the CdGM discrete states. The probability for vortices showing
the ZBCP lowers down with the increase of magnetic field. Meanwhile it seems
that the presence and absence of the ZBCP has no clear relationship with the
Te/Se ratio on the surface. Temperature dependence of the spectra reveals that
the ZBCP becomes weakened with increasing temperature and disappears at about 4
K. Our results provide a confirmed supplementary to the early claimed zero
energy modes within the vortex cores of Fe(Te,Se). Detailed characterization of
these zero energy modes versus magnetic field, temperature and spatial
distribution of Te/Se will help to clarify its origin.

ensembles in a driven-dissipative experimental setup, where they are
collectively damped by a bad cavity mode and incoherently pumped by a Raman
laser. Starting from the mean-field equations, we explain the emergence of
chaos by way of quasiperiodicity -- presence of two or more incommensurate
frequencies. This is known as the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos. The
equations of motion have a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry with respect to the
interchange of the two ensembles. However, some of the attractors of these
equations spontaneously break this symmetry. To understand the emergence and
subsequent properties of various attractors, we concurrently study the
mean-field trajectories, Poincar\'{e} sections, maximum and conditional
Lyapunov exponents, and power spectra. Using Floquet analysis, we show that
quasiperiodicity is born out of non $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations via
a supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Changing the detuning between the
level spacings in the two ensembles and the repump rate results in the
synchronization of the two chaotic ensembles. In this regime, the chaotic
intensity fluctuations of the light radiated by the two ensembles are
identical. Identifying the synchronization manifold, we understand the origin
of synchronized chaos as a tangent bifurcation intermittency of the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations. At its birth, synchronized chaos is
unstable. The interaction of this attractor with other attractors causes on-off
intermittency until the synchronization manifold becomes sufficiently
attractive. We also show coexistence of different phases in small pockets near
the boundaries.

recently published parameter space, a point in which defines a family of binary
texture images displaying a prescribed content of \nth{1}- to \nth{4}-order
correlations among pixels in 2x2 patches. We show that this parameter space can
be represented by fewer variables, namely the \emph{orbit invariants} obtained
by exploiting texture symmetry. Next we show how a class of locally countable
texture statistics, the Minkowski functionals -- recently shown to be a proxy
for human performance in texture discrimination tasks - can be written as a
linear combination of the dihedral orbit invariants. Furthermore, by recasting
these functionals as a combination of dihedral invariants, a generalization of
these functionals can be obtained for textures of any number of grey-levels,
patch sizes, or lattice types -- greatly reducing the number of
dimensions/parameters needed to characterize the generated images. Orbit
invariants may therefore provide a clue on the discrimination of these richer
textures, as the ordinary Minkowski functionals do for binary textures.

either rare, that is affecting few data streams, or common. We then show how to
detect multiple anomalies in a way that is computationally efficient but avoids
the approximations inherent in binary segmentation-like approaches. This
approach, which we call MVCAPA, is shown to consistently estimate the number
and location of the collective anomalies, a property that has not previously
been shown for competing methods. MVCAPA can be made robust to point anomalies
and can allow for the anomalies to be imperfectly aligned. We show the
practical usefulness of allowing for imperfect alignments through a resulting

construct exceptionally detailed maps of Lyman-alpha line properties at sub-kpc

structures in the Lyman-alpha emission and uncover small (~ 120 km/s in
Lyman-alpha peak shift), but significant at > 4 sigma, systematic variations in
the shape of the Lyman-alpha line profile within each halo. Indeed, we observe
a global trend for the line peak shift to become redder at large radii,
together with a strong correlation between the peak wavelength and line width.
This systematic intrahalo variation is markedly similar to the object-to-object
variations obtained from the integrated properties of recent large samples.
Regions of high surface brightness correspond to relatively small line shifts,
which could indicate that Lyman-alpha emission escapes preferentially from
regions where the line profile has been less severely affected by scattering of

(NLFH) has been instrumental in unraveling many new dynamical universality
classes in coupled driven systems with multiple conserved quantities. In
principle, this formalism requires knowledge of the exact expression of locally

However, for most nonequilibrium systems an exact expression is not available
and it is important to know what happens to the predictions of NLFH in these
cases. We address this question for the first time here in a system with
coupled time evolution of sliding particles on a fluctuating energy landscape.
In the disordered phase this system shows short-ranged correlations, this
system shows short-ranged correlations, the exact form of which is not known,
and so the exact expression for current cannot be obtained. We use approximate
expressions based on mean-field theory and corrections to it, to test the
prediction of NLFH using numerical simulations. In this process we also
discover important finite size effects and show how they affect the predictions
of NLFH. We find that our system is rich enough to show a large variety of
universality classes. From our analytics and simulations we have been able to
find parameter values which lead to diffusive, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ), $5/3

function in the modified KPZ case turns out to be close to the Pr\""ahofer-Spohn

However, the physical mechanisms causing the change of the magnetic inclination

calculation indicate the magnetic moment $M_{2}$ would evolve towards alignment
with the spin axis for PSR J1640-4631, and cause the magnetic inclination angle

in shaping the structural parameters and internal dynamics of its globular
cluster population. We make use of a homogeneous, up-to-date data set with
kinematics, structural properties, current and initial masses of 156 globular
clusters. In general, cluster radii increase as the Milky Way potential
weakens; with the core and Jacobi radii being those which increase at the
slowest and fastest rate respectively. We interpret this result as the
innermost regions of globular clusters being less sensitive to changes in the
tidal forces with the Galactocentric distance. The Milky Way's gravitational
field also seems to have differentially accelerated the internal dynamical
evolution of individual clusters, with those toward the bulge appearing
dynamically older. Finally we find a sub-population consisting of both compact
and extended globular clusters (as defined by their rh/rJ ratio) beyond 8 kpc
that appear to have lost a large fraction of their initial mass lost via
disruption. Moreover, we identify a third group with rh/rJ > 0.4, which have
lost an even larger fraction of their initial mass by disruption. In both cases
the high fraction of mass lost is likely due to their large orbital
eccentricities and inclination angles, which lead to them experiencing more
tidal shocks at perigalacticon and during disc crossings. Comparing the
structural and orbital parameters of individual clusters allows for constraints
to be placed on whether or not their evolution was relaxation or tidally
dominated.

series exhibiting autocorrelation functions of great diversity of behaviors,
including long-range power-law autocorrelation functions, as a signature of
interactions operating at many temporal or spatial scales. Often, algorithms
able to generate correlated noises reproducing the properties of real time
series produce \textsl{Gaussian} outputs, while real, experimentally observed
time series are often non-Gaussian, and may follow distributions with a
diversity of behaviors concerning the support, the symmetry or the tail
properties. Here, we study how the correlation of two Gaussian variables
changes when they are transformed to follow a different destination
distribution. Specifically, we consider bounded and unbounded distributions,
symmetric and non-symmetric distributions, and distributions with different
tail properties, from decays faster than exponential to heavy tail cases
including power-laws, and we find how these properties affect the correlation
of the final variables. We extend these results to Gaussian time series which
are transformed to have a different marginal distribution, and show how the
autocorrelation function of the final non-Gaussian time series depends on the
Gaussian correlations and on the final marginal distribution. As an application
of our results, we propose how to generalize standard algorithms producing
Gaussian power-law correlated time series in order to create synthetic time
series with arbitrary distribution and controlled power-law correlations.
Finally, we show a practical example of this algorithm by generating time
series mimicking the marginal distribution and the power-law tail of the
autocorrelation function of a real time series: the absolute returns of stock

caused by ordinary relaxation of the metastable phase into an ordered
(crystalline) phase and by dipole alignment induced by an applied electric
field. We found that this system at the temperature $T=268$ K, where water has
the density $0.94$ g/cm$^3$ and the applied electric field is of the magnitude
$E=0.5~\textrm{V}$/Angstrom, crystallizes into the cubic ice with few the

multiple sensors, including automotive radars. The fact that autonomous
vehicles implement both radar and communications motivates designing these

(DFRC) designs are the focus of a large body of recent works. These approaches
can lead to substantial gains in size, cost, power consumption, robustness, and
performance, especially when both radar and communications operate in the same
range, which is the case in vehicular applications. This article surveys the
broad range of DFRC strategies and their relevance to autonomous vehicles. We
identify the unique characteristics of automotive radar technologies and their
combination with wireless communications requirements of self-driving cars.
Then, we map the existing DFRC methods along with their pros and cons in the
context of autonomous vehicles, and discuss the main challenges and possible
research directions for realizing their full potential.

changes. However, recent prior work shows that as dataset sizes grow, DL model
accuracy and model size grow predictably. This paper leverages the prior work
to project the dataset and model size growth required to advance DL accuracy
beyond human-level, to frontier targets defined by machine learning experts.
Datasets will need to grow $33$--$971 \times$, while models will need to grow
$6.6$--$456\times$ to achieve target accuracies.
  We further characterize and project the computational requirements to train
these applications at scale. Our characterization reveals an important
segmentation of DL training challenges for recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

have comparatively moderate operational intensities and very large memory

important for guiding stereo image processing and commutation systems due to
the widespread usage of 3D contents. Compared with conventional methods which
are relied on hand-crafted features, deep learning oriented measurements have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years. However, most existing deep
SIQM evaluators are not specifically built for stereoscopic contents and
consider little prior domain knowledge of the 3D human visual system (HVS) in
network design. In this paper, we develop a Predictive Auto-encoDing Network
(PAD-Net) for blind/No-Reference stereoscopic image quality measurement. In the
first stage, inspired by the predictive coding theory that the cognition system
tries to match bottom-up visual signal with top-down predictions, we adopt the
encoder-decoder architecture to reconstruct the distorted inputs. Besides,
motivated by the binocular rivalry phenomenon, we leverage the likelihood and
prior maps generated from the predictive coding process in the Siamese
framework for assisting SIQM. In the second stage, quality regression network
is applied to the fusion image for acquiring the perceptual quality prediction.
The performance of PAD-Net has been extensively evaluated on three benchmark
databases and the superiority has been well validated on both symmetrically and
asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic images under various distortion types.

optimizations available in LLVM and Souper Optimizer to simplify away the
obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this approach can be effective

bogus control flow or integer encoding found in public and commercial

Plate Recognition (ALPR) system based on the state-of-the-art YOLO object
detector that contains a unified approach for license plate (LP) detection and
layout classification to improve the recognition results using post-processing
rules. The system is conceived by evaluating and optimizing different models,
aiming at achieving the best speed/accuracy trade-off at each stage. The
networks are trained using images from several datasets, with the addition of
various data augmentation techniques, so that they are robust under different
conditions. The proposed system achieved an average end-to-end recognition rate
of 96.9% across eight public datasets (from five different regions) used in the
experiments, outperforming both previous works and commercial systems in the
ChineseLP, OpenALPR-EU, SSIG-SegPlate and UFPR-ALPR datasets. In the other
datasets, the proposed approach achieved competitive results to those attained
by the baselines. Our system also achieved impressive frames per second (FPS)
rates on a high-end GPU, being able to perform in real time even when there are
four vehicles in the scene. An additional contribution is that we manually
labeled 38,351 bounding boxes on 6,239 images from public datasets and made the
annotations publicly available to the research community.

sense that there always exists a pair of classical--quantum states saturating
the bound, and so no further improvements are possible. An immediate
application is a uniform continuity bound for entanglement of formation that

consists of a central server with a catalog of $N$ files, $K$ caches with
limited memory $M$, and $K$ users such that each user has access to $L$
consecutive caches with a cyclic wrap-around and requests one file from the
central server's catalog. The server assists in file delivery by transmitting a
message of size $R$ over a shared error-free link and the goal is to
characterize the optimal rate-memory trade-off. This setup was studied
previously by Hachem et al., where an achievable rate and an
information-theoretic lower bound were derived. However, the multiplicative gap
between them was shown to scale linearly with the access degree $L$ and thus
order-optimality could not be established.
  A series of recent works have used a natural mapping of the coded caching
problem to the well-known index coding problem to derive tighter
characterizations of the optimal rate-memory trade-off under the additional
assumption that the caches store uncoded content. We follow a similar strategy
for the multi-access framework and provide new bounds for the optimal
rate-memory trade-off $R^*(M)$ over all uncoded placement policies. In
particular, we derive a new achievable rate for any $L \ge 1$ and a new lower
bound, which works for any uncoded placement policy and $L \ge K/2$. We then
establish that the (multiplicative) gap between the new achievable rate and the
lower bound is at most $2$ independent of all parameters, thus establishing an
order-optimal characterization of $R^*(M)$ for any $L\ge K/2$. This is a
significant improvement over the previously known gap result, albeit under the
restriction of uncoded placement policies. Finally, we also characterize
$R^*(M)$ exactly for a few special cases.

tasks is the scarcity and cost of labeled training data. Active Learning (AL)
is one way of addressing this challenge. In stream-based AL, observations are
continuously made available to the learner that have to decide whether to
request a label or to make a prediction. The goal is to reduce the request rate
while at the same time maximize prediction performance. In previous research,
reinforcement learning has been used for learning the AL request/prediction
strategy. In our work, we propose to equip a reinforcement learning process
with memory augmented neural networks, to enhance the one-shot capabilities.
Moreover, we introduce Class Margin Sampling (CMS) as an extension of the
standard margin sampling to the reinforcement learning setting. This strategy
aims to reduce training time and improve sample efficiency in the training
process. We evaluate the proposed method on a classification task using
empirical accuracy of label predictions and percentage of label requests. The
results indicates that the proposed method, by making use of the memory
augmented networks and CMS in the training process, outperforms existing

the observed gamma-ray emission from 47 Tuc is due to two source populations of

electron density wave. It is accompanied with quantum oscillations periodic in
inverse magnetic field, similar to the standard de Haas - van Alphen effect,
due to Landau level filling. The phase transition appears as a quantum one at
T=0, provided the relevant coupling constant is above the critical one. This
critical value rapidly decreases, and finally saturates toward zero on the

predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However,
the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is
essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work,
we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To
address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher
with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following
which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable.
Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher

rectified Gaussian distribution from i.i.d. samples. A rectified Gaussian
distribution is defined by passing a standard Gaussian distribution through a
one-layer ReLU neural network. We give a simple algorithm to estimate the
parameters (i.e., the weight matrix and bias vector of the ReLU neural network)
up to an error $\epsilon||W||_F$ using $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples and
$\tilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ time (log factors are ignored for simplicity). This
implies that we can estimate the distribution up to $\epsilon$ in total
variation distance using $\tilde{O}(\kappa^2d^2/\epsilon^2)$ samples, where
$\kappa$ is the condition number of the covariance matrix. Our only assumption
is that the bias vector is non-negative. Without this non-negativity
assumption, we show that estimating the bias vector within any error requires
the number of samples at least exponential in the infinity norm of the bias
vector. Our algorithm is based on the key observation that vector norms and
pairwise angles can be estimated separately. We use a recent result on learning
from truncated samples. We also prove two sample complexity lower bounds:
$\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples are required to estimate the parameters up to
error $\epsilon$, while $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to
estimate the distribution up to $\epsilon$ in total variation distance. The
first lower bound implies that our algorithm is optimal for parameter
estimation. Finally, we show an interesting connection between learning a
two-layer generative model and non-negative matrix factorization. Experimental
results are provided to support our analysis.

the joint coordinate sequence into an image sequence, which can model the
different correlations of different joints. With this image based skeletal
representation, we model the pose prediction as the evolution of image
sequence. Moreover, a novel inference network is proposed to predict all future
poses in one step by decoupling the decoders in a non-recursive manner.

changing leaders, to a single long-term leader. When a leader is deposed, the

explanation of how such phenomena can emerge from simple rules of interaction
between individuals. Here, we model transitions between different phases of
leadership structure. We find a novel class of group dynamical behaviour where
there is a single leader who is quickly replaced when they lose status,
demonstrating a power vacuum. The model uses a dynamic network of individuals
who non-coercively form and break alliances with one-another, with a key
parameter modelling inequality in these alliances. We argue the model can
explain transitions in leadership structure in the Neolithic Era from
relatively equal hunter-gatherer societies, to groups with chieftains which
change over time, to groups with an institutionalised leader on a paternal
lineage. Our model demonstrates how these transitions can be explained by the
impact of technological developments such as food storage and/or weapons, which

consideration that fine-grained energy metering is not used at the point of

measured (at time steps of 15 minutes, 30 minutes or one hour), the event-based
energy metering (EDM) is indicated as a viable option to provides a very
detailed reconstruction of the demand patterns. The use of EDM enables
high-quality tracking of the demand peaks with a reduced number of data with

a similar peak tracking capability. From the EDM outcomes, a new class of
options for setting up tariffs or contracts for flexibility, based on the

  To extract a high-accuracy model, we develop a learning-based attack

analytical and empirical arguments, we then explain the inherent limitations

  Process",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To improve the ability of VAE to disentangle in the latent space, existing
works mostly focus on enforcing independence among the learned latent factors.
However, the ability of these models to disentangle often decreases as the
complexity of the generative factors increases. In this paper, we investigate
the little-explored effect of the modeling capacity of a posterior density on
the disentangling ability of the VAE. We note that the independence within and
the complexity of the latent density are two different properties we constrain
when regularizing the posterior density: while the former promotes the
disentangling ability of VAE, the latter -- if overly limited -- creates an
unnecessary competition with the data reconstruction objective in VAE.
Therefore, if we preserve the independence but allow richer modeling capacity
in the posterior density, we will lift this competition and thereby allow
improved independence and data reconstruction at the same time. We investigate
this theoretical intuition with a VAE that utilizes a non-parametric latent
factor model, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), as a latent density that is able
to grow with the complexity of the data. Across three widely-used benchmark
data sets and two clinical data sets little explored for disentangled learning,
we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the improved disentangling
performance of IBP-VAE over the state of the art. In the latter two clinical
data sets riddled with complex factors of variations, we further demonstrated
that unsupervised disentangling of nuisance factors via IBP-VAE -- when
combined with a supervised objective -- can not only improve task accuracy in
comparison to relevant supervised deep architectures but also facilitate
knowledge discovery related to task decision-making. A shorter version of this
work will appear in the ICDM 2019 conference proceedings.

image-wide global search, a novel skimming module is designed to efficiently

carbon-oxygen star explodes as a supernova in presence of a neutron star binary
companion in close orbit. Hypercritical (i.e. highly super-Eddington) accretion
of the ejecta matter onto the neutron star sets in, making it reach the
critical mass with consequent formation of a Kerr black hole. We have recently
shown that, during the accretion process onto the neutron star, fast neutrino
flavour oscillations occur. Numerical simulations of the above system show that
a part of the ejecta keeps bound to the newborn Kerr black hole, leading to a
new process of hypercritical accretion. We here address, also for this phase of
the binary-driven hypernova, the occurrence of neutrino flavour oscillations
given the extreme conditions of high density (up to $10^{12}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and
temperatures (up to tens of MeV) inside this disk. We estimate the
\textcolor{red}{behaviour} of the electronic and non-electronic neutrino
content within the two-flavour formalism ($\nu_{e}\nu_{x}$) under the action of
neutrino collective effects by neutrino self-interactions. We find that in the
case of inverted mass hierarchy, neutrino oscillations inside the disk have
frequencies between $\sim (10^{5}$-$10^{9})$ s$^{-1}$, leading the disk to
achieve flavour equipartition. This implies that the energy deposition rate by
neutrino annihilation ($\nu + \bar{\nu} \to e^{-} + e^{+}$) in the vicinity of
the Kerr black hole, is smaller than previous estimates in the literature not
accounting by flavour oscillations inside the disk. The exact value of the
reduction factor depends on the $\nu_{e}$ and $\nu_{x}$ optical depths but it
can be as high as $\sim 5$. The results of this work are a first step toward
the analysis of neutrino oscillations in a novel astrophysical context and, as
such, deserve further attention.

synapses, where intracluster local synapses are mapped within crossbars of the
hardware and inter-cluster global synapses are mapped to the shared

restrictors and asymmetric Y meters were fabricated to adjust the metering
ratio between seawater and acid simulants. Laser etching conditions were varied
to create a range of channel dimensions down to ~75 microns. Channel flow
versus pressure measurements were used to determine hydrodynamic resistances
which were compared with finite element simulations using a range of
cross-section profiles and areas. Microfluidic metering circuits were
constructed from variable resistance snake channels and dimensionally symmetric

multivariate data missing non-monotonically and not-at-random, taking a
semiparametric approach. Specifically, we assume that the missingness mechanism
satisfies what has been previously called ""no self-censoring"" or ""itemwise
conditionally independent nonresponse,"" which roughly corresponds to the
assumption that no partially-observed variable directly determines its own
missingness status. We show that this assumption, combined with an odds ratio
parameterization of the joint density, enables identification of functionals of
interest, and we establish the semiparametric efficiency bound for the
nonparametric model satisfying this assumption. We propose a practical
augmented inverse probability weighted estimator, and in the setting with a
(possibly high-dimensional) always-observed subset of covariates, our proposed
estimator enjoys a certain double-robustness property. We explore the
performance of our estimator with simulation experiments and on a
previously-studied data set of HIV-positive mothers in Botswana.

solve transverse magnetic scattering problems by multilayer embedded objects.
In the proposed approach, an equivalent current density is derived when the
equivalent theorem is recursively applied on each boundary from inner to
exterior regions. Then, the objects are replaced by the background medium and
the equivalent electric current density enforced on the outermost boundary
remains fields in the exterior region unchanged. Therefore, the scattering
problems by the multilayer embedded objects can be solved with the electric
field integral equation (EFIE). Compared with other two-region formulations
(TRFs), like the PMCHWT, CTF, the proposed approach shows significant benefits:
only the surface electric current density instead of both the electric and
magnetic current densities is required to model the complex objects.
Furthermore, the single electric current density is only enforced on the
outermost boundary of objects. Therefore, the overall count of unknowns can be
significantly reduced, especially when the number of boundaries between
different homogeneous media is large. At last, several numerical experiments
are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Targets are generated uniformly as per a Poisson process in time with a fixed

several policies in the low and high arrival rates of target generation. For
low arrival, we propose and analyze a First-Come-First-Served and a Look-Ahead

  Privacy Theory","5 pages, 1 table",,,,"cs.CR cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The use of connected surgical robotics to automate medical procedures
presents new privacy challenges. We argue that conventional patient consent
protocols no longer work. Indeed robots that replace human surgeons take on an
extraordinary level of responsibility. Surgeons undergo years of training and
peer review in a strongly regulated environment, and derive trust via a
patient's faith in the hospital system. Robots on the other hand derive trust
differently, via the integrity of the software that governs their operation.
From a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental shifts. First, the threat
model has shifted from one where the humans involved were untrusted to one
where the robotic software is untrusted. Second, the basic unit of privacy
control is no longer a medical record, but is replaced by four new basic units:
the subject on which the robot is taking action; the tools used by the robot;
the sensors (i.e data) the robot can access; and, finally access to monitoring
and calibration services which afford correct operation of the robot. We
suggest that contextual privacy provides useful theoretical tools to solve the
privacy problems posed by surgical robots. However, it also poses some
challenges: not least that the complexity of the contextual-privacy policies,
if rigorously specified to achieve verification and enforceability, will be
exceedingly high to directly expose to humans that review contextual privacy
policies. A medical robot works with both information and physical material.
While informational norms allow for judgements about contextual integrity and
the transmission principle governs the constraints applied on information
transfer, nothing is said about material property. Certainly, contextual
privacy provides an anchor for useful notions of privacy in this scenario and
thus should be considered to be extended to cover both information and material
flows.

error in a temporal interferometric stack. In this study, two deep learning
architectures, namely convolutional neural network for interferometric semantic
segmentation (CNN-ISS) and convolutional long short term memory network for

and spatio-temporal behaviour respectively, were proposed for selection of PS

to its classification into phase stable (PS) and phase unstable (non-PS)
measurement pixels using ~10,000 real world interferometric images of different
study sites containing man-made objects, forests, vegetation, uncropped land,
water bodies, and areas affected by lengthening, foreshortening, layover and

a classified image of the test dataset, reveal that CLSTM-ISS estimates
improved the classification of PS and non-PS pixels compared to those of StaMPS

pseudospin chirality at two valleys. Klein tunneling refers to the intriguing
capability of these chiral electrons to penetrate through high and wide
potential barrier. The two valleys have been treated independently in the
literature, where time reversal symmetry dictates that neither the normal
incidence transmission nor the angle-averaged one can have any valley
polarization. Here we show that, when intervalley scattering by barrier is
accounted, graphene electrons normally incident at a superlattice barrier can
experience a fully valley-selective Klein tunneling, i.e. perfect transmission
in one valley, and perfect reflection in the other. Intervalley backscattering
creates staggered pseudospin gaps in the superlattice barrier, which, combined
with the valley contrast in pseudospin chirality, determines the valley
polarity of Klein tunneling. The angle averaged transmission can have a net
valley polarization of 20% for a 5-period barrier, and exceed 75% for a
20-period barrier. Our finding points to an unexpected opportunity to realize

potential source of outflows that may perturb the global expansion rate and
thus help mitigate the present `$H_0$ tension'. First, we compare local
peculiar velocities measured via the galaxy average redshift-magnitude Hubble
diagram, $\bar{z}(m)$, with a simple dynamical outflow model based on the
average underdensity in the Local Hole. We find that this outflow model is in
good agreement with our peculiar velocity measurements from $\bar{z}(m)$ and
not significantly inconsistent with SNIa peculiar velocity measurements from at
least the largest previous survey. This outflow could cause an $\approx2-3$\%
increase in the local value of Hubble's constant. Second, considering
anisotropic motions, we find that the addition of the outflow model may improve
the $\bar{z}(m)$ fit of a bulk flow where galaxies are otherwise at rest in the
Local Group frame. We conclude that the Local Hole plus neighbouring
overdensities such as the Shapley Supercluster may cause outflow and bulk
motions out to $\approx150$h$^{-1}$Mpc that are cosmologically significant and
that need to be taken into account in estimating Hubble's constant.

$m$-generated group, the density of its Cayley graph in a given set of
generators, is the supremum of densities taken over all its finite subgraphs.
It is known that a group with $m$ generators is amenable iff the density of the
corresponding Cayley graph equals $2m$. A famous problem on the amenability of
R.\,Thompson's group $F$ is still open. What is known due to the result by Belk
and Brown, is that the density of its Cayley graph in the standard set of group
generators $\{x_0,x_1\}$, is at least $3.5$. This estimate has not been
exceeded so far. For the set of symmetric generators $S=\{x_1,\bar{x}_1\}$,
where $\bar{x}_1=x_1x_0^{-1}$, the same example gave the estimate only $3$.
There was a conjecture that for this generating set the equality holds. If so,
$F$ would be non-amenable, and the symmetric generating set had doubling
property. This means that for any finite set $X\subset F$, the inequality
$|S^{\pm1}X|\ge2|X|$ holds. In this paper we disprove this conjecture showing
that the density of the Cayley graph of $F$ in symmetric generators $S$
strictly exceeds $3$. Moreover, we show that even larger generating set
$S_0=\{x_0,x_1,\bar{x}_1\}$ does not have doubling property.

convex programming. It is intrinsically linked to the affine structure of the
underlying space. Here we introduce an alternative notion of self-concordance
which is linked to the projective structure. A function on a set $X \subset
A^n$ in an $n$-dimensional affine space is projectively self-concordant if and
only if it can be extended to an affinely self-concordant logarithmically
homogeneous function on the conic extension $K \subset V^{n+1}$ of $X$ in the
$(n+1)$-dimensional vector space obtained by homogenization of $A^n$. The
feasible sets in conic programs, notably linear and semi-definite programs, are
naturally equipped with projectively self-concordant barriers. However, the
interior-point methods used to solve these programs employ only affine
self-concordance. We show that estimates used in the analysis of interior-point
methods are tighter for projective self-concordance, in particular inner and
outer approximations of the set. This opens the way to a better tuning of
parameters in interior-points algorithms to allow larger steps and hence faster
convergence. Projective self-concordance is also a useful tool in the
theoretical analysis of logarithmically homogeneous barriers on cones.

formation of a hybridized state which paves a way for exploiting new degrees of
freedom to control phenomena with high efficiency and precision. A magnon
polaron is the hybridized state of a phonon and a magnon, the elementary quanta
of lattice vibrations and spin waves in a magnetically-ordered material. A
magnon polaron can be formed at the intersection of the magnon and phonon
dispersions, where their frequencies coincide. The observation of magnon
polarons in the time domain has remained extremely challenging because the weak
interaction of magnons and phonons and their short lifetimes jeopardize the
strong coupling required for the formation of a hybridized state. Here, we
overcome these limitations by spatial matching of magnons and phonons in a
metallic ferromagnet with a nanoscale periodic surface pattern. The spatial
overlap of the selected phonon and magnon modes formed in the periodic
ferromagnetic structure results in a high coupling strength which, in
combination with their long lifetimes allows us to find clear evidence of an
optically excited magnon polaron. We show that the symmetries of the localized
magnon and phonon states play a crucial role in the magnon polaron formation
and its manifestation in the optically excited magnetic transients.

between data sets favours the blurred reflection model. In particular, the
variability can be attributed to changes in flux of the primary coronal
emission. Different reflection models fit the data equally well, but differ in
interpretation. The use of reflionx predicts a low disc ionisation and power
law dominated spectrum, while relxill predicts a highly ionised and blurred
reflection dominated spectrum. A power law dominated spectrum might be more
consistent with the normal X-ray-to-UV spectral shape (aox). Both blurred
reflection models suggest a rapidly spinning black hole seen at a low
inclination angle, and both require a sub-solar (~0.5) abundance of iron. All
physical models require a narrow emission feature at 6.7 keV likely

the work in [1, 2], which used implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods (IMEX) to
build high-order, partitioned multiphysics solvers. We consider a generic
multiphysics problem modeled as a system of coupled ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), coupled through coupling terms that can depend on the state
of each subsystem; therefore the method applies to both a semi-discretized
system of partial differential equations (PDEs) or problems naturally modeled
as coupled systems of ODEs. The sufficient conditions to build arbitrarily
high-order partitioned SDC schemes are derived. Based on these conditions,
various of partitioned SDC schemes are designed. The stability of the
first-order partitioned SDC scheme is analyzed in detail on a coupled, linear
model problem. We show that the scheme is conditionally stable, and under
conditions on the coupling strength, the scheme can be unconditionally stable.
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on several
classes of multiphysics problems including a simple linear system of ODEs,
advection-diffusion-reaction systems, and fluid-structure interaction problems
with both incompressible and compressible flows, where we verify the design
order of the SDC schemes and study various stability properties. We also
directly compare the accuracy, stability, and cost of the proposed partitioned
SDC solver with the partitioned IMEX method in [1, 2] on this suite of test
problems. The results suggest that the high-order partitioned SDC solvers are
more robust than the partitioned IMEX solvers for the numerical examples
considered in this work, while the IMEX methods require fewer implicit solves.

order to relate separation in the graph to conditional independence in the
distribution, and this is particularly important when performing inference from
data. When the model is perfect, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
conditional independence statements in the distribution and separation
statements in the graph. Previous work has shown that almost all models based
on linear directed acyclic graphs as well as Gaussian chain graphs are perfect,
the latter of which subsumes Gaussian graphical models (i.e., the undirected
Gaussian models) as a special case. However, the complexity of chain graph
models leads to a proof of this result which is indirect and mired by the
complications of parameterizing this general class. In this paper, we directly
approach the problem of perfectness for the Gaussian graphical models, and
provide a new proof, via a more transparent parametrization, that almost all

  arXiv:1801.07319",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consistency properties provided by most key-value stores can be classified
into sequential consistency and eventual consistency. The former is easier to
program with but suffers from lower performance whereas the latter suffers from
potential anomalies while providing higher performance. We focus on the problem
of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly
with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store
that provides a weaker consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based
approach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say $P$, and
continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors $P$. If $P$ is violated
(because of weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the
computation at a state where $P$ holds.
  We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the
Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2
instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a
$50\%$ -- $80\%$ increase in throughput when compared with sequential
consistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low
(typically less than $4\%$) and the latency of detecting violations was small.
In particular, in a scenario designed to intentionally cause a large number of
violations, more than $99.9\%$ of violations were detected in less than 50
milliseconds in regional networks, and in less than 3 seconds in global
networks.
  We find that for some applications, frequent rollback can cause the program
using eventual consistency to effectively \textit{stall}. We propose alternate
mechanisms for dealing with re-occurring rollbacks. Overall, for applications
considered in this paper, we find that even with rollback, eventual consistency
provides better performance than using sequential consistency.

for a countable set of particular frequencies, the spectrum consists of three
disjoint parts: The essential spectrum consisting of the point zero, an
infinite sequence of positive eigenvalues which accumulate only at infinity and
an infinite sequence of negative eigenvalues which accumulate only at zero. The
analysis is based on a representation of the operator as block operator. For
small/big enough eigenvalue parameter the Schur-complements with respect to
different components can be build. For each Schur-complement the existence of
an infinite sequence of eigenvalues is proved via a fixed point technique

nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem. Methods for solving optimization
problems in large-scale machine learning, such as deep learning and deep
reinforcement learning (RL), are generally restricted to the class of
first-order algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). While SGD
iterates are inexpensive to compute, they have slow theoretical convergence
rates. Furthermore, they require exhaustive trial-and-error to fine-tune many
learning parameters. Using second-order curvature information to find search
directions can help with more robust convergence for non-convex optimization
problems. However, computing Hessian matrices for large-scale problems is not
computationally practical. Alternatively, quasi-Newton methods construct an
approximate of the Hessian matrix to build a quadratic model of the objective
function. Quasi-Newton methods, like SGD, require only first-order gradient
information, but they can result in superlinear convergence, which makes them
attractive alternatives to SGD. The limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular
quasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations.
In this chapter, we propose efficient optimization methods based on L-BFGS
quasi-Newton methods using line search and trust-region strategies. Our methods
bridge the disparity between first- and second-order methods by using gradient
information to calculate low-rank updates to Hessian approximations. We provide
formal convergence analysis of these methods as well as empirical results on
deep learning applications, such as image classification tasks and deep
reinforcement learning on a set of ATARI 2600 video games. Our results show a
robust convergence with preferred generalization characteristics as well as
fast training time.

efficient, safe, regulatory-compliant and sustainable operations of modern
systems. Their increasing complexity brings new challenges for the Sensor Fault
Detection and Isolation (SFD-SFI) tasks. One of the key enablers for any
SFD-SFI methods employed in modern complex sensor systems, is the so-called
analytical redundancy, which is nothing but building an analytical model of the
sensors observations (either derived from first principles or identified from
historical data in a data-driven fashion). In a nutshell, SFD amounts to
generate and to monitor residuals by comparing the sensor measurements with the
model predictions with the idea that the faulty sensors will result in large
residuals (i.e. the defective sensors generate measurement that are
inconsistent with their expected behavior represented by the model). In this
paper we introduce a disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the
objective to cope with the \textit{smearing-out} effect, i.e. the propagation
of a sensor fault to the non-faulty sensors resulting in large misleading
residuals. Moreover, the introduction of a probabilistic model for the residual
generation allows us to develop a novel procedure for the identification of the
faulty sensors. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is
linear in the number of sensors as opposed to the combinatorial nature of the
SFI problem. Finally, we empirically verify the performances of the proposed
SFD-SFI architecture using a real data set collected at a petrochemical plant.

shape of which the classical dynamics is integrable, and introduced circular
scatterers of varying number, size and position. The spectral properties of
generic quantum systems of which the classical counterpart is either integrable
or chaotic are universal and well understood. If, however, the classical
dynamics is pseudo-integrable or almost-integrable, they exhibit a
non-universal intermediate statistics, for which analytical results are known

size and position to the sector billiard. We demonstrate that, while the
spectral properties of almost-integrable billiards are sensitive to the
classical dynamics, this is not the case for the distribution of the
wavefunction components, which was analysed in terms of the strength
distribution, and the fluctuation properties of the scattering matrix which
coincide with those of typical, fully chaotic systems.

technology usage like software usage and even security feature usage. However,
on the dark side it has also allowed an adversary to potentially exploit the
users in a manner to either obtain information from them or influence them
towards decisions that might have malicious settings or intents. While there
have been substantial efforts into understanding how social influence affects
one's likelihood to adopt a security technology, especially its correlation
with the number of friends adopting the same technology, in this study we
investigate whether peer influence can dictate what users decide over and above
their own knowledge. To this end, we manipulate social signal exposure in an
online controlled experiment with human participants to investigate whether
social influence can be harnessed in a negative way to steer users towards
harmful security choices. We analyze this through a controlled game where each
participant selects one option when presented with six security technologies
with differing utilities, with one choice having the most utility. Over
multiple rounds of the game, we observe that social influence as a tool can be
quite powerful in manipulating a user's decision towards adoption of security
technologies that are less efficient. However, what stands out more in the
process is that the manner in which a user receives social signals from its
peers decides the extent to which social influence can be successful in
changing a user's behavior.

challenges are critical when developing machine learning algorithms in

using distributed learning techniques such as federated learning over disparate

This paper proposes an improved algorithm to securely train deep neural
networks over several data sources in a distributed way, in order to eliminate
the need to centrally aggregate the data and the need to share the data thus
preserving privacy. The proposed method allows training of deep neural networks
using data from multiple de-linked nodes in a distributed environment and to
secure the representation shared during training. Only a representation of the
trained models (network architecture and weights) are shared. The algorithm was
evaluated on existing healthcare patients data and the performance of this
implementation was compared to that of a regular deep neural network trained on
a single centralised architecture. This algorithm will pave a way for
distributed training of neural networks on privacy sensitive applications where

low-dimensional systems, but there is significant interest in their application
to high-dimensional weather and climate models. We build on work by Smith et

the time that individual ""candidate"" trajectories of high-dimensional models
shadow observations, using a model of the thermally-driven rotating annulus in
the perfect model scenario. Models of the annulus are intermediate in
complexity between low-dimensional systems and global atmospheric models. We
demonstrate our method by measuring shadowing times against
artificially-generated observations for candidate trajectories beginning a
fixed distance from truth in one of the annulus' chaotic flow regimes. The
distribution of candidate shadowing times we calculated using our method
corresponds closely to (1) the range of times over which the trajectories
visually diverge from the observations and (2) the divergence time using a
simple metric based on the distance between model trajectory and observations.
An empirical relationship between the expected candidate shadowing times and
the initial distance from truth confirms that the method behaves reasonably as

a minimal number of parameters steered to each task. Inspired by the recent
success of multi-domain learning in image classification, for the first time we
explore a promising universal architecture that handles multiple medical
segmentation tasks and is extendable for new tasks, regardless of different
organs and imaging modalities. Our 3D Universal U-Net (3D U$^2$-Net) is built
upon separable convolution, assuming that {\it images from different domains
have domain-specific spatial correlations which can be probed with channel-wise
convolution while also share cross-channel correlations which can be modeled
with pointwise convolution}. We evaluate the 3D U$^2$-Net on five organ
segmentation datasets. Experimental results show that this universal network is
capable of competing with traditional models in terms of segmentation accuracy,
while requiring only about $1\%$ of the parameters. Additionally, we observe
that the architecture can be easily and effectively adapted to a new domain
without sacrificing performance in the domains used to learn the shared
parameterization of the universal network. We put the code of 3D U$^2$-Net into
