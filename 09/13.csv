parties. In such a scenario, the Intellectual Property (IP) is not protected
against adversarial developers which have unrestricted access to the firmware
binary. For this reason, microcontroller manufacturers integrate eXecute-Only
Memory (XOM) which shall prevent an unauthorized read-out of third-party
firmware during development. The concept allows execution of code but disallows
any read access to it. Our security analysis shows that this concept is
insufficient for firmware protection due to the use of shared resources such as
the CPU and SRAM. We present a method to infer instructions from observed state
transitions in shared hardware. We demonstrate our method via an automatic
recovery of protected firmware. We successfully performed experiments on
devices from different manufacturers to confirm the practicability of our
attack. Our research also reveals implementation flaws in some of the analyzed
devices which enables an adversary to bypass the read-out restrictions.
Altogether, the paper shows the insufficient security of the XOM concept as
well as several implementations.

approaches, however, have so far been addressed separately. On the other hand,
recent works in optical computational imaging have demonstrated growing success
of concurrent learning-based design of data acquisition and image
reconstruction schemes. Such schemes have already demonstrated substantial
effectiveness, leading to considerably shorter acquisition times and improved
quality of image reconstruction. Inspired by this initial success, in this
work, we propose a novel approach to the learning of optimal schemes for
conjoint acquisition and reconstruction of MRI scans, with the optimization
carried out simultaneously with respect to the time-efficiency of data
acquisition and the quality of resulting reconstructions. To be of a practical
value, the schemes are encoded in the form of general k-space trajectories,
whose associated magnetic gradients are constrained to obey a set of predefined
hardware requirements (as defined in terms of, e.g., peak currents and maximum
slew rates of magnetic gradients). With this proviso in mind, we propose a
novel algorithm for the end-to-end training of a combined
acquisition-reconstruction pipeline using a deep neural network with
differentiable forward- and back-propagation operators. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on image reconstruction and image segmentation tasks, reporting
substantial improvements in terms of acceleration factors as well as the
quality of these tasks.

  ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing, Washington DC, November 7-9, 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Urban imagery usually serves as forensic analysis and by design is available
for incident mitigation. As more imagery collected, it is harder to narrow down
to certain frames among thousands of video clips to a specific incident. A
real-time, proactive surveillance system is desirable, which could instantly
detect dubious personnel, identify suspicious activities, or raise momentous
alerts. The recent proliferation of the edge computing paradigm allows more
data-intensive tasks to be accomplished by smart edge devices with lightweight
but powerful algorithms. This paper presents a forensic surveillance strategy
by introducing an Instant Suspicious Activity identiFication at the Edge
(I-SAFE) using fuzzy decision making. A fuzzy control system is proposed to
mimic the decision-making process of a security officer. Decisions are made
based on video features extracted by a lightweight Deep Machine Learning (DML)
model. Based on the requirements from the first-line law enforcement officers,
several features are selected and fuzzified to cope with the state of
uncertainty that exists in the officers' decision-making process. Using
features in the edge hierarchy minimizes the communication delay such that
instant alerting is achieved. Additionally, leveraging the Microservices
architecture, the I-SAFE scheme possesses good scalability given the increasing
complexities at the network edge. Implemented as an edge-based application and
tested using exemplary and various labeled dataset surveillance videos, the
I-SAFE scheme raises alerts by identifying the suspicious activity in an
average of 0.002 seconds. Compared to four other state-of-the-art methods over
two other data sets, the experimental study verified the superiority of the
I-SAFE decentralized method.

straightforwardly optimize their objective, and enables humans to learn what
the robot is trying to achieve. However, our insight is that---when robots are
aware that humans learn by trusting that the robot actions are
rational---intelligent robots do not act as the human expects; instead, they
take advantage of the human's trust, and exploit this trust to more efficiently
optimize their own objective. In this paper, we formally model instances of
human-robot interaction (HRI) where the human does not know the robot's
objective using a two-player game. We formulate different ways in which the

search for faint FRBs near the core of the Virgo cluster using the Australian
Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder telescope. During 300 hr of observations, we
discovered one burst, FRB 180417, with dispersion measure DM $=474.8$
cm$^{-3}$pc. The FRB was promptly followed up by several radio telescopes for
27 h, but no repeat bursts were detected. An optical follow-up of FRB 180417
using the PROMPT5 telescope revealed no new sources down to an $R$-band
magnitude of 20.1. We argue that FRB 180417 is likely behind the Virgo cluster
as the Galactic and intracluster DM contribution are small compared to the DM
of the FRB, and there are no galaxies in the line of sight. The non-detection
of FRBs from Virgo constrains the faint-end slope, $\alpha<1.52$ (at 68\%
confidence limit), and the minimum luminosity, $L_{\rm min}\gtrsim 2\times

overfitting to the domain they are trained in. For this problem, a domain is
characterized not just by genre of text but even by factors as specific as the
particular distribution of entities, as neural models tend to overfit by
memorizing properties of frequent entities in a dataset. We tackle the problem
of building robust entity linking models that generalize effectively and do not
rely on labeled entity linking data with a specific entity distribution. Rather
than predicting entities directly, our approach models fine-grained entity
properties, which can help disambiguate between even closely related entities.
We derive a large inventory of types (tens of thousands) from Wikipedia
categories, and use hyperlinked mentions in Wikipedia to distantly label data
and train an entity typing model. At test time, we classify a mention with this
typing model and use soft type predictions to link the mention to the most
similar candidate entity. We evaluate our entity linking system on the
CoNLL-YAGO dataset (Hoffart et al., 2011) and show that our approach
outperforms prior domain-independent entity linking systems. We also test our
approach in a harder setting derived from the WikilinksNED dataset (Eshel et

existence of fast algorithms. Despite numerous algorithmic improvements, the
computation time is still non-negligible because researchers often estimate
many quantile regressions and use the bootstrap for inference. We suggest two
new fast algorithms for the estimation of a sequence of quantile regressions at
many quantile indexes. The first algorithm applies the preprocessing idea of
Portnoy and Koenker (1997) but exploits a previously estimated quantile
regression to guess the sign of the residuals. This step allows for a reduction
of the effective sample size. The second algorithm starts from a previously
estimated quantile regression at a similar quantile index and updates it using
a single Newton-Raphson iteration. The first algorithm is exact, while the
second is only asymptotically equivalent to the traditional quantile regression
estimator. We also apply the preprocessing idea to the bootstrap by using the
sample estimates to guess the sign of the residuals in the bootstrap sample.
Simulations show that our new algorithms provide very large improvements in
computation time without significant (if any) cost in the quality of the
estimates. For instance, we divide by 100 the time required to estimate 99
quantile regressions with 20 regressors and 50,000 observations.

intergalactic star-forming emission. We present the extended ionised gaseous
structures detected and analyse their kinematical properties. The large field
of view (11'x11') and the spectral ranges of SITELLE have allowed a thorough
study of the entire galaxy system, its interaction history and the main
properties of the ionised gas. The observations have revealed complex 3D
strands in SQ seen for the first time, as well as the spatially resolved
velocity field for a new SQ dwarf galaxy (M82-like) and the detailed spectral
map of NGC7320c, confirming its AGN nature. A total of 175 SQ H$\alpha$
emission regions have been found, 22 of which present line profiles with at
least two kinematical components. We studied 12 zones and 28 sub-zones in the
SQ system to define plausible physical spatial connections between its
different parts in the light of the kinematical information gathered. In this
respect we have found 5 velocity systems in SQ: i) v=[5600-5900] $km\,s^{-1}$;
ii) v=[5900-6100] $km\,s^{-1}$; iii) v=[6100-6600] $km\,s^{-1}$; iv)
v=[6600-6800] $km\,s^{-1}$; and v) v=[6800-7000] $km\,s^{-1}$. No gas emission
is detected in the old tail, neither near NGC7318A nor in NGC7317, and the
connection between NGC7319 north lobe and starburst A cannot be confirmed.
Conversely, a clear gaseous bridge has been confirmed both spatially and
kinematically between the large-scale shock region and the NGC7319 AGN.
Finally, a larger scale, outer rim winding the NGC7318B/A system clockwise
north-west to south-east has been highlighted in continuum and in H$\alpha$.
This structure may be reminiscent of a sequence of a previously proposed
scenario for SQ a sequence of individual interactions.

which form a vector bundle morphism; examples include the complete lifts of
vector fields to tangent bundles and the horizontal lifts arising from a
connection in a vector bundle. A grid in a double vector bundle consists of two
linear sections, one in each structure, and thus provides two paths from the
base manifold to the top space; the warp of the grid measures the lack of
commutativity of the two paths.
  For a double vector bundle $D$, a linear section induces a linear map on the
relevant dual of $D$ and thence a linear section of the iterated dual; we call
this the corresponding squarecap section. This notion makes precise the
relationships between various standard $1$-forms and vector fields that are not
dual in the usual sense. A grid in $D$ induces squarecap sections in the two
iterated duals. These iterated duals are themselves in duality and we obtain an
expression for the warp of a grid in terms of a pairing. This result extends
the relationships between various standard formulas, and clarifies the iterated
dualization involved in the concept of double Lie algebroid.
  In the first part of the paper we review the nonstandard pairing of the two
duals of a double vector bundle, showing in particular that it arises as a
direct generalization of the Legendre-type antisymplectomorphism $T^*(A^*)\to
T^*(A)$ for any vector bundle $A$ of Mackenzie and Xu.

sets of parameters to describe different dynamic regimes that a time series may
exhibit at different periods of time. The switching mechanism between regimes
is controlled by unobserved random variables that form a first-order Markov
chain. Explicit-duration MSMs contain additional variables that explicitly
model the distribution of time spent in each regime. This allows to define
duration distributions of any form, but also to impose complex dependence
between the observations and to reset the dynamics to initial conditions.
Models that focus on the first two properties are most commonly known as hidden
semi-Markov models or segment models, whilst models that focus on the third
property are most commonly known as changepoint models or reset models. In this
monograph, we provide a description of explicit-duration modelling by
categorizing the different approaches into three groups, which differ in
encoding in the explicit-duration variables different information about regime
change/reset boundaries. The approaches are described using the formalism of
graphical models, which allows to graphically represent and assess statistical
dependence and therefore to easily describe the structure of complex models and
derive inference routines. The presentation is intended to be pedagogical,
focusing on providing a characterization of the three groups in terms of model
structure constraints and inference properties. The monograph is supplemented
with a software package that contains most of the models and examples
described. The material presented should be useful to both researchers wishing
to learn about these models and researchers wishing to develop them further.

the introduction of non-linear feedback, where decreasing the saturation value
has a similar effect to decreasing the co-variance. We also find co-operation
to no longer have a detrimental effect on stability with non-linear feedback,

We further demonstrate the interpretability of our model via three analyses.
First, the controller can softly decompose the multi-hop question into multiple
single-hop sub-questions to promote compositional reasoning behavior of the

Furthermore, we develop a model that correlates the energy resolution with the

new approaches to the mechanism by which spacetime can emerge as the ground

one dimensionless coupling constant. Extensions to this model have been
proposed that improve the ground state geometry, but they require additional
coupling constants. In this paper we conduct an extensive exploration of the
graph properties of the ground states of these models, and a simplification
requiring only one coupling constant. We demonstrate that the simplification is
effective at producing an acceptable ground state. Moreover we propose a scheme
for the inclusion of matter and dynamics as excitations above the ground state

political and economic challenges. The classical voter model is a
well-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we
define a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a
simplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We
use the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the
recently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and
introduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a
2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical
simulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive
voter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon
varying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented
state of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the
fragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial
quantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state
below the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards
fragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a
multiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,
before the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many
other dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar
behaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different

  In contrast to most existing proposals, our approach achieves scaling via
separation of concerns, i.e., better utilization of network resources, rather

introducing additional complexity. We present simulations on a proof-of-concept

However, due to the compounding uncertainty in long horizon video prediction

limitation of these approaches is the ability to plan over long horizons to
reach distant goals. To that end, we propose a framework for subgoal generation
and planning, hierarchical visual foresight (HVF), which generates subgoal
images conditioned on a goal image, and uses them for planning. The subgoal
images are directly optimized to decompose the task into easy to plan segments,
and as a result, we observe that the method naturally identifies semantically

for neutrinos from astrophysical transients on timescales ranging from a

propose a novel method for quantizing BERT models to ultra low precision. In

Hessian based mix-precision method to compress the model further. We
extensively test our proposed method on BERT downstream tasks of SST-2, MNLI,
CoNLL-03, and SQuAD. We can achieve comparable performance to baseline with at
most $2.3\%$ performance degradation, even with ultra-low precision
quantization down to 2 bits, corresponding up to $13\times$ compression of the

over decentralized networks, e.g. in the context of multi-agent learning and
federated learning. Due to the imminent need to alleviate the communication
burden, the investigation of communication-efficient distributed optimization
algorithms - particularly for empirical risk minimization - has flourished in
recent years. A large fraction of these algorithms have been developed for the
master/slave setting, relying on a central parameter server that can
communicate with all agents. This paper focuses on distributed optimization
over networks, or decentralized optimization, where each agent is only allowed
to aggregate information from its neighbors. By properly adjusting the global
gradient estimate via local averaging in conjunction with proper correction, we
develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method Network-DANE,
which generalizes DANE to the decentralized scenarios. Our key ideas can be
applied in a systematic manner to obtain decentralized versions of other
master/slave distributed algorithms. A notable development is
Network-SVRG/SARAH, which employs variance reduction to further accelerate
local computation. We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and
Network-SVRG for strongly convex losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic
losses, which shed light on the impacts of data homogeneity, network
connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence. We further
extend Network-DANE to composite optimization by allowing a nonsmooth penalty
term. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the appealing performance
of our algorithms over competitive baselines, in terms of both communication

of local communications and computations per iteration can substantially
improve the overall efficiency.

show the emergence of the spin-connection and curvature, in addition to

imposed by conformal symmetry, and describe applications to quantum chaos in
higher dimensional CFTs. The first approach consists of a reformulation of the
shadow operator formalism and kinematic space techniques. We observe that the
shadow operator associated with the stress tensor (or other conserved currents)
can be written as the descendant of a field ${\cal E}$ with negative dimension.
Computations of stress tensor contributions to conformal blocks can be
systematically organized in terms of the ""soft mode"" ${\cal E}$, turning them
into a simple diagrammatic perturbation theory at large central charge. Our
second (equivalent) approach concerns a theory of reparametrization modes,
generalizing previous studies in the context of the Schwarzian theory and
two-dimensional CFTs. Due to the conformal anomaly in even dimensions, gauge
modes of the conformal group acquire an action and are shown to exhibit the
same dynamics as the soft mode ${\cal E}$ that encodes the physics of the
stress tensor shadow. We discuss the calculation of the conformal partial waves
or the conformal blocks using our effective field theory. The separation of
conformal blocks from shadow blocks is related to gauging of certain symmetries
in our effective field theory of the soft mode. These connections explain and
generalize various relations between conformal blocks, shadow operators,
kinematic space, and reparametrization modes. As an application we study
thermal physics in higher dimensions and argue that the theory of
reparametrization modes captures the physics of quantum chaos in Rindler space.
This is also supported by the observation of the pole skipping phenomenon in
the conformal energy-energy two-point function on Rindler space.

of an isolated cold-atom Fermi-Hubbard system subject to an external linear
potential (a ""tilt""). The tilt is along one of the principal directions of the
two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and couples mass transport to local heating
through energy conservation. We study transport and thermalization in our
system by observing the decay of prepared initial density waves as a function
of wavelength $\lambda$ and tilt strength and find that the associated decay
time $\tau$ crosses over as the tilt strength is increased from
characteristically diffusive to subdiffusive with $\tau\propto\lambda^4$. In
order to explain the underlying physics we develop a hydrodynamic model that
exhibits this crossover. For strong tilts, the subdiffusive transport rate is
set by a thermal diffusivity, which we are thus able to measure as a function
of tilt in this regime. We further support our understanding by probing the
local inverse temperature of the system at strong tilts, finding good agreement
with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we discuss the relation of the
strongly tilted limit of our system to recently studied 1D models which may
exhibit nonergodic dynamics.

comets. The observed morphology is also unremarkable and best explained by dust
with a power-law size-distribution index of -3.7 +/- 1.8 and a low ejection

the solar gravitational attraction to the solar radiation pressure). The

(SMEFT) with flavor symmetry are of mass dimension 9. As a consequence, baryon-
and lepton-number violating processes are further suppressed with the
introduction of flavor symmetries, e.g., the allowed scale associated with
proton decay is typically lowered to $10^5$ GeV, which is significantly lower
than the GUT scale. To illustrate these features, we discuss Minimal Flavor

This paper evaluates the effects of different planar projections on
non-Gaussian statistics of weak lensing convergence maps. In particular we
investigate the effect of projection on peak counts and Minkowski Functionals
(MFs) derived from convergence maps and the suitability of a number of
projections at matching the peak counts and MFs obtained from a sphere. We find
that the peak counts derived from planar projections consistently overestimate
the counts at low SNR thresholds and underestimate at high SNR thresholds
across the projections evaluated, although the difference is reduced when
smoothing of the maps is increased. In the case of the Minkowski Functionals,
V0 is minimally affected by projection used, while projected V1 and V2 are
consistently overestimated with respect to the spherical case.

for task-oriented dialogue do not sufficiently capture these challenges since
they cover few domains and assume a single static ontology per domain. In this
work, we introduce the the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset, containing
over 16k multi-domain conversations spanning 16 domains. Our dataset exceeds
the existing task-oriented dialogue corpora in scale, while also highlighting
the challenges associated with building large-scale virtual assistants. It
provides a challenging testbed for a number of tasks including language
understanding, slot filling, dialogue state tracking and response generation.
Along the same lines, we present a schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented
dialogue, in which predictions are made over a dynamic set of intents and
slots, provided as input, using their natural language descriptions. This
allows a single dialogue system to easily support a large number of services
and facilitates simple integration of new services without requiring additional
training data. Building upon the proposed paradigm, we release a model for
dialogue state tracking capable of zero-shot generalization to new APIs, while
remaining competitive in the regular setting.

investigate how chirality affects the motion of topological defects, as well as
the collective motion in stripe-shaped domains. We find that chirality
introduces a characteristic asymmetry in the collective cellular flow, from
which the ratio between chiral and non-chiral active stresses can be inferred
by particle-image-velocimetry measurements. Furthermore, we find that chirality
changes the nature of the spontaneous flow transition under confinement and
that, for specific anchoring conditions, the latter has the structure of an
imperfect pitchfork bifurcation.

the strong gravity regime. We modeled broadband X-ray spectra from $Suzaku$ and
$NuSTAR$ with MYTORUS, self-consistently accounting for Fe K$\alpha$ line
emission, as well as direct and reflected continuum emission, from finite
column density matter. A narrow Fe K$\alpha$ emission line originating in an
X-ray reprocessor with solar Fe abundance far from the central SMBH is
sufficient to produce excellent fits for all spectra. For the first time, we
are able to measure the global, out of the line-of-sight column density to be
in the range $\sim$$1.5$ to $\sim$$2.9\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, i.e. in the
Compton thick regime, while the line-of-sight column density is Compton thin in
all observations. The Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is unresolved in all but one
observations. The Compton scattered continuum from distant matter removes the
need for relativistic broadening of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line, which is
required for SMBH spin measurements. The resolved line observation can
alternatively be modeled with a relativistic model but we do not find evidence
for a truncated accretion disk model. We conclude that the X-ray emission in
these 4C 74.26 data is unlikely to originate in the inner accretion disk region
and thus cannot be used to measure SMBH spin.

properties such as stellar mass, size and rotation velocity which agree well
with observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies. In particular, the
simulations reproduce the age-velocity dispersion relation and a
multi-component stellar disk as observed for the Milky Way. Half of our
galaxies show a double exponential vertical profile, while the others are well
described by a single exponential model which we link to the disk merger
history. In all cases, mono-age populations follow a single exponential whose
scale height varies monotonically with stellar age and radius. The scale length
decreases with stellar age while the scale height increases. The general
structure of the stellar disks is already set at time of birth as a result of
the inside-out and upside-down formation. Subsequent evolution modifies this
structure by increasing both the scale length and height of all mono-age
populations. Thus, our results put tight constraints on how much dynamical
memory stellar disks can retain over cosmological timescales. Our simulations
demonstrate that it is possible to form thin galactic disks in cosmological
simulations provided there are no significant stellar mergers at low redshifts.
Most of the stellar mass is formed in-situ with only a few percent
($\lesssim5\%$) brought in by merging satellites at early times. Redshift zero

encapsulates the protected corner charge modes and, for the HOTI, predicts an
anomalous edge with fractional dipole moment. In 3D we propose a dipolar
Chern-Simons theory with a quantized coefficient as a description of the
response of both second order HOTIs harboring chiral hinge currents, and of a

circumstellar medium (CSM); a high density material distributed only within a
small radius ($\lesssim 10^{15}$ cm with the mass-loss rate of 0.01 $\sim

acceleration and magnetic field amplification in the `confined' CSM,
synchrotron emission may be masked in centimeter wavelengths due to free-free
absorption; the millimeter range can however be a potential new window. We
investigate the time evolution of synchrotron radiation from the system of a
red super giant surrounded by the `confined' CSM, relevant to typical type II-P
SNe. We show that synchrotron millimeter emission is generally detectable, and
the signal can be used as a sensitive tracer of the nature of the `confined'
CSM; it traces different CSM density parameter space than in the optical.
Furthermore, our simulations show that the `confined' CSM efficiently produces
secondary electrons and positrons through proton inelastic collisions, which
can become main contributors to the synchrotron emission in several ten days
since the SN. We predict that the synchrotron emission is detectable by ALMA,

which appear at PN orders $x^{3k} \log^k(x)$ and $x^{3k+3/2} \log^k(x)$ for

logarithms, which appear at orders $x^{3k} \log^{k-1}(x)$ and $x^{3k+3/2}
\log^{k-1}(x)$ ($k\ge 1$), in both the energy and angular momentum radiated to
infinity. For the energy flux leading logarithms, we show that to arbitrarily
high PN order their eccentricity dependence is determined by particular sums
over the function $g(n,e_t)$, derived from the Newtonian mass quadrupole
moment, that normally gives the spectral content of the Peters-Mathews flux as
a function of radial harmonic $n$. An analogous power spectrum
$\tilde{g}(n,e_t)$ determines the leading logarithms of the angular momentum
flux. For subleading logs, the quadrupole power spectra are again shown to play
a role, providing a distinguishable part of the eccentricity dependence of
these flux terms to high PN order. With the quadrupole contribution understood,
the remaining analytic eccentricity dependence of the subleading logs can in
principle be determined more easily using black hole perturbation theory. We
show this procedure in action, deriving the complete analytic structure of the
$x^6 \log(x)$ subleading-log term and an analytic expansion of the $x^{9/2}$
subleading log to high order in a power series in eccentricity. We discuss how
these methods might be extended to other sequences of terms in the PN expansion

magnon equilibration length. This regime allows the use of a drift-diffusion
approach, which is opposed to the thin-film limit considered by Bender {\it et

and thickness-dependence of the structural spin Seebeck coefficient
$\mathcal{S}$ and magnon conductance $\mathcal{G}$. In their evaluation we
incorporate effects from field- and temperature-dependent spin conserving
inter-magnon scattering processes. Furthermore, the interfacial spin transport
is studied by evaluating the contact magnon conductances in a microscopic model
that accounts for the sub-lattice symmetry breaking at the interface. We find
that while inter-magnon scattering does slightly suppress the spin Seebeck
effect, transport is generally unaffected, with the relevant spin decay length
being determined by non-magnon-conserving processes such as Gilbert damping. In
addition, we find that while the structural spin conductance may be enhanced
near the spin flip transition, it does not diverge due to spin impedance at the
normal metal|magnet interfaces.

physics, since they are forbidden in the Standard Model while they may be
generated in new theories. The usual approach to these processes is to perform
the computations in the physical basis; nevertheless this may lose track of the
dependence on some of the fundamental parameters, in particular on those at the
origin of the flavor violation. Consequently, in order to obtain analytical
expressions directly in terms of these parameters, flavor techniques are often
preferred. In this work, we focus on the mass insertion approximation
technique, which works with the interaction states instead of the physical
ones, and provides diagrammatic expansions of the observables. After reviewing
the basics of this technique with two simple examples, we apply it to the
lepton flavor violating Higgs decays in the framework of a general type-I
seesaw model with an arbitrary number of right-handed neutrinos. We derive an
effective vertex valid to compute these observables when the right-handed
neutrino masses are above the electroweak scale and show that we recover
previous results obtained for low scale seesaws. Finally, we apply current
constraints on the model to conclude on maximum Higgs decay rates, which
unfortunately are far from current experimental sensitivities.

  Stars","Version to appear in Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics",,"10.1016/j.ppnp.2020.103791",,"nucl-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We construct a generalized EFT approach to dense compact-star matter that
exploits the CCP for hadron-quark continuity at high density, hidden topology
and hidden symmetries of QCD. No Landau-Ginzburg-Wilsonian-type phase
transition is involved. The microscopic DoF of QCD possibly intervening at high
baryonic density are traded in for fractionalized topological objects.
Essential in the description are symmetries invisible in QCD in the matter-free
vacuum: Scale symmetry, flavor local symmetry and parity-doubling. The partial
emergence of scale symmetry is signaled by a dilatonic scalar in a
""pseudo-conformal"" structure. Flavor gauge symmetry manifests with the $\rho$
meson mass going toward a Wilsonian RGFP identified with the VMFP at which the
gauge boson mass goes to zero. Parity doubling is to take place as the
quasi-nucleon mass converges to the chiral invariant $m_0$. The theory accounts
satisfactorily for all known properties of normal nuclear matter and makes
certain predictions that are drastically different from what's available in the
literature. In particular, it provides a topological mechanism, argued to be
robust, for the cross-over from soft-to-hard EoS that predicts the star
properties in overall agreement with the presently available data, including
the maximum star mass $M_{max}\sim 2.3 M_\odot$ and the recent LIGO/Virgo GW
data. What is most glaringly different from all other approaches known,
however, is the prediction for the rapid convergence to a sound velocity of
star $v_s^2\approx 1/3$ at a density $n\gsim 3 n_0$, far from the asymptotic
density $\gsim 50n_0$ expected in pQCD. We interpret this to signal the onset
of albeit approximate conformal symmetry in dense compact-star matter. The
model developed here could bring out a new paradigm in nuclear/hadron physics,
exploiting ideas in condensed matter physics, nuclear and particle physics and
astrophysics.

such as Twitter, Facebook and banking. As the scale and frequency of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increase, there is an urgent need
for determining the impact of the attack. Two central challenges of the task
are to get feedback from a large number of users and to get it in a timely
manner. In this paper, we present a weakly-supervised model that does not need
annotated data to measure the impact of DoS issues by applying Latent Dirichlet
Allocation and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence on tweets. There is a
limitation to the weakly-supervised module. It assumes that the event detected
in a time window is a DoS attack event. This will become less of a problem,
when more non-attack events twitter got collected and become less likely to be
identified as a new event. Another way to remove that limitation, an optional
classification layer, trained on manually annotated DoS attack tweets, to
filter out non-attack tweets can be used to increase precision at the expense
of recall. Experimental results show that we can learn weakly-supervised models
that can achieve comparable precision to supervised ones and can be generalized
across entities in the same industry.

two-stage and single-relay queueing communication scheme is investigated.
Concretely, a traffic-aware $N$-threshold and gated-service policy are applied
at the relay. As two fundamental and significant performance metrics, the mean
waiting time and long-term expected power consumption are explicitly derived
and related with the queueing and service parameters, such as packet arrival
rate, service threshold and channel statistics. Besides, we take into account
the electrical circuit energy consumptions when the relay server and access
point (AP) are in different modes and energy costs for mode transitions,
whereby the power consumption model is more practical. The expected power
minimization problem under the mean waiting time constraint is formulated.
Tight closed-form bounds are adopted to obtain tractable analytical formulae
with less computational complexity. The optimal energy-saving service threshold
that can flexibly adjust to packet arrival rate is determined. In addition,
numerical results reveal that: 1) sacrificing the mean waiting time not
necessarily facilitates power savings; 2) a higher arrival rate leads to a
greater optimal service threshold; and 3) our policy performs better than the
current state-of-the-art.

nonlocal dispersive optical model (DOM). By enforcing the dispersion relation
connecting the real and imaginary part of the self-energy, scattering and
structure data are used to constrain these self-energies. The ability to
calculate both bound and scattering states simultaneously puts these
self-energies in a unique position to consistently describe exclusive knockout
reactions such as $(e,e'p)$. The present analysis reveals the importance of
high-energy proton reaction cross-section data in constraining spectroscopic
factors required for the description of the $(e,e'p)$ cross sections. In
particular, it is imperative that high-energy proton reaction cross-section
data are measured for $^{48}$Ca in the near future so that the quenching of the
spectroscopic factors in the $^{48}$Ca$(e,e'p)^{47}$K reaction can be
unambiguously constrained using the DOM. Measurements of proton reaction cross
sections in inverse kinematics employing rare isotope beams with large neutron
excess will provide corresponding constraints on proton spectroscopic factors
for exotic nuclei. Moreover, DOM generated spectral functions indicate that the
quenching of spectroscopic factors compared to $^{40}$Ca is not only due to
long-range correlation, but also partly due to the increase in high-momentum
protons in $^{48}$Ca on account of the strong neutron-proton interaction.
Single-particle momentum distributions of protons and neutrons in $^{48}$Ca
calculated from these spectral functions confirm that neutron excess causes a
higher fraction of high-momentum protons than neutrons.

reward machines, i.e., a type of Mealy machine that encodes the reward
functions. We focus on a setting in which this knowledge is a priori not
available to the learning agent. We develop an iterative algorithm that
performs joint inference of reward machines and policies for RL (more
specifically, q-learning). In each iteration, the algorithm maintains a
hypothesis reward machine and a sample of RL episodes. It derives q-functions
from the current hypothesis reward machine, and performs RL to update the
q-functions. While performing RL, the algorithm updates the sample by adding RL
episodes along which the obtained rewards are inconsistent with the rewards
based on the current hypothesis reward machine. In the next iteration, the
algorithm infers a new hypothesis reward machine from the updated sample. Based
on an equivalence relationship we defined between states of reward machines, we
transfer the q-functions between the hypothesis reward machines in consecutive
iterations. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to an
optimal policy in the limit if a minimal reward machine can be inferred and the
maximal length of each RL episode is sufficiently long. The experiments show
that learning high-level knowledge in the form of reward machines can lead to
fast convergence to optimal policies in RL, while standard RL methods such as
q-learning and hierarchical RL methods fail to converge to optimal policies
after a substantial number of training steps in many tasks.

ridge is believed to arise from unresolved populations of X-ray binary systems.
However, the identity of the dominant class of accreting objects in each region
remains unclear. Recent studies of Fe line properties and the low-energy (<10
keV) X-ray continuum of the bulge indicate a major population fraction of
non-magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), in particular quiescent dwarf novae.
This is in contrast to previous high-energy (>10 keV) X-ray measurements of the
bulge and ridge, which indicate a dominant population of magnetic CVs, in
particular intermediate polars. In addition, NuSTAR broad-band measurements
have uncovered a much heavier intermediate polar population in the central ~100
pc than previously assumed, raising the possibility that some fraction of this
population extends further from the center. Here we use NuSTAR's large aperture
for unfocused photons and its broad-band X-ray range to probe the diffuse
continuum of the inner ~1-3$^\circ$ of the Galactic bulge. This allows us to
constrain possible multi-temperature components of the spectrum, such as could
indicate a mixture of soft and hard populations. Our emissivity is consistent
with previous hard X-ray measurements in the bulge and ridge, with the diffuse
X-ray luminosity tracing the stellar mass. The spectrum is well-described by a
single-temperature thermal plasma with $kT \approx 8$ keV, with no significant
emission above 20 keV. This supports that the bulge is dominated by quiescent
dwarf novae; we find no evidence of a significant intermediate polar population
in the hard X-ray band.

adversary causes predictable errors in a machine learning algorithm through
precise manipulation of the input. Numerous techniques have been proposed to
harden machine learning algorithms and mitigate the effect of adversarial
attacks. Of these techniques, adversarial training, which augments the training
data with adversarial samples, has proven to be an effective defense with
respect to a certain class of attacks. However, adversarial training is
computationally expensive and its improvements are limited to a single model.
In this work, we take a first step toward creating a model-agnostic adversarial
defense. We propose Adversarially-Trained Autoencoder Augmentation (AAA), the
first model-agnostic adversarial defense that is robust against certain
adaptive adversaries. We show that AAA allows us to achieve a partially
model-agnostic defense by training a single autoencoder to protect multiple
pre-trained classifiers; achieving adversarial performance on par or better
than adversarial training without modifying the classifiers. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that AAA can be used to create a fully model-agnostic defense for
MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets by improving the adversarial performance of a
never before seen pre-trained classifier by at least 45% with no additional
training. Finally, using a natural image corruption dataset, we show that our
approach improves robustness to naturally corrupted images,which has been
identified as strongly indicative of true adversarial robustness.

ecliptic hemisphere, into 95 $15^{\circ}\times15^{\circ}$ regions and estimate
the spectral index of polarized synchrotron emission within each region using a
simple but robust T-T plot technique. Three different versions of the S-PASS
data are considered, corresponding to: no correction for Faraday rotation;
Faraday correction based on the rotation measure model presented by the S-PASS
team; or Faraday correction based on a rotation measure model presented by
Hutschenreuter and En{\ss}lin. We find that the correlation between S-PASS and
WMAP is strongest when applying the S-PASS model. Adopting this correction
model, we find that the mean spectral index of polarized synchrotron emission
gradually steepens from $\beta_s\approx-2.8$ at low Galactic latitudes to
$\beta_s\approx-3.3$ at high Galactic latitudes, in good agreement with
previously published results. Finally, we consider two special cases defined by
the BICEP2 and SPIDER fields and obtain mean estimates of

exhibit transient growth even when all eigenvalues of the matrix have negative
real part, and similarly for the powers of the matrix when all eigenvalues have
magnitude less than 1. Established conditions for the existence of these
transient effects depend on properties of the entire matrix, such as the Kreiss
constant, and can be laborious to use in practice. In this work we develop a
relationship between the invariant subspaces of the matrix and the existence of
transient effects in the matrix exponential or matrix powers. Analytical
results are obtained for two-dimensional invariant subspaces and Jordan
subspaces, with the former causing transient effects when the angle between the
subspace's constituent eigenvectors is sufficiently small. In addition to
providing a finer-grained understanding of transient effects in terms of
specific invariant subspaces, this analysis also enables geometric
interpretations for the transient effects.

diarization method. Unlike most existing methods, our proposed method does not
have separate modules for extraction and clustering of speaker representations.
Instead, our model has a single neural network that directly outputs speaker
diarization results. To realize such a model, we formulate the speaker
diarization problem as a multi-label classification problem, and introduces a
permutation-free objective function to directly minimize diarization errors
without being suffered from the speaker-label permutation problem. Besides its
end-to-end simplicity, the proposed method also benefits from being able to
explicitly handle overlapping speech during training and inference. Because of
the benefit, our model can be easily trained/adapted with real-recorded
multi-speaker conversations just by feeding the corresponding multi-speaker
segment labels. We evaluated the proposed method on simulated speech mixtures.
The proposed method achieved diarization error rate of 12.28%, while a
conventional clustering-based system produced diarization error rate of 28.77%.
Furthermore, the domain adaptation with real-recorded speech provided 25.6%
relative improvement on the CALLHOME dataset. Our source code is available

investigated in robotics, since they are essential for using robots in
automated manufacturing. This paper deals with the design and optimized
synthesis of a special type of fixtures, which we call \emph{snapping
fixtures}. Given a polyhedral workpiece $P$ with $n$ vertices and of constant
genus, which we need to hold, a snapping fixture is a semi-rigid polyhedron
$G$, made of a palm and several fingers, such that when $P$ and $G$ are well
separated, we can push $P$ toward $G$, slightly bending the fingers of $G$ on
the way (exploiting its mild flexibility), and obtain a configuration, where
$G$ is back in its original shape and $P$ and $G$ are inseparable as rigid
bodies. We prove the minimal closure conditions under which such fixtures can
hold parts, using Helly's theorem. We then introduce an algorithm running in
$O(n^3)$ time that produces a snapping fixture, minimizing the number of
fingers and optimizing additional objectives, if a snapping fixture exists. We
also provide an efficient and robust implementation of a simpler version of the
algorithm, which produces the fixture model to be 3D printed and runs in
$O(n^4)$ time. We describe two applications with different optimization
criteria: Fixtures to hold add-ons for drones, where we aim to make the fixture
as lightweight as possible, and small-scale fixtures to hold precious stones in
jewelry, where we aim to maximize the exposure of the stones, namely minimize
the obscuring of the workpiece by the fixture.

survey for planets that transit bright stars. In addition, its excellent
photometric precision enables asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant
stars, which exhibit convection-driven, solar-like oscillations. Simulations
predict that TESS will detect solar-like oscillations in nearly 100 stars
already known to host planets. In this paper, we present an asteroseismic
analysis of the known red-giant host stars HD 212771 and HD 203949, both
systems having a long-period planet detected through radial velocities. These
are the first detections of oscillations in previously known exoplanet-host
stars by TESS, further showcasing the mission's potential to conduct
asteroseismology of red-giant stars. We estimate the fundamental properties of
both stars through a grid-based modeling approach that uses global
asteroseismic parameters as input. We discuss the evolutionary state of HD
203949 in depth and note the large discrepancy between its asteroseismic mass
($M_\ast = 1.23 \pm 0.15\,{\rm M}_\odot$ if on the red-giant branch or $M_\ast
= 1.00 \pm 0.16\,{\rm M}_\odot$ if in the clump) and the mass quoted in the
discovery paper ($M_\ast = 2.1 \pm 0.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$), implying a change
$>30\,\%$ in the planet's mass. Assuming HD 203949 to be in the clump, we
investigate the planet's past orbital evolution and discuss how it could have
avoided engulfment at the tip of the red-giant branch. Finally, HD 212771 was
observed by K2 during its Campaign 3, thus allowing for a preliminary
comparison of the asteroseismic performances of TESS and K2. We estimate the
ratio of the observed oscillation amplitudes for this star to be $A_{\rm
max}^{\rm TESS}/A_{\rm max}^{\rm K2} = 0.75 \pm 0.14$, consistent with the
expected ratio of $\sim0.85$ due to the redder bandpass of TESS.

Here we study a Fermi gas in a 2D optical lattice within a linear cavity with a
tilt along the cavity axis. The hopping along the cavity axis is only induced
by resonant Raman scattering of transverse pump light into a standing wave
cavity mode. Choosing a suitable pump geometry allows to realize the
Hofstadter-Harper model with a cavity-induced dynamical synthetic magnetic
field, which appears at the onset of the superradiant phase transition. The
dynamical nature of this cavity-induced synthetic magnetic field arises from
the delicate interplay between collective superradiant scattering and the
underlying fractal band structure. Using a sixth-order expansion of the free
energy as function of the order parameter and by numerical simulations we show
that at low magnetic fluxes the superradiant ordering phase transition is first
order, while it becomes second order for higher flux. The dynamic nature of the
magnetic field induces a non-trivial deformation of the Hofstadter butterfly in
the superradiant phase. At strong pump far above the self-ordering threshold we
recover the Hofstadter butterfly one would obtain in a static magnetic field.

that the resulting embedding vectors are useful for prediction tasks related to

temporal networks. In particular, we illustrate the performance of our approach
for the prediction of nodes' epidemic states in a single instance of a

threatens data security, particularly in web applications where compression is
indispensable for performance reasons. Current approaches to mitigating
compression side channels have drawbacks in that they either degrade
compression ratio drastically or require too much effort from developers to be
widely adopted. To bridge the gap, we develop Debreach, a static analysis and
program transformation based approach to mitigating compression side channels.
Debreach consists of two steps. First, it uses taint analysis to soundly
identify flows of sensitive data in the program and uses code instrumentation
to annotate data before feeding them to the compressor. Second, it enhances the
compressor to exploit the freedom to not compress of standard compression
protocols, thus removing the dependency between sensitive data and the size of
the compressor's output. Since Debreach automatically instruments applications
and does not change the compression protocols, it has the advantage of being
non-disruptive and compatible with existing systems. We have evaluated Debreach
on a set of web server applications written in PHP. Our experiments show that,
while ensuring leakage-freedom, Debreach can achieve significantly higher
compression performance than state-of-the-art approaches.

fractionations. Energy balance at the surface of a body accreted within ~1 Myr
of CAI formation and heated from within by 26Al decay results in internal
temperatures exceeding the silicate solidus, producing a transient magma ocean
with a thin surface boundary layer of order < 1 meter that would be subject to
foundering. Bodies that are massive enough to form magma oceans by radioisotope
decay (ge 0.1%) can retain hot rock vapor even in the absence of ambient
nebular gas. We find that a steady-state rock vapor forms within minutes to
hours and results from a balance between rates of magma evaporation and
atmospheric escape. Vapor pressure buildup adjacent to the surfaces of the
evaporating magmas would have inevitably led to an approach to equilibrium
isotope partitioning between the vapor phase and the silicate melt. Numerical
simulations of this near-equilibrium evaporation process for a body with a
radius of ~ 700 km yield a steady-state far-field vapor pressure corresponding
to 95% saturation. Approaches to equilibrium isotope fractionation between
vapor and melt should have been the norm during planet formation due to the
formation of steady-state rock vapor atmospheres and/or the presence of
protostellar gas. We model the Si and Mg isotopic composition of bulk Earth and

theoretical threshold for high-mass star formation of $\gtrsim$ 1 g cm$^{-2}$,
only toward the regions which contain current high-mass star-forming sites. For
other areas, further mass accretion or dynamical compression would be necessary
for future high-mass star formation. This is consistent with the current star
formation activity. Using the $^{12}$CO data, we demonstrate that our data have
enough capability to identify molecular outflows, and for Aquila Rift, we
identify 4 new outflow candidates. The scientific results will be discussed in

[Ambainis, CCC 2014] showed that the related, but arguably more natural,
problem of simulating local measurements on ground states of local Hamiltonians
(APX-SIM) is likely harder than QMA. Indeed, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] showed that
APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete, for P^QMA[log] the class of languages decidable
by a P machine making a logarithmic number of adaptive queries to a QMA oracle.
In this work, we show that APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete even when restricted
to more physical Hamiltonians, obtaining as intermediate steps a variety of
related complexity-theoretic results.
  We first give a sequence of results which together yield P^QMA[log]-hardness
for APX-SIM on well-motivated Hamiltonians: (1) We show that for NP, StoqMA,
and QMA oracles, a logarithmic number of adaptive queries is equivalent to
polynomially many parallel queries. These equalities simplify the proofs of our
subsequent results. (2) Next, we show that the hardness of APX-SIM is preserved
under Hamiltonian simulations (a la [Cubitt, Montanaro, Piddock, 2017]). As a
byproduct, we obtain a full complexity classification of APX-SIM, showing it is
complete for P, P^||NP, P^||StoqMA, or P^||QMA depending on the Hamiltonians
employed. (3) Leveraging the above, we show that APX-SIM is P^QMA[log]-complete
for any family of Hamiltonians which can efficiently simulate spatially sparse
Hamiltonians, including physically motivated models such as the 2D Heisenberg
model.
  Our second focus considers 1D systems: We show that APX-SIM remains
P^QMA[log]-complete even for local Hamiltonians on a 1D line of 8-dimensional

with slow states subject to demand forecast uncertainty. The H-MPC has two
layers: (i) the scheduling MPC at the upper layer with a relatively long
prediction/planning horizon and slow update rate, and (ii) the piloting MPC at
the lower layer over a shorter prediction horizon with a faster update rate.
The scheduling layer MPC calculates the optimal slow states, which will be
tracked by the piloting MPC, while enforcing the system constraints according
to a long-range and approximate prediction of the future demand/load, e.g.,
traction power demand for driving a vehicle. In this paper, to enhance the
H-MPC robustness against the long-term demand forecast uncertainty, we propose
to use the high-quality preview information enabled by the connectivity
technology over the short horizon to modify the planned trajectories via a
constraint tightening approach at the scheduling layer. Simulation results are
presented for a simplified vehicle model to confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed robust H-MPC framework in handling demand forecast uncertainty.

based on the semantic descriptions of the classes. Existing algorithms usually
formulate it as a semantic-visual correspondence problem, by learning mappings
from one feature space to the other. Despite being reasonable, previous
approaches essentially discard the highly precious discriminative power of
visual features in an implicit way, and thus produce undesirable results. We
instead reformulate ZSL as a conditioned visual classification problem, i.e.,
classifying visual features based on the classifiers learned from the semantic
descriptions. With this reformulation, we develop algorithms targeting various
ZSL settings: For the conventional setting, we propose to train a deep neural
network that directly generates visual feature classifiers from the semantic
attributes with an episode-based training scheme; For the generalized setting,
we concatenate the learned highly discriminative classifiers for seen classes
and the generated classifiers for unseen classes to classify visual features of
all classes; For the transductive setting, we exploit unlabeled data to
effectively calibrate the classifier generator using a novel
learning-without-forgetting self-training mechanism and guide the process by a
robust generalized cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments show that our
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by large

single source or many sources incoherently, recent studies demonstrate an
ability of resonant nanostructures to cause the synchronization of quantum
source spontaneous emission, i.e., Dicke superradiance effect. What remains
poorly explored is how the coherent excitation can affect antenna performance:
its multipole composition, directivity, efficiency, and Purcell effect. In this
paper, we investigate an antenna excited by two coherent sources and
demonstrate that this approach can boost antenna performance. To make the
discussion independent of the frequency range, we restrict the consideration by
all-dielectric antennas, which attract significant interest in both microwaves
and optics. We explore that coherent excitation of a dielectric antenna by two

superradiance and enhanced directivity. Interestingly, it makes possible
excitation of nonradiative field configuration, anapole state, and turning it

the investigations of relativistic many-body methods, the new versions of
charge-dependent Bonn (CD-Bonn) $NN$ potential are constructed within the
pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling instead of the pseudoscalar type in the
original CD-Bonn potential worked out by Machleidt [Phys. Rev. C 63, 024001
(2001)]. Two effective scalar mesons are introduced, whose coupling constants
with nucleon are independently determined at each partial wave for total
angular momentum $J\leq 4$, to describe the charge dependence of $NN$
scattering data precisely, while the coupling constants between vector,
pseudovector mesons and nucleon are identical in all channels. Three revised
CD-Bonn potentials adopting the pseudovector pion-nucleon couplings (pvCD-Bonn)
are generated by fitting the Nijmegen PWA phase shift data and deuteron binding
energy with different pion-nucleon coupling strengths, which can reproduce the
phase shifts at spin-single channels and low-energy $NN$ scattering parameters
very well, and provide the significantly different mixing parameters at
spin-triplet channels. Furthermore, the $D$-state probabilities of deuteron
from these potentials range from $4.22\%$ to $6.05\%$. It demonstrates that
these potentials contain different components of tensor force, which will be
useful to discuss the roles of tensor force in nuclear few-body and many-body
systems.

Monolayer MoS2 channels were directly grown on SiO2/Si substrate via chemical
vapor deposition technique. The increase in current with back gate voltage
shows the tunability of FET characteristics. The Schottky barrier height (SBH)
estimated for Py/MoS2 contacts is found to be +28.8 meV (zero-bias), which is
the smallest value reported so-far for any direct metal (magnetic or

V), SBH shows a drastic reduction down to a value of -6.8 meV. The negative SBH
reveals ohmic behavior of Py/MoS2 contacts. Low SBH with controlled ohmic
nature of FM contacts is a primary requirement for MoS2 based spintronics and
therefore using directly grown MoS2 channels in the present study can pave a
path towards high performance devices for large scale applications.

visual differences between vehicles. Besides the holistic appearance of
vehicles which is easily affected by the viewpoint variation and distortion,
vehicle parts also provide crucial cues to differentiate near-identical
vehicles. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a Part-Guided Attention
Network (PGAN) to pinpoint the prominent part regions and effectively combine
the global and part information for discriminative feature learning. PGAN first
detects the locations of different part components and salient regions
regardless of the vehicle identity, which serve as the bottom-up attention to
narrow down the possible searching regions. To estimate the importance of
detected parts, we propose a Part Attention Module (PAM) to adaptively locate
the most discriminative regions with high-attention weights and suppress the
distraction of irrelevant parts with relatively low weights. The PAM is guided
by the instance retrieval loss and therefore provides top-down attention that
enables attention to be calculated at the level of car parts and other salient
regions. Finally, we aggregate the global appearance and part features to
improve the feature performance further. The PGAN combines part-guided
bottom-up and top-down attention, global and part visual features in an
end-to-end framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves new state-of-the-art vehicle instance retrieval performance on
four large-scale benchmark datasets.

applications, such as nanoscale actuators and energy storage medium. This work
reports for the first-time super-elastic tensile characteristics of NFs
constructed from a screw dislocation of carbon nanocones (NF-S). The NF-S
exhibits three distinct elastic deformation stages under tensile, including an
initial homogeneous deformation, delamination, and further stretch of covalent
bonds. The delamination process endows the NF-S extraordinary tensile
deformation capability, which is not accessible from its counterpart with a
normal cup-stacked geometry. The failure of NF-S is governed by the inner edges
of the nanocone due to the strain concentration, leading to a common failure
force for NF-S with varying geometrical parameters. Strikingly, the
delamination process is dominated by the inner radius and the apex angle of the
nanocone. For a fixed apex angle, the yielding strain increases remarkably when
the inner radius increases, which can exceed 1000%. It is also found that the
screw dislocation allows the nanocones flattening and sliding during
compression. This study provides a comprehensive understanding on the
mechanical properties of NFs as constructed from carbon nanocones, which opens
new avenues for novel applications, such as nanoscale actuators.

model-free superhedging, given marginal distributions of the underlying asset.
Contrary to prior studies, we do not require contingent claims to be upper
semicontinuous, allowing for upper semi-analytic ones. The generalized duality
stipulates an extended version of risk-neutral pricing. To compute the
model-free superhedging price, one needs to find the supremum of expected
values of a contingent claim, evaluated not directly under martingale
(risk-neutral) measures, but along sequences of measures that converge, in an
appropriate sense, to martingale ones. To derive the main result, we first
establish a portfolio-constrained duality for upper semi-analytic contingent
claims, relying on Choquet's capacitability theorem. As we gradually fade out

we use an evolutionary computation approach in the form of a differential

light curves were obtained in the years 1971 and 2018, independently.
Photometric analyses reveal that the two sets of light curves produce almost
consistent results. It contains a W-subtype totally eclipsing binary, and its
mass ratio and fill-out factor are $q = 3.35(1)$ and $f = 29(2)\,\%$. The
absolute elements of its two component stars were determined to be $M_{1} =
0.39(2)M_\odot$, $M_{2} = 1.31(7)M_\odot$, $R_{1} = 0.77(1)R_\odot$, $R_{2} =
1.30(2)R_\odot$, $L_{1} = 0.75(3)L_\odot$ and $L_{2} = 2.00(7)L_\odot$. The
period of V752 Cen is 0.37023198 day. The 0.37-d period remained constant from
its first measurement in 1971 until the year 2000. However, it changed suddenly
around the year 2000 and has been increasing continuously at a rate of
$dP/dt=+5.05\times{10^{-7}}day\cdot year^{-1}$ since then, which can be
explained by mass transfer from the less massive component star to the more
massive one with a rate of $\frac{dM_{2}}{dt}=2.52\times{10^{-7}}M_\odot/year$.
The period variation of V752 Cen over the 48 years in which the period has been
monitored is really unusual, and is potentially related to effects from the
possible presence of a nearby third star or of a pair of stars in a second
binary.

A major advancement in ER methodology has been the application of Bayesian
generative models, which provide a natural framework for inferring latent
entities with rigorous quantification of uncertainty. Despite these advantages,
existing models are severely limited in practice, as standard inference
algorithms scale quadratically in the number of records. While scaling can be
managed by fitting the model on separate blocks of the data, such a na\""ive

propose a principled model for scalable Bayesian ER, called ""distributed

compromising posterior correctness. Our approach relies on several key ideas,
including: (i) an auxiliary variable representation that induces a partition of
the entities and records into blocks; (ii) a method for constructing
well-balanced blocks based on k-d trees; (iii) a distributed
partially-collapsed Gibbs sampler with improved mixing; and (iv) fast
algorithms for performing Gibbs updates. Empirical studies on six data

scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

deep learning (DL) models are trained for providing various AI-driven services.
Efficient resource scheduling is essential for maximal utilization of expensive
DL clusters. Existing cluster schedulers either are agnostic to ML workload
characteristics, or use scheduling heuristics based on operators' understanding
of particular ML framework and workload, which are less efficient or not
general enough. In this paper, we show that DL techniques can be adopted to
design a generic and efficient scheduler. DL2 is a DL-driven scheduler for DL
clusters, targeting global training job expedition by dynamically resizing
resources allocated to jobs. DL2 advocates a joint supervised learning and
reinforcement learning approach: a neural network is warmed up via offline
supervised learning based on job traces produced by the existing cluster
scheduler; then the neural network is plugged into the live DL cluster,
fine-tuned by reinforcement learning carried out throughout the training
progress of the DL jobs, and used for deciding job resource allocation in an
online fashion. By applying past decisions made by the existing cluster
scheduler in the preparatory supervised learning phase, our approach enables a
smooth transition from existing scheduler, and renders a high-quality scheduler
in minimizing average training completion time. We implement DL2 on Kubernetes
and enable dynamic resource scaling in DL jobs on MXNet. Extensive evaluation
shows that DL2 outperforms fairness scheduler (i.e., DRF) by 44.1% and expert
heuristic scheduler (i.e., Optimus) by 17.5% in terms of average job completion

model fluid dynamics. However, mechanisms of CNNs for learning fluid dynamics
are still not well understood, while such understanding is highly necessary to
optimize the network or to reduce trial-and-errors during the network
optmization. In the present study, a CNN to predict future three-dimensional
unsteady wake flow using flow fields in the past occasions is developed.
Mechanisms of the developed CNN for prediction of wake flow behind a circular
cylinder are investigated in two flow regimes: the three-dimensional wake
transition regime and the shear-layer transition regime. Feature maps in the
CNN are visualized to compare flow structures which are extracted by the CNN
from flow at the two flow regimes. In both flow regimes, feature maps are found
to extract similar sets of flow structures such as braid shear-layers and
shedding vortices. A Fourier analysis is conducted to investigate mechanisms of
the CNN for predicting wake flow in flow regimes with different wave number
characteristics. It is found that a convolution layer in the CNN integrates and
transports wave number information from flow to predict the dynamics.
Characteristics of the CNN for transporting input information including time
histories of flow variables is analyzed by assessing contributions of each flow
variable and time history to feature maps in the CNN. Structural similarities
between feature maps in the CNN are calculated to reveal the number of feature
maps that contain similar flow structures. By reducing the number of feature
maps that contain similar flow structures, it is also able to successfully
reduce the number of parameters to learn in the CNN by 85\% without affecting
prediction performances.

present BPnP, a novel network module that backpropagates gradients through a
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) solver to guide parameter updates of a neural

the optimizer block were a differentiable function. We validate BPnP by
incorporating it in a deep model that can learn camera intrinsics, camera
extrinsics (poses) and 3D structure from training datasets. Further, we develop
an end-to-end trainable pipeline for object pose estimation, which achieves
greater accuracy by combining feature-based heatmap losses with 2D-3D

verified against the exact solution of the linear LCM, was found to be adequate
provided the mean separation between emitters is larger than half the emitter
height. In this paper, we subject the analytical predictions to a more
stringent test by simulating (i) an infinite regular array and (ii) an isolated
cluster of 10 random emitters, using the finite element software COMSOL. In
case of the array, the error in apex field enhancement factor (AFEF) is found
to be less than $0.25\%$ for an infinite array when the lattice constant $c
\geq 1.5h$, increasing to $2.9\%$ for $c = h$ and $8.1\%$ for $c = 0.75h$. For
an isolated random cluster of 10 emitters, the error in large AFEF values is
found to be small. Thus, the error in net emitted current is small for a random
cluster compared to a regular infinite array with the same (mean) spacing. The
line charge model thus provides a reasonable analytical tool for optimizing a

superfluid response at finite hopping. From the polarization amplitude we
derive the variance and the associated size scaling exponent. Again, the
variational study does not produce a finite superfluid weight at integer
filling (size scaling exponent is near one), but the Fourier transform of the
polarization amplitude behaves in a similar way to the result of exact
diagonalization, with a peak at small hopping, and suddenly decreasing at the
insulator-superfluid transition. On the other hand, exact diagonalization
studies result in a finite spread of the total position which increases with
the size of the system. In the superfluid phase the size scaling exponent is
two as expected. Importantly, our work addresses the ambiguities that arise in

of processing and the management of heterogeneous infrastructure over a dynamic
range of scales: from the edge to the cloud and HPC, and intermediate
resources. Serverless is an emerging service that combines high-level
middleware services, such as distributed execution engines for managing tasks,
with low-level infrastructure. It offers the potential of usability and
scalability, but adds to the complexity of managing heterogeneous and dynamic
resources. In response, we extend Pilot-Streaming to support serverless
platforms. Pilot-Streaming provides a unified abstraction for resource
management for HPC, cloud, and serverless, and allocates resource containers
independent of the application workload removing the need to write
resource-specific code. Understanding of the performance and scaling
characteristics of streaming applications and infrastructure presents another
challenge for EILC. StreamInsight provides insight into the performance of
streaming applications and infrastructure, their selection, configuration and
scaling behavior. Underlying StreamInsight is the universal scalability law,
which permits the accurate quantification of scalability properties of
streaming applications. Using experiments on HPC and AWS Lambda, we demonstrate
that StreamInsight provides an accurate model for a variety of application

one of the agents (attacker) is deciding which of two targets to attack, one
with a known reward and another with uncertain reward. The attacker receives a
single private sample from the uncertain target's distribution and updates its
belief of the target quality. The other agent (defender) knows the true
rewards, but does not see the sample that the attacker has received. This leads
to agents possessing asymmetric information: the attacker is uncertain over the
parameter of the distribution, whereas the defender is uncertain about the
observed sample. After the attacker updates its belief, both the attacker and
the defender play a simultaneous move game based on their respective beliefs.
We offer a characterization of the pure strategy equilibria of the game and

hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We present an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, named auto-GMM, based on Gaussian mixture models, to
isolate intrinsic structures in simulated galaxies based on their kinematic
phase space. For each galaxy, the number of Gaussian components allowed by the

our method by applying it to prototype galaxies selected from the cosmological
simulation IllustrisTNG. Our method can effectively decompose most galactic
structures. The intrinsic structures of simulated galaxies can be inferred
statistically by non-human supervised identification of galaxy structures. We
successfully identify four kinds of intrinsic structures: cold disks, warm

complex kinematics of particles moving on bar orbits.

exhibits the chiral edge states in the absence of magnetic field. While the
search for quantum anomalous Hall insulators is still active, the researchers
mainly search for the systems containing magnetic atom. Here, based on
first-principles density functional theory, we predict a new family of chern
insulators with fully spin-polarized quadratic px;y non-Dirac bands in the
alkali earth metal BaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) system. We show that BaX monolayer has
a half-metallic ferromagnetic ground state. The ferromagnetism is mainly
originated from the p orbitals of Si, Ge and Sn atoms. The 2D BaSn monolayer
exhibits a large magnetocrystalline anisotropic energy of 12.20 meV/cell and a
nontrivial band gap of 159.10 meV. Interestingly, both the spin polarization of
the chiral edge currents and the sign of Chern number can be tuned by doping.
Furthermore, the 4 % compressive strain can drive structural phase transition
but the nontrivial topological properties remain reserve in the 2D BaX systems.
Our findings not only extend the novel concepts but also provide fascinating
opportunities for the realization of quantum anomalous Hall effect
experimentally.

not all networks are the same, and in fact, for many that have additional
complexities to their structure, traditional general network analysis methods
are no longer applicable. For example, signed networks contain both positive
and negative links, and thus dedicated theories and algorithms have been
developed. However, previous work mainly focuses on the unipartite setting
where signed links connect any pair of nodes. Signed bipartite networks on the
one hand, are commonly found, but have primarily been overlooked. Their
complexities of having two node types where signed links can only form across
the two sets introduce challenges that prevent most existing literature on
unipartite signed and unsigned bipartite networks from being applied. On the
other hand, balance theory, a key signed social theory, has been generally
defined for cycles of any length and is being used in the form of triangles for
numerous unipartite signed network tasks. However, in bipartite networks there
are no triangles and furthermore there exist two types of nodes. Therefore, in
this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis and validation of
balance theory using the smallest cycle in signed bipartite networks - signed
butterflies (i.e., cycles of length 4 containing the two node types). Then, to
investigate the applicability of balance theory aiding signed bipartite network
tasks, we develop multiple sign prediction methods that utilize balance theory
in the form of signed butterflies. Our sign prediction experiment on three
real-world signed bipartite networks demonstrates the effectiveness of using
these signed butterflies for not only sign prediction, but paves the way for
improvements in other signed bipartite network analysis tasks.

mineral phases and composition, even when extracted from the same rock mass.
The spatial variability in compositional and structural features prevent
reproducible measurements of deformation, fracture formation and other physical
and chemical properties. Here, we use geo-architected 3D printed synthetic
gypsum rock to show that mineral texture orientation governs the isotropy or
anisotropy in fracture surface roughness and volumetric flow rate through
tensile fractures. Failure load is governed by the orientation of depositional
layering relative to loading direction but this effect can be hidden when an
orientated mineral texture is present within the layers. We find that samples
with certain mineral orientations are twice as strong as the weakest samples
and that high values of sample strength correlate with rougher fracture
surfaces. Mineral texture oriented parallel to the failure plane gives rise to
anisotropic surface roughness and in turn to anisotropic flow rates. The
uniqueness of induced fracture roughness and the degree of anisotropy is a
potential method for assessment of the orientation and relative bonding
strengths of minerals in a rock. With this information, we will be able to
predict isotropic or anisotropic flow rates through fractures which is vital to
induced fracturing, geothermal energy production and CO2 sequestration.

it can be concluded that users without experience can generate high-quality

between 66-81\% of the quality of a state-of-the-art automated algorithm on

in the performance of users, which is a result of some typical user behaviors.

device for the spin XOR gate consists of three iron (Fe)/cobalt (Co)/magnesium
oxide (MgO) electrodes, i.e., two input and one output electrodes. Spins are
injected into the Si channel from the input electrodes whose spin angular
momentum corresponds to the binary input 1 or 0. The spin drift effect is
controlled by a lateral electric field in the Si channel to adjust the spin
accumulation voltages under two different parallel configurations,
corresponding to (1, 1) and (0, 0), so that they exhibit the same value. As a
result, the spin accumulation voltage detected by the output electrode exhibits
three different voltages, represented by an XOR gate. The one-dimensional spin
drift-diffusion model clearly explains the obtained XOR behavior. Charge
current detection of the spin XOR gate is also demonstrated. The detected

core-collapse supernova. LBVs are characterized by photometric and
spectroscopic variability, produced by strong and dense winds, mass-loss events
and very intense UV radiation. LBVs strongly disturb their surroundings by
heating and shocking, and produce important amounts of dust. The study of the
circumstellar material is therefore crucial to understand how these massive
stars evolve, and also to characterize their effects onto the interstellar
medium. The versatility of NIKA2 is a key in providing simultaneous
observations of both the stellar continuum and the extended, circumstellar
contribution. The NIKA2 frequencies (150 and 260 GHz) are in the range where
thermal dust and free-free emission compete, and hence NIKA2 has the capacity
to provide key information about the spatial distribution of circumstellar
ionized gas, warm dust and nearby dark clouds; non-thermal emission is also
possible even at these high frequencies. We show the results of the first NIKA2
survey towards five LBVs. We detected emission from four stars, three of them
immersed in tenuous circumstellar material. The spectral indices show a complex
distribution and allowed us to separate and characterize different components.
We also found nearby dark clouds, with spectral indices typical of thermal
emission from dust. Spectral indices of the detected stars are negative and
hard to be explained only by free-free processes. In one of the sources,
G79.29+0.46, we also found a strong correlation of the 1mm and 2mm continuum
emission with respect to nested molecular shells at 0.1 pc from the LBV. The
spectral index in this region clearly separates four components: the LBV star,

human biases, most notably gender and racial biases, and models for attenuating
such biases have consequently been proposed. However, existing models and
studies (1) operate on under-specified and mutually differing bias definitions,
(2) are tailored for a particular bias (e.g., gender bias) and (3) have been
evaluated inconsistently and non-rigorously. In this work, we introduce a
general framework for debiasing word embeddings. We operationalize the
definition of a bias by discerning two types of bias specification: explicit
and implicit. We then propose three debiasing models that operate on explicit
or implicit bias specifications and that can be composed towards more robust
debiasing. Finally, we devise a full-fledged evaluation framework in which we
couple existing bias metrics with newly proposed ones. Experimental findings
across three embedding methods suggest that the proposed debiasing models are
robust and widely applicable: they often completely remove the bias both
implicitly and explicitly without degradation of semantic information encoded
in any of the input distributional spaces. Moreover, we successfully transfer
debiasing models, by means of cross-lingual embedding spaces, and remove or
attenuate biases in distributional word vector spaces of languages that lack
readily available bias specifications.

quadrupole-octopole alignment in the CMB is studied in this work. First, a
generalization of the dipolar modulation model is proposed by considering that
the amplitude may depend on the scale. As derived from a Bayesian inference
analysis, this model fits the CMB data better than the scale-independent one.
As an extension of the standard model, the scale-dependent dipolar modulation
shows comparable evidence to the standard isotropic model in the large scales
($\ell_\mathrm{max} \leq 64$). The posterior distribution of the parameters of
the scale-dependent model suggests that the amplitude of the dipolar modulation
is large at the lowest multipoles. This large asymmetry induces a detectable
correlation between the quadrupole and the octopole. The significance of the
quadrupole-octopole alignment is analyzed under the assumption that the
Universe has a scale-dependent dipolar modulation. The three alignment
estimators considered in this paper show an increment of $80\%$ in the p-value,
showing a clear correlation between these two CMB anomalies. Within this new
scenario, only one of the alignment estimators is still below the $1\%$

required for example for evaluating asymptotic precisions of parameter
estimates, for computing test statistics or asymptotic distributions in
statistical testing, for evaluating post model selection inference results or
optimality criteria in experimental designs. However its exact computation is
often not trivial. In particular in many latent variable models, it is
intricated due to the presence of unobserved variables. Therefore the observed
FIM is usually considered in this context to estimate the FIM. Several methods
have been proposed to approximate the observed FIM when it can not be evaluated
analytically. Among the most frequently used approaches are Monte-Carlo methods
or iterative algorithms derived from the missing information principle. All
these methods require to compute second derivatives of the complete data
log-likelihood which leads to some disadvantages from a computational point of
view. In this paper, we present a new approach to estimate the FIM in latent
variable model. The advantage of our method is that only the first derivatives
of the log-likelihood is needed, contrary to other approaches based on the
observed FIM. Indeed we consider the empirical estimate of the covariance
matrix of the score. We prove that this estimate of the Fisher information
matrix is unbiased, consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Moreover we
highlight that none of both estimates is better than the other in terms of
asymptotic covariance matrix. When the proposed estimate can not be directly
analytically evaluated, we present a stochastic approximation estimation
algorithm to compute it. This algorithm provides this estimate of the FIM as a
by-product of the parameter estimates. We emphasize that the proposed algorithm
only requires to compute the first derivatives of the complete data
log-likelihood with respect to the parameters. We prove that the estimation
algorithm is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian when the number of
iterations goes to infinity. We evaluate the finite sample size properties of
the proposed estimate and of the observed FIM through simulation studies in
linear mixed effects models and mixture models. We also investigate the
convergence properties of the estimation algorithm in non linear mixed effects
models. We compare the performances of the proposed algorithm to those of other

self-force, whose conservative piece shifts the critical value of the angular
momentum and the frequency of the asymptotic circular orbit away from their

Reject inference comprises techniques to overcome sampling bias through

the adjusted self-learning framework over regular self-learning and previous
reject inference strategies. We also find strong evidence in favor of the
proposed evaluation measure assessing reject inference strategies more

is possible by thermal release. Photon stimulated desorption of adsorbed Na on
solid surfaces has been commonly used to explain observations at high
altitudes. We investigate three model velocity distribution functions (VDF)
that have been previously used in several studies to describe the desorption of
atoms from a solid surface either by electron or by photon bombardment, namely:
the Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) distribution, the empirical distribution proposed
by [Wurz et al., 2010] for PSD, and the Weibull distribution. We use all
available measurements reported by [Yakshinskiy and Madey, 2000, 2004] to test
these distributions and determine which one fits best (statistically) and we
discuss their physical validity. Our results show that the measured VDF of
released Na atoms are too narrow compared to Maxwell-Boltzmann fits with
supra-temperatures as suggested by [3]. We found that a good fit with M-B is
only achieved with a speed offset of the whole distribution to higher speeds
and a lower temperature, with the offset and the fit temperature not showing
any correlation with the surface temperature. From the three distributions we
studied, we find that the Weibull distribution provides the best fits using the
temperature of the surface, though an offset towards higher speeds is required.
This work confirms that Electron-Stimulated Desorption (ESD) and
Photon-Stimulated Desorption (PSD) should produce non-thermal velocity (or
energy) distributions of the atoms released via these processes, which is
expected from surface physics. We recommend to use the Weibull distribution
with the shape parameter kappa=1.7, the speed offset v0=575 m/s, and the
surface temperature to model PSD distributions at planetary bodies.

continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and Markov decision processes (CTMDPs)
for specifications in continuous stochastic logics. It can be computed by
numerically solving a characteristic linear dynamical system but the procedure
is computationally expensive. We take a control-theoretic approach and propose
a reduction technique that finds another dynamical system of lower dimension
(number of variables), such that numerically solving the reduced dynamical
system provides an approximation to the solution of the original system with
guaranteed error bounds. Our technique generalises lumpability (or
probabilistic bisimulation) to a quantitative setting. Our main result is a
Lyapunov function characterisation of the difference in the trajectories of the
two dynamics that depends on the initial mismatch and exponentially decreases
over time. In particular, the Lyapunov function enables us to compute an error
bound between the two dynamics as well as a convergence rate. Finally, we show
that the search for the reduced dynamics can be computed in polynomial time
using a Schur decomposition of the transition matrix. This enables us to
efficiently solve the reduced dynamical system by computing the exponential of
an upper-triangular matrix characterising the reduced dynamics. For CTMDPs, we
generalise our approach using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions for
switched affine dynamical systems. We synthesise a policy for the CTMDP via its
reduced-order switched system that guarantees the time bounded reachability
probability lies above a threshold. We provide error bounds that depend on the
minimum dwell time of the policy. We demonstrate the technique on examples from
queueing networks, for which lumpability does not produce any state space
reduction but our technique synthesises policies using reduced version of the
model.

describing the evolution of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field of the Sun
is critical for the correct reproduction of the polar magnetic flux built up
during a solar cycle, which in turn is known to be a good predictor of the
amplitude of the upcoming cycle. For an informed choice of parameters it is
important to understand the effect and interplay of the various parameters and
to optimize the models for the polar magnetic field. Here we present the
results of a large-scale systematic study of the parameter space in an SFT
model where the source term representing the net effect of tilted flux
emergence was chosen to represent a typical, average solar cycle as described
by observations. Comparing the results with observational constraints on the
spatiotemporal variation of the polar magnetic field, as seen in magnetograms
for the last four solar cycles, we mark allowed and excluded regions in the 3D
parameter space defined by the flow amplitude u0, the magnetic diffusivity eta
and the decay time scale tau, for three different assumed meridional flow
profiles. Without a significant decay term in the SFT equation (i.e., for tau
>10 yr) the global dipole moment reverses too late in the cycle for all flow
profiles and parameters, providing independent supporting evidence for the need
of a decay term, even in the case of identical cycles. An allowed domain is
found to exist for tau values in the 5-10 yr range for all flow profiles
considered. Generally higher values of eta (500-800 km^2/s) are preferred

utilization of the resource in cloud computing services.As the cloud data
centers consume high electrical power,the operational costs and carbon dioxide
releases increases.The inefficient usage of the resources is the main reason
for these problems and VM consolidation is a viable solution.VM consolidation
includes host overload/under-load detection,VM selection and VM placement
processes.Most existing host overload/under-load detection approaches of VM
consolidation uses CPU utilization only for the determining host load.In this
paper,three resources namely CPU utilization,memory utilization and bandwidth
utilization are used for host overload detection and an adaptive regression
based model called Multiple Regression Multi-Objective Seven-Spot Ladybird
Optimization(MR-MOSLO) is proposed.This model is based on combining the
benefits of adaptive threshold based and regression based host overload
detection algorithms.This approach of combining these features provide more
advantages for threshold setting in dynamic environments with accurate
prediction of host overloading.For this purpose, initially,Multiple Regression
(MR)algorithm is used which relay on CPU utilization,memory utilization and
bandwidth utilization for estimation of the host load conditions.Then a
Multi-Objective Seven-Spot Ladybird Optimization(MOSLO)algorithm is introduced
to select the upper and lower threshold limits for host utilization.Based on
these algorithms,the host overload/under-load is detected with high accuracy
and less power consumption.The simulations are conducted in CloudSim tool and
the empirical results shows that the proposed MR-MOSLO algorithm detects the
host overload efficiently with reasonably similar energy and SLA values while
comparatively lesser SLATAH,PDM,SLAV and ESV values than most of the existing
methods.

the eclipse phenomena of this black widow pulsar using model fits of increased
dispersion and scattering of the pulsed radio emission as it traverses the
eclipse medium. These model fits reveal variability in dispersion features on
timescales as short as the orbital period, and previously unknown trends on
timescales of months--years. No clear patterns are found between the
low-frequency eclipse widths, orbital period variations and trends in the
intra-binary material density. Using polarisation calibrated observations we
present the first available limits on the strength of magnetic fields within
the eclipse region of this system; the average line of sight field is
constrained to be $10^{-4}$ G $\lesssim B_{||} \lesssim 10^2$ G, while for the
case of a field directed near-perpendicular to the line of sight we find
$B_{\perp} \lesssim 0.3$ G. Depolarisation of the linearly polarised pulses
during the eclipse is detected and attributed to rapid rotation measure
fluctuations of $\sigma_{\text{RM}} \gtrsim 100$ rad m$^{-2}$ along, or across,
the line of sights averaged over during a sub-integration. The results are
considered in the context of eclipse mechanisms, and we find scattering and/or
cyclotron absorption provide the most promising explanation, while dispersion
smearing is conclusively ruled out. Finally, we estimate the mass loss rate
from the companion to be $\dot{M}_{\text{C}} \sim 10^{-12} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,

the largest eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our starting
point is one explanation on the rationale of adversarial examples. Based on the
idea of the difference between a benign sample and its adversarial example is
measured by the Euclidean norm, while the difference between their
classification probability densities at the last (softmax) layer of the network
could be measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the explanation
shows that the output difference is a quadratic form of the input difference.
If the eigenvalue of this quadratic form (a.k.a. FIM) is large, the output
difference becomes large even when the input difference is small, which
explains the adversarial phenomenon. This makes the adversarial defense
possible by controlling the eigenvalues of the FIM. Our solution is adding one
term representing the trace of the FIM to the loss function of the original
network, as the largest eigenvalue is bounded by the trace. Our defensive
scheme is verified by experiments using a variety of common attacking methods
on typical deep neural networks, e.g. LeNet, VGG and ResNet, with datasets
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). Our new
network, after adopting the novel loss function and retraining, has an
effective and robust defensive capability, as it decreases the fooling ratio of
the generated adversarial examples, and remains the classification accuracy of
the original network.

the northern RSL sites, humidity decreases when RSL increment while humidity is
high on the fading season. We suggest that the recurrence of RSL is caused by
the different angle of response between wet and dry grains. 2D DEM simulation
indicates that, when the ratio of a liquid bridge volume to a particle volume
is the order of 10^{-7}, the repose angle of Martian sand can increase to ~40
degrees due to cohesion, which is near the slope around RSL starting area.
Thus, if this amount of liquid bridge is generated by deliquescence or
capillary condensation of vapor and if the water evaporates following the
humidity and temperature cycles, Martian sand can induce avalanche on RSL
slope. When grains are wet again, sand and dust deposit on RSL, which may be
the mechanism of RSL disappearance and recharge of grains for the next season.
In our model, because liquid induces RSL indirectly (RSL itself is the granular
flow), the amount of liquid can be drastically reduced compared with the wet
mechanism. In this case, as well as temperature, the seasonal cycle of relative
humidity plays an important role in the recurrence of RSL.

connections between the core and filament evolutions, and between the filament
dynamics and the global evolution of the cloud. We characterise the gas
dynamics and energy balance using Herschel and WISE observations and molecular
tracers observed with the IRAM 30m and TRAO 14m telescopes. The velocity field
of the cloud is examined and velocity-coherent structures are put in
perspective with the cloud environment. Two main velocity components (VCs) are
revealed, well separated in the north and merged around the location of intense
N2H+ emission where Paper I found the peak of SF activity. The relative
position of the two VCs along the sightline, and the velocity gradient in N2H+
emission imply that the VCs have been undergoing collision for ~10^5 yrs. The
dense gas where N2H+ is detected is interpreted as the compressed region
between the two filaments, which corresponds to a high mass inflow rate of
~1e-3 Msun/yr and possibly leads to an increase in its SF efficiency. We
identify a protostar in the junction region that possibly powers two crossed
intermittent outflows. We show that the HII region around the nearby cluster
NCG 2264 is still expanding and its role in the collision is examined. However,
we cannot rule out the idea that the collision arises mostly from the global
collapse of the cloud. The (sub-)filament-scale observables examined in this

role in feeding the cores in the junction region. One must now characterise the
cloud morphology, its fragmentation, and magnetic field, all at high

  Sparse Coding","14 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video rain/snow removal from surveillance videos is an important task in the
computer vision community since rain/snow existed in videos can severely
degenerate the performance of many surveillance system. Various methods have
been investigated extensively, but most only consider consistent rain/snow
under stable background scenes. Rain/snow captured from practical surveillance
camera, however, is always highly dynamic in time with the background scene
transformed occasionally. To this issue, this paper proposes a novel rain/snow
removal approach, which fully considers dynamic statistics of both rain/snow
and background scenes taken from a video sequence. Specifically, the rain/snow
is encoded as an online multi-scale convolutional sparse coding (OMS-CSC)
model, which not only finely delivers the sparse scattering and multi-scale
shapes of real rain/snow, but also well encodes their temporally dynamic
configurations by real-time ameliorated parameters in the model. Furthermore, a
transformation operator imposed on the background scenes is further embedded
into the proposed model, which finely conveys the dynamic background
transformations, such as rotations, scalings and distortions, inevitably
existed in a real video sequence. The approach so constructed can naturally
better adapt to the dynamic rain/snow as well as background changes, and also
suitable to deal with the streaming video attributed its online learning mode.
The proposed model is formulated in a concise maximum a posterior (MAP)
framework and is readily solved by the ADMM algorithm. Compared with the
state-of-the-art online and offline video rain/snow removal methods, the
proposed method achieves better performance on synthetic and real videos
datasets both visually and quantitatively. Specifically, our method can be
implemented in relatively high efficiency, showing its potential to real-time
video rain/snow removal.

trajectories is essential for many robotic applications. Such policies can be
learned using reinforcement learning or planned using optimal control. While
reinforcement learning is sample inefficient, optimal control only plans an
optimal trajectory from a specific starting configuration. In this paper we
propose deep optimal feedback control to learn an optimal feedback policy
rather than a single trajectory. By exploiting the inherent structure of the
robot dynamics and strictly convex action cost, we can derive principled cost
functions such that the optimal policy naturally obeys the action limits, is
globally optimal and stable on the training domain given the optimal value
function. The corresponding optimal value function is learned end-to-end by
embedding a deep differential network in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann
differential equation and minimizing the error of this equality while
simultaneously decreasing the discounting from short- to far-sighted to enable
the learning. Our proposed approach enables us to learn an optimal feedback
control law in continuous time, that in contrast to existing approaches
generates an optimal trajectory from any point in state-space without the need
of replanning. The resulting approach is evaluated on non-linear systems and
achieves optimal feedback control, where standard optimal control methods
require frequent replanning.

Introduction For some time now, rare-earth (RE)-doped semiconductors represent
significant potential applications in the field of opto-electronic technology.
Part of this technological interest relies on the shielded 4f levels of the RE
ions as they give rise to sharp and strong luminescence peaks [1-5]. Among the
RE elements, Er is preferred to its counterparts since the Er ions can produce
both visible light at 558 nm (green, one of the primary colours) and IR light
at 1.54 $\mu$m whose spectrum region coincides with the main low-loss region in
the absorption spectrum of silica-based optical fibres, combining so potential
applications towards photonic devices and towards optical communication devices
operating in the infrared domain. These interesting emissions can however only
be exploited when placed into host matrixes. On one side, the shielding of the
intra 4f levels prevents the shifting of the RE 3+ energy levels and ensures
the frequency emission stability. Moreover the intra 4f transitions are parity
forbidden for the isolated ions. Matrixes can render the Er 3+ ions optically
active, via a relaxation of selection rules due to crystal field effects. As
silicon based materials were tested in the 1960s to the 90s with no clear
industrial success it was found that the

candidate models of the mechanisms of visual processing in the primate ventral

extremely deep and branching architectures, demonstrating increasingly better
object categorization performance, yet bringing into question how brain-like
they still are. In particular, typical deep models from the machine learning
community are often hard to map onto the brain's anatomy due to their vast
number of layers and missing biologically-important connections, such as
recurrence. Here we demonstrate that better anatomical alignment to the brain
and high performance on machine learning as well as neuroscience measures do
not have to be in contradiction. We developed CORnet-S, a shallow ANN with four
anatomically mapped areas and recurrent connectivity, guided by Brain-Score, a
new large-scale composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks for quantifying
the functional fidelity of models of the primate ventral visual stream. Despite
being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on
Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet. Moreover, our
extensive analyses of CORnet-S circuitry variants reveal that recurrence is the
main predictive factor of both Brain-Score and ImageNet top-1 performance.
Finally, we report that the temporal evolution of the CORnet-S ""IT"" neural

these results establish CORnet-S, a compact, recurrent ANN, as the current best

$\gamma\,, = \, 0.0216(9) \, \rm s$. Furthermore, we measure the proper motion
of the system ($\mu_{\alpha} \, = \, 5.19(22)$ and $\mu_{\delta} =
-0.56(25)\rm~mas ~ yr^{-1}$), which is not only important for analyzing its
motion in the cluster, but is also essential for a proper interpretation of
$\gamma$, given the latter parameter's correlation with the variation of the
projected semi-major axis. The measurements of $\gamma$ and the proper motion
enable a separation of the system component masses: we obtain a pulsar mass of
$M_{p} \, = \, 1.25^{+0.05}_{-0.06} \, M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of
$M_{c} \, = \, 1.22^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \, M_{\odot}$. This raises the possibility
that the companion is also a neutron star. Searches for radio pulsations from
the companion have thus far been unsuccessful, hence we cannot confirm the
latter hypothesis. The low mass of this millisecond pulsar - one of the lowest
ever measured for such objects - clearly indicates that the recycling process
can be achieved with a relatively small amount of mass transfer.

X/E_{i+1}$ is starlike-equivalent for each $i$ and $E_{N+1}$ is a point. A

starlike-equivalent, if there exists $N\geq 0$ such that each element of

$X\to X/\mathcal{D}$ is the limit of a sequence of homeomorphisms. This is a
strong generalisation of results of Denman-Starbird and Freedman and is
applicable to the proof of Freedman's celebrated disc embedding theorem. The
latter leads to a multitude of foundational results for topological
$4$-manifolds, including the $4$-dimensional Poincar\'{e} conjecture.

  Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied
constraint handling framework. The objective of a DCOP algorithm is to optimize
a global objective function that can be described as the aggregation of a
number of distributed constraint cost functions. In a DCOP, each of these
functions is defined by a set of discrete variables. However, in many
applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor networks,
continuous valued variables are more suited than the discrete ones. Considering
this, Functional DCOPs (F-DCOPs) have been proposed that is able to explicitly
model a problem containing continuous variables. Nevertheless, the
state-of-the-art F-DCOPs approaches experience onerous memory or computation
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new F-DCOP algorithm, namely
Particle Swarm Based F-DCOP (PFD), which is inspired by a meta-heuristic,
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Although it has been successfully applied to
many continuous optimization problems, the potential of PSO has not been
utilized in F-DCOPs. To be exact, PFD devises a distributed method of solution
construction while significantly reducing the computation and memory
requirements. Moreover, we theoretically prove that PFD is an anytime
algorithm. Finally, our empirical results indicate that PFD outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality and computation
overhead.

between particles. These correlations are especially marked when the TP is
driven and leads to inhomogeneous density profiles. Determining the impact of
this inhomogeneity when several TPs are driven in the system is a key question,
related to the general issue of bath-mediated interactions, which are known to
induce collective motion and lead to the formation of clusters or lanes in a

proposed method only requires very few assumptions and thus promises to be of
broad practical use. Two test statistics are defined, and their asymptotic or
approximate sampling distributions are derived. In order to improve
particularly the small-sample behavior of the resulting tests, two
bootstrap-based methods are developed and theoretically justified. Several
simulations shed light on the performance of the proposed tests. The analysis

robotics. To address single-image RGB localization, state-of-the-art
feature-based methods match local descriptors between a query image and a
pre-built 3D model. Recently, deep neural networks have been exploited to
regress the mapping between raw pixels and 3D coordinates in the scene, and
thus the matching is implicitly performed by the forward pass through the
network. However, in a large and ambiguous environment, learning such a
regression task directly can be difficult for a single network. In this work,
we present a new hierarchical scene coordinate network to predict pixel scene
coordinates in a coarse-to-fine manner from a single RGB image. The network
consists of a series of output layers, each of them conditioned on the previous
ones. The final output layer predicts the 3D coordinates and the others produce
progressively finer discrete location labels. The proposed method outperforms
the baseline regression-only network and allows us to train compact models
which scale robustly to large environments. It sets a new state-of-the-art for
single-image RGB localization performance on the 7-Scenes, 12-Scenes, Cambridge
Landmarks datasets, and three combined scenes. Moreover, for large-scale

great importance for chemical and life sciences. Since most of the relevant

challenges of performing optical measurements in that spectral range. To
address this problem, here, we study the possibility of shifting CD signal of a

microcavity. Specifically, we show that by strongly coupling chiral plasmonic
nanoparticles to a non-chiral Fabry-P\'erot microcavity one can imprint the
hybrid mode splitting, the hallmark of strongly coupled systems, on the CD
spectrum of the coupled system and thereby effectively shift the chiral
resonance of the model system to lower energies. We first predict the effect
using analytical transfer-matrix method as well as numerical finite-difference

consider both the traveling times between the cameras and the traffic flow that
each camera is supposed to monitor. In this paper, we study the problem of
routing a set of technicians to repair cameras by minimizing the total weighted
latency, that is, the sum of the weighted waiting times of each camera, where
the weight is a parameter proportional to the monitored traffic. The resulting
problem, called weighted k-traveling repairman problem (wkTRP), is a
generalization of the well-known traveling repairman problem and can be used to
model a variety of real-world applications. To solve the wkTRP, we propose an
iterated local search heuristic and an exact branch-and-cut algorithm enriched

extensive computational experiments performed both on instances derived from a

follow-up observations that are used to provide estimates of effective
temperature, surface gravity and metallicity ([Fe/H]) for the candidates. The
selection process is very efficient: of the 2618 candidates with low-resolution
spectra that have photometric metallicity estimates less than or equal to -2.0,
41% have [Fe/H] $\leq$ -2.75 and only $\sim$7% have [Fe/H] $>$ -2.0 dex. The
most metal-poor candidate in the sample has [Fe/H] $<$ -4.75 and is notably
carbon-rich. Except at the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] $<$ -4), the stars
observed spectroscopically are dominated by a `carbon-normal' population with
[C/Fe]$_{1D,LTE}$ $\leq$ +1 dex. Consideration of the A(C)$_{1D, LTE}$ versus
[Fe/H]$_{1D, LTE}$ diagram suggests that the current selection process is
strongly biased against stars with A(C)$_{1D, LTE}$ $>$ 7.3 (predominantly
CEMP-$s$) while any bias against stars with A(C)$_{1D, LTE}$ $<$ 7.3 and
[C/Fe]$_{LTE}$ $>$ +1 (predominantly CEMP-no) is not readily quantifiable given
the uncertainty in the SkyMapper $v$-band DR1.1 photometry. We find that the

shorter mean-free-paths than phonons so that the latter can be selectively
scattered. Nevertheless, introducing disorder into a material often comes at
the expense of scattering charge carriers as well as phonons. In order to
determine the tradeoff between the degradation of the lattice thermal
conductivity and of the power factor due to this, we perform a theoretical
investigation of both phonon and electron transport in nanocrystalline,
nanoporous Si geometries. We use molecular dynamics for phonon transport
calculations and the non-equilibrium Green's function method for electronic
transport. We report on the engineering tradeoff that the porosity (number of
pores and their in-between distance) has on the overall thermoelectric
performance for the material optimization. We indeed find that the reduction in
thermal conductivity is stronger compared to the reduction in the power factor,
for the low porosities considered in this study (up to 5 %), and that the ZT
figure of merit can experience a large increase, especially when grain
boundaries are included, compared to just nanoporosity.

about a drop-in replacement for the (sample-dependent) approximate posterior to

choice to adopt for natural signals like images, as it does not force the

allows more freedom for the approximate posterior to match the true posterior.
This allows for the repararametrization trick, as well as the KL-divergence

sample-based estimation. Although providing more freedom to adapt to correlated

characterize correlation and scaling, respectively. As validated by the

for calculating thermal rate coefficients of various chemical reactions. For
wider application of this methodology, efficient ways to generate the
underlying full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the
corresponding energy gradients are required. Recently, we have proposed a fully
automated procedure based on combining the original RPMDrate code with active
learning for PES on-the-fly using moment tensor potential and successfully
applied it to two representative thermally activated chemical reactions [I. S.
Novikov, Y. V. Suleimanov, A. V. Shapeev, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 29503-29512
(2018)]. In this work, using a prototype insertion chemical reaction S + H$_2$,
we show that this procedure works equally well for another class of chemical
reactions. We find that the corresponding PES can be generated by fitting to
less than 1500 automatically generated structures while the RPMD rate
coefficients show deviation from the reference values within the typical
convergence error of RPMDrate. We note that more structures are accumulated
during the real-time propagation of the dynamic factor (the recrossing factor)
as opposed to the previous study. We also observe that relatively flat free
energy profile of the along the reaction coordinate before entering the
complex-formation well can cause issues with locating the maximum of the free
energy surface for less converged PESs. However, the final RPMD rate
coefficient is independent of the position of the dividing surface that makes
it invulnerable to this problem, keeping the total number of necessary
structures within a few thousand. Our work concludes that, in future, the
proposed methodology can be applied to realistic complex chemical reactions
with various energy profiles.

problems; i.e., (i) it is not optimized to minimize diarization errors

problems, the End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND), in which a bidirectional
long short-term memory (BLSTM) network directly outputs speaker diarization
results given a multi-talker recording, was recently proposed. In this study,
we enhance EEND by introducing self-attention blocks instead of BLSTM blocks.
In contrast to BLSTM, which is conditioned only on its previous and next hidden
states, self-attention is directly conditioned on all the other frames, making
it much suitable for dealing with the speaker diarization problem. We evaluated
our proposed method on simulated mixtures, real telephone calls, and real
dialogue recordings. The experimental results revealed that the self-attention
was the key to achieving good performance and that our proposed method
performed significantly better than the conventional BLSTM-based method. Our
method was even better than that of the state-of-the-art x-vector

fluctuations of the partial $\gamma$-decay widths for a compound-nucleus
resonance are governed by the Porter-Thomas distribution (PTD), and that
consequently the distribution of total $\gamma$-decay widths is very narrow.
However, a recent experiment [Koehler, Larsen, Guttormsen, Siem, and Guber,
Phys. Rev. C 88, 041305(R) (2013)] reported large fluctuations of the total
$\gamma$-decay widths in the $^{95}$Mo$(n,\gamma)^{96}$Mo* reaction, contrary
to this expectation. Furthermore, in recent theoretical works it was argued
that sufficiently strong channel couplings can cause deviations of the partial
width distributions from PTD. Here, we investigate whether the combined
influence of a large number of nonequivalent $\gamma$-decay channels, each of
which couples weakly to the compound-nucleus resonances, can modify the
statistics of the partial widths. We study this effect in neutron scattering
off $^{95}$Mo within a random-matrix model that includes coupling to the
entrance neutron channel and to the large number of $\gamma$ channels. Using
realistic coupling parameters obtained from empirical models for the level
density and the $\gamma$ strength function, we find that the PTD describes well
the distribution of partial widths for all decay channels, in agreement with
the statistical-model expectation. Furthermore, we find that the width of the
distribution of the total $\gamma$-decay widths is insensitive to wide
variations in the parameters of the $\gamma$ strength function, as well as to
deviations of the partial-width distributions from the PTD. Our results rule
out an explanation of the recent experimental data within a statistical-model

the most important consideration for code reuse. However, determining if a
snippet is correct, but simply out-of-date, is a non-trivial task. In the best
case, breaking changes are well documented, allowing developers to manually
determine when a code snippet contains an out-of-date API usage. In the worst
case, determining if and when a breaking change was made requires an exhaustive
search through previous dependency versions.
  We present V2, a strategy for determining if a code snippet is out-of-date by
detecting discrete instances of configuration drift, where the snippet uses an
API which has since undergone a breaking change. Each instance of configuration
drift is classified by a failure encountered during validation and a
configuration patch, consisting of dependency version changes, which fixes the
underlying fault. V2 uses feedback-directed search to explore the possible
configuration space for a code snippet, reducing the number of potential
environment configurations that need to be validated. When run on a corpus of
public Python snippets from prior research, V2 identifies 248 instances of
configuration drift.

  Method. QTDU consists of a three-stage pipeline for the obtaining of ulcer
segmentation, tissues' labeling, and wounded area quantification. We set up our
approach by using a real and annotated set of dermatological ulcers for
training several deep learning models to the identification of ulcered
superpixels.
  Results. Empirical evaluations on 179,572 superpixels divided into four
classes showed QTDU accurately spot wounded tissues (AUC = 0.986, sensitivity =
0.97, and specificity = 0.974) and outperformed machine-learning approaches in
up to 8.2% regarding F1-Score through fine-tuning of a ResNet-based model.
Last, but not least, experimental evaluations also showed QTDU correctly
quantified wounded tissue areas within a 0.089 Mean Absolute Error ratio.

temperatures between $100-10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ due to the large energy spacing
between its rotational and vibrational modes. For the formation of the first
stars at redshifts 20 and above, this variation can be significant because
primordial molecular clouds are in this temperature range due to the absence of
efficient cooling by dust and metals. We study the possible importance of
variations in $\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ for the primordial initial mass function
by carrying out 80 3D gravito-hydrodynamic simulations of collapsing clouds
with different random turbulent velocity fields, half using fixed $\gamma_{\rm
H_2} = 7/5$ in the limit of classical diatomic gas (used in earlier works) and
half using an accurate quantum mechanical treatment of $\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$.
We use the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH with the primordial chemistry
network from KROME for this study. The simulation suite produces almost 400
stars, with masses from $0.02 - 50$ M$_\odot$ (mean mass $\sim
10.5\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and mean multiplicity fraction $\sim 0.4$). While the
results of individual simulations do differ when we change our treatment of
$\gamma_{\mathrm{H_2}}$, we find no statistically significant differences in
the overall mass or multiplicity distributions of the stars formed in the two
sets of runs. We conclude that, at least prior to the onset of radiation
feedback, approximating H$_2$ as a classical diatomic gas with $\gamma_{\rm
H_2} = 7/5$ does not induce significant errors in simulations of the
fragmentation of primordial gas. Nonetheless, we recommend using the accurate
formulation of the H$_2\,$ adiabatic index in primordial star formation studies
since it is not computationally more expensive and provides a better treatment

adversarial attacks that fool the classifiers using subtly modified input data.
In contrast to previous works, here we focus on the white-box adversarial
defense where the attackers are granted full access to not only the classifiers
but also defenders to produce as strong attacks as possible. In such a context
we propose viewing a defender as a functional, a higher-order function that
takes functions as its argument to represent a function space, rather than
fixed functions conventionally. From this perspective, a defender should be
realized and optimized individually for each adversarial input. To this end, we
propose RIDE, an efficient and provably convergent self-supervised learning
algorithm for individual data estimation to protect the predictions from
adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the significant improvement of adversarial
defense performance on image recognition, eg, 98%, 76%, 43% test accuracy on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets respectively under the state-of-the-art

provide information complementary to popular nuclear neutrinoless

$0\nu\beta\beta$ decays in short, though $\beta$ refers to all charged leptons.
In this work we investigate the decays $K^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\mp l^{\pm}l^{\pm}$
that arise from short-distance or contact interactions involving four quark
fields and two charged lepton fields, which have canonical dimension nine
(dim-9) at leading order in low energy effective field theory (LEFT). We make a
complete analysis on the basis of all dim-9 operators that violate lepton
number by two units, and compute their one-loop QCD renormalization effects. We
match these effective interactions in LEFT to those in chiral perturbation
theory ($\chi$PT) for pseudoscalar mesons, and determine the resulting hadronic
low energy constants (LECs) by chiral symmetry and lattice results in the
literature. The obtained decay rate is general in that all physics at and above
the electroweak scale is completely parameterized by the relevant Wilson
coefficients in LEFT and hadronic LECs in $\chi$PT. Assuming the standard model
effective field theory (SMEFT) is the appropriate effective field theory
between some new physics scale and the electroweak scale, we match our LEFT
results to SMEFT whose leading effective interactions arise from LNV dim-7
operators. This connection to SMEFT simplifies significantly the interaction
structures entering in the kaon decays, and we employ the current experimental
bounds to set constraints on the relevant Wilson coefficients in SMEFT.

region (BLR) fluxes are predicted from optical continuum variability (taken as
a proxy for the ionizing continuum) convolved with a response function that
depends on the geometry. However, it has long been known that BLR variability
can deviate from these predictions. We analyze both extensive long-term
H$\beta$ and continuum monitoring of NGC 5548 and a large sample of
high-quality H$\beta$ light curves of other AGNs to investigate the frequency
and characteristics of anomalous responses of the BLR. We find that anomalies
are very common and probably occur in every object. Onsets can be on a
timescale only slightly longer than the light-crossing time and durations are
of the order of the characteristic timescale of variability of the optical
continuum to several times longer. Anomalies are larger when NGC 5548 is in a
low state, but otherwise there is no correlation with continuum variability.
There is abundant evidence for the optical continuum of AGNs varying
independently of the higher-energy continua and this is sufficient to explain
the anomalous responses of the total BLR flux. There are good reasons for
believing that the frequent lack of correlation between spectral regions is due
to anisotropic and non-axisymmetric emission. Rapid changes in line profiles
and velocity-dependent lags are consistent with this. Motion of compact
absorbing clouds across the line of sight is another possible cause of
anomalies. The prevalence of anomalies should be considered when planning
reverberation-mapping campaigns.

Lagrangian displacement fields in the context of modified gravity (MG)
theories. We start from the extension of Lagrangian Perturbation Theory to a
class of MG models that can be described by a parametrized Poisson equation,
with the introduction of a scale-dependent function. We exploit fast Fourier
transforms to compute the full source term of the differential equation for the
second-order Lagrangian displacement field. We compare its mean to the source
term computed for specific configurations for which a k-dependent solution can
be found numerically. We choose the configuration that best matches the full
source term, thus obtaining an approximate factorization of the second-order
displacement field as the space term valid for standard gravity times a
k-dependent, second-order growth factor $D_2(k,t)$. This approximation is used
to compute second order displacements for particles. The method is tested
against N-body simulations run with standard and $f(R)$ gravity: we rely on the
results of a friends-of-friends code run on the N-body snapshots to assign
particles to halos, then compute the halo power spectrum. We find very
consistent results for the two gravity theories: second-order LPT (2LPT) allows
to recover the halo power spectrum of N-body simulations within $\sim 10\%$
precision to $k\sim 0.2-0.4\ h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, as well as halo positions,
with an error that is a fraction of the inter-particle distance. We show that,
when considering the same level of non-linearity in the density field, the
performance of 2LPT with MG is the same (within $1\%$) as the one obtained for
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with General Relativity. When implemented in a
computer code, this formulation of 2LPT can quickly generate dark matter
distributions with $f(R)$ gravity, and can easily be extended to other MG
theories.

monitored by a large tetragonal compressive strain, that is itself a
Jahn-Teller active distortion. Equally, the competition of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic orders is slave of the same tetragonal strain. Our results
further indicate that the metal to insulator transition can be thought as a
Peierls transition that is enabled by spin symmetry breaking. Therefore,
dynamical spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic state stabilize the insulating
phase by the instantaneous symmetry breaking they produce and which is properly
captured from static DFT calculations. As a basis to our discussion, we
introduce canonical notations for lattice distortions in perovskites that

of the manifold.FLRML significantly reduces the complexity and memory usage in
optimization, which makes the method scalable to both high dimensions and large

make the method scalable to larger datasets which are hard to be loaded and
decomposed in limited memory. The outperforming experimental results show that
our method is with high accuracy and much faster than the state-of-the-art
methods under several benchmarks with large numbers of high-dimensional data.

we analyze the emergence of the latter class of models at intermediate and low
energy scales from fundamental quark-gluon interactions. To this end, we study
the renormalization group flow of a Fierz-complete set of four-quark
interactions and monitor their strength at finite temperature and quark
chemical potential. At small quark chemical potential, we find that the
scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel is dynamically rendered most dominant
by the gauge degrees of freedom, indicating the formation of a chiral
condensate. Moreover, the inclusion of quark-gluon interactions leaves a
significant imprint on the dynamics as measured by the curvature of the
finite-temperature phase boundary which we find to be in accordance with
lattice QCD results. At large quark chemical potential, we then observe that
the dominance pattern of the four-quark couplings is changed by the underlying
quark-gluon dynamics, without any fine-tuning of the four-quark couplings. In
this regime, the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel becomes subleading and
the dominance pattern suggests the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark
condensate. In particular, our study confirms the importance of explicit
$U_{\mathrm{A}}(1)$ breaking for the formation of this type of condensate at
high densities.

physical insights for open-cavity flows. Resolvent analysis identifies the flow
response to harmonic forcing, given a steady base state, in terms of the
response and forcing modes and the amplification gain. The response and forcing
modes reveal the spatial structures associated with this amplification process.
In this study, we perform resolvent analysis on both laminar and turbulent
flows over a rectangular cavity with length-to-depth ratio of $L/D=6$ at a free
stream Mach number of $M_\infty=0.6$ in a spanwise periodic setting. Based on
the dominant instability of the base state, a discount parameter is introduced
to resolvent analysis to examine the harmonic characteristics over a
finite-time window. We first uncover the underlying flow physics and interpret
findings from laminar flow at $Re_D = 502$. These findings from laminar flow
are extended to a more practical cavity flow example at a much higher Reynolds
number of $Re_D = 10^4$. The features of response and forcing modes from the
laminar and turbulent cavity flows are similar to the spatial structures from
the laminar analysis. We further find that the large amplification of energy in
flow response is associated with high frequency for turbulent flow, while the
flow is more responsive to low frequency excitation in the laminar case. These
findings from resolvent analysis provide valuable insights for flow control
studies with regard to parameter selection and placement of actuators and
sensors.

ultra-faint systems imaged by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) using SOAR/Goodman
and Blanco/DECam imagers. We have detected two RRLs in the field of Grus I,
none in Kim 2, one in Phoenix II, and four in Grus II. With the detection of
these stars, we accurately determine the distance moduli for these ultra-faint
dwarf satellite galaxies; $\mu_0$=20.51$\pm$0.10 mag (D$_{\odot}$=127$\pm$6
kpc) for Grus I and $\mu_0$=20.01$\pm$0.10 mag (D$_{\odot}$=100$\pm$5 kpc) for
Phoenix II. These measurements are larger than previous estimations by Koposov
et al. 2015 and Bechtol et al. 2015, implying larger physical sizes; 5\% for
Grus I and 33\% for Phoenix II. For Grus II, out of the four RRLs detected, one
is consistent with being a member of the galactic halo (D$_\odot$=24$\pm$1 kpc,
$\mu_0$=16.86$\pm$0.10 mag), another is at D$_\odot$=55$\pm$2 kpc
($\mu_0$=18.71$\pm$0.10 mag), which we associate with Grus II, and the two
remaining at D$_\odot$=43$\pm$2 kpc ($\mu_0$=18.17$\pm$0.10 mag). Moreover, the
appearance of a subtle red horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram of
Grus II at the same brightness level of the latter two RRLs, which are at the
same distance and in the same region, suggests that a more metal-rich system
may be located in front of Grus II. The most plausible scenario is the
association of these stars with the Chenab/Orphan Stream. Finally, we performed
a comprehensive and updated analysis of the number of RRLs in dwarf galaxies.
This allows us to predict that the method of finding new ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies by using two or more clumped RRLs will work only for systems brighter
than M$_V\sim-6$ mag.

of its birth are crucial arbiters for competing hypotheses regarding the birth
environment of the Sun. The presence of short-lived radionuclides, as evidenced
by their decay products in meteorites, has been used to suggest that
particular, sometimes exotic, stellar sources were proximal to the Sun's birth
environment. The recent confirmation of neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS)
mergers and associated kilonovae as potentially dominant sources of r-process
nuclides can be tested in the case of the solar birth environment using the
relative abundances of the longer-lived nuclides. Critical analysis of the 15
radionuclides and their stable partners for which abundances and production
ratios are well known suggests that the Sun formed in a typical massive
star-forming region (SFR). The apparent overabundances of short-lived
radionuclides (e.g.\, $^{26} {\rm Al}$, $^{41}{\rm Ca}$, $^{36}{\rm Cl}$) in
the early solar system appears to be an artifact of a heretofore
under-appreciation for the important influences of enrichment by Wolf-Rayet
winds in SFRs. The long-lived nuclides (e.g.\, $^{238}{\rm U}$, $^{244}{\rm
Pu}$, $^{247}{\rm Cr}$, $^{129}{\rm I}$) are consistent with an average time
interval between production events of $10^8$ years, seemingly too short to be
the products of NS-NS mergers alone. The relative abundances of all of these
nuclides can be explained by their mean decay lifetimes and an average
residence time in the ISM of $\sim200$ Myr. This residence time evidenced by
the radionuclides is consistent with the average lifetime of dust in the ISM
and the timescale for converting molecular cloud mass to stars.

three-quark and quark-antiquark configurations of the constituent-quark model.
These so-called exotic hadrons contain additional constituent (anti)quarks or
excited gluonic fields that contribute to the quantum numbers of the hadron.
The COMPASS experiment at CERN is studying the excitation spectrum of light
mesons composed of up, down, and strange quarks. The excited mesons are
produced via the strong interaction by scattering a 190 GeV/c pion beam off
proton or nuclear targets. On heavy nuclear targets, in addition the
electromagnetic interaction contributes in the form of quasi-real photon
exchange at very low four-momentum transfer squared. COMPASS has performed the
most comprehensive analyses to date of isovector resonances decaying into
multi-particle final states. In this review, we give a general introduction

COMPASS data provide solid evidence for the existence of the manifestly exotic
$\pi_1(1600)$, which has quantum numbers forbidden for a quark-model state, and
of the $a_1(1420)$, which does not fit into the quark-model spectrum. By

In addition to conventional compression techniques, e.g., weight pruning and
quantization, removing unimportant activations can reduce the amount of data
communication and the computation cost. Unlike weight parameters, the pattern
of activations is directly related to input data and thereby changes
dynamically. To regulate the dynamic activation sparsity (DAS), in this work,
we propose a generic low-cost approach based on winners-take-all (WTA) dropout
technique. The network enhanced by the proposed WTA dropout, namely
\textit{DASNet}, features structured activation sparsity with an improved
sparsity level. Compared to the static feature map pruning methods, DASNets
provide better computation cost reduction. The WTA technique can be easily
applied in deep neural networks without incurring additional training
variables. More importantly, DASNet can be seamlessly integrated with other
compression techniques, such as weight pruning and quantization, without
compromising on accuracy. Our experiments on various networks and datasets

a residual neural network with convolutional layers as a meta-learning agent
for few-shot TSC. The network is trained on a diverse set of few-shot tasks
sampled from various domains (e.g. healthcare, activity recognition, etc.) such
that it can solve a target task from another domain using only a small number
of training samples from the target task. Most existing meta-learning
approaches are limited in practice as they assume a fixed number of target
classes across tasks. We overcome this limitation in order to train a common
agent across domains with each domain having different number of target
classes, we utilize a triplet-loss based learning procedure that does not
require any constraints to be enforced on the number of classes for the
few-shot TSC tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use
meta-learning based pre-training for TSC. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
few-shot TSC, outperforming several strong baselines on few-shot tasks sampled
from 41 datasets in UCR TSC Archive. We observe that pre-training under the
meta-learning paradigm allows the network to quickly adapt to new unseen tasks
with small number of labeled instances.

Nevertheless, the reliable life-time prediction of bonded anchor systems based

due to the complex non-liner viscoelastic behaviour of concrete and adhesives
alike. This contribution summarizes the results of a comprehensive experimental
investigation and systematically carried out time-to-failure analysis performed
on bonded anchors under sustained tensile load. Two different adhesive
materials that find widespread application in the building industry were used,
one epoxy and one vinylester based. Performed experiments include full material
characterizations of concrete and the adhesives, bonded anchor pull-out tests
at different loading rates, and time-to-failure sustained load tests. All
anchor tests are performed in a confined configuration with close support.
After a thorough review of available experimental data and analysis methods in
the literature the experimental data is presented with the main goals to (i)
derive a set of recommendations for efficient time to failure tests, and (ii)
to provide guidance for the analysis of load versus time-to-failure test data.
Finally,a new approach based on a sigmoid function is proposed and compared to
the established regression models. The analyses indicate a better agreement
with the physics of the problem and, thus, more reliable extrapolations.

an unknown linear forcing term and a set of nonlinear parameters to be

modeled as a random variable. This random vector is augmented by a random
regularization parameter for the linear part. A probability distribution
function for this augmented random vector knowing the measurements is derived.
The derivation is based on the maximum likelihood regularization parameter
selection which we generalize to the case where the underlying linear operator
is rectangular and depends on a nonlinear parameter. Unlike in previous
studies, we do not limit ourselves to the most likely regularization parameter,
instead we show that due to the dependence of the problem on the nonlinear
parameter there is a great advantage in exploring all positive values of the
regularization parameter. Based on our new probability distribution function,
we construct a propose and accept or reject algorithm to compute the posterior
expected value and covariance of the nonlinear parameter. This algorithm is
greatly accelerated by using a parallel platform where we alternate computing
proposals in parallel and combining proposals to accept or reject them.
Finally, our new algorithm is illustrated by solving an inverse problem in
seismology. We show that the results obtained by our algorithm are more
accurate than those found using Generalized Cross Validation or using the
discrepancy principle, and that our algorithm has the capability to quantify

risk of falling in case of collisions with external objects. Compliant
actuation may reduce forces during collisions, thus protecting hardware and
user. However, experimental data of collisions specific to lower limb
exoskeletons are not available. In this work, we investigated how a variable
stiffness actuator at the knee joint influences collision forces transmitted to
the user via the exoskeleton. In a test bench experiment, we compared three
configurations of an exoskeleton leg with a variable stiffness knee actuator in
(i) compliant or (ii) stiff configurations, and with (iii) a rigid actuator.
The peak torque observed at the pelvis was reduced from 260.2 Nm to 116.2 Nm as
stiffness decreased. In addition, the mechanical impulse was reduced by a
factor of three. These results indicate that compliance in the knee joint of an
exoskeleton can be favorable in case of collision and should be considered when
designing powered lower limb exoskeletons. Overall, this could decrease the
effort necessary to maintain balance after a collision and improved collision
handling in exoskeletons could result in safer use and benefit their usefulness

ten-fold cross-validation was carried out during training to avoid overfitting.
13,233 distinct variables with heterogeneous data types were included without

high-resolution land surface features, known to improve forecasts of

4) reducing the per capita cost of care. In this contribution, recent
literature providing examples of design research in the eHealth domain is
reviewed to answer the research question: in which measure has design research
contributed to each of the four aims of eHealth innovation in the past five
years?. The results of the review are presented and employed to draw three main
observations: 1) design researchers in eHealth seem to be largely focused on
improving experiences of care, either patients' or health professionals; 2)
design researchers' contribution on reducing per capita costs of care appears
to be less pronounced, which is outlined as a point for improvement; and 3) in
a considerable amount of reviewed contributions, design researchers appear to
be contributing to multiple aims at once. In this sub-group of reviewed
contributions, several disciplinary areas and types of stakeholders interact
and integrate through design research activities. The latter observation leads
to a reflection on the strategic role of design research in the contexts of the
convergence revolution and of the non-communicable disease crisis. Implications
of this reflection for design researchers are recognized in the opportunity and
timeliness to develop eHealth-specific ways to orchestrate design integration.
A direction for further research in this sense is identified in the use of
sensory and self-monitored data as a boundary object for eHealth innovation.
The prospective value of this direction is finally exemplified through the case

where keywords are converted to an indicator vector and then concatenated to
the baseline features. A list of keywords is manually selected based on the
error analysis, which may best reflect some characteristics of fake news titles

created based on Mutual Information (MI) theory: keywords generator based on MI
stance class, MI customised class, and Pointwise MI algorithm. The second
approach is based on word embedding, where word2vec model is introduced and two
document similarities calculation algorithms are implemented: wor2vec cosine
similarity and WMD distance. The third approach is ensemble learning. Different
models are configured together with two continuous outputs combining
algorithms. The 10-fold cross validation reveals that the ensemble of three

depends on a regular spherical parameterization of the mesh, which is
computationally prohibitive in some cases and may also demand further
post-processing to refine the network output. Therefore, an accurate and
fully-automatic cortical surface parcellation scheme directly working on the
original brain surfaces would be highly advantageous. In this study, we propose
an end-to-end deep brain cortical parcellation network, called \textbf{DBPN}.
Through intrinsic and extrinsic graph convolution kernels, DBPN dynamically
deciphers neighborhood graph topology around each vertex and encodes the
deciphered knowledge into node features. Eventually, a non-linear mapping
between the node features and parcellation labels is constructed. Our model is
a two-stage deep network which contains a coarse parcellation network with a
U-shape structure and a refinement network to fine-tune the coarse results. We
evaluate our model in a large public dataset and our work achieves superior
performance than state-of-the-art baseline methods in both accuracy and
efficiency

  Perception",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes the use of Bayesian approximations of uncertainty from
deep learning in a robot planner, showing that this produces more cautious
actions in safety-critical scenarios. The case study investigated is motivated
by a setup where an aerial robot acts as a ""scout"" for a ground robot. This is
useful when the below area is unknown or dangerous, with applications in space
exploration, military, or search-and-rescue. Images taken from the aerial view
are used to provide a less obstructed map to guide the navigation of the robot
on the ground. Experiments are conducted using a deep learning semantic image
segmentation, followed by a path planner based on the resulting cost map, to
provide an empirical analysis of the proposed method. A comparison with similar
approaches is presented to portray the usefulness of certain techniques, or
variations within a technique, in similar experimental settings. The method is
analyzed to assess the impact of variations in the uncertainty extraction, as
well as the absence of an uncertainty metric, on the overall system with the
use of a defined metric which measures surprise to the planner. The analysis is
performed on multiple datasets, showing a similar trend of lower surprise when
uncertainty information is incorporated in the planning, given threshold values
of the hyperparameters in the uncertainty extraction have been met. We find
that taking uncertainty into account leads to paths that could be 18% less
risky on an average.

  IJCAI'19",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a multi-stage learning approach for pruning the search space of
maximum clique enumeration, a fundamental computationally difficult problem
arising in various network analysis tasks. In each stage, our approach learns
the characteristics of vertices in terms of various neighborhood features and
leverage them to prune the set of vertices that are likely not contained in any
maximum clique. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is domain
independent -- the same small set of features works well on graph instances
from different domain. Compared to the state-of-the-art heuristics and
preprocessing strategies, the advantages of our approach are that (i) it does
not require any estimate on the maximum clique size at runtime and (ii) we
demonstrate it to be effective also for dense graphs. In particular, for dense
graphs, we typically prune around 30 \% of the vertices resulting in speedups
of up to 53 times for state-of-the-art solvers while generally preserving the
size of the maximum clique (though some maximum cliques may be lost). For large
real-world sparse graphs, we routinely prune over 99 \% of the vertices
resulting in several tenfold speedups at best, typically with no impact on
solution quality.

Carley","Location Order Recovery in Trails with Low Temporal Resolution","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researchers who study object movement problems related to topics like traffic
flow analysis, patient monitoring, and software operation, need to know the
correct order in which objects move. Here, we use the term trail to refer to a
series of movements by an object. This paper introduces a new missing data
problem that occurs when analyzing trails where there is inadequate temporal
resolution on the events. The temporal resolution is inadequate when an object,
which can only be in one place at one time, appears in the data to be in two or
more locations at once. We refer to this lack of resolution as a broken point.
Broken points prevent us from knowing the correct order of movement. We propose
a three-phase framework for recovering the location order. Based on the Markov
transition network, we are able to find the route with the highest probability.
Our results show that this framework can efficiently find the correct location
order in trails with low temporal resolution. We also demonstrate that by
correcting the location order, the criticality of locations can change
significantly.

detection of these accounts, machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes,
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks are applied.
Additionally, for the detection of automated accounts, cost sensitive genetic

microwave community for their versatile wavefront manipulation capability.
Despite their promising potential in telecommunications and radar applications,
few transmissive metasurfaces have been reported operating at millimeter-wave
frequencies. Several secondary effects including fabrication tolerances,
interlayer near-field coupling and the roughness of conductors are more severe
at such high frequencies and can cause significant performance degradation.
Additionally, very accurate experimental techniques are required in order to
characterise these effects. In this work, we present highly efficient
refracting metasurfaces operating at 83 GHz. We use a synthesis technique that
minimizes performance degradation due to effects such as interlayer near-field
coupling and conductor roughness. Our experimental characterization includes an
accurate determination of the intensity of all forward propagating Floquet
harmonics in a broad frequency range. The experimental data shows very good
agreement with full-wave simulation and verifies our synthesis method.

that are discriminative for a certain class. It has been shown that classifiers
are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a plethora of datasets by
taking as input distances from the input time series to different
discriminative shapelets. Additionally, these shapelets can easily be
visualized and thus possess an interpretable characteristic, making them very
appealing in critical domains, such as the health care domain, where
longitudinal data is ubiquitous. In this study, a new paradigm for shapelet
discovery is proposed, which is based upon evolutionary computation. The
advantages of the proposed approach are that (i) it is gradient-free, which
could allow to escape from local optima more easily and to find suited
candidates more easily and supports non-differentiable objectives, (ii) no
brute-force search is required, which drastically reduces the computational
complexity by several orders of magnitude, (iii) the total amount of shapelets
and length of each of these shapelets are evolved jointly with the shapelets
themselves, alleviating the need to specify this beforehand, (iv) entire sets
are evaluated at once as opposed to single shapelets, which results in smaller
final sets with less similar shapelets that result in similar predictive
performances, and (v) discovered shapelets do not need to be a subsequence of
the input time series. We present the results of experiments which validate the
enumerated advantages.
