approaches to describe the physics of the glass transition, but the theory's
inherent approximations compromise its accuracy in the activated glassy regime.
Here we show that microscopic generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT), a
recently proposed hierarchical framework to systematically improve upon
standard MCT, provides a promising pathway toward a more accurate
first-principles description of glassy dynamics. We present a comprehensive
numerical analysis for Percus-Yevick hard spheres by performing explicitly
wavenumber- and time-dependent GMCT calculations up to sixth order.
Specifically, we calculate the location of the critical point, the associated
non-ergodicity parameters, the time-dependent dynamics of the density
correlators at both absolute and reduced packing fractions, and we test several
universal scaling relations in the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation regimes. It
is found that higher-order GMCT can successfully remedy some of standard MCT's
pathologies, including an underestimation of the critical glass transition
density and an overestimation of the hard-sphere fragility. Furthermore, we
numerically demonstrate that the celebrated scaling laws of standard MCT are
preserved in GMCT at all closure levels, and that the predicted critical
exponents manifestly improve as more levels are incorporated in the GMCT
hierarchy. Although formally the GMCT equations should be solved up to infinite
order to reach full convergence, our finite-order GMCT calculations
unambiguously reveal a uniform convergence pattern for the dynamics. We thus
argue that GMCT can provide a feasible and controlled means to bypass MCT's
main uncontrolled approximation, offering hope for the future development of a
quantitative first-principles theory of the glass transition.

of mass between the two systems is additive, in the sense of being a sum of

satisfied on condition that a macroscopic detailed balance condition holds at

property. However, the nonequilibrium chemical potentials of the systems in
contact keep track of the contact dynamics, and thus do not obey an equation of
state. These nonequilibrium chemical potentials can be related either to the

the isolated systems. Results are applied both to an exactly solvable driven

theoretical physics in recent years. It states that certain quantum mechanical
theories can actually be described by classical gravity in one higher
dimension, in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. What makes this
duality so useful is that it relates theories with weak coupling to theories
with strong coupling and thus provides a new tool for tackling strongly coupled
quantum field theories, which are notoriously difficult to handle using
conventional methods. During the course of my PhD I have mostly studied time
dependent processes, in particular thermalization processes, in quantum field
theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the gravity side, this is dual to
dynamical formation of black holes from the collapse of matter fields. By
studying the gravitational collapse process in detail, we can then draw
conclusions about the dynamical formation of a thermal state in the dual
quantum field theory. Using mostly numerical methods, I have studied how
confinement affects thermalization in quantum field theories, where the system
may never thermalize and field theory observables undergo interesting
quasiperiodic behaviour. I have also studied formation of black holes in three
dimensions which due to the simplified nature of three-dimensional gravity can
be done using analytical methods. This has led to the discovery of new
solutions of three-dimensional gravity corresponding to the formation of black
holes without spherical symmetry, which can provide a deeper understanding of
thermalization in two-dimensional quantum field theories. In a third line of
research, I have studied higher spin gravity in three dimensions, an exotic
extension of three-dimensional gravity which includes fields with spin higher
than two, and we outline a new method to construct black hole solutions
carrying higher spin charge.

pleased to receive likes, comments, shares, or, more generally, feedback from

receives to (re-)estimate her followers' preferences and decides which stories
to share next to receive more (positive) feedback. Under which conditions can
she succeed? In this work, we first look into this problem from a theoretical
perspective and then provide a set of practical algorithms to identify and
characterize such behavior in social media. More specifically, we address the
above problem from the viewpoint of sequential decision making and utility
maximization. For a wide variety of utility functions, we first show that, to
succeed, a user needs to actively trade off exploitation-- sharing stories
which lead to more (positive) feedback--and exploration-- sharing stories to
learn about her followers' preferences. However, exploration is not necessary
if a user utilizes the feedback her followers provide to other users in

framework for observation data, which relies on statistical hypothesis testing
to determine whether a user utilizes the feedback she receives from each of her
followers to decide what to post next. Experiments on synthetic data illustrate
our theoretical findings and show that our estimation framework is able to
accurately recover users' underlying utility functions. Experiments on several

  In contrast to learning the complete state transition function, local forward

classify all the ideals of the initial object ${\mathcal{Z}}$ in the category
of wheeled PROPs. We show that non-degenerate sub-wheeled PROPs of ${\mathcal
V}$ are exactly subalgebras of the form ${\mathcal V}^G$ where $G$ is a closed,
reductive subgroup of the general linear group ${\rm GL}(V)$. When $V$ is a
finite dimensional Hilbert space, a similar description of invariant tensors
for an action of a compact group was given by Schrijver. We also generalize the
theorem of Procesi that says that trace rings satisfying the $n$-th
Cayley-Hamilton identity can be embedded in an $n \times n$ matrix ring over a
commutative algebra $R$. Namely, we prove that a wheeled PROP can be embedded
in $R\otimes {\mathcal V}$ for a commutative $K$-algebra $R$ if and only if it
satisfies certain relations.

membranes, micelles, and capsids, a collection of separated subunits
spontaneously binds together to form functional and more ordered structures. In
this work, we study the statistical physics of self-assembly in a simpler
scenario: the formation of dimers from a system of monomers. The properties of
the model allow us to frame the microstate counting as a combinatorial problem
whose solution leads to an exact partition function. From the associated
equilibrium conditions, we find that such dimer systems come in two types:
""search-limited"" and ""combinatorics-limited"", only the former of which has
states where partial assembly can be dominated by correct contacts. Using
estimates of biophysical quantities in systems of single-stranded DNA
dimerization, transcription factor and DNA interactions, and protein-protein
interactions, we find that all of these systems appear to be of the
search-limited type, i.e., their fully correct dimerization regimes are more
limited by the ability of monomers to find one another in the constituent
volume than by the combinatorial disadvantage of correct dimers. We derive the
parameter requirements for fully correct dimerization and find that rather than
the ratio of particle number and volume (number density) being the relevant
quantity, it is the product of particle diversity and volume that is
constrained. Ultimately, this work contributes to an understanding of
self-assembly by using the simple case of a system of dimers to analytically
study the combinatorics of assembly.

comparing observations and predictions by photoionisation models. Higher
metallicities are confirmed for inner regions, although there are important
discrepancies between the diagnostic diagrams. Calibrations based on the N2
index may underestimate inner regions O/H due to the [NII] saturation at solar
metallicities. The degeneracy between the age and ionisation parameter affects
O/H calibrations based on the O3N2 index. Innermost regions have enhanced N/O
ratios, indicating an increase in the slope of the relation between N/O and
O/H. Ionisation parameter calibrations based on the [SII]/H{\alpha} ratio are
not valid for inner regions due to the bivalued behaviour of this ratio with
O/H. Innermost regions have lower [OII]/[OIII] ratios than expected, indicating
a possible non-linear relation between u and Z. Ionising and non-ionising
populations are present in both inner and outer regions. Inner regions show
larger ionising cluster masses that possibly compose star-forming complexes.
Outer regions might be affected by stochastic effects. Equivalent widths
indicate younger ages for outer regions, but degeneracy between evolution and
underlying population effects prevent a quantitative determination. Inner
regions have larger angular sizes, lower filling factors, and larger ionised
hydrogen masses. The confirmed systematic differences between ionising clusters
of inner and outer HII regions condition the validity and range of reliability
of O/H and u calibrations commonly applied to the study of HII regions.

for solving optimization problems that are potentially non-smooth and with hard
constraints. It has been applied to various computer graphics applications,
including physical simulation, geometry processing, and image processing.
However, ADMM can take a long time to converge to a solution of high accuracy.
Moreover, many computer graphics tasks involve non-convex optimization, and
there is often no convergence guarantee for ADMM on such problems since it was
originally designed for convex optimization. In this paper, we propose a method
to speed up ADMM using Anderson acceleration, an established technique for
accelerating fixed-point iterations. We show that in the general case, ADMM is
a fixed-point iteration of the second primal variable and the dual variable,
and Anderson acceleration can be directly applied. Additionally, when the
problem has a separable target function and satisfies certain conditions, ADMM
becomes a fixed-point iteration of only one variable, which further reduces the
computational overhead of Anderson acceleration. Moreover, we analyze a
particular non-convex problem structure that is common in computer graphics,
and prove the convergence of ADMM on such problems under mild assumptions. We
apply our acceleration technique on a variety of optimization problems in
computer graphics, with notable improvement on their convergence speed.

properties of the volume explored by the BRW so far remained elusive, with
exact results limited to one dimension. Here we present analytical results,
supported by numerical simulations, on the scaling of the volume explored by a
BRW in the critical regime, the onset of epidemics, in general environments.
Our results characterise the spreading dynamics on regular lattices and general
graphs, such as fractals, random trees and scale-free networks, revealing the
direct relation between the graphs' dimensionality and the rate of propagation
of the viral process. Furthermore, we use the BRW to determine the spectral
properties of real social and metabolic networks, where we observe that a lack

light from a scene is collapsed along a spatial dimension because of an edge
occluder to yield a 1D video. Deprojection is ill-posed-- often there are many

results, while the decode-and-forward scheme is used in the other band to
transfer the unprocessed tasks. The motivation behind the proposed HR scheme
for RACO is to adapt the allocation of computing and communication resources
both to dynamic user requirements and to diverse computational tasks. Within
this framework, we seek to minimize the weighted sum of the execution delay and
the energy consumption in the RACO system by jointly optimizing the computation
offloading ratio, the bandwidth allocation, the processor speeds, as well as
the transmit power levels of both user $A$ and the MERS, under practical

interaction (HCI) is an essential part of interactive image segmentation.
Nevertheless, publications introducing novel interactive segmentation systems
(ISS) often lack an objective comparison of HCI aspects. It is demonstrated,
that even when the underlying segmentation algorithm is the same throughout
interactive prototypes, their user experience may vary substantially. As a
result, users prefer simple interfaces as well as a considerable degree of
freedom to control each iterative step of the segmentation. In this article, an
objective method for the comparison of ISS is proposed, based on extensive user
studies. A summative qualitative content analysis is conducted via abstraction
of visual and verbal feedback given by the participants. A direct assessment of
the segmentation system is executed by the users via the system usability scale

ever increasing size and complexity of the systems under consideration, pushing
established methods of modeling and simulation towards their limits. This paper
complements existing surveys on large-scale modeling and simulation of physical

in order to investigate research needs, current challenges as well as promising
modeling and simulation paradigms. Furthermore, we applied the analytic
hierarchy process method to prioritise the strengths and weakness of different
modeling paradigms. The results of this study show that experts consider
acausal modeling techniques to be suitable for modeling large scale systems,

distance ladder set tight constraints to the amount and nature of dark matter
(DM). In particular structure formation strongly constraints not only the
amount of energy density, but also the time when DM became non-relativistic,
anr. Standard cold and thermic warm DM particles have a smooth transition from
being relativistic at high energies to a non-relativistic regime since the mass
of these particles is constant while the velocity redshifts with the expansion
of the universe. However, here we explore the possibility that the DM particle
acquires a non-perturbative mass at a phase transition scale and a scale factor
ac. This transition acquired a more fundamental meaning for the Bound Dark
Matter (BDM) model because they describe a particle getting its mass through a
non-perturbative process. These BDM particles may go from being relativistic to
non-relativistic at ac, which implies an abrupt transition of the velocity of
the particles vc at that time, affecting the equation of state and the
cosmological evolution. Here we study the cosmological impact of the values of
vc and the scale transition ac and they by reducing the free-streaming scale
and therefore the small scale structure. Using CMB Plank, Supernovae SNIa, and
BAO data, we constrain the valid region in the parameter space ac-vc putting
upper bounds to ac but not restricting vc. For instance, the transition must be
ac<$2.66\times10^{-6}$ for vc = 0. We also find that the free-streaming and the
Jeans mass of the dark matter particle is highly influenced by the velocity vc,
for example, a 3 keV WDM have a Jeans mass of Mfs=$1.97\times10^7$ Msun/h^3 but
an equivalent BDM with the same anr but an abrupt transition in the velocity,
vc~0 would have a Jeans mass of Mfs=$2.08x10^4$ Msun/h^3 which significantly
changes the large scale structure formation.

classify significantly class-imbalanced clinical data. The data are curated
from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) with the
goal of predicting the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). While the
majority of the existing machine learning models that have been used on this
class of data are vulnerable to class imbalance even after the adjustment of
class-specific weights, our simple two-layer CNN exhibits resilience to the
imbalance with fair harmony in class-specific performance. In order to obtain
significant improvement in classification accuracy under supervised learning
settings, it is a common practice to train a neural network architecture with a
massive data and thereafter, test the resulting network on a comparatively
smaller amount of data. However, given a highly imbalanced dataset, it is often
challenging to achieve a high class 1 (true CHD prediction rate) accuracy as
the testing data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we employ
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature weight
assessment followed by majority-voting based identification of important
features. Next, the important features are homogenized by using a fully
connected layer, a crucial step before passing the output of the layer to
successive convolutional stages. We also propose a training routine per epoch,
akin to a simulated annealing process, to boost the classification accuracy.
Despite a 35:1 (Non-CHD:CHD) ratio in the NHANES dataset, the investigation
confirms that our proposed CNN architecture has the classification power of 77%
to correctly classify the presence of CHD and 81.8% the absence of CHD cases on
a testing data, which is 85.70% of the total dataset. ( (<1920

$CP$-odd (pseudoscalar) component in the top-quark Yukawa coupling. In
particular, the role of the $t{\bar t} h$ center-of-mass rest frame in the
associated production of a top pair and a $h$ boson at the LHC is explored. The
$h$ boson is assumed to have both a $CP$-even (scalar) and a $CP$-odd coupling
to the top quark. The relative strength of the scalar and pseudoscalar
components is regulated by an angle $\alpha$. Observables sensitive to the
nature of the top-quark Yukawa coupling are proposed. These observables are
defined in terms of the transverse and longitudinal projections of $t$,
$\bar{t}$ and $h$ momenta with respect to the beam axis in the $t{\bar t} h$
rest frame. Distributions differential with respect to those observables are
evaluated up to NLO in QCD. These distributions are found to be sensitive to
the $CP$ nature of the coupling. Dileptonic final states of the $t{\bar t} h$
system (with $h\rightarrow b\bar b$) are used, after fast DELPHES detector
simulation and full event reconstruction through a kinematic fit, as a case
study to test the observables' sensitivity to the $CP$ nature of the coupling.
Confidence levels are presented as a function of the total integrated LHC
luminosity for the case of exclusion of a pure $CP$-odd coupling against the
Standard Model $CP$-even hypothesis. By using observables evaluated in the
$t{\bar t} h$ system, the luminosity needed to directly probe the $CP$
properties of the top-quark Yukawa coupling at the High-Luminosity run of the
LHC can be decreased by a few hundred inverse femtobarns, when compared to
analyses that use observables in the laboratory rest frame. In addition,
transverse momentum distributions of the $h$ boson and top quarks are found to
provide no more discriminant power than a counting experiment.

implements a mechanism by which the key sent for unlocking an obfuscated

the key into a dynamically changing license. Third, it protects the

novel mechanisms for the exchange of data to/from COMA protected architectures:
(1) a highly secure but slow double encryption, which is used for exchange of

field strength $B_{\rm S,NS}\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G and mass $\sim 1.4M_\odot$), the
NS as a whole will possibly eventually plunge into the BH. During the inspiral
phase, the spinning BH could be charged to the Wald charge quantity $Q_{\rm W}$
until merger in an electro-vacuum approximation. During the merger, if the
spinning charged BH creates its own magnetosphere due to an electric field
strong enough for pair cascades to spark, the charged BH would transit from
electro-vacuum to force-free cases and could discharge in a time $\gtrsim1~{\rm
ms}$. As the force-free magnetosphere is full of a highly conducting plasma,
the magnetic flux over the NS's caps would be retained outside the BH's event
horizon under the frozen-in condition. Based on this scenario, we here
investigate three possible energy-dissipation mechanisms that could produce
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in a time interval of the BH's discharge post
a BH-NS merger-induced gravitational wave event: (1) magnetic reconnection at
the BH's poles would occur, leading to a millisecond bright EM signal, (2) a
magnetic shock in the zone of closed magnetic field lines due to the detachment
and reconnection of the entire BH magnetic field would probably produce a
bright radio emission, e.g., a fast radio burst, and (3) the Blandford-Znajek
mechanism would extract the BH's rotational energy, giving rise to a
millisecond-duration luminous high-energy burst. We also calculate the
luminosities due to these mechanisms as a function of BH's spin for different
values of $B_{\rm S,NS}$.

sweeping principle, based on the strong maximum principle, applied to the
linearized equation for $u_t$. Our result covers that of Pol\'{a}\v{c}ik and
Yanagida [JDE (2005)] who had further assumed that the solution stays above
some positive radial steady state and $p>p_c$. In contrast, they relied on the
use of similarity variables and invariant manifold ideas. Remarkably, to the
best of our knowledge, a corresponding Liouville property was previously
missing for $p =p_c$. We emphasize that such Liouville type theorems imply the
quasiconvergence of a class of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem.

decoupling via minimal geometric deformation approach. To do so, we impose the
most general equation of state, relating the components of the $\theta$-sector
in order to obtain the new material contributions and the decoupler function
$f(r)$. Besides, we obtain the bounds on the free parameters of the extended
solution to avoid new singularities. Furthermore, we show the finitude of all
thermodynamic parameters of the solution such as the effective density
$\tilde{\rho}$, radial $\tilde{p}_{r}$ and tangential $\tilde{p}_{t}$ pressure
for different values of parameter $\alpha$ and the total electric charge $Q$.
Finally, the behavior of some scalar invariants, namely the Ricci $R$ and
Kretshmann $R_{\mu\nu\omega\epsilon}R^{\mu\nu\omega\epsilon}$ scalars are
analyzed. It is also remarkable that, after an appropriate limit, the deformed
Schwarzschild black hole solution always can be recovered.

X-ray emission in the Chandra campaign observations. Suzaku clearly detects the
diffuse emission above known foreground and background components between 0.4-5
keV at the surface brightness of 3.3x10^-14 erg s^{-1} arcmin^{-2}. The
spectrum requires two plasma emission components with kT~0.2 and 0.5 keV, which
suffer interstellar absorption of N_H~1.9x10^{21} cm^{-2}. Multiple absorption
models assuming two temperature plasmas at ionization equilibrium or
non-equilibrium are tested but there is no significant difference in terms of
chi^2/d.o.f.. These plasma temperatures are similar to those of the central and
eastern parts of the Carina nebula measured in earlier Suzaku observations, but
the surface brightness of the hot component is significantly lower than those
of the other regions. This means that these two plasma components are
physically separated and have different origins. The elemental abundances of O,
Ne and Mg with respect to Fe favor that the diffuse plasma originates from
core-collapsed supernovae or massive stellar winds.

  Transformations in Embedding Space","Accepted to EMNLP 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A notable property of word embeddings is that word relationships can exist as
linear substructures in the embedding space. For example, $\textit{gender}$
corresponds to $\vec{\textit{woman}} - \vec{\textit{man}}$ and
$\vec{\textit{queen}} - \vec{\textit{king}}$. This, in turn, allows word
analogies to be solved arithmetically: $\vec{\textit{king}} -
\vec{\textit{man}} + \vec{\textit{woman}} \approx \vec{\textit{queen}}$. This
property is notable because it suggests that models trained on word embeddings
can easily learn such relationships as geometric translations. However, there
is no evidence that models $\textit{exclusively}$ represent relationships in
this manner. We document an alternative way in which downstream models might
learn these relationships: orthogonal and linear transformations. For example,
given a translation vector for $\textit{gender}$, we can find an orthogonal
matrix $R$, representing a rotation and reflection, such that
$R(\vec{\textit{king}}) \approx \vec{\textit{queen}}$ and
$R(\vec{\textit{man}}) \approx \vec{\textit{woman}}$. Analogical reasoning
using orthogonal transformations is almost as accurate as using vector
arithmetic; using linear transformations is more accurate than both. Our
findings suggest that these transformations can be as good a representation of
word relationships as translation vectors.

Gennes equations self-consistently with the two-dimensional finite element
method. In nano-structured superconductors, the LDOS as a function of the
energy has many discrete peaks. A discretization of the LDOS comes from a
discretization of energy levels due to the quantum confinement effect in
nano-structured systems. When the temperature increases, a width of a peak in
the LDOS is spread to a large energy range and neighbor peaks are superposed
due to the thermal effect. On the other hand, for the fixed temperature, the
behavior of the LDOS is different between nano-scaled rectangular and square
systems. In the nano-scaled rectangular system, when only a lateral length
increases, a contribution of the quantum confinement effect from the lateral
side is suppressed, while the contribution from a longitudinal side remains
large. Then, some peaks are left in the LDOS even when the lateral length is
very large. These peaks form a periodic structure and can be regarded as gaps
in a multi gap structure due to the quantum confinement effect. On the other
hand, energy levels in the square system tend to arrange equally. Then, in the
square system, peaks in the LDOS which exist in the rectangular system are
small. Also, the period between peaks in the LDOS in the square system is
smaller than the period in the rectangular system.

yielded significant improvements on many NLP tasks. However, just how
contextual are the contextualized representations produced by models such as
ELMo and BERT? Are there infinitely many context-specific representations for
each word, or are words essentially assigned one of a finite number of
word-sense representations? For one, we find that the contextualized
representations of all words are not isotropic in any layer of the
contextualizing model. While representations of the same word in different
contexts still have a greater cosine similarity than those of two different
words, this self-similarity is much lower in upper layers. This suggests that
upper layers of contextualizing models produce more context-specific
representations, much like how upper layers of LSTMs produce more task-specific
representations. In all layers of ELMo, BERT, and GPT-2, on average, less than
5% of the variance in a word's contextualized representations can be explained
by a static embedding for that word, providing some justification for the
success of contextualized representations.

an Independent Mechanism (IM) principle was proposed, stating that the

variable have less variation than the anti-causal direction. Existing

completion exploits the existing facts in a KG to discover new ones.
Translation-based embedding model (TransE) is a prominent formulation to do KG
completion. Despite the efficiency of TransE in memory and time, it suffers
from several limitations in encoding relation patterns such as symmetric,
reflexive etc. To resolve this problem, most of the attempts have circled
around the revision of the score function of TransE i.e., proposing a more
complicated score function such as Trans(A, D, G, H, R, etc) to mitigate the
limitations. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a different
perspective. We show that existing theories corresponding to the limitations of
TransE are inaccurate because they ignore the effect of loss function.
Accordingly, we pose theoretical investigations of the main limitations of
TransE in the light of loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this has
not been investigated so far comprehensively. We show that by a proper
selection of the loss function for training the TransE model, the main
limitations of the model are mitigated. This is explained by setting
upper-bound for the scores of positive samples, showing the region of truth
(i.e., the region that a triple is considered positive by the model). Our
theoretical proofs with experimental results fill the gap between the
capability of translation-based class of embedding models and the loss
function. The theories emphasise the importance of the selection of the loss
functions for training the models. Our experimental evaluations on different

inference rules of the form: from a set of clauses $\Gamma$ derive the set of
clauses $\Gamma \cup \{ C \}$ where, due to some syntactic condition, $\Gamma
\cup \{ C \}$ is satisfiable if $\Gamma$ is, but where $\Gamma$ does not
necessarily imply $C$. These inference rules include BC, RAT, SPR and PR
(respectively short for blocked clauses, resolution asymmetric tautologies,
subset propagation redundancy and propagation redundancy), which arose from
work in satisfiability (SAT) solving. We introduce a new, more general rule SR
(substitution redundancy).
  If the new clause $C$ is allowed to include new variables then the systems
based on these rules are all equivalent to extended resolution. We focus on
restricted systems that do not allow new variables. The systems with deletion,
where we can delete a clause from our set at any time, are denoted DBC${}^-$,
DRAT${}^-$, DSPR${}^-$, DPR${}^-$ and DSR${}^-$. The systems without deletion
are BC${}^-$, RAT${}^-$, SPR${}^-$, PR${}^-$ and SR${}^-$.
  With deletion, we show that DRAT${}^-$, DSPR${}^-$ and DPR${}^-$ are
equivalent. By earlier work of Kiesl, Rebola-Pardo and Heule, they are also
equivalent to DBC${}^-$. Without deletion, we show that SPR${}^-$ can simulate
PR${}^-$ provided only short clauses are inferred by SPR inferences. We also
show that many of the well-known ""hard"" principles have small SPR${}^-$
refutations. These include the pigeonhole principle, bit pigeonhole principle,
parity principle, Tseitin tautologies and clique-coloring tautologies.
SPR${}^-$ can also handle or-fication and xor-ification, and lifting with an
index gadget. Our final result is an exponential size lower bound for RAT${}^-$
refutations, giving exponential separations between RAT${}^-$ and both
DRAT${}^-$ and SPR${}^-$.

representation and clustering results due to the sensitivity to noise, hard
constraint on the reconstruction error and pre-obtained approximate
similarities. To improve the representation ability, a novel unsupervised
Robust Flexible Auto-weighted Local-coordinate Concept Factorization (RFA-LCF)
framework is proposed for clustering high-dimensional data. Specifically,
RFA-LCF integrates the robust flexible CF by clean data space recovery, robust
sparse local-coordinate coding and adaptive weighting into a unified model.
RFA-LCF improves the representations by enhancing the robustness of CF to noise
and errors, providing a flexible constraint on the reconstruction error and
optimizing the locality jointly. For robust learning, RFA-LCF clearly learns a
sparse projection to recover the underlying clean data space, and then the
flexible CF is performed in the projected feature space. RFA-LCF also uses a
L2,1-norm based flexible residue to encode the mismatch between the recovered
data and its reconstruction, and uses the robust sparse local-coordinate coding
to represent data using a few nearby basis concepts. For auto-weighting,
RFA-LCF jointly preserves the manifold structures in the basis concept space
and new coordinate space in an adaptive manner by minimizing the reconstruction
errors on clean data, anchor points and coordinates. By updating the
local-coordinate preserving data, basis concepts and new coordinates
alternately, the representation abilities can be potentially improved.
Extensive results on public databases show that RFA-LCF delivers the
state-of-the-art clustering results compared with other related methods.

be synthesized. However, constructing expressive discrete abstractions makes
the synthesis problem computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose a
new sampling-based LTL planning algorithm that does not require any discrete

explore the product state-space, until a maximum number of iterations is
reached or a feasible plan is found. The use of trees makes data storage and

algorithm. To accelerate the construction of feasible plans, we introduce bias
in the sampling process which is guided by transitions in the

networks. The objective is to measure how quickly a fire (e.g., a piece of fake
news) can be spread in a network. The burning process takes place in discrete
rounds. In each round, a new fire breaks out at a selected vertex and burns it.
Meanwhile, the old fires extend to their neighbours and burn them. A burning
schedule selects where the new fire breaks out in each round, and the burning
problem asks for a schedule that burns all vertices in a minimum number of
rounds, termed the burning number of the graph. The burning problem is known to
be NP-hard even when the graph is a tree or a disjoint set of paths. For
connected graphs, it has been conjectured that burning takes at most $\lceil
\sqrt{n} \rceil$ rounds.
  We approach the algorithmic study of graph burning from two directions.
First, we consider graphs with minimum degree $\delta$. We present an algorithm
that burns any graph of size $n$ in at most $\sqrt{\frac{24n}{\delta+1}}$
rounds. In particular, for dense graphs with $\delta \in \Theta(n)$, all
vertices are burned in a constant number of rounds. More interestingly, even
when $\delta$ is a constant that is independent of the graph size, our
algorithm answers the graph-burning conjecture in the affirmative by burning
the graph in at most $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ rounds. Next, we consider burning
graphs with bounded path-length or tree-length. These include many graph
families including connected interval graphs and connected chordal graphs. We
show that any graph with path-length $pl$ and diameter $d$ can be burned in
$\lceil \sqrt{d-1} \rceil + pl$ rounds. Our algorithm ensures an approximation
ratio of $1+o(1)$ for graphs of bounded path-length. We introduce another
algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $2+o(1)$ for burning graphs

near relative equilibria. To overcome the lack of linearization at a relative
equilibrium or the possible non-smoothness of the orbit space, we categorify
the space of equivariant vector fields. A category where the objects are
equivariant vector fields was first introduced by Hepworth in the context of
smooth stacks [Hepworth, Theory Appl. Categ. 22 (2009), 542-587]. Central to
our approach is the ensuing notion of isomorphic equivariant vector fields. The
idea is that considering equivariant vector fields, and their corresponding
dynamics, up to isomorphism is a way to take into account the symmetries of the
group action without passing to the orbit space. In particular, the category of
equivariant vector fields near a relative equilibrium is equivalent to the
category of equivariant vector fields on the slice representation of the
relative equilibrium. In this paper we apply this to bifurcations to and from
relative equilibria, and to the genericity of conditions for equivariant
bifurcation from relative equilibria.

with any factorization $f = f_{1} \cdots f_{r}$ and for $f^{\prime}$ dividing
$f$, we consider a more general type of Bernstein--Sato ideal consisting of the
polynomials $B(S) \in \mathbb{C}[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}]$ satisfying the
functional equation $B(S) f^{\prime} f_{1}^{s_{1}} \cdots f_{r}^{s_{r}} \in
\text{A}_{n}(\mathbb{C})[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}] f_{1}^{s_{1} + 1} \cdots
f_{r}^{s_{r} + 1}.$
  Generalizing techniques due to Maisonobe, we compute the zero locus of the
standard Bernstein--Sato ideal in the sense of Budur (i.e. $f^{\prime} = 1)$
for any factorization of a free and reduced $f$ and for certain factorizations
of a non-reduced $f$. We also compute the roots of the Bernstein--Sato
polynomial for any power of a free and reduced arrangement. If $f$ is tame, we
give a combinatorial formula for the roots lying in $[-1,0).$
  For $f^{\prime} \neq 1$ and any factorization of a line arrangement, we
compute the zero locus of this ideal. For free and reduced arrangements of
larger rank, we compute the zero locus provided $\text{deg}(f^{\prime}) \leq 4$
and give good estimates otherwise. Along the way we generalize a duality
formula for $\mathscr{D}_{X,\mathfrak{x}}[S]f^{\prime}f_{1}^{s_{1}} \cdots
f_{r}^{s_{r}}$ that was first proved by Narv\'aez-Macarro for $f$ reduced,
$f^{\prime} = 1$, and $r = 1.$
  As an application, we investigate the minimum number of hyperplanes one must
add to a tame $f$ so that the resulting arrangement is free. This notion of
freeing a divisor has been explicitly studied by Mond and Schulze, albeit not
for hyperplane arrangements. We show that small roots of the Bernstein--Sato
polynomial of $f$ can force lower bounds for this number.

can also be achieved without retraining(fine-tuning) which is essential in most
NAS methods. These advantages can be achieved by using a reinforcement

designed networks with state-of-the-art performance in 3D medical image

in which an outer expectation is taken with respect to one random variable $Y$

$\theta$. Although the nested (Markov chain) Monte Carlo estimator has been
often used in this context, a root-mean-square accuracy of $\varepsilon$ is
achieved notoriously at a cost of $O(\varepsilon^{-2-1/\alpha})$, where
$\alpha$ denotes the order of convergence of the bias and is typically between
$1/2$ and $1$. In this article we propose a novel efficient Monte Carlo
estimator of EVSI by applying a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Instead
of fixing the number of inner samples for $\theta$ as done in the nested Monte
Carlo estimator, we consider a geometric progression on the number of inner
samples, which yields a hierarchy of estimators on the inner conditional
expectation with increasing approximation levels. Based on an elementary
telescoping sum, our MLMC estimator is given by a sum of the Monte Carlo
estimates of the differences between successive approximation levels on the
inner conditional expectation. We show, under a set of assumptions on decision
and information models, that successive approximation levels are tightly
coupled, which directly proves that our MLMC estimator improves the necessary
computational cost to optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. Numerical experiments
confirm the considerable computational savings as compared to the nested Monte

capacity. Unfortunately, compression techniques either incur tag area overheads

compressed cache blocks without any placement restrictions and tag area
overheads.
  This paper proposes Touch\'e, a framework that enables storing multiple
arbitrary compressed cache blocks within a physical cacheline without any tag
area overheads. The Touch\'e framework consists of three components. The first
component, called the ``Signature'' (SIGN) engine, creates shortened signatures
from the tag addresses of compressed blocks. Due to this, the SIGN engine can
store multiple signatures in each tag entry. On a cache access, the physical
cacheline is accessed only if there is a signature match (which has a
negligible probability of false positive). The second component, called the
``Tag Appended Data'' (TADA) mechanism, stores the full tag addresses with
data. TADA enables Touch\'e to detect false positive signature matches by
ensuring that the actual tag address is available for comparison. The third
component, called the ``Superblock Marker'' (SMARK) mechanism, uses a unique
marker in the tag entry to indicate the occurrence of compressed cache blocks
from neighboring physical addresses in the same cacheline. Touch\'e is
completely hardware-based and achieves an average speedup of 12\% (ideal 13\%)
when compared to an uncompressed baseline.

potential performance speedup from sparsity has not been adequately addressed.
The computation and memory footprint of CNNs can be significantly reduced if
sparsity is exploited in network evaluations. To take advantage of sparsity,
some accelerator designs explore sparsity encoding and evaluation on CNN
accelerators. However, sparsity encoding is just performed on activation or
weight and only in inference. It has been shown that activation and weight also
have high sparsity levels during training. Hence, sparsity-aware computation
should also be considered in training. To further improve performance and
energy efficiency, some accelerators evaluate CNNs with limited precision.
However, this is limited to the inference since reduced precision sacrifices
network accuracy if used in training. In addition, CNN evaluation is usually
memory-intensive, especially in training. In this paper, we propose SPRING, a
SParsity-aware Reduced-precision Monolithic 3D CNN accelerator for trainING and
inference. SPRING supports both CNN training and inference. It uses a binary
mask scheme to encode sparsities in activation and weight. It uses the
stochastic rounding algorithm to train CNNs with reduced precision without
accuracy loss. To alleviate the memory bottleneck in CNN evaluation, especially
in training, SPRING uses an efficient monolithic 3D NVM interface to increase
memory bandwidth. Compared to GTX 1080 Ti, SPRING achieves 15.6X, 4.2X and
66.0X improvements in performance, power reduction, and energy efficiency,
respectively, for CNN training, and 15.5X, 4.5X and 69.1X improvements for
inference.

This phenomenon was recently observed in graphene. Here we investigate a novel
collapse phenomenon when multiple sub- and supercritical charges of equal
strength are put close together as in a molecule. We construct a phase diagram
which consists of three distinct regions: 1) subcritical, 2) frustrated atomic
collapse, and 3) molecular collapse. We show that the single impurity atomic
collapse resonances rearrange themselves to form molecular collapse resonances
which exhibit a distinct quasi-bonding, anti-bonding and non-bonding character.
Here we limit ourselves to a systems consisting of two and three charges. We
show that by tuning the distance between the charges and their strength a high
degree of control over the molecular collapse resonances can be achieved.

ladder connected to two normal metal leads. We focus on the role of the
constituent Majorana fermions and the subgap Andreev states. The double
degeneracy of Majorana fermions of the individual legs of the ladder gets
lifted by a coupling between the two leading to the formation of Andreev bound
states. The coupling can be induced by a superconducting phase difference
between the two legs of the ladder accompanied by a finite inter-leg hopping.
Andreev bound states formed strongly enhance local Andreev reflection. When the
ladder and normal metal are weakly coupled, the Andreev bound states, which are
the controlling factor, result in weak nonlocal scattering. In sharp contrast,
when the ladder - normal metal interface is transparent to electron flow, we
find that the subgap Andreev states enhance nonlocal conductance strongly. The
features in the local and nonlocal conductances resemble the spectrum of the
isolated ladder. Long-range pairing helps lift the degeneracy of the Majorana
modes, makes them less localized, and thus inhibits local transport, while
aiding non-local transport. In particular, long-range pairing alone (without a
superconducting phase difference) can enhance crossed Andreev reflection.

states that $D$ is nowhere vanishing. AS conjecture $2$ (hyperbolic version) is
the stronger statement that $|D(\mathbf{x})| \geq 1$ for any $\mathbf{x} \in

  In this short article, we prove AS conjecture $2$ for hyperbolic convex
coplanar quadrilaterals, that is for configurations of $4$ points in $H^2$ with
none of the points in the configuration lying in the convex hull of the other
three. We also obtain Y. Zhang and J. Ma's result, namely AS conjecture $1$ for

for $|D|$ depending on $n$ only for the natural ``star-based'' variant of the
AS problem, for convex coplanar hyperbolic configurations. The latter result
holds for any $n \geq 2$.
  The proofs for $n=4$ make use of the symbolic library of Python. The proof of
the general result follows from a general formula for the determinant. In all
these cases, $D$ can be expanded as a linear combination of non-negative
rational functions with positive coefficients.

here show that pre-inflationary quantum fluctuations can provide a scenario for

based on the assumption that at very high energies (higher than the energy
scale of inflation) the vacuum-expectation value (VeV) of the field is trapped
in a false vacuum and then, due to renormalization-group (RG) running, the
potential starts to flatten out toward low energy, eventually tending to a
convex one which allows the field to roll down to the true vacuum. We argue
that the proposed mechanism should apply to large classes of inflationary
potentials with multiple concave regions. Our findings favor a particle physics
origin of chaotic, large-field inflationary models as we eliminate the need for
large field fluctuations at the GUT scale. In our analysis, we provide a
specific example of such an inflationary potential, whose parameters can be
tuned to reproduce the existing cosmological data with good accuracy.

Perron-Frobenius type growth of the solution via its projection onto an
associated leading eigenfunction. In [9, 4], further analysis is performed to
understand the implications of this growth both in the stochastic sense, as
well as from the perspective of Monte-Carlo simulation. Such Monte-Carlo
simulations are prevalent in industrial applications, in particular where
regulatory checks are needed in the process of reactor core design. In that
setting, however, it turns out that a different notion of growth takes centre
stage, which is otherwise characterised by another eigenvalue problem. In that
setting, the eigenvalue, sometimes called k-effective (written
$k_\texttt{eff}$), has the physical interpretation as being the ratio of
neutrons produced (during fission events) to the number lost (due to absorption
in the reactor or leakage at the boundary) per typical fission event. In this

disorder. Transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ is a candidate material
that hosts a QSL ground state with spin-1/2 on the two-dimensional perfect
triangular lattice. Here, we performed systematic studies of low-temperature
heat capacity and thermal conductivity on pure, Se-substituted and electron
irradiated crystals of 1T-TaS$_2$. In pure 1T-TaS$_2$, the linear temperature
term of the heat capacity $\gamma T$ and the finite residual linear term of the
thermal conductivity in the zero-temperature limit
$\kappa_{0}/T\equiv\kappa/T(T\rightarrow0)$ are clearly resolved, consistent
with the presence of gapless spinons with a Fermi surface. Moreover, while the
strong magnetic field slightly enhances $\kappa_0/T$, it strongly suppresses
$\gamma$. These unusual contrasting responses to magnetic field imply the
coexistence of two types of gapless excitations with itinerant and localized
characters. Introduction of additional weak random exchange disorder in
1T-Ta(S$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ leads to vanishing of $\kappa_0/T$, indicating that
the itinerant gapless excitations are sensitive to the disorder. On the other
hand, in both pure and Se-substituted systems, the magnetic contribution of the
heat capacity obeys a universal scaling relation, which is consistent with a
theory that assumes the presence of localized orphan spins forming random
singlets. Electron irradiation in pure 1T-TaS$_2$ largely enhances $\gamma$ and
changes the scaling function dramatically, suggesting a possible new state of

terms of ecological and evolutionary processes, and can strongly influence the
species' reaction to climate change. One of the frequently observed features at
range margins is fragmentation, caused internally by population dynamics or
externally by the limited availability of suitable habitat sites. We study both
causes, and describe the transition from a connected to a fragmented state
across space by means of a gradient metapopulation model. The main features of
our approach are the following. 1) Inhomogeneities can occur at two spatial
scales: there is a broad-scale gradient, which can be patterned by fine-scale
heterogeneities. The latter is implemented by dispersing a variable number of
small obstacles over the terrain, which can be penetrable or unpenetrable by
the spreading species. 2) We study the occupancy of this terrain in a
steady-state on two temporal scales: in snapshots and by long-term averages.
The simulations reveal some general scaling laws that are applicable in various
environments, independently of the mechanism of fragmentation. The edge of the
connected region (the hull) is a fractal with dimension 7/4. Its width and
length changes with the gradient according to universal scaling laws, that are
characteristic for percolation transitions. The results suggest that
percolation theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of range
margins in a broad variety of real-life scenarios, including those in which the
environmental gradient is combined with fine-scale heterogeneity. This provides
a new method for comparing the range margins of different species in various
geographic regions, and monitoring range shifts under climate change.

We show that a number of reasonable choices can be made to estimate the
velocities for this event, but that systematic differences remain between these
measurements depending on the data used. This leads to significant changes in
the Hubble constant inferred from GW170817. We present Bayesian Model Averaging
as one way to account for these differences, and obtain
$H_{0}=66.8^{+13.4}_{-9.2}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. Adding additional
information on the viewing angle from high resolution imaging of the radio
counterpart refines this to
$H_{0}=64.8^{+7.3}_{-7.2}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. During this analysis
we also present an alternative Bayesian model for the posterior on $H_{0}$ from
Standard Sirens that works more closely with observed quantities from redshift
and peculiar velocity surveys. Our results more accurately capture the true
uncertainty on the total and peculiar velocities of NGC4993 and show that
exploring how well different datasets characterize galaxy groups and the
velocity field in the local Universe could improve this measurement further.
These considerations impact any low-redshift distance measurement, and the
improvements we suggest here can also be applied to standard candles like type
Ia supernovae. GW170817 is particularly sensitive to peculiar velocity
uncertainties because it is so close. For future standard siren measurements
the importance of this error will decrease as (a) we will measure more distant
standard sirens, and (b) the random direction of peculiar velocities will
average out with more detections.

limitation that training a model requires a large amount of data with
pixel-level annotations. To address this challenging issue, many researchers
give attention to unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.
Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to adapt the model trained on the source
domain to the target domain. In this paper, we introduce a self-ensembling
technique, one of the successful methods for domain adaptation in
classification. However, applying self-ensembling to semantic segmentation is
very difficult because heavily-tuned manual data augmentation used in
self-ensembling is not useful to reduce the large domain gap in the semantic
segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework
consisting of two components, which are complementary to each other. First, we
present a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), which is computationally efficient and effective to facilitate domain
alignment. Given those augmented images, we apply self-ensembling to enhance
the performance of the segmentation network on the target domain. The proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on
unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.

vector, the screened interaction in real space exhibits attractive regions for
certain twist angles near the magic angle. Attractive interactions can induce

correlation phenomena in undoped tBLG. The resulting screened Hubbard

propose a model employing the semantic ranking that holds the first place in
two of the most popular leaderboards for answering multiple-choice questions:
ARC Easy and Challenge. To achieve this, we introduce a self-attention based

  Domain Adaptive One-Stage Object Detection","ICCV 2019 (oral)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning-based object detectors have shown remarkable improvements.
However, supervised learning-based methods perform poorly when the train data
and the test data have different distributions. To address the issue, domain
adaptation transfers knowledge from the label-sufficient domain (source domain)
to the label-scarce domain (target domain). Self-training is one of the
powerful ways to achieve domain adaptation since it helps class-wise domain
adaptation. Unfortunately, a naive approach that utilizes pseudo-labels as
ground-truth degenerates the performance due to incorrect pseudo-labels. In
this paper, we introduce a weak self-training (WST) method and adversarial
background score regularization (BSR) for domain adaptive one-stage object
detection. WST diminishes the adverse effects of inaccurate pseudo-labels to
stabilize the learning procedure. BSR helps the network extract discriminative
features for target backgrounds to reduce the domain shift. Two components are
complementary to each other as BSR enhances discrimination between foregrounds
and backgrounds, whereas WST strengthen class-wise discrimination. Experimental
results show that our approach effectively improves the performance of the
one-stage object detection in unsupervised domain adaptation setting.

Accepted version",,,,"math.NT math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Random integers, sampled uniformly from $[1,x]$, share similarities with
random permutations, sampled uniformly from $S_n$. These similarities include
the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem on the distribution of the number of prime factors of
a random integer, and Billingsley's theorem on the largest prime factors of a
random integer. In this paper we extend this analogy to non-uniform
distributions.
  Given a multiplicative function $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge
0}$, one may associate with it a measure on the integers in $[1,x]$, where $n$
is sampled with probability proportional to the value $\alpha(n)$. Analogously,
given a sequence $\{ \theta_i\}_{i \ge 1}$ of non-negative reals, one may
associate with it a measure on $S_n$ that assigns to a permutation a
probability proportional to a product of weights over the cycles of the
permutation. This measure is known as the generalized Ewens measure.
  We study the case where the mean value of $\alpha$ over primes tends to some
positive $\theta$, as well as the weights $\alpha(p) \approx (\log
p)^{\gamma}$. In both cases, we obtain results in the integer setting which are
in agreement with those in the permutation setting.

be attributed to the strong influence of the pseudogap of the underdoped IP in

the interband bound states may provide several in-gap quasiparticle peaks in

spin flip and pair-hopping Hund interactions can divide one quasiparticle peak
into two peaks, where the splitting energy increases linearly with increasing
$J$. Strong Hund's rule coupling can move the interband doublon-holon pair
excitations outside the Mott gap and restrict the bound states by suppressing
the orbital selectivity of the doubly-occupied and single-hole states.

quality obtainable for AGN using spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting
technique, we tested the capability of machine learning (ML), usually reliable
in computing photo-z for QSO in wide and shallow areas with rich spectroscopic
samples. Using MLPQNA as example of ML, we computed photo-z for the
X-ray-selected sources in Stripe 82X, using the publicly available photometric
and spectroscopic catalogues. Stripe 82X is at least as deep as eROSITA will be
and wide enough to include also rare and bright AGNs. In addition, the
availability of ancillary data mimics what can be available in the whole sky.
We found that when optical, and near- and mid-infrared data are available, ML
and SED fitting perform comparably well in terms of overall accuracy, realistic
redshift probability density functions, and fraction of outliers, although they
are not the same for the two methods. The results could further improve if the
photometry available is accurate and including morphological information.
Assuming that we can gather sufficient spectroscopy to build a representative
training sample, with the current photometry coverage we can obtain reliable
photo-z for a large fraction of sources in the Southern hemisphere well before
the spectroscopic follow-up, thus timely enabling the eROSITA science return.
The photo-z catalogue is released here.

by running a representative set of queries and use the observations to train a

downsides. First, collecting the training data can be very expensive, since all
queries need to be executed on potentially large databases. Second, training
data has to be recollected when the workload and the data changes. To overcome
these limitations, we take a different route: we propose to learn a pure
data-driven model that can be used for different tasks such as query answering
or cardinality estimation. This data-driven model also supports ad-hoc queries
and updates of the data without the need of full retraining when the workload
or data changes. Indeed, one may now expect that this comes at a price of lower
accuracy since workload-driven models can make use of more information.
However, this is not the case. The results of our empirical evaluation

$S(n)= X(1) + \cdots +X(n)$. The corresponding absorbed-reflected walk $W(n), n
\in \mathbb{N}$ in the first quadrant is given by $W(0) = x \in \mathbb{R}_+^2$
and $W(n) = \max \{ 0, W(n-1) - X(n) \}$, where the maximum is taken
coordinate-wise. This is often called the Lindley process and models the
waiting times in a two-server queue. We characterize recurrence of this
process, assuming suitable, rather mild moment conditions on $X$. It turns out
that this is directly related with the tail asymptotics of the exit time of the
random walk $x + S(n)$ from the quadrant, so that the main part of this paper
is devoted to an analysis of that exit time in relation with the drift vector,
i.e., the expectation of $X$.

appendix is one of the most common surgical emergencies. Localizing the
appendix is challenging due to its unclear anatomy amidst the complex
colon-structure as observed in the conventional CT views, resulting in a
time-consuming diagnosis. End-to-end learning of a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is also not likely to be useful because of the negligible size of the
appendix compared with the abdominal CT volume. With no prior computational
approaches to the best of our knowledge, we propose the first computerized
automation for acute appendicitis diagnosis. In our approach, we utilize a
reinforcement learning agent deployed in the lower abdominal region to obtain
the appendix location first to reduce the search space for diagnosis. Then, we
obtain the classification scores (i.e., the likelihood of acute appendicitis)
for the local neighborhood around the localized position, using a CNN trained
only on a small appendix patch per volume. From the spatial representation of
the resultant scores, we finally define a region of low-entropy (RLE) to choose
the optimal diagnosis score, which helps improve the classification accuracy
showing robustness even under high appendix localization error cases. In our
experiment with 319 abdominal CT volumes, the proposed RLE-based decision with
prior localization showed significant improvement over the standard CNN-based
diagnosis approaches.

the properties of its host galaxy. To correctly interpret the spectra of the
afterglow we need to have a good understanding of the foreground interstellar
medium (ISM) in our own Galaxy. The common practice to correct for the
foreground is to use neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the Leiden/Argentina/Bonn
(LAB) survey. However, the poor spatial resolution of the single dish data may
have a significant effect on the derived column densities. To investigate this,
we present new high-resolution HI observations with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) towards 4 GRBs. We combine the interferometric ATCA data
with single dish data from the Galactic All Sky Survey (GASS) and derive new
Galactic HI column densities towards the GRBs. We use these new foreground
column densities to fit the Swift XRT X-ray spectra and calculate new intrinsic
hydrogen column density values for the GRB host galaxies. We find that the new
ATCA data shows higher Galactic HI column densities compared to the previous
single dish data, which results in lower intrinsic column densities for the
hosts. We investigate the line of sight optical depth near the GRBs and find
that it may not be negligible towards one of the GRBs, which indicates that the
intrinsic hydrogen column density of its host galaxy may be even lower. In
addition, we compare our results to column densities derived from far-infrared

superconductivity arising from purely repulsive interactions, and has been
extensively applied to explore a variety of unconventional superconducting
systems. Here we study the evolution of the leading superconducting
instabilities of the single-orbital Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square
lattice as a function of onsite Coulomb repulsion $U$ and band filling by
calculating the irreducible particle-particle scattering vertex obtained from
dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations, and compare the results to
both perturbative Kohn-Luttinger (KL) theory as well as the widely used random
phase approximation (RPA) spin-fluctuation pairing scheme. Near half-filling we
find remarkable agreement of the hierarchy of the leading pairing states
between these three methods, implying adiabatic continuity between weak- and
strong-coupling pairing solutions of the Hubbard model. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
instability is robust to increasing $U$ near half-filling as expected. Away
from half filling, the predictions of KL and RPA at small $U$ for transitions
to other pair states agree with DCA at intermediate $U$ as well as recent
diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. RPA results fail only in the very dilute
limit, where it yields a $d_{xy}$ ground state instead of a $p$-wave state
established by diagrammatic Monte Carlo and low-order perturbative methods, as

Meanwhile, some algorithms, including the semidefinite relaxation algorithm and
projected gradient algorithm, are taken to solve the phase shift problem in the
case of instantaneous channel, and in the statistical channel model, the impact
of phase shift on the overall system is analyzed. However, since beamforming

for when a set system supports an agreement test. Agreement testing is a
certain type of property testing that generalizes PCP tests such as the plane
vs. plane test. Previous work has shown that high dimensional expansion is
useful for agreement tests. We extend these results to more general families of
subsets, beyond simplicial complexes. These include
  - Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are faces of high dimensional
expanders. Our new tests apply to all dimensions of complexes both in case of
two-sided expansion and in the case of one-sided partite expansion. This
improves and extends an earlier work of Dinur and Kaufman (FOCS 2017) and
applies to matroids, and potentially many additional complexes.
  - Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are neighborhoods of vertices in
a high dimensional expander. This family resembles the expander neighborhood
family used in the gap-amplification proof of the PCP theorem. This set system
is quite natural yet does not sit in a simplicial complex, and demonstrates
some versatility in our proof technique.
  - Agreement tests on families of subspaces (also known as the Grassmann
poset). This extends the classical low degree agreement tests beyond the
setting of low degree polynomials.
  Our analysis relies on a new random walk on simplicial complexes which we
call the ``complement random walk'' and which may be of independent interest.
This random walk generalizes the non-lazy random walk on a graph to higher
dimensions, and has significantly better expansion than previously-studied
random walks on simplicial complexes.

dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) is usually dominated by the Debye process. This
process is regarded as a signature of the dynamics of transient supramolecular
structures formed by H-bonding. In phenyl propanols the steric hindrance of the
phenyl ring is assumed to influence chain formation and thereby to decrease or
even suppress the intensity of the Debye process. In the present paper we study
this effect in a systematic series of structural isomers of phenyl-1-propanol
in comparison with 1-propanol. It turns out that by combining BDS, Photon
Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) and calorimetry the dynamics of supramolecular
structures can be uncovered. While light scattering spectra show the same
spectral shape of the main relaxation for all investigated monoalcohols, the
dielectric spectra differ in the Debye contribution. Thus it becomes possible
for the first time to unambiguously disentangle both relaxation modes in the
dielectric spectra. It turns out that the Debye relaxation gets weaker the
closer the position of phenyl ring is to the hydroxy group, in accordance with
the analysis of the Kirkwood-Fr\""ohlich correlation factor. Even in
1-phenyl-1-propanol, which has the phenyl group attached at the closest
position to the hydroxy group, we can separate a Debye-contribution in the
dielectric spectrum. From this we conclude that hydrogen bonds are not
generally suppressed by the increased steric hindrance of the phenyl ring, but
rather an equilibrium of ring and chain-like structures is shifted towards
ring-like shapes on shifting the phenyl ring closer to the hydroxy group.
Moreover, the shape of the alpha-relaxation as monitored by PCS and BDS remains
unaffected by the degree of hydrogen bonding and is the same among the
investigated alcohols.

the solar photovoltaic system with a battery energy storage in Portugal is
unclear in the technical, energetic and mostly in the economical point of view.
The energy generation and consumption management, jointly with the battery
operation, have a great influence in the profitability value of the
configuration. The present work evaluates different photovoltaic configurations
with and without energy storage for the normal low voltage C consumer profile,
for a contracted power of 3.45 kVA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
systems, framed in the regulation in force in Portugal, the decree-law
153/2014, which promotes the micro-generation and self-consumption. The
analysis consists of three different geographical locations in the country,
considering distinct electric tariffs. These are relevant parameters in the
choice of the configuration, concluding that although the solar photovoltaic
system by itself is already economical presently, its integration with battery
energy storage is not in most of the configurations, however it is already
possible to find profitable PV and battery configurations, considering all the
most relevant criteria, and supported by good energy management.

we have proposed a diffusive eco-epidemiological model and performed pattern
formation analysis in the model system. Sufficient conditions for local
asymptotic stability and global asymptotic stability for the constant positive
steady state are obtained by linearization and Lyapunov function technique. A
priori estimate for the positive steady state is obtained for the nonexistence
of the nonconstant positive solution using Cauchy and Poincar\'e inequality.
The existence of the nonconstant positive steady states is studied using
Leray-Schauder degree theory. The importance of the diffusive coefficients
which are responsible for the appearance of stationary patterns is observed.
Pattern formation is done using numerical simulation. Further, the effect of
the cannibalism and disease are observed on the dynamics of the proposed model
system. The movements of prey and susceptible predator plays a significant role
in pattern formation. These movements cause stationary and non-stationary
patterns. It is observed that an increment in the movement of the susceptible
predator as well as cannibalistic attack rate converts non-Turing patterns to
Turing patterns. Lyapunov spectrum is calculated for quantification of stable
and unstable dynamics. Non-Turing patterns obtained with parameter set having
unstable limit cycle are more interesting and realistic than stationary
patterns. Stationary and non-stationary non-Turing patterns are obtained.

branch chiral ring contains nilpotent elements, as can easily be checked in the
case of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with 1 flavour. (2) the Higgs branch as a geometric
space can in general be decomposed into two cones with nontrivial intersection,
the baryonic and mesonic branches. To study the second point in detail we use
the recently developed tool of magnetic quivers for five-brane webs, using the
fact that the classical Higgs branch for theories with 8 supercharges does not
change through dimensional reduction. We compare this approach with the
computation of the hyper-K\""ahler quotient using Hilbert series techniques,
finding perfect agreement if nilpotent operators are eliminated by the
computation of a so called radical. We study the nature of the nilpotent

giving new insights into the vacuum structure of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD. In
addition we demonstrate the power of the magnetic quiver technique, as it
allows us to identify the decomposition into cones, and provides us with the
global symmetries of the theory, as a simple alternative to the techniques that

numerical results from free minimization of a mean-field density functional for
a system of particles interacting via the GEM-4 potential. We show that the
system does indeed display a LIF transition, although the interaction potential
is markedly different from the cases studied before. We also show that one may
consider the (suitably defined) effective density within the potential wells,
$\bar{\rho}_{\text{eff}}$, as a control parameter of LIF, rather than the
amplitude of the external potential as in the common LIF scenario. In the
second part, we suggest a new theoretical description of the onset of LIF which
bases on the pressure balance equation relating the pressure tensor and the
external potential. Evaluating this equation for the modulated liquid phase at
effective density $\bar{\rho}_{\text{eff}}$ and combining it with the (known)
stability threshold of the corresponding bulk fluid, we can predict the
critical effective density or, equivalently, the potential amplitude related to
the onset of LIF. Our approach yields very good results for the model at hand,

a better understanding of galactic structures. Also the general form of the
force law is introduced by which the rotation curve and mass discrepancy of
axisymmetric disks of stars are derived. In addition, it is suggested that the
mass discrepancy as a function of centripetal acceleration becomes significant
near a constant acceleration $ 2c_{1}a_{0} $ where $c_{1}$ is the Neumann
constant and $ a_{0} = 6.59 \times 10^{-10} $ $m/s^{2}$ is a fundamental
acceleration. Furthermore, it is shown that a critical surface density equal to

significant role in rotation curve and mass discrepancy plots. Also, the
specific form of NFW mass density profile at small radii, $ \rho \propto 1/r $,

the torus of the galaxy using the CO(2-1), CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3) lines with
spatial resolutions ~0.03""-0.09""(2-6pc). ALMA resolves the CND as an asymmetric
ringed disk of D~400pc-size and mass of ~1.4x10^8 Msun. The inner edge of the
ring is associated with edge-brightened arcs of NIR polarized emission
identified with the working surface of the AGN ionized wind. ALMA proves the
existence of a molecular torus of M_torus ~ 3x10^5Msun, which extends over a
large range of spatial scales D=10-30pc around the central engine. The new
observations evidence the density radial stratification of the torus: the
HCO+(4-3) torus, with a full size D=11pc, is a factor of 2-3 smaller than its
CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) counterparts, which have full-sizes D=26pc and D=28pc,
respectively. The torus is connected to the CND through a network of gas
streamers. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular
motions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND. These velocity
distortions are interconnected and are part of a 3D outflow that reflects the
effects of AGN feedback on the kinematics of molecular gas across a wide range
of spatial scales. We conclude that a wide-angle AGN wind launched from the
accretion disk is impacting a sizeable fraction of the gas inside the torus
(~0.4-0.6 x M_torus). However, a large gas reservoir (~1.2-1.8 x 10^5Msun)
close to the equatorial plane of the torus remains unaffected by the AGN wind
and can continue fueling the AGN for ~1-4Myr. AGN fueling seems nevertheless
thwarted on intermediate scales (15pc < r < 50pc).

avoid dephasing caused by atom-atom interactions, we measure a $1/e$ time of 30
$\mu$s for the $80S$ state in free expansion. One of the dominant limitations
is the combination of photon recoil and thermal atomic motion at 0.2 $\mu$K. If
the 1064-nm dipole trap is left on, then the $1/e$ time is reduced to 13
$\mu$s, in agreement with a model taking differential light shifts and
gravitational sag into account. To characterize how coherent the retrieved
light is, we overlap it with reference light and measure the visibility $V$ of
the resulting interference pattern, obtaining $V> 90\%$ for short dark time.
Our experimental work is accompanied by a detailed model for the dark-time
decay of the retrieval efficiency of light stored in atomic ensembles. The
model is generally applicable for photon storage in Dicke states, such as in
EIT with $\Lambda$-type or ladder-type level schemes and in
Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller single-photon sources. The model includes a treatment
of the dephasing caused by thermal atomic motion combined with net photon
recoil, as well as the influence of trapping potentials. It takes into account
that the signal light field is typically not a plane wave. The model maps the
retrieval efficiency to single-atom properties and shows that the retrieval
efficiency is related to the decay of fringe visibility in Ramsey spectroscopy
and to the spatial first-order coherence function of the gas.

contributions from damped harmonic oscillators. Each term leads to a maximum in
the imaginary part of the dielectric function at the transversal optical (TO)
resonance frequency of the corresponding oscillator. In contrast, the peak
maxima of the negative imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function are
attributed to the so-called longitudinal optical (LO) oscillator frequencies.
The shapes of the corresponding bands resemble those of the imaginary part of
the dielectric function. Therefore, it seems natural to also employ sums of the
contributions of damped harmonic oscillators to describe the imaginary part of
the inverse dielectric function. In this contribution, we derive the
corresponding dispersion relations to investigate and establish the
relationship between the transversal and longitudinal optical oscillator
strength, which can differ, according to experimental results, by up to three
orders of magnitude. So far, these differences are not understood and prevent
the longitudinal optical oscillator strengths from proper interpretation. We
demonstrate that transversal and longitudinal oscillator strengths should be
identical for a single oscillator and that the experimental differences are in
this case due to the introduction of a dielectric background in the dispersion
formula. For this effect we derive an exact correction. Based on this
correction we further derive a modified Kramers-Kronig sum rule for the
isotropic case as well as for the components of the inverse dielectric function
tensor. For systems with more than one oscillator, our model for the isotropic
case can be extended to yield oscillator strengths and LO resonance wavenumber
for uncoupled LO modes with or without dielectric background...

the internal structure of hydraulic jumps in a shallow water model. The main
purpose of the paper is the study of the vanishing viscosity limit of the
Cauchy problem for this equation. First, we study the properties of the
solution of the regularised problem and then we show that solutions converge to
the entropy solution of the scalar conservation law in this limit in
$C([0,T];L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R}))$ for initial data in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$,

use weak entropy inequalities and the double scale technique of Kruzhkov. Such
techniques also allow to show the $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ contraction of the
regularised problem. For completeness, we study the behaviour in the tail of
travelling wave solutions for genuinely nonlinear fluxes. These waves converge
to shock waves in the vanishing viscosity limit, but decay algebraically as
$x-ct \to \infty$, rather than exponentially, the latter being a behaviour that
they exhibit as $x-ct \to- \infty$, however. Finally, we generalise the results

authors recognized that in general the eigenvalues due not correspond to the
spectrum of a compact operator and hence proposed a modified eigenvalue problem
with the desired properties.
  The present article considers the original and the modified electromagnetic
Stekloff eigenvalue problem. We cast the problems as eigenvalue problem for a
holomorphic operator function $A(\cdot)$. We construct a ""test function
operator function"" $T(\cdot)$ so that $A(\lambda)$ is weakly
$T(\lambda)$-coercive for all suitable $\lambda$, i.e. $T(\lambda)^*A(\lambda)$
is a compact perturbation of a coercive operator. The construction of
$T(\cdot)$ relies on a suitable decomposition of the function space into
subspaces and an apt sign change on each subspace.
  For the approximation analysis, we apply the framework of T-compatible
Galerkin approximations. For the modified problem, we prove that convenient
commuting projection operators imply T-compatibility and hence convergence. For
the original problem, we require the projection operators to satisfy an
additional commutator property involving the tangential trace. The existence
and construction of such projection operators remain open questions.

high-dimensional distributions. However, application of MCMC methods to heavy
tailed distributions and distributions with analytically intractable densities
turns out to be rather problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
towards the use of MCMC algorithms for distributions with analytically known
Fourier transforms and, in particular, heavy tailed distributions. The main
idea of the proposed approach is to use MCMC methods in Fourier domain to
sample from a density proportional to the absolute value of the underlying
characteristic function. A subsequent application of the Parseval's formula
leads to an efficient algorithm for the computation of integrals with respect
to the underlying density. We show that the resulting Markov chain in Fourier
domain may be geometrically ergodic even in the case of heavy tailed original
distributions. We illustrate our approach by several numerical examples
including multivariate elliptically contoured stable distributions.

start with light-head, single-stage, and anchor-free designs, which enable fast

encoding more training samples from annotated boxes plays a similar role as
increasing batch size, which helps enlarge the learning rate and accelerate the

kernels to encode training samples. Besides, we design the initiative sample
weights for better information utilization. Experiments on MS COCO show that
our TTFNet has great advantages in balancing training time, inference speed,
and accuracy. It has reduced training time by more than seven times compared to
previous real-time detectors while maintaining state-of-the-art performances.
In addition, our super-fast version of TTFNet-18 and TTFNet-53 can outperform
SSD300 and YOLOv3 by less than one-tenth of their training time, respectively.

technique the value of alpha_MLT in the 1D stellar evolution code is calibrated
to match the adiabatic specific entropy derived from 3D radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations of stellar convective envelopes, whose effective temperature,
surface gravity, and metallicity are selected consistently along the
evolutionary track. The customary treatment of convection in stellar evolution
models relies on a constant, solar-calibrated alpha_MLT. There is, however,
mounting evidence that this procedure does not reproduce the observed radii of
cool stars satisfactorily. For instance, modelling alpha Cen A and B requires
an ad-hoc tuning of alpha_MLT to distinct, non-solar values. The
entropy-calibrated models of alpha Cen A and B reproduce their observed radii
within 1% (or better) without externally adjusted parameters. The fit is of
comparable quality to that of models with freely adjusted alpha_MLT for alpha
Cen B (within 1 sigma), while it is less satisfactory for alpha Cen A (within ~
2.5 sigma). This level of accuracy is consistent with the intrinsic
uncertainties of the method. Our results demonstrate the capability of the
entropy calibration method to produce stellar models with radii accurate within

redshift interval by means of a multiwavelength sample of galaxies in the
CANDELS GOODS-South, GOODS-North and EGS fields. We use an updated criterion to
extract faint AGNs from a population of NIR (rest-frame UV) selected galaxies
at photometric $z>4$ showing X-ray detection in deep Chandra images available
for the three CANDELS fields. We have collected a photometric sample of 32 AGN
candidates in the selected redshift interval, six of which having spectroscopic
redshifts. Including our COSMOS sample as well as other bright QSO samples
allows a first guess on the shape of the UV luminosity function at $z\sim 4.5$.
The resulting emissivity and photoionization rate appear consistent with that
derived from the photoionization level of the intergalactic medium at $z\sim
4.5$. An extrapolation to $z\sim 5.6$ suggests an important AGN contribution to
the IGM ionization if there are no significant changes in the shape of the UV
luminosity function.

originate from different sensors or algorithms with very different noise and
outlier statistics which are considered during data fusion. 3) Scene denoising

was hypothesized that massive vortices can drive spiral arms in protoplanetary
disks in a way analogous to planets. In this paper, we study the basic
properties of vortex-driven spirals by the Rossby Wave Instability in 2D
hydrodynamics simulations. We study how the surface density contrast, the
number, and the shape of vortex-driven spirals depend on the properties of the
vortex. We also compare vortex-driven spirals with those induced by planets.
The surface density contrast of vortex-driven spirals in our simulations are
comparable to those driven by a sub-thermal mass planet, typically a few to a
few tens of Earth masses. In addition, different from the latter, the former is
not sensitive to the mass of the vortex. Vortex-driven spiral arms are not
expected to be detectable in current scattered light observations, and the
prominent spirals observed in scattered light in a few protoplanetary disks,
such as SAO 206462 (HD 135344B), MWC 758, and LkHa 330, are unlikely to be
induced by the candidate vortices in them.

function of frequency and pump power at various pump frequencies. The phase
response can be explained with the behavior of the non-linear Duffing
oscillator. The observed decrease of the resonance frequency as the pump power
increases, as well as the emergency of an unstable bifurcation zone, are the
characteristic non-linear behavior of the Duffing oscillator. The gain profile
in the stable zone can be explained with a model adapted from the theoretical
model for the two-dimensional gain profile of an impedance-matched
current-pumped JPA. With an appropriate environmental impedance, the
theoretical model captures the features and morphology of the gain profile,
such as the emergence of a gain hot zone with two branches around the resonance
frequency of the JPA. Based on the gain profile, we propose that the best
working zone is the merging point of the two branches of the gain hot zone
before the emergence of the bifurcation zone, which gives a large bandwidth and
a good gain. Over 17dB gain with a bandwidth larger than 300MHz was observed.
The impedance matched JPA is used in our superconducting quantum computers for
improving the fast readout fidelity of the transmon qubits.

on-chip transistor density, power limitations, and number of components, render
modern HPC systems subject to soft errors. Silent data corruptions (SDCs) are
typically caused by such soft errors in the form of bit-flips in the memory
subsystem and hinder the correctness of scientific applications. This work
addresses the problem of protecting a class of iterative computational kernels,
called stencils, against SDCs when executing on parallel HPC systems. Existing
SDC detection and correction methods are in general either inaccurate,
inefficient, or targeting specific application classes that do not include
stencils. This work proposes a novel algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT)
method to protect scientific applications that contain arbitrary stencil
computations against SDCs. The ABFT method can be applied both online and
offline to accurately detect and correct SDCs in 2D and 3D parallel stencil
computations. We present a formal model for the proposed method including
theorems and proofs for the computation of the associated checksums as well as
error detection and correction. We experimentally evaluate the use of the
proposed ABFT method on a real 3D stencil-based application (HotSpot3D) via a
fault-injection, detection, and correction campaign. Results show that the
proposed ABFT method achieves less than 8% overhead compared to the performance
of the unprotected stencil application. Moreover, it accurately detects and
corrects SDCs. While the offline ABFT version corrects errors more accurately,
it may incur a small additional overhead than its online counterpart.

underlying mechanisms for such non-2D/2D interfacing remain largely elusive at

atomic layer deposition (ALD) of the important metal oxide HfO2 on chemical
vapor deposited graphene using atomically resolved and element specific
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). To avoid any deleterious
influence of polymer residues from pre-ALD graphene transfers we employ a
substrate-assisted ALD process directly on the as grown graphene still
remaining on its Cu growth catalyst support. Thereby we resolve at the atomic
scale key factors governing the integration of non-2D metal oxides with 2D
materials by ALD: Particular to our substrate-assisted ALD process we find a
graphene-layer-dependent catalytic participation of the supporting Cu catalyst
in the ALD process. We further confirm at high resolution the role of surface
irregularities such as steps between graphene layers on oxide nucleation.
Employing the energy transfer from the scanning electron beam to in situ
crystallize the initially amorphous ALD HfO2 on graphene, we observe HfO2
crystallization to non-equilibrium HfO2 polymorphs (cubic/tetragonal). Finally
our data indicates a critical role of the graphene's atmospheric adventitious
carbon contamination on the ALD process whereby this contamination acts as an
unintentional seeding layer for metal oxide ALD nucleation on graphene under
our conditions. As atmospheric adventitious carbon contamination is hard to
avoid in any scalable 2D materials processing, this is a critical factor in ALD
recipe development for 2D materials coating. Combined our work highlights
several key mechanisms underlying scalable ALD oxide growth on 2D materials.

independent of the residual function may cause a dramatic increase or numerical
oscillation of the residual. This inherit drawback of the hard thresholding
renders the traditional thresholding algorithms unstable and thus generally
inefficient for solving practical sparse optimization problems. How to overcome
this weakness and develop a truly efficient thresholding method is a
fundamental question in this field. The aim of this paper is to address this
question by proposing a new thresholding technique based on the notion of
optimal $k$-thresholding. The central idea for this new development is to
connect the $k$-thresholding directly to the residual reduction during the
course of algorithms.
  This leads to a natural design principle for the efficient thresholding
methods. Under the restricted isometry property (RIP), we prove that the
optimal thresholding based algorithms are globally convergent to the solution
of sparse optimization problems. The numerical experiments demonstrate that
when solving sparse optimization problems, the traditional hard thresholding
methods have been significantly transcended by the proposed algorithms which
can even outperform the classic $\ell_1$-minimization method in many
situations.

retrieval methods. We present a new approach using unsupervised machine
learning to generate informed priors for retrieval of exoplanetary atmosphere
parameters from transmission spectra. We use principal component analysis (PCA)
to efficiently compress the information content of a library of transmission
spectra forward models generated using the PLATON package. We then apply a
$k$-means clustering algorithm in PCA space to segregate the library into
discrete classes. We show that our classifier is almost always able to
instantaneously place a previously unseen spectrum into the correct class, for
low-to-moderate spectral resolutions, $R$, in the range $R~=~30-300$ and noise
levels up to $10$~per~cent of the peak-to-trough spectrum amplitude. The
distribution of physical parameters for all members of the class therefore
provides an informed prior for standard retrieval methods such as nested
sampling. We benchmark our informed-prior approach against a standard
uniform-prior nested sampler, finding that our approach is up to a factor two
faster, with negligible reduction in accuracy. We demonstrate the application
of this method to existing and near-future observatories, and show that it is
suitable for real-world application. Our general approach is not specific to
transmission spectroscopy and should be more widely applicable to cases that
involve repetitive fitting of trusted high-dimensional models to large data
catalogues, including beyond exoplanetary science.

simple cases where neither method can have substantially increased uncertainty
in between well-separated regions of low uncertainty. We provide strong
empirical evidence that exact inference does not have this pathology, hence it
is due to the approximation and not the model. In contrast, for deep networks,
we prove a universality result showing that there exist approximate posteriors
in the above classes which provide flexible uncertainty estimates. However, we
find empirically that pathologies of a similar form as in the single-hidden

networks. Our results motivate careful consideration of the implications of
approximate inference methods in BNNs.

The housings of the filters have been manufactured using traditional computer

considerations are also discussed, including the integration of dielectric and

implemented by changing the 3D printed parts in the same metallic housing.
Breadboards show fractional bandwidths between 3% and 4.6% with return losses
better than RL=18dB, and spurious free ranges of SFR=1GHz. Insertion losses are
better than IL=4.3dB. Even though dielectric losses from the plastic material
are shown to be high, the measured results are quite satisfactory, thereby
clearly showing that this strategy maybe useful for the fast production of low

dramatically influence the dynamics of fully flexible, ring-shaped polymers in
ways not known for any other polymer architecture or topology. We show that
steady shear leads to an inflation scenario exclusive to ring polymers, which
depends not only on Weissenberg number but also on contour length of the ring.
By analyzing velocity fields of the solvent around the polymer, we show the
existence of a hydrodynamic pocket which allows the polymer to self-stabilize
at a certain alignment angle to the flow axis. This self-induced stabilization
is accompanied by transitioning of the ring to a non-Brownian particle and a
cessation of tumbling. The ring swells significantly in the vorticity
direction, and the horseshoe regions on the stretched and swollen ring are
effectively locked in place relative to the ring's center-of-mass. The observed
effect is exclusive to ring polymers and stems from an interplay between
hydrodynamic interactions and topology. Furthermore, knots tied onto such rings
can serve as additional ""stabilization anchors"". Under strong shear, the
knotted section is pulled tight and remains well-localized while tank-treading
from one horseshoe region to the opposite one in sudden bursts. We find knotted
polymers of high contour length behave very similarly to unknotted rings of the
same contour length, but small knotted rings feature a host of different
configurations. We propose a filtering technique for rings and chains based on
our observations and suggest that strong shear could be used to tighten knots
on rings.

has led to question the appropriateness of Granger causality, especially in its

CCM are able to uncover interactions with surprisingly similar performance, for
predator-prey cycles, 2-species deterministic (chaotic) or stochastic

origin of the KiTS19 challenge. It aims at accelerating the research and
development in this field to aid prognosis and treatment planning by providing
a characterized dataset of 300 CT scans to be segmented. To address the
challenge, we proposed an automatic, multi-stage, 2.5D deep learning-based
segmentation approach based on Residual UNet framework. An ensembling operation
is added at the end to combine prediction results from previous stages reducing
the variance between single models. Our neural network segmentation algorithm
reaches a mean Dice score of 0.96 and 0.74 for kidney and kidney tumors,
respectively on 90 unseen test cases. The results obtained are promising and
could be improved by incorporating prior knowledge about the benign cysts that
regularly lower the tumor segmentation results.

and stars within about 13-80Mjup. While isolated BDs are most likely produced
by gravitational collapse in molecular clouds down to masses of a few Mjup, a
non-negligible fraction of low-mass companions might be formed through the
planet formation channel in protoplanetary disks. The upper mass limit of
objects formed within disks is still observationally unknown, the main reason
being the strong dearth of BD companions at orbital periods shorter than 10
years, a.k.a. the BD desert. To address this question, we aim at determining
the best statistics of secondary companions within the 10-100Mjup range and
within 10 au from the primary star, while minimising observational bias. We
made an extensive use of the RV surveys of FGK stars below 60pc distance to the
Sun and in the northern hemisphere performed with the SOPHIE spectrograph at
the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. We derived the Keplerian solutions of the
RV variations of 54 sources. Public astrometric data of the Hipparcos and Gaia
missions allowed constraining the mass of the companion for most sources. We
introduce GASTON, a new method to derive inclination combining RVs Keplerian
and astrometric excess noise from Gaia DR1. We report the discovery of 12 new
BD candidates. For 5 of them, additional astrometric data led to revise their
mass in the M-dwarf regime. Among the 7 remaining objects, 4 are confirmed BD
companions, and 3 others are likely in this mass regime. We also report the
detection of 42 M-dwarfs within 90Mjup-0.52Msun. The resulting Msin(i)-P
distribution of BD candidates shows a clear drop in the detection rate below
80-day orbital period. Above that limit, the BD desert reveals rather wet, with
a uniform distribution of the Msin(i). We derive a minimum BD-detection

similarity search (e.g., SIFT features), and 2) tag-based image retrieval
(TBIR), which has relied on user tagging (e.g., Flickr tags). CBIR now gains
semantic expressiveness by advances in deep-learning-based detection of visual

informative labels. However, learning-based tagging still yields noisy labels
and is restricted to concrete objects, missing out on generalizations and

textual context of an image or in queries that lead to a click. This paper
addresses the above limitations by semantically refining and expanding the
labels suggested by learning-based object detection. We consider the semantic
coherence between the labels for different objects, leverage lexical and

manifolds is established. Moreover, an elliptic version of this theorem is
obtained. The proof these normal form results is inspired by the
Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction for dynamical systems and by the Kuranishi method
for moduli spaces, and uses a slice theorem for Fr\'echet manifolds as the main
technical tool. As a consequence of this equivariant normal form theorem, the
abstract moduli space obtained by factorizing a level set of the equivariant
map with respect to the group action carries the structure of a Kuranishi
space.
  Moreover, the theory of singular symplectic reduction is developed in the
infinite-dimensional Fr\'echet setting. By refining the above construction, a
normal form for momentum maps similar to the classical
Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg normal form is established. Analogous to the
reasoning in finite dimensions, this normal form result is then used to show
that the reduced phase space decomposes into smooth manifolds each carrying a
natural symplectic structure.
  Finally, the singular symplectic reduction scheme is further investigated in
the situation where the original phase space is an infinite-dimensional
cotangent bundle. The fibered structure of the cotangent bundle yields a
refinement of the usual orbit-momentum type strata into so-called seams. Using
a suitable normal form theorem, it is shown that these seams are manifolds.
Taking the harmonic oscillator as an example, the influence of the seams on
dynamics is illustrated.
  The general results stated above are applied to various gauge theory models.
The moduli spaces of anti-self-dual connections in four dimensions and of
Yang-Mills connections in two dimensions is studied. Moreover, the stratified
structure of the reduced phase space of the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is
investigated in a Hamiltonian formulation.

importance to design simple and intuitive models that can explain their
intrinsic structure and dynamics. These can, for instance, be used to study
networks analytically or to construct networks not observed in real life. Most
models proposed in the literature are of two types. A model can be either
static, where edges are added between a fixed set of nodes according to some
predefined rule, or evolving, where the number of nodes or edges increases over
time. However, some real networks do not grow but rather shrink, meaning that
the number of nodes or edges decreases over time. We here propose a simple
model of shrinking networks called the war pact model. We show that networks
generated in such a way exhibit common structural properties of real networks.
Furthermore, compared to classical models, these resemble international trade,
correlates of war, Bitcoin transactions and other networks more closely.
Network shrinking may therefore represent a reasonable explanation of the
evolution of some networks and greater emphasis should be put on such models in
the future.

rank predictors potentially associated with some trait by the strength of the
association. This approach provides a valuable alternative to the sparsity
framework often used with big data. Most approaches to this problem are
empirical Bayesian, where we use the data to estimate the hyperparameters of
the prior distribution, then use that distribution to estimate the unobserved
parameter values. There are a number of different approaches to this problem,
based on different loss functions for mis-ranking units. Despite the number of
papers developing methods for this problem, there is no work on the consistency
of these methods. In this paper, we develop a general framework for consistency
of empirical Bayesian ranking methods, which includes nearly all commonly used
methods. We then determine conditions under which consistency holds. Given that
little work has been done on selection of prior distribution, and that the loss
functions developed are not strongly motivated, we consider the case where both
of these are misspecified. We show that provided the loss function is
reasonable; the prior distribution is not too light-tailed; and the error in

suffer from computational complexity that increases proportionally to the
number of pre-defined slots that need tracking. This issue becomes more severe
when it comes to multi-domain dialogues which include larger numbers of slots.
In this paper, we investigate how to approach DST using a generation framework
without the pre-defined ontology list. Given each turn of user utterance and
system response, we directly generate a sequence of belief states by applying a
hierarchical encoder-decoder structure. In this way, the computational
complexity of our model will be a constant regardless of the number of
pre-defined slots. Experiments on both the multi-domain and the single domain

the increasing number of pre-defined domains and slots but also reaches the

nonperturbative artefacts associated with the use of intermediate
momentum-subtraction schemes. Our study uses the Highly Improved Staggered
Quark (HISQ) action on gluon field configurations that include $n_f=2+1+1$
flavours of sea quarks, but our results have applicability to other quark
actions. Renormalisation schemes that make use of the exact lattice vector
Ward-Takahashi identity for the conserved current also have renormalisation
factors, $Z_V$, for nonconserved vector currents that are free of contamination
by nonperturbative condensates. We show this by explicit comparison of two such
schemes: that of the vector form factor at zero momentum transfer and the
RI-SMOM momentum-subtraction scheme. The two determinations of $Z_V$ differ
only by discretisation effects (for any value of momentum-transfer in the
RI-SMOM case). The RI$^{\prime}$-MOM scheme, although widely used, does not
share this property. We show that $Z_V$ determined in the standard way in this
scheme has $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ nonperturbative contamination that limits its
accuracy. Instead we define an RI$^{\prime}$-MOM $Z_V$ from a ratio of local to
conserved vector current vertex functions and show that this $Z_V$ is a safe
one to use in lattice QCD calculations. We also perform a first study of vector
current renormalisation with the inclusion of quenched QED effects on the
lattice using the RI-SMOM scheme.

produce radiation - analogously to the way jet planes surpass the speed of
sound and produce a sonic boom. This radiation emission, known as the Cherenkov
effect, is among the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics. As such, it
is used in numerous applications of particle detectors, particle accelerators,
light sources, and medical imaging. Surprisingly, all Cherenkov-based
applications and experiments thus far were fully described by classical
electrodynamics even though theoretical work predicts new Cherenkov phenomena
coming from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum description could provide new
possibilities for the design of highly controllable light sources and more
efficient accelerators and detectors. Here, we provide a direct evidence of the
quantum nature of the Cherenkov effect and reveal its intrinsic quantum
features. By satisfying the Cherenkov condition for relativistic electron
wavefunctions and maintaining it over hundreds of microns, each electron
simultaneously accelerates and decelerates by absorbing and emitting hundreds
of photons in a coherent manner. We observe this strong interaction in an
ultrafast transmission electron microscope, achieving for the first time a
phase-matching between a relativistic electron wavefunction and a propagating
light wave. Consequently, the quantum wavefunction of each electron evolves
into a coherent plateau, analogous to a frequency comb in ultrashort laser
pulses, containing hundreds of quantized energy peaks. Our findings prove that
the delocalized wave nature of electrons can become dominant in stimulated
interactions. In addition to prospects for known applications of the Cherenkov
effect, our work provides a platform for utilizing quantum electrodynamics for
applications in electron microscopy and in free-electron pump-probe
spectroscopy.

the role of outward migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are compared
with the observed exoplanets in terms of masses, semimajor axes, metallicities,

characteristic disk sizes are larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the
disks are more metal-rich and/or their stellar hosts are more massive. Our
model shows that 1) the characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the pebble
isolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase linearly with the mass of its
stellar host, corresponding to one Earth mass around a late M-dwarf star and 20
Earth masses around a solar-mass star. 2) The low-mass planets up to 20 Earth
masses can form around stars with a wide range of metallicities, while massive
gas giant planets are preferred to grow around metal-rich stars. 3) Super-Earth
planets that are mainly composed of silicates, with relatively low water
fractions can form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice line in weakly
turbulent disks where outward migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos
are formed over a wide range of radial distances, the super-Earths would end up
having a distinctive, bimodal composition in water mass. Our model succeeds in
quantitatively reproducing several important observed properties of exoplanets

existence of micropteron traveling waves in the diatomic FPUT lattice in the
limit as the ratio of the two alternating masses approaches 1, at which point
the diatomic lattice reduces to the well-understood monatomic FPUT lattice.
These are traveling waves whose profiles asymptote to a small periodic
oscillation at infinity, instead of vanishing like the classical solitary wave.
We produce these micropteron waves using a functional analytic method,
originally due to Beale, that was successfully deployed in the related long
wave and small mass diatomic problems. Unlike the long wave and small mass
problems, this equal mass problem is not singularly perturbed, and so the
amplitude of the micropteron's oscillation is not necessarily small beyond all
orders (i.e., the traveling wave that we find is not necessarily a nanopteron).
The central challenge of this equal mass problem hinges on a hidden solvability
condition in the traveling wave equations, which manifests itself in the
existence and fine properties of asymptotically sinusoidal solutions (Jost
solutions) to an auxiliary advance-delay differential equation.

analysed thoroughly for power grids, the understanding of multiple failures is
becoming more and more important to prevent large scale outages with an
increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. In this publication, we
examine the collective nature of the simultaneous failure of several
transmission elements. In particular, we focus on the difference between single
transmission element failures and the collective failure of several elements.
We demonstrate that already for two concurrent failures, the simultaneous
outage can lead to an inversion of the direction of flow as compared to the two
individual failures and find situations where additional outages may be
beneficial for the overall system. In addition to that, we introduce a
quantifier that performs very well in predicting if two outages act strongly
collectively or may be treated as individual failures mathematically. Finally,
we extend on recent progress made on the understanding of single link failures
demonstrating that multiple link failures may be treated as superpositions of
multiple electrical dipoles for lattice-like networks with collective effects
completely vanishing in the continuum limit. Our results demonstrate that the
simultaneous failure of multiple lines may lead to unexpected effects that
cannot be easily described using the theoretical framework for single link
failures.

Despite the significant advancement in describing spreading processes in

many features of the underlying mechanisms require further understanding. Here,
we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model
with a force-field obtained from the statistical associating fluid theory to
study droplets laden with common and superspreading surfactants. We have
confirmed the important elements of the superspreading mechanism, i.e. the
adsorption of surfactant at the contact line and the fast replenishment of
surfactant from the bulk. Through a detailed comparison of a range of droplets
with different surfactants, our analysis has indicated that the ability of
surfactant to adsorb at the interfaces is the key feature of the superspreading
mechanism. To this end, surfactants that tend to form aggregates and have a
strong hydrophobic attraction in the aggregated cores prevent the fast
replenishment of the interfaces, resulting in reduced spreading ability. We
also show that various surfactant properties, such as diffusion and
architecture, play a secondary role in the spreading process. Moreover, we
discuss various drop properties such as the height, contact angle, and
surfactant surface concentration, highlighting differences between
superspreading and common surfactants. We anticipate that our study will
provide further insight for applications requiring the control of wetting.

debris threats on-orbit is expected to be an important approach and we will
analyze the latest vision algorithms to perform the detection, followed by
quick reaction control systems to perform the avoidance. Alternately there may
be scenarios where the debris is too small to track and avoid. In this case,
the spacecraft will need passive mitigation measures to survive the impact.

rigid (`global') symmetry lie at the foundations of gauge theory. When the
rigid symmetry is extended to a {\it local} one, a so-called gauge symmetry, a
new interaction emerges as gauge potential $A$; its field strength is $F\sim
{\rm curl} A$. In gravity, the conservation of the energy-momentum current of
matter and the rigid translation symmetry in the Minkowski space of special
relativity lie at the foundations of a gravitational gauge theory. If the
translation invariance is made local, a gravitational potential $\vartheta$
arises together with its field strength $T\sim {\rm curl}\,\vartheta$. Thereby
the Minkowski space deforms into a Weitzenb\""ock space with nonvanishing
torsion $T$ but vanishing curvature. The corresponding theory is reviewed and
its equivalence to general relativity pointed out. Since translations form a
subgroup of the Poincar\'e group, the group of motion of special relativity,
one ought to straightforwardly extend the gauging of the translations to the
gauging of full Poincar\'e group thereby also including the conservation law of
the {\it angular momentum} current. The emerging Poincar\'e gauge (theory of)
gravity, starting from the viable Einstein-Cartan theory of 1961, will be
shortly reviewed and its prospects for further developments assessed.

prediction has recently attracted widespread research interest in the field of
artificial intelligence (AI) with the increasing availability of massive
traffic mobility data. Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse
factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the
evolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified
neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can
effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow
with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two
progressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM
\cite{xingjian2015convolutional}) units connected with a convolutional layer.
Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as
input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into
the connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The
second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal
representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further,
we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide
short-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential
and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments
on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of
our method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger
pickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.

finite subgroup acting transitively on $t_{1},t_{2},\cdots ,t_{n}$ in an

  Applications -- A Mapping Study","21 pages",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Across different domains, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used
more and more in safety-critical applications in which erroneous outputs of
such ANN can have catastrophic consequences. However, the development of such
neural networks is still immature and good engineering practices are missing.
With that, ANNs are in the same position as software was several decades ago.
Today, standards for functional safety, such as ISO 26262 in the automotive
domain, require the application of a collection of proven engineering
principles and methods in the creation of software to increase its quality and
reduce failure rates to an acceptable level. Objective: In the future, such a
set of proven engineering methods needs to be established for the development
of Artificial Neural Networks to allow their use in safety-critical
applications. Method: This work takes a step in this direction by conducting a
mapping study to extract challenges faced in the development of ANNs for
safety-critical applications and to identify methods that have been used for
the hardening of ANNs in such settings. Results: We extracted ten different
challenges found to be repeatedly reported in the literature regarding the use
of ANNs in critical contexts. All of these challenges are addressed by
engineering methods, of which we identified 54 in our study that can be used
for the hardening of networks. Conclusions: Various methods have been proposed
to overcome the specific challenges of using ANNs in safety-critical
applications. On the path towards defining best practices, we envision that
future software engineering will need to focus on further investigating these
methods and increasing the maturity and understanding of existing approaches,
with the goal to develop clear guidance for proper engineering of high-quality
ANNs.

based initially upon the more abstract grounds of mathematical aesthetics, here
we describe a unified theory motivated conceptually through an elementary
generalisation of the expression for a local proper time interval, beyond that
of 4-dimensional spacetime and also beyond that of the local structure of
models with extra spatial dimensions, for which the explicit mathematical
development naturally incorporates the octonion algebra as an essential
feature. Properties of matter are identified directly through the symmetry
breaking structure entailed in the necessary extraction of the external
4-dimensional spacetime background and are shown to reproduce a series of
characteristic structures of the Standard Model of particle physics. While
already employing octonion-based constructions of the exceptional Lie groups E6

reinforced classifier for improving the generalization under a few available

proposed classifier uses a generalization-feedback from a subset of the

cross-entropy loss about the training data. We evaluate the improvement of the
proposed classifier by applying it on three different classification problems
against the standard deep classifiers equipped with existing
overfitting-prevention techniques. Besides an overall improvement in
classification performance, the proposed classifier showed remarkable
characteristics of generalized learning, which can have great potential in
medical classification tasks.

then assess the feasibility of using angle information from multiple fixed
receivers to determine the position of a device. Our results reveal that
angular detection is limited to a restricted range. On the other hand, even in
a simple deployment with only two antennas per receiver, the AoA-based

localization within a few centimeters remains a difficult endeavor. We then
demonstrate that a malicious device may be able to easily alter the
