the incomplete information setting, which plays a critical role in ranking and
training of agents. Traditionally, researchers have relied on Elo ratings for
this purpose, with recent works also using methods based on Nash equilibria.
Unfortunately, Elo is unable to handle intransitive agent interactions, and
other techniques are restricted to zero-sum, two-player settings or are limited
by the fact that the Nash equilibrium is intractable to compute. Recently, a
ranking method called {\alpha}-Rank, relying on a new graph-based
game-theoretic solution concept, was shown to tractably apply to general games.
However, evaluations based on Elo or {\alpha}-Rank typically assume noise-free
game outcomes, despite the data often being collected from noisy simulations,
making this assumption unrealistic in practice. This paper investigates
multiagent evaluation in the incomplete information regime, involving
general-sum many-player games with noisy outcomes. We derive sample complexity
guarantees required to confidently rank agents in this setting. We propose
adaptive algorithms for accurate ranking, provide correctness and sample
complexity guarantees, then introduce a means of connecting uncertainties in
noisy match outcomes to uncertainties in rankings. We evaluate the performance
of these approaches in several domains, including Bernoulli games, a soccer
meta-game, and Kuhn poker.

spectroscopy (resolving power $R = 28$,000) of 13 young intermediate-mass stars
in the Taurus star-forming region. Based on the presence of near- and
mid-infrared continuum emission, young intermediate-mass stars can be
classified into three different evolutionary stages: Phases I, II, and III in
the order of evolution. Our obtained spectra ($\lambda = 0.91$--1.35\,$\mu$m)
depict \HeI $\lambda$10830 and P$\beta$ lines that are sensitive to
magnetospheric accretion and winds. We also investigate five sources each for
P$\beta$ and \ion{He}{1} lines that were obtained from previous studies along
with our targets. We observe that the P$\beta$ profile morphologies in Phases I
and II corresponded to an extensive variety of emission features; however,
these features are not detected in Phase III. We also observe that the He I
profile morphologies are mostly broad subcontinuum absorption lines in Phase I,
narrow subcontinuum absorption lines in Phase II, and centered subcontinuum
absorption features in Phase III. Our results indicate that the profile
morphologies exhibit a progression of the dominant mass flow processes: stellar
wind and probably magnetospheric accretion in the very early stage,
magnetospheric accretion and disk wind in the subsequent stage, and no
activities in the final stage. These interpretations further suggest that
opacity in protoplanetary disks plays an important role in mass flow processes.
Results also indicate that \ion{He}{1} absorption features in Phase III
sources, associated with chromospheric activities even in such young phases,
are characteristics of intermediate-mass stars.

communication systems with large antenna arrays because the analog beamforming

indirect access by the baseband processing to the communication channels and
due to low SNR before beam alignment. Compressed sensing (CS) based algorithms
have been adopted to address these challenges by leveraging the sparse nature

algorithms for narrowband CE, the hybrid beamformers are randomly configured

beamforming into analog and digital stages can provide the large reduction in
power consumption and small loss in spectral efficiency needed for practical
implementations. Developing algorithms with this favorable tradeoff is
challenging due to the additional degrees of freedom in the analog stage and
its accompanying hardware constraints. In hybrid beamforming systems, for
example, channel estimation algorithms do not directly observe the channels,
face a high channel count, and operate at low SNR before transmit-receive beam

compressed sensing (CS) channel estimation algorithms have been developed that
randomly configure the analog beamformers, digital beamformers, and/or pilot

pilot symbols for open-loop channel estimation. We use CS approaches that rely
on low coherence for their recovery guarantees, and hence seek to minimize the
mutual coherence of the compressed sensing matrix. We also propose a precoder
column ordering to design the pilot symbols. Simulation results show that our

has a relatively low thermal inertia of $\Gamma=110 _{-12}^{+40}\rm~J m^{-2}

effective diameter are then constrained to be $p_v=0.095_{-0.003}^{+0.016}$ and
$D_{\rm eff}=431_{-33}^{+6}\rm~m$, respectively. The low thermal inertia
indicates that 2008 EV5 may have undergone sufficient space weathering over
secular evolution. The high roughness may have resemblances to the appearances
of Bennu and Ryugu recently observed by spacecrafts, where a great number of
boulders are widely distributed on the asteroid's surface. Moreover, we
numerically perform 1000 backward simulations of 2008 EV5's cloned orbits

unlikely to find water ice on most area of 2008 EV5, but there may exist water

been shown that in the limit when the transverse size of a rigid beam is
greater than the longitudinal extension, the wake wave acquires purely an
electrostatic form and the simulation results show a good agreement with the
1-D results given by Ratan et al. [Phys. Plasmas, 22, 073109 (2015)]. In the
other limit, when the transverse dimensions are equal or smaller than the
longitudinal extension, the wake waves are electromagnetic in nature.
Furthermore, a linear theoretical analysis of 2-D wakefields for a rigid
bi-parabolic beam has also been done and compared with the simulations. It has
also been shown that the transformer ratio which a key parameter that measures
the efficiency in the process of acceleration, becomes higher for a 2-D system
(i.e. for a beam having a smaller transverse extension compared to longitudinal
length) than the 1-D system (beam having larger transverse extension compared
to longitudinal length). Furthermore, including the self-consistent evolution
of the driver beam in the simulation, we have seen that the beam propagating
inside the plasma undergoes the transverse pinching which occurs much earlier

dimensions in the system the 1-D rigidity limit given by Tsiklauri et al.

absenteeism. While the demand uncertainty is exogenous (stemming from the
random patient census), the absenteeism uncertainty is \emph{endogenous}, i.e.,
the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse
staffing level. For quality of care, many hospitals have developed float pools,
i.e., groups of hospital units, and trained nurses to be able to work in
multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortage.
In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model
that considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. We derive a
separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float
pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in
practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear

these connections, we develop two new blocks for relational learning on sets:
the set-denoising block and the set-residual block. The former is motivated by
the connection between message passing on general graphs and diffusion-based
denoising models, whereas the latter is inspired by the well-known residual
network. In addition to demonstrating the interpretability of our model by
learning the true underlying relational structure experimentally, we also show
the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets by
achieving results that are competitive with or outperform the state-of-the-art.

the presently undetermined scale of spontaneous breaking of Peccei-Quinn

all $T$. We obtain $\chi(T)$ by using quark condensates calculated in two

correct chiral behavior, including the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry
and its restoration at high $T$. This is reflected in the $U_A(1)$ symmetry
breaking and restoration through $\chi(T)$. In our previous studies, such
$\chi(T)$ yields the $T$-dependence of the $U_A(1)$-anomaly-influenced masses

the so called strong form of Boyland's Conjecture on the closed annulus: Assume
$f$ is a homeomorphism of $\overline{\mathbb{A}}:=(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})\times
[0,1]$ which is isotopic to the identity and preserves a Borel probability
measure $\mu$ with full support. We prove that if the rotation set of $f$ is a

endpoint of this segment. We also study the case of homeomorphisms such that
$\mathbb{A}=(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})\times (0,1)$ is a region of instability of
$f$. We show that, if the rotation numbers of the restriction of $f$ to the
boundary components lies in the interior of the rotation set of $f$, then $f$
has uniformly bounded deviations from its rotation set. Finally, by combining
this last result and recent work on realization of rotation vectors for annular

given by sample points, as a linear combination of as few elementary components

dictionary, from where the elementary components are selected. The success in
sparsely representing an ECG record depends on the nature of the dictionary
being considered. In this paper we focus on the construction of different
families of wavelet dictionaries, which are appropriate for the purpose of
reducing dimensionality of ECG signals through sparse representation modelling.
The suitability of wavelet dictionaries for ECG modelling, applying the
Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit approach for the selection process, was
demonstrated in a previous work on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database consisting
of 48 records each of which of 30 min length. This paper complements the
previous one by presenting the technical details, methods, algorithms, and
MATLAB software facilitating the construction of different families of wavelet
dictionaries. The implementation allows for straightforward further extensions
to include additional wavelet families. The sparsity in the representation of
an ECG record significantly improves in relation to the sparsity produced by
the corresponding wavelet basis. This result holds true for the 17 wavelet
families considered here.

be one of the most widely used algorithms for efficient depth estimation,

However, SGM only models a first-order smoothness assumption, thus favoring
fronto-parallel surfaces. In this work, we present a hierarchical algorithm

confidence measures for each estimate. Our algorithm relies on a plane-sweep
multi-image matching followed by an extended SGM optimization that allows to
incorporate local surface orientations, thus achieving more consistent and

solve difficult partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problems
which impair temporal difference (TD)-based RL algorithms such as DQN, as the
TD error cannot be easily derived from observations. The key idea is to use a
Hebbian network with bio-inspired neural traces in order to bridge temporal
delays between actions and rewards when confounding observations and sparse
rewards result in inaccurate TD errors. In MOHQA, DQN learns low level features
and control, while the MOHN contributes to the high-level decisions by
associating rewards with past states and actions. Thus the proposed
architecture combines two modules with significantly different learning
algorithms, a Hebbian associative network and a classical DQN pipeline,
exploiting the advantages of both. Simulations on a set of POMDPs and on the
MALMO environment show that the proposed algorithm improved DQN's results and
even outperformed control tests with A2C, QRDQN+LSTM and REINFORCE algorithms
on some POMDPs with confounding stimuli and sparse rewards.

a more informative model than the currently popular simple and attribute

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response
to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used
extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control
assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic
devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize
multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description
are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed
various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the
performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this
paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw
EMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the
feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature
description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end
optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our
approach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with TensorFlow deep
learning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics
processing units of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate
the ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw EMG signals. We
anticipate our EMG-based control system to be a starting point to design more
sophisticated prosthetic hands. For example, a pressure measurement unit can be
added to transfer the perception of the environment to the user. Furthermore,
our system can be modified for other prosthetic devices.

quasi-periodically forced systems with a degenerate fixed points. The same
questions were answered in \cite{ss18} using two versions of KAM theory.
  Our method is based on reformulating the existence of response solutions as a
fixed point problem in appropriate spaces of smooth functions. By algebraic
manipulations, the fixed point problem is transformed into a contraction.
  Compared to the KAM method, the present method does not incur a loss of
regularity. That is, the solutions we obtain have the same regularity as the
forcing. Moreover, the method here applies when problems are only finitely
differentiable. It also weakens slightly the non-degeneracy conditions. Since
the method is based on the contraction mapping principle, we also obtain
automatically smooth dependence on parameters and, when studying complex
versions of the problem we discover the new phenomenon of monodromy. We also
present results for higher dimensional systems, but for higher dimensional
systems, the concept of degenerate fixed points is much more subtle than in one
dimensional systems.
  To illustrate the power of the method, we also consider two problems not
studied in \cite{ss18}: the forcing with zero average and second order
oscillators. We show that in the zero average forcing case, the solutions are
qualitatively different, but the second order oscillators is remarkably
similar.

achieving greater fuel economy, engine efficiency, and reduced emissions. In
order to achieve continuously optimal engine operation, engine calibration
methods use a combination of static correlations obtained from dynamometer
tests for steady-state operating points and road and/or track performance data.
As the parameter space of control variables, design variable constraints, and
objective functions increases, the cost and duration for optimal calibration
become prohibitively large. In order to reduce the number of dynamometer tests
required for calibrating modern engines, a large-scale simulation-driven
machine learning approach is presented in this work. A parallel, fast, robust,
physics-based reduced-order engine simulator is used to obtain performance and
emission characteristics of engines over a wide range of control parameters
under various transient driving conditions (drive cycles). We scale the
simulation up to 3,906 nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility to generate data required to train a machine
learning model. The trained model is then used to predict various engine
parameters of interest. Our results show that a deep-neural-network-based
surrogate model achieves high accuracy for various engine parameters such as
exhaust temperature, exhaust pressure, nitric oxide, and engine torque. Once
trained, the deep-neural-network-based surrogate model is fast for inference:
it requires about 16 micro sec for predicting the engine performance and

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations towards the star-forming
region IRAS 01123+6430 using VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) to
measure its annual parallax and proper motion. The annual parallax was measured
to be 0.151+/-0.042 mas, which corresponds to a distance of
D=6.61^{+2.55}_{-1.44} kpc, and the obtained proper motion components were
({\mu}_{\alpha}cos{\delta}, {\mu}_{\delta})=(-1.44+/-0.15, -0.27+/-0.16) mas
yr^{-1} in equatorial coordinates. Assuming Galactic constants of (R_0,
{\Theta}_0)=(8.05+/-0.45 kpc, 238+/-14 km s^{-1}), the Galactocentric distance
and rotation velocity were measured to be (R, {\Theta})=(13.04+/-2.24 kpc,
239+/-22 km s^{-1}), which are consistent with a flat Galactic rotation curve.
The newly estimated distance provides a more accurate bolometric luminosity of
the central young stellar object, L_Bol=(3.11+/-2.86)\times 10^3 L_solar, which
corresponds to a spectral type of B1-B2. The analysis of 12CO(J=1-0) survey
data obtained with the Five College Radio Astronomical Observatory (FCRAO) 14 m
telescope shows that the molecular cloud associated with IRAS 01123+6430
consists of arc-like and linear components, which well matches a structure
predicted by numerical simulation of the cloud-cloud collision (CCC)
phenomenon. The coexistence of arc-like and linear components implies that the
relative velocity of initial two clouds was as slow as 3-5 km s^{-1}, which
meets the expected criteria of massive star formation where the core mass is
effectively increased in the presence of low relative velocity (~3-5 km
s^{-1}), as suggested by Takahira et al.(2014).

specifically friendly to mobile devices with limited power capacity and

approximate the floating-point information using a set of discrete values,
which we call value approximation, typically assuming the same architecture as
the full-precision networks. Here we take a novel ""structure approximation""
view of quantization -- it is very likely that different architectures designed
for low-bit networks may be better for achieving good performance. In
particular, we propose a ""network decomposition"" strategy, termed Group-Net, in
which we divide the network into groups. Thus, each full-precision group can be
effectively reconstructed by aggregating a set of homogeneous binary branches.
In addition, we learn effective connections among groups to improve the
representation capability. Moreover, the proposed Group-Net shows strong
generalization to other tasks. For instance, we extend Group-Net for accurate
semantic segmentation by embedding rich context into the binary structure.
Furthermore, for the first time, we apply binary neural networks to object
detection. Experiments on both classification, semantic segmentation and object

applied to solve the kinematic equations of major attitude parameters,

Specifically, the mainstream algorithms, which have relied on the simplified

calculation of high-order derivatives. The functional iterative integration
approach is respectively implemented on both the normal polynomial and the
Chebyshev polynomial. Numerical results under the classical coning motion are
reported to assess all derived attitude algorithms. It is revealed that in the
relative frequency range when the coning to sampling frequency ratio is below
0.05-0.1 (depending on the chosen polynomial truncation order), all algorithms
have the same order of accuracy if the same number of samples are used to fit
the angular velocity over the iteration interval; in the range of higher

excellent numerical stability and powerful functional representation capability

followers are to asymptotically reach a predetermined consensus state. To
guarantee the stability of the switched system and the consensus of the
followers, we derive maximum and minimal dwell-time conditions to constrain the
intervals between consecutive time instants at which the leader should provide

satisfy practical constraints such as charging its battery and staying in
specific regions of interest. Both the maximum and minimum dwell-time
conditions and these practical constraints can be expressed by metric temporal

suggests that the spatial nonlocal interactions cannot be ruled out of the
turbulence physics. Furthermore, filtering the Navier-Stokes equations in the
large eddy simulation of turbulent flows would further enhance the existing
nonlocality, emerging in the corresponding subgrid scale fluid motions. That
urges the development of new nonlocal closure models, which respect the
corresponding non-Gaussian statistics of the subgrid stochastic motions. To
this end and starting from the filtered Boltzmann equation, we model the
corresponding equilibrium distribution function with a \textit{L\'evy}-stable
distribution, leading to the proposed fractional-order modeling of
subgrid-scale stresses. We approximate the filtered equilibrium distribution
function with a power-law term, and derive the corresponding filtered
Navier-Stokes equations. Subsequently in our functional modeling, the
divergence of subgrid-scale stresses emerges as a single-parameter fractional
Laplacian, $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}(\cdot)$, $\alpha \in (0,1]$, of the filtered
velocity field. The only model parameter, i.e., the fractional exponent,
appears to be strictly depending on the filter-width and the flow Reynolds
number. We furthermore explore the main physical and mathematical properties of
the proposed model under a set of mild conditions. Finally, the introduced

models and an active interest in generating stylized text, we present an
approach to leverage the generalization capabilities of a language model to
rewrite an input text in a target author's style. Our proposed approach adapts
a pre-trained language model to generate author-stylized text by fine-tuning on
the author-specific corpus using a denoising autoencoder (DAE) loss in a
cascaded encoder-decoder framework. Optimizing over DAE loss allows our model
to learn the nuances of an author's style without relying on parallel data,
which has been a severe limitation of the previous related works in this space.
To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we propose a linguistically-motivated
framework to quantify stylistic alignment of the generated text to the target
author at lexical, syntactic and surface levels. The evaluation framework is
both interpretable as it leads to several insights about the model, and
self-contained as it does not rely on external classifiers, e.g. sentiment or
formality classifiers. Qualitative and quantitative assessment indicates that
the proposed approach rewrites the input text with better alignment to the
target style while preserving the original content better than state-of-the-art
baselines.

Based on different geometric phases, various quantum gates have been proposed,
such as nonadiabatic geometric gates based on nonadiabatic Abelian geometric
phases and nonadiabatic holonomic gates based on nonadiabatic non-Abelian
geometric phases. Up to now, nonadiabatic holonomic one-qubit gates have been
experimentally demonstrated with the supercondunting transmon, where three
lowest levels with cascaded configuration are all applied in the operation.
However, the second excited states of transmons have relatively short coherence
time, which results in a lessened fidelity of quantum gates. Here, we
experimentally realize Abelian-geometric-phase-based nonadiabatic geometric
one-qubit gates with a superconducting Xmon qubit. The realization is performed
on two lowest levels of an Xmon qubit and thus avoids the influence from the
short coherence time of the second excited state. The experimental result
indicates that the average fidelities of single-qubit gates can be up to 99.6%

cross-correlation function of the scattered intensity distribution on a
two-dimensional (2D) detector and further averaging over many diffraction
patterns for enhancement of the anisotropic signal. Over the last decade, AXCCA
was successfully used to study the anisotropy in various soft matter systems,
such as solutions of anisometric particles, liquid crystals, colloidal

multi-modality, still pose a challenge for generative adversarial networks
(GANs). Recent research shows that progressive training (ProGAN) and mapping
network extensions (StyleGAN) enable both increased training stability for
higher dimensional problems and better feature separation within the embedded
latent space. However, these architectures leave limited control over shaping
the output of the network, which is an undesirable trait in the case of logo
synthesis. This paper explores a conditional extension to the StyleGAN
architecture with the aim of firstly, improving on the low resolution results
of previous research and, secondly, increasing the controllability of the
output through the use of synthetic class-conditions. Furthermore, methods of
extracting such class conditions are explored with a focus on the human
interpretability, where the challenge lies in the fact that, by nature, visual
logo characteristics are hard to define. The introduced conditional style-based
generator architecture is trained on the extracted class-conditions in two
experiments and studied relative to the performance of an unconditional model.
Results show that, whilst the unconditional model more closely matches the
training distribution, high quality conditions enabled the embedding of finer
details onto the latent space, leading to more diverse output.

electric field around nanotips. The enhancement is maximum when individual
emitter-tips are well separated. As the distance between two or more nanotips
decreases, the field enhancement at individual tips reduces due to the
shielding effect. The anode-proximity effect acts in quite the opposite way,
increasing the local field as the anode is brought closer to the emitter. For
isolated emitters, this effect is pronounced when the anode is at a distance
less than three times the height of the emitter. It is shown here that for a
large area field emitter (LAFE), the anode proximity effect increases
dramatically and can counterbalance shielding effects to a large extent. Also,
it is significant even when the anode is far away. The apex field enhancement
factor for a LAFE in the presence of an anode is derived using the line charge
model. It is found to explain the observations well and can accurately predict
the apex enhancement factors. The results are supported by numerical studies

have attracted attention because of an extremely simplified architecture and
fast decoding. To alleviate data sparseness issues due to infrequent words, the
combination with an acoustic-to-character (A2C) model is investigated.
Moreover, the A2C model can be used to recover out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
that are not covered by the A2W model, but this requires accurate detection of
OOV words. A2W models learn contexts with both acoustic and transcripts;
therefore they tend to falsely recognize OOV words as words in the vocabulary.
In this paper, we tackle this problem by using external language models (LM),
which are trained only with transcriptions and have better linguistic
information to detect OOV words. The A2C model is used to resolve these OOV
words. Experimental evaluations show that external LMs have the effects of not
only reducing errors but also increasing the number of detected OOV words, and
the proposed method significantly improves performances in English
conversational and Japanese lecture corpora, especially for out-of-domain
scenario. We also investigate the impact of the vocabulary size of A2W models
and the data size for training LMs. Moreover, our approach can reduce the
vocabulary size several times with marginal performance degradation.

of a sessile water droplet containing polystyrene particles on a non-uniformly
heated glass are investigated experimentally. In particular, the effects of
temperature gradient across the substrate and particles size are investigated.
The temperature gradient was imposed using Peltier coolers, and side
visualization, infrared thermography, optical microscopy, and optical
profilometry were employed to collect the data. On a uniformly heated
substrate, a ring with an inner deposit is obtained, which is attributed to
axisymmetric Marangoni recirculation and consistent with previous reports.
However, the dimensions of the ring formed on a non-uniformly heated substrate
are significantly different on the hot and cold side of the substrate and are
found to be a function of the temperature gradient and particles size. In the
case of smaller particle size, the contact line on hot side depins and together
with twin asymmetric Marangoni recirculations, it results in a larger ring
width on the cold side as compared to the hot side. In contrast, the contact
line remains pinned in case of larger particles, and the twin asymmetric
Marangoni recirculations advect more particles on the hot side, resulting in a
larger ring width at the hot side. A mechanistic model is employed to explain
why the depinning is dependent on the particle size. A larger temperature
gradient significantly increases or decreases the ring width depending on the
particle size, due to a stronger intensity recirculation. A regime map is
proposed for the deposit patterns on temperature gradient-particle size plane
to classify the deposits.

Specifically, we propose a new method which consists of two consecutive steps

initially search the top $k$ most similar images from the internet and extract
their annotations/descriptions (e.g., tags or keywords). The annotation
information is employed to design a filter bank for each image category and
generate filter words (codebook). Finally, each image is represented by the
histogram of the occurrences of filter words in all categories. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed features in scene image classification on three
commonly-used scene image datasets (i.e., MIT-67, Scene15 and Event8). Our
method typically produces a lower feature dimension than existing feature
extraction methods. Experimental results show that the proposed features
generate better classification accuracies than vision based and tag based

cloud computing is undoubtedly one of the promising solutions. However, the
computation cost in the cloud can be unexpectedly high if it cannot be managed
properly. The long tail phenomenon has been observed widely in the big data
clustering area, which indicates that the majority of time is often consumed in
the middle to late stages in the clustering process. In this research, we try
to cut the unnecessary long tail in the clustering process to achieve a
sufficiently satisfactory accuracy at the lowest possible computation cost. A
novel approach is proposed to achieve cost-effective big data clustering in the
cloud. By training the regression model with the sampling data, we can make
widely used k-means and EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithms stop
automatically at an early point when the desired accuracy is obtained.
Experiments are conducted on four popular data sets and the results demonstrate
that both k-means and EM algorithms can achieve high cost-effectiveness in the
cloud with our proposed approach. For example, in the case studies with the
much more efficient k-means algorithm, we find that achieving a 99% accuracy
needs only 47.71%-71.14% of the computation cost required for achieving a 100%
accuracy while the less efficient EM algorithm needs 16.69%-32.04% of the
computation cost. To put that into perspective, in the United States land use
classification example, our approach can save up to $94,687.49 for the

producers and customers of goods and services. There have been concerns that
over-emphasis on customer satisfaction by the platforms may affect the
well-being of the producers. To counter such issues, few recent works have
attempted to incorporate fairness for the producers. However, these studies
have overlooked an important issue in such platforms -- to supposedly improve
customer utility, the underlying algorithms are frequently updated, causing
abrupt changes in the exposure of producers. In this work, we focus on the
fairness issues arising out of such frequent updates, and argue for incremental
updates of the platform algorithms so that the producers have enough time to
adjust (both logistically and mentally) to the change. However, naive
incremental updates may become unfair to the customers. Thus focusing on
recommendations deployed on two-sided platforms, we formulate an ILP based
online optimization to deploy changes incrementally in n steps, where we can
ensure smooth transition of the exposure of items while guaranteeing a minimum
utility for every customer. Evaluations over multiple real world datasets show
that our proposed mechanism for platform updates can be efficient and fair to
both the producers and the customers in two-sided platforms.

assigned a beta-Bernoulli prior, is utilized to characterize if the sensor's

measurement model, both centralized and decentralized information fusion
filters are developed. Specifically, in the centralized approach, all

are jointly estimated by employing the mean-field variational Bayesian
inference in an iterative manner. In the decentralized approach, however, every
node shares its information, including the prior and likelihood, only with its
neighbors based on a hybrid consensus strategy. Then each node independently
performs the estimation task based on its own and shared information. In
addition, an approximation distributed solution is proposed to reduce the local
computational complexity and communication overhead. Simulation results reveal
that the proposed algorithms are effective in dealing with outliers compared

investigate the effects of including multi-mode content in estimating source

(IMRPhenomD). We use as sources IMRPhenomHM and hybrid EOB-NR waveforms over a

with IMRPhenomHM and IMRPhenomD. These allow us to quantify the accuracy of
parameter measurements using a multi-mode model, the biases incurred when using
a quadrupole-only model to recover full (multi-mode) signals, and the
systematic errors in the IMRPhenomHM model. We see that the parameters
recovered by multi-mode templates are more precise for all non-zero
inclinations as compared to quadrupole templates. For multi-mode injections,
IMRPhenomD recovers biased parameters for non-zero inclinations with lower
likelihood while IMRPhenomHM recovered parameters are accurate for most cases,
and if a bias exists, it can be explained as a combined effect of observational
priors and (in the case of hybrid-NR signals) waveform inaccuracies. For cases
where IMRPhenomHM recovers biased parameters, the bias is always smaller than
the corresponding IMRPhenomD recovery, and we conclude that IMRPhenomHM will be
sufficiently accurate to allow unbiased measurements for most GW observations.

solve Maxwell's equations for the components of the electric field on the
surface of a dielectric scatterer is introduced. In this method, both the
vector Helmholtz equation and the divergence-free constraint are satisfied
inside and outside the scatterer. The divergence-free condition is replaced by
an equivalent boundary condition that relates the normal derivatives of the
electric field across the surface of the scatterer. Also, the continuity and
jump conditions on the electric and magnetic fields are expressed in terms of
the electric field across the surface of the scatterer. Together with these
boundary conditions, the scalar Helmholtz equation for the components of the
electric field inside and outside the scatterer is solved by a fully
desingularized surface integral method. Comparing with the most popular surface
integral methods based on the Stratton-Chu formulation or the PMCHWT
formulation, our method is conceptually simpler and numerically straightforward
because there is no need to introduce intermediate quantities such as surface
currents and the use of complicated vector basis functions can be avoided
altogether. Also, our method is not affected by numerical issues such as the
zero frequency catastrophe and does not contain integrals with (strong)
singularities. To illustrate the robustness and versatility of our method, we
show examples in the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometrical optics scattering regimes.
Given the symmetry between the electric field and the magnetic field, our
theoretical framework can also be used to solve for the magnetic field.

In the problems, we are given a knapsack with capacity $1$, a buffer with

proportional (i.e., the value of each item is proportional to its size) or
general. For the general&non-removable case, we observe that no constant

the reactive energy of an antenna tends to become infinitely large when
integrating the conventionally defined energy density in the whole space
outside a small sphere containing the antenna. The reactive energy can be made
bounded by subtracting an additional term associated with the radiation fields.
However, there exists no well-founded accurate definition for this additional

  Abstraction","Accepted by ASE 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural networks are becoming a popular tool for solving many real-world
problems such as object recognition and machine translation, thanks to its
exceptional performance as an end-to-end solution. However, neural networks are
complex black-box models, which hinders humans from interpreting and
consequently trusting them in making critical decisions. Towards interpreting
neural networks, several approaches have been proposed to extract simple
deterministic models from neural networks. The results are not encouraging
(e.g., low accuracy and limited scalability), fundamentally due to the limited
expressiveness of such simple models.
  In this work, we propose an approach to extract probabilistic automata for
interpreting an important class of neural networks, i.e., recurrent neural
networks. Our work distinguishes itself from existing approaches in two
important ways. One is that probability is used to compensate for the loss of
expressiveness. This is inspired by the observation that human reasoning is
often `probabilistic'. The other is that we adaptively identify the right level
of abstraction so that a simple model is extracted in a request-specific way.
We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets using state-of-the-art
architectures including GRU and LSTM. The result shows that our approach
significantly improves existing approaches in terms of accuracy or scalability.
Lastly, we demonstrate the usefulness of the extracted models through detecting
adversarial texts.

test for cosmological models with suppressed small-scale power (and, hence,
late formation of cosmic structure). We explore the ages of the oldest stars in
numerical simulations from the Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project
with cold dark matter (CDM) and two warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies with 3

WDM, while CDM and 6 keV WDM are statistically indistinguishable. Even this 5
Myr difference, however, is much less than current observational uncertainties
on the stellar population properties of high-redshift galaxies. The age
distributions of all galaxies in all cosmologies fail to produce a substantial
Balmer break, although uncertainties in dust attenuation are a potentially
significant factor. Finally, we assess the convergence of our simulation

and more frequent, volatile and advanced. Being able to capture intrusions in
time for such a large scale network is critical and very challenging. To this
end, the machine learning (or AI) based network intrusion detection (NID), due
to its intelligent capability, has drawn increasing attention in recent years.
Compared to the traditional signature-based approaches, the AI-based solutions
are more capable of detecting variants of advanced network attacks. However,
the high detection rate achieved by the existing designs is usually accompanied

automated vehicles (CAVs) in society by modeling and analyzing the
social-mobility dilemma in a game-theoretic approach. We formulate this dilemma
as a normal-form game of players making a binary decision: whether to travel
with a CAV (CAV travel) or not (non-CAV travel) and by constructing an
intuitive payoff function inspired by the socially beneficial outcomes of a
mobility system consisting of CAVs. We show that the game is equivalent to the
Prisoner's dilemma, which implies that the rational collective decision is the
opposite of the socially optimum. We present two different solutions to tackle
this phenomenon: one with a preference structure and the other with
institutional arrangements. In the first approach, we implement a social
mechanism that incentivizes players to non-CAV travel and derive a lower bound
on the players that ensures an equilibrium of non-CAV travel. In the second
approach, we investigate the possibility of players bargaining to create an
institution that enforces non-CAV travel and show that as the number of players
increases, the incentive ratio of non-CAV travel over CAV travel tends to zero.
We conclude by showcasing the last result with a numerical study.

Spring compliance maps contact forces to spring compressions, ensuring the

arXiv:1909.03815], in this article, we calculate the effects of parity
violation on gravitational-wave (GW) waveforms during their propagation in the
most general parity-violating gravities, including Chern-Simons modified
gravity, ghost-free scalar-tensor gravity, symmetric teleparallel equivalence
of GR theory, Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and so on. For this purpose, we
consider the GWs generated by the coalescence of compact binaries and
concentrate on the imprints of the parity violation in the propagation of GWs.
With a unified description of GW in the theories of parity-violating gravity,
we study the effects of velocity and amplitude birefringence on the GW
waveforms. Decomposing the GWs into the circular polarization modes, the two
birefringence effects exactly correspond to the modifications in phase and
amplitude of GW waveforms respectively. We find that, for each circular
polarization mode, the amplitude, phase and velocity of GW can be modified by
both the parity-violating terms and parity-conserving terms in gravity.
Therefore, in order to test the parity symmetry in gravity, we should compare
the difference between two circular polarization modes, rather than measuring
an individual mode. Combining two circular modes, we obtain the GW waveforms in
the Fourier domain, and obtain the deviations from those in General Relativity.
The GW waveforms derived in this paper are also applicable to the theories of
parity-conserving gravity, which have the modified dispersion relations (e.g.
massive gravity, double special relativity theory, extra-dimensional theories,
etc), or/and have the modified friction terms (e.g. nonlocal gravity,
gravitational theory with time-dependent Planck mass, etc).

cosmology, and our understanding of their fundamental nature is incomplete.
Many parameterizations of couplings between the two in the continuity equation
have been studied in the literature, and observational data from the growth of
perturbations can constrain these parameterizations. Assuming standard general
relativity with a simple Yukawa-type coupling between dark energy and dark
matter fields in the Lagrangian, we use the Boltzmann equation to analytically
express and calculate the interaction kernel $Q$ in the continuity equation and
compare it to that of a typical parametrization. We arrive at a comparably very
small result, as expected. Since the interaction is a function of the dark
matter mass, other observational data sets can be used to constrain the mass.
This calculation can be modified to account for other couplings of the dark
energy and dark matter fields. This calculation required obtaining a
distribution function for dark energy that leads to an equation of state
parameter that is negative, which neither Bose-Einstein nor Fermi-Dirac
statistics can supply, and this is the main result of this paper. Treating dark
energy as a quantum scalar field, we use adiabatic subtraction to obtain a
finite analytic approximation for its distribution function that assumes the
FLRW metric and nothing more.

algorithm with thousands of malware files annotated with class labels (the

used disassembled malware files (provided by Microsoft) and separated the
constituent data into parsed instructions, which look like human-readable
machine code text, and raw bytes, which are hexadecimal values. We are

this investigation using the machine learning Python package Keras, which
allows easily configurable deep learning architectures and training. We hoped
to understand the trade-offs between the different formats. Due to the class
imbalance in the data, we used multiple methods to compare the formats, using
test accuracies, balanced accuracies (taking into account weights of classes),

that users have limited attention: as the number of robots increases, users
lose the ability to decide which robot requires teleoperation the most. Our

can model the user's choice of which robot to control as an approximately
