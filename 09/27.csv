many scientific and graph analytics applications. In this work, we are
concerned with a spatial partitioning called rectilinear partitioning (also
known as generalized block distribution) of sparse matrices, which is needed
for tiled (or {\em blocked}) execution of sparse matrix and graph analytics
kernels. More specifically, in this work, we address the problem of symmetric
rectilinear partitioning of square matrices. By symmetric, we mean having the
same partition on rows and columns of the matrix, yielding a special tiling
where the diagonal tiles (blocks) will be squares. We propose five heuristics
to solve two different variants of this problem, and present a thorough
experimental evaluation showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

examined by comparing the interstellar extinction curve with the ultraviolet
absorption of graphene calculated from its dielectric functions experimentally

absence in the interstellar extinction curve of the ~2755 Angstrom
$\pi$--$\pi^{\ast}$ electronic interband transition of graphene, we place an
upper limit of ~20ppm of C/H on the interstellar graphene abundance, exceeding
the previous estimate by a factor of ~3 which made use of the dielectric
functions measured with the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) method. Compared
with the SE method which measures graphene in air (and hence its surface is
contaminated) in a limited energy range of ~0.7--5 eV, the EELS probes a much
wider energy range of ~0--50 eV and is free of contamination. The fact that the
EELS dielectric functions are substantially smaller than that of SE naturally
explains why a higher upper limit on the graphene abundance is derived with
EELS. Inspired by the possible detection of C$_{24}$, a planar graphene sheet,
in several Galactic and extragalactic planetary nebulae, we also examine the
possible presence of C$_{24}$ in the diffuse ISM by comparing the model IR
emission of C$_{24}$ with the observed IR emission of the Galactic cirrus and
the diffuse ISM toward $l = 44^{o}20^\prime$ and $b=-0^{o}20^\prime$. An upper
limit of ~20 ppm on C$_{24}$ is also derived from the absence of the

Peripheral Collisions (UPC) occur when the incoming ions pass beyond the range

approach to complement traditional augmentation techniques like flipping,
translation or rotation. Our work is motivated by the intriguing property that
deep networks are surprisingly good at linearizing features, such that certain
directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic
transformations, e.g., adding sunglasses or changing backgrounds. As a
consequence, translating training samples along many semantic directions in the
feature space can effectively augment the dataset to improve generalization. To
implement this idea effectively and efficiently, we first perform an online
estimate of the covariance matrix of deep features for each class, which
captures the intra-class semantic variations. Then random vectors are drawn
from a zero-mean normal distribution with the estimated covariance to augment
the training data in that class. Importantly, instead of augmenting the samples
explicitly, we can directly minimize an upper bound of the expected
cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set, leading to a highly
efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed ISDA amounts to
minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds negligible extra computational
cost to a normal training procedure. Although being simple, ISDA consistently
improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (ResNets and
DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.

However, they only expresses the position information with no abilities to

preserve the source information, such as texture, style, color, and face

propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces, and
synthesizes an image with respect to the reference. Specifically, the source

characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method is
able to support a more flexible warping from multiple sources. In addition, we
build a new dataset, namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of
human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis.

continuous map from $M^n$ to a $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex such that

now famous Gromov's inequalities: $Fill Rad(M^n)\leq c(n)vol(M^n)^{1\over n}$
and, if $M^n$ is essential, then also $sys_1(M^n)\leq 6c(n)vol(M^n)^{1\over n}$

exponential in $n$.
  Moreover, we present a qualitative improvement: In Guth's theorem the
assumption that the volume of every metric ball of radius $r$ is less than
$({r\over c(n)})^n$ can be replaced by a weaker assumption that for every point

  Also, if $X$ is a boundedly compact metric space such that for some $r>0$ and
an integer $n\geq 1$ the $n$-dimensional Hausdorff content of each metric ball
of radius $r$ in $X$ is less than $({r\over 4n})^n$, then there exists a

through statistical methods. Deflating out the lowest eigenvectors or singular
vectors of the matrix reduces the variance of the trace estimator. This work
summarizes our efforts to reduce the computational cost of computing the
deflation space while achieving the desired variance reduction for Lattice QCD
applications. Previous efforts computed the lower part of the singular spectrum
of the Dirac operator by using an eigensolver preconditioned with a multigrid
linear system solver. Despite the improvement in performance in those
applications, as the problem size grows the runtime and storage demands of this
approach will eventually dominate the stochastic estimation part of the
computation.
  In this work, we propose to compute the deflation space in one of the
following two ways. First, by using an inexact eigensolver on the Hermitian,
but maximally indefinite, operator $A \gamma_5$. Second, by exploiting the fact
that the multigrid prolongator for this operator is rich in components toward
the lower part of the singular spectrum. We show experimentally that the
inexact eigensolver can approximate the lower part of the spectrum even for
ill-conditioned operators. Also, the deflation based on the multigrid
prolongator is more efficient to compute and apply, and, despite its limited
ability to approximate the fine level spectrum, it obtains similar variance
reduction on the trace estimator as deflating with approximate eigenvectors
from the fine level operator.

challenging domains in discrete and continuous control have used policy
gradient methods in the on-policy setting. However, policy gradients can suffer
from large variance that may limit performance, and in practice require
carefully tuned entropy regularization to prevent policy collapse. As an
alternative to policy gradient algorithms, we introduce V-MPO, an on-policy
adaptation of Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) that performs
policy iteration based on a learned state-value function. We show that V-MPO
surpasses previously reported scores for both the Atari-57 and DMLab-30
benchmark suites in the multi-task setting, and does so reliably without
importance weighting, entropy regularization, or population-based tuning of
hyperparameters. On individual DMLab and Atari levels, the proposed algorithm
can achieve scores that are substantially higher than has previously been
reported. V-MPO is also applicable to problems with high-dimensional,
continuous action spaces, which we demonstrate in the context of learning to
control simulated humanoids with 22 degrees of freedom from full state
observations and 56 degrees of freedom from pixel observations, as well as
example OpenAI Gym tasks where V-MPO achieves substantially higher asymptotic

therefore, the usual treatment of the plasmon as Coulomb-dressed zero sound
does not apply. Furthermore, the dominant coherent modes in the longitudinal
channel, which control the neutral density-density correlator, are diffusive.
We show these modes are strongly suppressed when the boundary Coulomb
interaction is turned on. This renders the low frequency charge density
response spectrum completely incoherent and featureless.
  At intermediate frequencies, we observe a broad feature -- the fake plasmon
-- in the dressed correlator, which could be confused with an overdamped
plasmon. However, its gap is set by the scale of translation symmetry breaking
instead of the plasma frequency. This broad feature originates from the
non-hydrodynamic sector of the holographic spectrum, and therefore, its
behaviour, typical of strongly correlated quantum critical systems with
holographic duals, deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid paradigm.

with samples of $5 \times 10^{12}$ Z bosons, $10^8$ W pairs, $10^6$ Higgs

the precise (ppm) measurements of the W and Z masses and widths, as well as
forward-backward asymmetries. To this effect the centre-of-mass energy
distribution should be determined with the high precision. This document
describes the capacity offered by FCC-ee, starting with transverse polarization
of the beams around the Z pole and the W pair threshold. A running scheme based
on regular measurements of the beam energy by resonant depolarization of pilot
bunches, during physics data taking, is proposed. The design for polarization
wigglers, polarimeter and depolarizer is outlined. The $e^\pm$ beam energies
will be monitored with a relative precision of $10^{-6}$. The centre-of-mass
energy is derived subject to further corrections, related to the beam
acceleration, synchrotron radiation and beamstrahlung; these effects are

centre-of-mass energy spread, and the $e^+$ and $e^-$ energy difference.
Monitoring methods to minimize absolute error and relative uncertainties are
discussed. The impact on the physics measurements is given. A programme of
further simulations, design, monitoring and R&D is outlined.

first, additional photons are produced from the early pre-equilibrium stage
computed from the \textit{bottom-up} thermalization scenario. In the second,
the thermal rates are enhanced close to the pseudo-critical temperature
$T_c\approx 155\,\text{MeV}$ using a phenomenological ansatz. We compute the
correlators for relative momenta $q_o, \,q_s$ and $q_l$ for different
transverse pair momenta, $K_\perp$, and find that the longitudinal correlation
is the most sensitive to different photon sources. Our results also demonstrate
that including anisotropic pre-equilibrium rates enhances non-Gaussianities in
the correlators, which can be quantified using the kurtosis of the correlators.
Finally, we study the feasibility of measuring a direct photon HBT signal in
the upcoming high-luminosity LHC runs. Considering only statistical
uncertainties, we find that with the projected $\sim 10^{10}$ heavy ion events
a measurement of the HBT correlations for $K_\perp<1\, \text{GeV}$ is

has worked remarkably well. However, individual pixels also exhibit response
nonuniformity. Typically, pixels are most sensitive near their centers and less
sensitive near the edges, with a difference in response of as much as 50%. The
exact shape of this fall-off, and its dependence on the wavelength of light, is
the intra-pixel response function (IPRF). A direct measurement of the IPRF can
be used to improve the photometric uncertainties, leading to improved
photometry and astrometry of under-sampled systems. Using the spot-scan

phase diagram. We calculate the values of the tricritical quark masses in the
Roberge-Weiss plane, $\mu=\imath\pi T/3$, which separate mass regions with
chiral and deconfinement phase transitions from the intermediate region, for
QCD with $N_\text{f}=2$ unimproved staggered quarks on $N_\tau=6$ lattices. A
quantitative measure for the quality of finite size scaling plots is developed,
which significantly reduces the subjective judgement required for fitting. We
observe that larger aspect ratios are necessary to unambiguously determine the
order of the transition than at $\mu=0$. Comparing with previous results from
$N_\tau=4$ we find a $\sim50$% reduction in the light tricritical pion mass.
The heavy tricritical pion mass stays roughly the same, but is too heavy to be
resolved on $N_\tau=6$ lattices and thus equally afflicted with cut-off
effects. Further comparison with other discretizations suggests that current
cut-off effects on the light critical masses are likely to be larger than
$\sim100$%, implying a drastic shrinking of the chiral first-order region to
possibly zero.

  Zero-Forcing Precoding","Presented at 57th IEEE Annual Allerton Conference on Communication,
  Control, and Computing",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-M-MIMO) systems represent an evolution of the
classical cellular architecture that has dominated the mobile landscape for
decades. In CF-M-MIMO, a central processing unit (CPU) controls a multitude of
access points (APs) that are irregularly scattered throughout the coverage area
effectively becoming a fully distributed implementation of the M-MIMO
technology. As such, it inherits many of the key properties that have made
M-MIMO one of the physical layer pillars of 5G systems while opening the door
to new features not available in M-MIMO. Among the latest is the possibility of
performing the precoding at the CPU (centralized) or at the APs (distributed)
with the former known to offer much better performance at the cost of having to
collect all the relevant channel state information (CSI) at the CPU. Realistic
deployments of cell-free systems are likely to require more than one CPU when
the area to be covered is large, thus a critical issue that needs to be solved
is how these multiple CPUs should be interconnected. This paper analyzes and
proposes designs for different degrees of interconnectivity among the CPUs for
the specific case of centralized zero-forcing precoding. Results show that a
modest form of CPU interconnection can boost very significantly the max-min
rate performance so prevalent in CF-M-MIMO architectures.

inferring the function better by leveraging such structures. Specifically, we
investigate the low-rank structure, which widely exists for big data matrices.
We verify empirically the existence of low-rank Q functions in the context of
control and deep RL tasks. As our key contribution, by leveraging Matrix
Estimation (ME) techniques, we propose a general framework to exploit the
underlying low-rank structure in Q functions. This leads to a more efficient
planning procedure for classical control, and additionally, a simple scheme
that can be applied to any value-based RL techniques to consistently achieve
better performance on ""low-rank"" tasks. Extensive experiments on control tasks

mid-pseudo-rapidity, $|\eta| < $ 1.0, and full azimuth, $\phi$, from
longitudinally polarized $pp$ collisions to study the gluon polarization in the
proton. At center of mass energies $\sqrt{s} =$ 200 and 510 GeV, jet production
is dominated by hard QCD scattering processes such as gluon-gluon ($gg$) and
quark-gluon ($qg$), thus making the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry
($A_{LL}$) sensitive to the gluon polarization. Early STAR inclusive jet
$A_{LL}$ results at $\sqrt{s} = $ 200 GeV provided the first evidence of the
non-zero gluon polarization at momentum fraction $x > $ 0.05. The higher center
of mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 510$ GeV allows to explore the gluon polarization as

magnetically-driven, self-confined super-Alfv\'enic jets from near Keplerian
accretion disks. These Jet Emitting Disks are possible for high levels of disk
magnetization $\mu$ defined as $\mu=2/\beta$ where beta is the usual plasma
parameter. In near-equipartition JEDs, accretion is supersonic and jets carry
away most of the disk angular momentum. However, these solutions prove
difficult to compare with cutting edge numerical simulations, for the reason
that numerical simulations show wind-like outflows but in the domain of small
magnetization. In this work, we present for the first time self-similar
isothermal solutions for accretion-ejection structures at small magnetization
levels. We elucidate the role of MRI-like structures in the acceleration
processes that drive this new class of solutions. The disk magnetization $\mu$
is the main control parameter: massive outflows driven by the pressure of the
toroidal magnetic field are obtained up to $\mu \sim 10^{-2}$, while more
tenuous centrifugally-driven outflows are obtained at larger $\mu$ values. The
generalized parameter space and the astrophysical consequences are discussed.
We believe that these new solutions could be a stepping stone in understanding
the way astrophysical disks drive either winds or jets. Defining jets as
self-confined outflows and winds as uncollimated outflows, we propose a simple
analytical criterion based on the initial energy content of the outflow, to
discriminate jets from winds. We show that jet solution are achieved at all
magnetization level, while winds could be obtained only in weakly magnetized
disks that feature heating.

incoherent deeply virtual Compton scattering, which can provide a tomographic

state-of-the-art models of the nuclear spectral function and of the parton

expressions for a bound moving nucleon, have been used. A good overall
agreement with the data is obtained, in particular at high values of the photon
virtuality. The observed big difference between results for the bound proton
and those for the free one turns out to be due in small part to modifications
of the parton structure, and rather it should be related to kinematical nuclear
effects. The analysis demonstrates that the comparison of the results of this
approach, based on a conventional description, with future precise data, has
the potential to expose exotic quark and gluon effects in nuclei.

optimal policies is to first construct a loss function that is based on the
scalarization of individual objectives, and then find the optimal policy that
minimizes the loss. However, optimizing the scalarized (and weighted) loss does
not necessarily provide guarantee of high performance on each possibly
conflicting objective because it is challenging to assign the right weights
without knowing the relationship among these objectives. Moreover, the
effectiveness of these gradient descent algorithms is limited by the agent's
ability to explain their decisions and actions to human users. The purpose of
this study is two-fold. First, we propose a vector value function based
multi-objective reinforcement learning (V2f-MORL) approach that seeks to
quantify the inter-objective relationship via reinforcement learning (RL) when
the impact of one objective on others is unknown a prior. In particular, we
construct one actor and multiple critics that can co-learn the policy and
inter-objective relationship matrix (IORM), quantifying the impact of
objectives on each other, in an iterative way. Second, we provide a semantic
representation that can uncover the trade-off of decision policies made by
users to reconcile conflicting objectives based on the proposed V2f-MORL
approach for the explainability of the generated behaviors subject to given
optimization objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

learning: RLBench. The benchmark features 100 completely unique, hand-designed
tasks ranging in difficulty, from simple target reaching and door opening, to
longer multi-stage tasks, such as opening an oven and placing a tray in it. We
provide an array of both proprioceptive observations and visual observations,
which include rgb, depth, and segmentation masks from an over-the-shoulder
stereo camera and an eye-in-hand monocular camera. Uniquely, each task comes
with an infinite supply of demos through the use of motion planners operating
on a series of waypoints given during task creation time; enabling an exciting
flurry of demonstration-based learning. RLBench has been designed with
scalability in mind; new tasks, along with their motion-planned demos, can be
easily created and then verified by a series of tools, allowing users to submit
their own tasks to the RLBench task repository. This large-scale benchmark aims
to accelerate progress in a number of vision-guided manipulation research
areas, including: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, multi-task
learning, geometric computer vision, and in particular, few-shot learning. With
the benchmark's breadth of tasks and demonstrations, we propose the first
large-scale few-shot challenge in robotics. We hope that the scale and
diversity of RLBench offers unparalleled research opportunities in the robot
learning community and beyond.

  Systems (NeurIPS 2019); 18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While progress has been made in understanding the robustness of machine
learning classifiers to test-time adversaries (evasion attacks), fundamental
questions remain unresolved. In this paper, we use optimal transport to
characterize the minimum possible loss in an adversarial classification
scenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from
one of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint,
and presents the modified example to the classifier. We define an appropriate
cost function such that the minimum transportation cost between the
distributions of the two classes determines the minimum $0-1$ loss for any
classifier. When the classifier comes from a restricted hypothesis class, the
optimal transportation cost provides a lower bound. We apply our framework to
the case of Gaussian data with norm-bounded adversaries and explicitly show
matching bounds for the classification and transport problems as well as the
optimality of linear classifiers. We also characterize the sample complexity of
learning in this setting, deriving and extending previously known results as a
special case. Finally, we use our framework to study the gap between the
optimal classification performance possible and that currently achieved by
state-of-the-art robustly trained neural networks for datasets of interest,
namely, MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10.

be used to guarantee convergence of function estimates in the RKH space

to uncertain ODE systems with positive limit sets given by certain types of

  Cellular Networks and Uplink-Downlink Duality",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the information-theoretic optimality of treating inter-cell
interference as noise (multi-cell TIN) in downlink cellular networks. We focus
on scenarios modeled by the Gaussian interfering broadcast channel (IBC),
comprising $K$ mutually interfering Gaussian broadcast channels (BCs), each
formed by a base station communicating independent messages to an arbitrary
number of users. We establish a new power allocation duality between the IBC
and its dual interfering multiple access channel (IMAC), which entails that the
corresponding generalized degrees-of-freedom regions achieved through
multi-cell TIN and power control (TINA regions) for both networks are
identical. As by-products of this duality, we obtain an explicit
characterization of the IBC TINA region from a previously established
characterization of the IMAC TINA region; and identify a multi-cell convex-TIN
regime in which the IBC TINA region is a polyhedron (hence convex) without the
need for time-sharing. We then identify a smaller multi-cell TIN regime in
which the IBC TINA region is optimal and multi-cell TIN achieves the entire
capacity region of the IBC, up to a constant gap. This is accomplished by
deriving a new genie-aided outer bound for the IBC, that reveals a novel
BC-type order that holds amongst users in each constituent BC (or cell) under
inter-cell interference, which in turn is not implied by previously known
BC-type orders (i.e. degraded, less noisy and more capable orders). The
multi-cell TIN regime that we identify for the IBC coincides with a
corresponding multi-cell TIN regime previously identified for the IMAC, hence
establishing a comprehensive uplink-downlink duality of multi-cell TIN in the
GDoF (and approximate capacity) sense.

exceptional points (EPs), i.e., exotic degeneracies of non-Hermitian systems.
The usual approach in those studies involves the introduction of a
phenomenological effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), where the gain and
losses are incorporated as the imaginary frequencies of fields and from which
the Hamiltonian EPs (HEPs) are derived. Although this approach can provide
valid equations of motion for the fields in the classical limit, its
application in the derivation of EPs in the quantum regime is questionable.
Recently, a framework [Minganti {\it et al.},

Liouvillian naturally includes quantum noise effects via quantum-jump terms,
thus allowing one to consistently determine its EPs purely in the quantum
regime. In this work we study a non-Hermitian system consisting of coupled
cavities with unbalanced gain and losses, where the gain is far from
saturation, i.e, the system is assumed to be linear. We apply both formalisms,
based on an NHH and a Liouvillian within the Scully-Lamb laser theory, to
determine and compare the corresponding HEPs and LEPs in the semiclassical and
quantum regimes. {Our results indicate that, although the overall spectral
properties of the NHH and the corresponding Liouvillian for a given system can
differ substantially, their LEPs and HEPs occur for the same combination of
system parameters.}

tadpole cancellation conditions in string theory. Moreover, the
non-perturbative lift as M5/MO5-anomaly cancellation in M-theory had been based
on indirect plausibility arguments,lacking a microscopic underpinning in
M-brane charge quantization. We provide a framework for answering these
questions, crucial not only for mathematical consistency but also for
phenomenological accuracy of string theory, by formulating the M-theory C-field
on flat M-orientifolds in the generalized cohomology theory called Equivariant
Cohomotopy. This builds on our previous results for smooth but curved
spacetimes, showing in that setting that charge quantization in twisted
Cohomotopy rigorously implies a list of expected anomaly cancellation
conditions. Here we further expand this list by proving that brane charge
quantization in unstable equivariant Cohomotopy implies the anomaly
cancellation conditions for M-branes and D-branes on flat orbi-orientifolds.
For this we (a) use an unstable refinement of the equivariant Hopf-tom Dieck
theorem to derive local/twisted tadpole cancellation, and (b) the lift to
super-differential cohomology to establish global/untwisted tadpole
cancellation. Throughout, we use (c) the unstable Pontrjagin-Thom theorem to
identify the brane/O-plane configurations encoded in equivariant Cohomotopy and
(d) the Boardman homomorphism to equivariant K-theory to identify Chan-Paton
representations of D-brane charge. We find that unstable equivariant
Cohomotopy, but not its image in K-theory, distinguishes D-brane charge from
the finite set of types of O-plane charges.

  Issue 2, Article 3","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/3",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority
than necessary. Since programs can access more data than they legitimately
need, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or
buggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control
policies.
  Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access
to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often
have many users and consist of many different software components. First,
databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user
for each application user is impractical for applications with many users.
Second, different components of the same application may require different
authority, which would require creating different database users for different
software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly
limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason,
we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database
security.
  Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications
with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts,
which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.
  Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of
ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB
enables reasoning about database access at the language level through
capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and
contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.
ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy
to specify different access control policies for different components.
Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are
enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access
control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms
of the underlying database management system.
  Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to
implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts
for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.
Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better
understand the language's performance overhead.
  Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for
enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user
applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers
to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and
reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database
security policies.

prove stronger bounds for the number of the exceptional moduli $q$ in the cases

special cases of a ""hybrid result"" that works for sums of $f$ over almost all

require invasive and system-specific code changes and are insufficient to

  Rather than sandboxing one service at a time, we propose that the best place
to add sandboxing to network services is in the service manager that starts
those services. As a first step towards this vision, we propose CapExec, a
process supervisor that can execute a single service within a sandbox based on
a service declaration file in which, required resources whose limited access to

compartmentalization framework and its Casper service framework, CapExec
provides robust application sandboxing without requiring any modifications to
the application itself. We believe that this is a first step towards ubiquitous

Gaussian, wavelet filter, and discretization of the intensity values) were
applied on tumor volumes. In total, 2530 radiomics features (tumor shape and
size, intensity statistics, and texture) were extracted from each segmented
tumor volume. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the association of
each feature with the histological condition. In the case of multivariate
analysis, the following was implemented: three feature selection including the
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), students t-test and
minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithms. These selected features
were then used to construct three classification models (SVM, random forest,
and logistic regression) to discriminate the high from low-grade ccRCC at

bootstrapped validation cohort using the area under receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Univariate analysis demonstrated that
among different image sets, 128 bin discretized images have statistically
significant different (q-value < 0.05) texture parameters with a mean of AUC
0.74 (q-value < 0.05). The three ML-based classifier shows proficient

achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as machine translation

approach, teacher forcing, guides a model with reference output history during
training. The problem is that the model is unlikely to recover from its
mistakes during inference, where the reference output is replaced by generated
output. Several approaches deal with this problem, largely by guiding the model
with generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often
require a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces
attention forcing, which guides the model with generated output history and
reference attention. This approach can train the model to recover from its
mistakes, in a stable fashion, without the need for a schedule or a classifier.
In addition, it allows the model to generate output sequences aligned with the
references, which can be important for cascaded systems like many speech
synthesis systems. Experiments on speech synthesis show that attention forcing
yields significant performance gain. Experiments on machine translation show
that for tasks where various re-orderings of the output are valid, guiding the

standardized approaches, a wide variety of techniques are employed for

of confidence-based regression, which entails predicting a confidence value for
each input-target pair (x,y). While this approach has demonstrated impressive
results, it requires important task-dependent design choices, and the predicted
confidences lack a natural probabilistic meaning. We address these issues by
proposing a general and conceptually simple regression method with a clear
probabilistic interpretation. In our proposed approach, we create an
energy-based model of the conditional target density p(y|x), using a deep
neural network to predict the un-normalized density from (x,y). This model of
p(y|x) is trained by directly minimizing the associated negative
log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. We perform
comprehensive experiments on four computer vision regression tasks. Our
approach outperforms direct regression, as well as other probabilistic and
confidence-based methods. Notably, our model achieves a 2.2% AP improvement
over Faster-RCNN for object detection on the COCO dataset, and sets a new
state-of-the-art on visual tracking when applied for bounding box estimation.
In contrast to confidence-based methods, our approach is also shown to be

attempts to learn a forward mapping that relates stimuli to the corresponding
brain activation. State-of-the-art encoding models use a single global model
(linear or non-linear) to predict brain activation given the stimulus. However,
the critical assumption in these methods is that a priori different brain
regions respond the same way to all the stimuli, that is, there is no
modularity or specialization assumed for any region. This goes against the
modularity theory, supported by many cognitive neuroscience investigations
suggesting that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain. In
this paper, we achieve this by clustering similar regions together and for
every cluster we learn a different linear regression model using a mixture of
linear experts model. The key idea here is that each linear expert captures the
behaviour of similar brain regions. Given a new stimulus, the utility of the
proposed model is twofold (i) predicts the brain activation as a weighted
linear combination of the activations of multiple linear experts and (ii) to
learn multiple experts corresponding to different brain regions. We argue that
each expert captures activity patterns related to a particular region of
interest (ROI) in the human brain. This study helps in understanding the brain
regions that are activated together given different kinds of stimuli.
Importantly, we suggest that the mixture of regression experts (MoRE) framework
successfully combines the two principles of organization of function in the
brain, namely that of specialization and integration. Experiments on fMRI data
from paradigm 1 [1]where participants view linguistic stimuli show that the
proposed MoRE model has better prediction accuracy compared to that of
conventional models.

produces an attractor, near-equilibrium solution which is consistent with

Additional solutions to the same equations may correspond to other observed

several falsifiable predictions, including higher metallicities and dust masses

also predicts that stellar mass-to-light ratios are lower than produced using a

in the density and the H$_2$ abundance. We use isothermal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of various sonic Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M}_s$, and density
decorrelation scales, $y_{\rm dec}$, to model the turbulent density field. We
post-process the simulations with chemical models and obtain the probability
density functions (PDFs) for the H$_2$, ArH$^+$, OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$

$\mathcal{M}_s$ and $y_{\rm dec}$, as the magnitude of the density fluctuations
increases, and as they become more coherent. Turbulence also affects the median
abundances: when $\mathcal{M}_s$ and $y_{\rm dec}$ are high, low-density
regions with low H$_2$ abundance become prevalent, resulting in an enhancement
of ArH$^+$ compared to OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$. We compare our models with

particular, the environment at the centers of galaxies. For example, detailed
observations of the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) revealed that it
has a complex and turbulent structure. Turbulence on galactic scales is often
modeled using star formation and feedback. However, these effects do not appear
to be sufficient for explaining the high-velocity dispersion observed in the
CMZ, indicating that additional gas-stirring processes are likely to be
operating. Here we introduce a proof-of-concept method to drive turbulence in
gas that orbits under the influence of a galactic potential. Instead of relying
on a particular physical mechanism, we have adopted a Fourier forcing module
and have applied it using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. To test our
method, we performed simulations of a simplistic model of the CMZ. Our
turbulence injection method is capable of balancing the self-gravity of the
gas, which allows us to run the simulations for long timescales and thereby
follow the evolution of the CMZ. Our results show that turbulence induces a
flocculent spiral pattern in our model, analogous to that found in
galactic-scale simulations. Furthermore, we find that our turbulence injection
method induces inward migration of gas, a result consistent with previous
numerical simulations. We submit that this injection method is a promising new

variety of ground state disorder-to-order phase transitions. We consider a
prototype of infinite-range interacting models known as the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model describing the collective interaction of $N$
spins, and investigate the dynamical properties of fluctuations and
correlations after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we focus
on critical quenches, where the initial state and/or the quench Hamiltonian are
critical. Depending on the type of quench, we identify three distinct behaviors
where both the short-time dynamics and the stationary state at long times are
effectively thermal, quantum, and genuinely non-equilibrium, characterized by
distinct universality classes and static and dynamical critical exponents.
These behaviors can be identified by an infrared effective temperature that is
finite, zero, and infinite (the latter scaling with the system size as
$N^{1/3}$), respectively. The quench dynamics is studied through a combination
of exact numerics and analytical calculations utilizing the non-equilibrium
Keldysh field theory. Our results are amenable to realization in experiments
with trapped-ion experiments where long-range interactions naturally arise.

the large ionized regions (bubbles) around bright individual sources, e.g.,
quasars, using the redshifted 21 cm signal. It has already been shown that
matched filter-based methods are not only able to detect the weak 21 cm signal
from these bubbles but also aid in constraining their properties. In this work,
we extend the previous studies to develop a rigorous Bayesian framework to
explore the possibility of constraining the parameters that characterize the

we apply our method on mock observations appropriate for the upcoming SKA1-low.
For a region of size $\gtrsim 50$ cMpc around a typical quasar at redshift 7,
we find that $\approx 20$ h of integration with SKA1-low will be able to
constrain the size and location of the bubbles, as well as the difference in
the neutral hydrogen fraction inside and outside the bubble, with $\lesssim
10\%$ precision. The recovery of the parameters are more precise and the SNR of
the detected signal is higher when the bubble sizes are larger and their shapes
are close to spherical. Our method can be useful in identifying regions in the
observed field which contain large ionized regions and hence are interesting
for following up with deeper integration times.

We explore the formation of such planets with a population synthesis code based
on a planetesimal-driven model previously used to study the formation of the
Jovian satellites. Because the discs have low mass and the stars are cool, the
formation is an inefficient process that happens at short periods, generating
compact planetary systems. Planets can be trapped in resonances and we follow
the evolution of the planets after the gas has dissipated and they undergo
orbit crossings and possible mergers. We find that formation of planets above
Mars mass and in the planetesimal accretion scenario, is only possible around
stars with masses $M_{\star} \ge 0.07 M_{sun}$ and discs of $M_{disc} \ge
10^{-2}~M_{sun} $. We find that planets above Earth-mass form around stars with
masses larger than $0.15 M_{\oplus}$ while planets larger than $5 M_{\oplus}$do
not form in our model, even not under the most optimal conditions (massive
disc), showing that planets such as GJ 3512b form with another, more efficient
mechanism. Our results show that the majority of planets form with a
significant water fraction; that most of our synthetic planetary systems have
1, 2, or 3 planets, but those with 4, 5, 6, and 7 planets are also common,
confirming that compact planetary systems with many planets should be a

Moreover, it has been shown in the last decade that the average white dwarf
(WD) mass observed in CVs is significantly higher than the average mass in
single WDs or in detached progenitors of CVs, and that there is an absence of
helium-core WDs in CVs which is not observed in their immediate detached
progenitors. This highly motivated us to revise the theory of CV formation and
evolution. A new empirical model for angular momentum loss in CVs was developed
in order to explain the high average WD mass observed and the absence of
systems with helium-core WDs. This model seems to help, at the same time, with
all of the above mentioned disagreements between theory and observations.
Moreover, it also provides us with a very likely explanation for the existence
of low-mass WDs without a companion. Here we will review the standard model for
CV evolution and the disagreements that have existed for decades between
simulations and observations with their possible solutions and/or improvements.
We will also summarize the recently confirmed disagreement related to the

kinetic power. In numerous scenarios such winds have been proven to produce
shocks in which relativistic particles are accelerated emitting non-thermal
radiation. Here, we report the first detection of non-thermal emission from a
single stellar bubble, G2.4+1.4, associated with a WO star. We observed this
source with the uGMRT in Band 4 ($550-850$ MHz) and Band 5 ($1050-1450$ MHz).
We present intensity and spectral index maps for this source that are
consistent with synchrotron emission (average spectral index, $\alpha = -0.83
\pm 0.10$). The fraction of the available kinetic wind power that is converted
into cosmic ray acceleration is estimated to be of the order of a few per cent.
This finding constitutes an observational breakthrough and gives new insight on
the non-thermal physical processes taking place in the environments of isolated
massive stars. In particular, our results show that non-runaway isolated
massive stars are capable of accelerating relativistic particles and are
therefore confirmed as sources of Galactic cosmic rays.

networks training significantly using large batch sizes and data parallelism.
Training in an asynchronous fashion, where delay occurs, can make training even
more scalable. However, asynchronous training has its pitfalls, mainly a
degradation in generalization, even after convergence of the algorithm. This
gap remains not well understood, as theoretical analysis so far mainly focused
on the convergence rate of asynchronous methods. Contributions: We examine
asynchronous training from the perspective of dynamical stability. We find that
the degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of
minima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We
derive closed-form rules on how the learning rate could be changed, while
keeping the accessible set the same. Specifically, for high delay values, we
find that the learning rate should be kept inversely proportional to the delay.
We then extend this analysis to include momentum. We find momentum should be
either turned off, or modified to improve training stability. We provide
empirical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

yield order-of-magnitude improvements in scan time, implementing the
delocalized measurements of CS theory is challenging. In this paper we study a
partially delocalized probe construction, in which the point probe is replaced

integrals of the target image. We show through simulations, rudimentary
theoretical analysis, and experiments, that these line measurements can image
sparse samples far more efficiently than traditional point measurements,

promise, practical reconstruction from line measurements poses additional

with respect to other AGN. We investigated the line profiles in a recent large
NLS1 sample classified using SDSS, and we divided the sources into two
subsamples according to their line shapes, Gaussian or Lorentzian. The line
profiles clearly separate all the properties of NLS1s. Black hole mass,
Eddington ratio, [O III], and Fe II strength are all very different in the
Lorentzian and Gaussian samples. We interpret this in terms of evolution within

Gaussian profiles may be typically associated to more evolved objects. Further
detailed spectroscopic studies are needed to fully confirm our hypothesis.

paper, we address the existence of new convex parameterizations and discuss
potential tradeoffs of each parametrization in different scenarios. Our main
contributions are: 1) We reveal that only four groups of stable closed-loop
transfer matrices are equivalent to internal stability: one of them is used in
the SLP, another one is used in the IOP, and the other two are new, leading to
two new convex parameterizations of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{stab}}$. 2) We
investigate the properties of these parameterizations after imposing the finite

ability of approximating $\mathcal{C}_{\text{stab}}$ given FIR constraints. 3)
These four parameterizations require no \emph{a priori} doubly-coprime
factorization of the plant, but impose a set of equality constraints. However,
these equality constraints will never be satisfied exactly in floating-point
arithmetic computation and/or implementation. We prove that the IOP is
numerically robust for open-loop stable plants, in the sense that small
mismatches in the equality constraints do not compromise the closed-loop
stability; but a direct IOP implementation will fail to stabilize open-loop
unstable systems in practice. The SLP is known to enjoy numerical robustness in
the state feedback case; here, we show that numerical robustness of the

is reproducible, appears for a range of different fuels and initial conditions,

it results from vortex breakdown in whirling, reacting fluid. Since its
discovery, considerable effort has been put into measurements, which have shown
its temperature structure and sensitivity to the boundary layer near the
surface. This has led to considerable speculation about the type of flames that

structure by performing simulations of vortex breakdown in gaseous reactive

is composed of three different flame structures -- a diffusion flame and a
premixed rich and lean flame -- all of which meet in a fourth structure, a
triple flame which appears as a whirling blue ring. In addition, the blue whirl
structure emerges as the result of vortex breakdown in a swirling reactive
flow, as evidenced in the simulation by a bubble mode that is usually invisible

event days and secure higher DR payments. Our goal is to identify and quantify
such incentives. To understand customer decisions, we formulate the problem of
determining hourly battery charging and discharge schedules to minimize
expected net costs, defined as energy purchase costs minus energy export
rebates and DR payments, over a sufficiently long time horizon (e.g., a year).
The complexity of this stochastic optimization problem grows exponentially with
the time horizon considered. To obtain computationally tractable solutions, we
propose using multistage model predictive control with scenario sampling.
Numerical results indicate that our solutions are near optimal (e.g., within 3%
from the optimum in the test cases). Finally, we apply our solutions to study
an example residential customer with solar photovoltaic and battery systems
participating in a typical existing baseline-based DR program. Results reveal
that over 66% of the average apparent load reduction during DR events could

ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray electrons and positrons that emit synchrotron
radiation in the presence of magnetic fields. For typical magnetic field
strengths (few $\mu $G) and $\mathcal O$(GeV--TeV) WIMP masses, this emission
peaks at hundreds of MHz. Here, we use the non-detection of 150-MHz radio
continuum emission from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Canes Venatici I with the
LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the annihilation cross
section of WIMPs into primary electron-positron and other fundamental

transport of the cosmic rays can be described by the diffusion approximation,
thus requiring a non-zero magnetic field strength with small-scale structure.
In particular, by adopting magnetic field strengths of $\mathcal O(1\,\mu$G)

exclude several thermal WIMP realisations in the $[2,20]$-GeV mass range. We
caution, however, that our limits for the cross section are subject to enormous

leads to unsatisfactory adaptation performance, in part because it ignores the

of auxiliary information available in the source and the target domains to
better align the source and target distributions. Specifically, we leverage the

different tasks, to improve the alignment. This structure is explicit in the

making the problem challenging. We address the challenge by devising a deep DA
framework, which combines a new task-driven domain alignment discriminator with
domain regularizers that encourage the shared features as task-specific and
domain invariant, and prompt the task model to be data structure preserving,
guiding its decision boundaries through the low density data regions. We
validate our framework on standard benchmarks, including Digits (MNIST, USPS,

approached upon the adoption of a quaternion orientational order parameter.
Unlike first-order phase transitions of liquids into crystalline solid states,
glass transitions are entirely different phenomena that are non-equilibrium and
that are highly dependent on the applied cooling rate. Herein, the ""ideal glass
transition"" that occurs at the finite Kauzmann temperature at which point the
configurational entropy of an undercooled liquid matches that of its
crystalline counterpart is identified as a first-order quantum critical point.
We suggest that this quantum critical point belongs to quaternion ordered
systems that exist in four- and three-dimensions. The Kauzmann quantum critical
point is considered to be a higher-dimensional analogue to the
superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition, in two- and
one-dimensional complex ordered systems. Such quantum critical points are
driven by tuning a non-thermal frustration parameter, and result due to
characteristic softening of the 'Higgs' type mode that corresponds to amplitude
fluctuations of the order parameter. The first-order nature of the finite
temperature Kauzmann quantum critical point is seen as a consequence of the
discrete change of the topology of the ground state manifold that applies to
crystalline and non-crystalline solid states.

representation learning. Since subwords increase parameter sharing ability in
neural models, their value should be even more pronounced in low-data regimes.
In this work, we therefore provide a comprehensive analysis focused on the
usefulness of subwords for word representation learning in truly low-resource
scenarios and for three representative morphological tasks: fine-grained entity
typing, morphological tagging, and named entity recognition. We conduct a
systematic study that spans several dimensions of comparison: 1) type of data
scarcity which can stem from the lack of task-specific training data, or even
from the lack of unannotated data required to train word embeddings, or both;
2) language type by working with a sample of 16 typologically diverse languages
including some truly low-resource ones (e.g. Rusyn, Buryat, and Zulu); 3) the
choice of the subword-informed word representation method. Our main results
show that subword-informed models are universally useful across all language
types, with large gains over subword-agnostic embeddings. They also suggest
that the effective use of subwords largely depends on the language (type) and
the task at hand, as well as on the amount of available data for training the
embeddings and task-based models, where having sufficient in-task data is a
more critical requirement.

cycle are fitted to a compilation of data, including optical and near-IR
photometry, Spitzer spectra (secured at a specific phase), interferometric
angular diameters, effective temperature and radial velocity measurements.
Herschel images in two bands are also analyzed qualitatively. In this fitting
process, based on the SPIPS algorithm, a residual is found in the SED, whatever
the pulsation phase, and for wavelengths larger than about $1.2\mu$m, which
corresponds to the so-determined infrared excess of Cepheids. This IR excess is
then corrected from interstellar medium absorption in order to infer or not the
presence of dust shells, and is finally used in order to fit a model of a shell
of ionized gas. For all Cepheids, we find a continuum IR excess increasing up
to about -0.1 magnitudes at 30$\mu$m, which cannot be explained by a hot or
cold dust model of CircumStellar Environment (CSE). We show, for the first
time, that the IR excess of Cepheids can be explained by free-free emission
from a thin shell of ionized gas, with a thickness of about 15% of the star
radius, a mass of $10^{-9}-10^{-7}$ Msol and a temperature ranging from 3500 to
4500K. This result has to be tested with interferometers operating in visible,
in the mid-IR or in the radio domain. The impact of such CSEs of ionized gas on

we address the problem of how to project undirected graphs onto the grid in a

approximately using a {\em regularized} Kamada-Kawai algorithm, a well-known
nonconvex optimization technique in graph drawing, with a vertex separation
penalty that improves the rounding performance on top of the solutions from
relaxation. Using GPGL we can easily conduct data augmentation as every local
minimum will lead to a grid layout for the same graph. Together with the help

classification problems, thanks to its ability to make use of abundant

nearby points on the data manifold are likely to share a label. Graph-based SSL
constructs a graph from point-cloud data as an approximation to the underlying
manifold, followed by label inference. It is no surprise that the quality of
the constructed graph in capturing the essential structure of the data is
critical to the accuracy of the subsequent inference step [6]. How should one
construct a graph from the input point-cloud data for graph-based SSL? In this
work we introduce a new, parallel graph learning framework (called PG-learn)
for the graph construction step of SSL. Our solution has two main ingredients:
(1) a gradient-based optimization of the edge weights (more specifically,
different kernel bandwidths in each dimension) based on a validation loss
function, and (2) a parallel hyperparameter search algorithm with an adaptive
resource allocation scheme. In essence, (1) allows us to search around a
(random) initial hyperparameter configuration for a better one with lower
validation loss. Since the search space of hyperparameters is huge for
high-dimensional problems, (2) empowers our gradient-based search to go through
as many different initial configurations as possible, where runs for relatively
unpromising starting configurations are terminated early to allocate the time
for others. As such, PG-learn is a carefully-designed hybrid of random and
adaptive search. Through experiments on multi-class classification problems, we
show that PG-learn significantly outperforms a variety of existing graph
construction schemes in accuracy (per fixed time budget for hyperparameter
tuning), and scales more effectively to high dimensional problems.

property that the monoid generated by the matrices appearing in their affine

classical operations of counter machines such as resets, permutations,

success in a variety of domains. One challenge in applying Q-learning to
continuous-action RL problems, however, is the continuous action maximization
(max-Q) required for optimal Bellman backup. In this work, we develop CAQL, a
(class of) algorithm(s) for continuous-action Q-learning that can use several
plug-and-play optimizers for the max-Q problem. Leveraging recent optimization
results for deep neural networks, we show that max-Q can be solved optimally
using mixed-integer programming (MIP). When the Q-function representation has
sufficient power, MIP-based optimization gives rise to better policies and is
more robust than approximate methods (e.g., gradient ascent, cross-entropy
search). We further develop several techniques to accelerate inference in CAQL,
which despite their approximate nature, perform well. We compare CAQL with
state-of-the-art RL algorithms on benchmark continuous-control problems that
have different degrees of action constraints and show that CAQL outperforms
policy-based methods in heavily constrained environments, often dramatically.

  Reparameterization offers Significant Performance and Efficiency Gains",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data dependent regularization is known to benefit a wide variety of problems
in machine learning. Often, these regularizers cannot be easily decomposed into
a sum over a finite number of terms, e.g., a sum over individual example-wise
terms. The $F_\beta$ measure, Area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) and Precision
at a fixed recall (P@R) are some prominent examples that are used in many
applications. We find that for most medium to large sized datasets, scalability
issues severely limit our ability in leveraging the benefits of such
regularizers. Importantly, the key technical impediment despite some recent
progress is that, such objectives remain difficult to optimize via
backpropapagation procedures. While an efficient general-purpose strategy for
this problem still remains elusive, in this paper, we show that for many
data-dependent nondecomposable regularizers that are relevant in applications,
sizable gains in efficiency are possible with minimal code-level changes; in
other words, no specialized tools or numerical schemes are needed. Our
procedure involves a reparameterization followed by a partial dualization --
this leads to a formulation that has provably cheap projection operators. We
present a detailed analysis of runtime and convergence properties of our
algorithm. On the experimental side, we show that a direct use of our scheme
significantly improves the state of the art IOU measures reported for MSCOCO

a generative model-based approach to define statistical depth for both

permits simple computation via Monte Carlo sampling and improves the depth
estimation accuracy. When applied to functional data, the proposed depth can
capture important features such as continuity, smoothness, or phase
variability, depending on the defining criteria. Specifically, we view
functional data as realizations from a second-order stochastic process, and
define their depths through the eigensystem of the covariance operator. These
new definitions are given through a proper metric related to the reproducing

algorithms to compute the proposed depths and establish estimation consistency.
Through simulations and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed functional

indirect method of detecting otherwise hidden companions is offered by their
effect on the outer parts of Be star disks, which are expected to be disrupted

originating in the disk, the disk truncation can be revealed by a turndown in
the spectral energy distribution due to reduced radio flux levels. In this work
we search for signs of spectral turndown in a sample of 57 classical Be stars

detections so far ($\lambda \approx$ 10\,cm) for 2 stars. We confidently detect
the turndown for all 26 stars with sufficient data coverage (20 of which are

are inconclusive as to whether the turndown is present or not. The analysis

of the Critical End Point from the thermodynamical parameters of the model
alone, without direct reference to the chiral susceptibility or any other

chiral quark models with a momentum independent constituent quark mass.

in \cite{MCruz:2017, Cruz2017}, is constrained using the joint of the latest
measurements of the Hubble parameter (OHD) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). Since
the expansion described by this solution does not present a transition from a
decelerated phase to an accelerated one, both phases can be well modeled
connecting both phases by requiring the continuity of the Hubble parameter at
$z=z_{t}$, the accelerated-decelerated transition redshift. Our best fit
constrains the main free parameters of the model to be $A_1=
1.58^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($A_2=0.84^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$) for the accelerated
(decelerated) phase. For both phases we obtain $q=-0.37^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$

equation of state, respectively. Comparing our model and LCDM statistically
through the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion
we obtain that the LCDM model is preferred by the OHD+SNIa data. Finally, it is
shown that the constrained parameters values satisfy the criterion for a
consistent fluid description of a dissipative dark matter component, but with a
high value of the speed of sound within the fluid, which is a drawback for a
consistent description of the structure formation. We briefly discuss the
possibilities to overcome this problem with a non-linear generalization of the
causal linear thermodynamics of bulk viscosity and also with the inclusion of
some form of dark energy.

additionally find no statistical correlation between the 1.4 GHz radio

attribute the lack of intrinsic absorption in our survey to the UV luminosity

rigorous framework for performing DFT-in-DFT and wave function in DFT

of each subsystem is expanded in only the basis functions associated with the
atoms of that subsystem, provide improved computationally efficiency for
WF-in-DFT calculations by reducing the number of orbitals in the WF
calculation. In this work, we extend absolutely localized projection-based
quantum embedding to study localized excited states using EOM-CCSD-in-DFT and
TDDFT-in-DFT. The embedding results are highly accurate compared to the
corresponding canonical EOM-CCSD and TDDFT results on the full system, with
TDDFT-in-DFT frequently more accurate than canonical TDDFT. The absolute
localization method is shown to eliminate the spurious low-lying excitation
energies for charge transfer states and prevent over delocalization of excited
states. Additionally, we attempt to recover the environment response caused by
the electronic excitations in the high-level subsystem using different schemes
and compare their accuracy. Finally, we apply this method to the calculation of
the excited state energy of green fluorescent protein and show that we
systematically converge to the full system results. Here we demonstrate how
this method can be useful in understanding excited states, specifically which
chemical moieties polarize to the excitation. This work shows absolutely
localized projection-based quantum embedding can treat local electronic

nodes that are capable of establishing social links. In order to deal with
misbehaving service provider nodes, service requestor nodes must evaluate their
trustworthiness levels. In this paper, we propose a novel trust management
mechanism in the SIoT to predict the most reliable service providers for each
service requestor, which leads to reduce the risk of being exposed to malicious
nodes. We model the SIoT with a flexible bipartite graph (containing two sets
of nodes: service providers and service requestors), then build a social
network among the service requestor nodes, using the Hellinger distance.
Afterward, we develop a social trust model using nodes' centrality and
similarity measures to extract trust behaviors among the social network nodes.
Finally, a matrix factorization technique is designed to extract latent
features of SIoT nodes, find trustworthy nodes, and mitigate the data sparsity
and cold start problems. We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed
trust prediction mechanism on prediction accuracy. The results indicate that

affected by the Earth's rotation, as well as by stable density stratification.
Using direct numerical simulations of forced Boussinesq equations, we study the
influence of these effects on the motion of fluid particles, focusing on cases
where the frequencies associated with rotation and stratification (RaS), $N$
and $f$ respectively, are held at a fixed ratio $N/f=5$. As the intensity of
RaS increases, a sharp transition is observed between a regime dominated by
eddies to a regime dominated by waves, which can also be seemingly described by
simply comparing the time scale $1/N$ and $\tau_\eta$ (the Kolmogorov time
scale). We perform a detailed study of Lagrangian statistics of acceleration,
velocity and related quantities in the two regimes. The flow anisotropy induces
a clear difference between particle motion in the horizontal and vertical
directions. In the regime $N\tau_\eta <1$, acceleration statistics in both
horizontal and vertical directions, exhibit well known characteristics of
isotropic turbulence. In contrast for $N\tau_\eta >1$, they are directly
influenced by imposed RaS. The Lagrangian velocity statistics exhibit visible
anisotropy for all runs; nevertheless the degree of anisotropy becomes very
strong in the regime $N\tau_\eta >1$. We find that in the regime $N\tau_\eta
<1$, rotation enhances the mean displacement of particles in horizontal planes
at short times, but inhibits them at longer times. This inhibition of
horizontal displacement becomes stronger for $N\tau_\eta >1$, with no clear
diffusive behavior. Displacements in the vertical direction are always
inhibited. The inhibition becomes extremely strong when $N\tau_\eta >1$, with
the particles almost being trapped horizontally.

dynamical complexity which makes them more challenging to model and control.
The impact of this added complexity to autonomous learning has not been
thoroughly explored. This is especially relevant to tendon-driven limbs whose
cables and tendons are inevitably elastic. Here, we explored the efficacy of
autonomous learning and control on a simulated bio-plausible tendon-driven leg
across different tendon stiffness values. We demonstrate that increasing
stiffness of the simulated muscles can require more iterations for the inverse
map to converge but can then perform more accurately, especially in discrete
tasks. Moreover, the system is robust to subsequent changes in muscle
stiffnesses and can adapt on-the-go within 5 attempts. Lastly, we test the
system for the functional task of locomotion, and found similar effects of
muscle stiffness to learning and performance. Given that a range of stiffness
values led to improved learning and maximized performance, we conclude the
robot bodies and autonomous controllers---at least for tendon-driven
systems---can be co-developed to take advantage of elastic elements.
Importantly, this opens also the door to development efforts that recapitulate
the beneficial aspects of the co-evolution of brains and bodies in vertebrates.

obtaining matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, so that there exists an $X$
satisfying the equation $\hat{A}X = \hat{B}$. Typically the problem is
overconstrained, meaning that $m \gg \max(n,d)$. The cost of the solution
$\hat{A}, \hat{B}$ is given by $\|A-\hat{A}\|_F^2 + \|B - \hat{B}\|_F^2$. We

Importantly, our running time is $\tilde{O}( \mathrm{nnz}(A) + \mathrm{nnz}(B)

$\mathrm{nnz}(C)$ denotes its number of non-zero entries. Importantly, our
running time does not directly depend on the large parameter $m$. As total
least squares regression is known to be solvable via low rank approximation, a
natural approach is to invoke fast algorithms for approximate low rank
approximation, obtaining matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ from this low rank
approximation, and then solving for $X$ so that $\hat{A}X = \hat{B}$. However,
existing algorithms do not apply since in total least squares the rank of the
low rank approximation needs to be $n$, and so the running time of known
methods would be at least $mn^2$. In contrast, we are able to achieve a much
faster running time for finding $X$ by never explicitly forming the equation
$\hat{A} X = \hat{B}$, but instead solving for an $X$ which is a solution to an
implicit such equation. Finally, we generalize our algorithm to the total least

strived for simplicity of use and easy transferability into a variety of

estimate the complete basis set limits. Using combinations of these approaches,
we achieved an accuracy of $\approx$ 1-10 mHa for K-Zn atoms and $\approx$
0.1-0.3 mHa for all other elements $-$ within about 1% or better of the ccECP

quantum state smoothing. Unfortunately, the cumulative errors in the most
typical simulations of quantum trajectories with a total time of simulation $T$
can reach orders of $T \Delta t$. Moreover, these errors may correspond to
deviations from valid quantum evolution as described by a completely positive
map. Here we introduce a higher-order method that reduces the cumulative errors
in the complete positivity of the evolution to of order $T\Delta t^2$, whether
for linear (unnormalised) or nonlinear (normalised) quantum trajectories. Our
method also guarantees that the discrepancy in the average evolution between
different detection methods (different `unravellings', such as quantum jumps or
quantum diffusion) is similarly small. This equivalence is essential for
comparing quantum state filtering to quantum state smoothing, as the latter
assumes that all irreversible evolution is unravelled, although the estimator
only has direct knowledge of some records. In particular, here we compare, for
the first time, the average difference between filtering and smoothing
conditioned on an event of which the estimator lacks direct knowledge: a photon
detection within a certain time window. We find that the smoothed state is
actually {\em less pure}, both before and after the time of the jump.
Similarly, the fidelity of the smoothed state with the `true' (maximal
knowledge) state is also lower than that of the filtered state before the jump.
However, after the jump, the fidelity of the smoothed state is higher.

is data-driven and conducted at the individual country or region level, often
in isolation. Consistent consideration of multi-scale interactions and their
non-linear dynamics is missing. Here, we develop a multiplexed network model,
where each city is modelled as a non-linear bi-stable system with stable states
in either war or peace. The causal factor categories which exasperate the risk
of conflict are each modelled as a network layer. We consider 3 layers: (1)
core geospatial network of interacting cities reflecting ground level
interactions, (2) cultural network of interacting countries reflecting cultural
groupings, and (3) political network of interacting countries reflecting
alliances. Together, they act as drivers to push cities towards or pull cities
away from war. Using a variety of data sources relative to 2002-2016, we show,
that our model correctly predicts the transitions from war to peace and peace
to war with F1 score of 0.78 to 0.92 worldwide at the city scale resolution. As
many conflicts during this period are auto-regressive (e.g. the War on Terror
in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Narco War across the Americas), we can predict the
emergence of new war or new peace. We demonstrate successful predictions across

such as food, rope, or clay. Cooking in particular relies heavily on cutting to
divide food items into desired shapes. However, cutting food is a challenging
task due to the wide range of material properties exhibited by food items. Due
to this variability, the same cutting motions cannot be used for all food
items. Sensations from contact events, e.g., when placing the knife on the food
item, will also vary depending on the material properties, and the robot will
need to adapt accordingly. In this paper, we propose using vibrations and
force-torque feedback from the interactions to adapt the slicing motions and
monitor for contact events. The robot learns neural networks for performing
each of these tasks and generalizing across different material properties. By
adapting and monitoring the skill executions, the robot is able to reliably cut
through more than 20 different types of food items and even detect whether
certain food items are fresh or old.

media has important applications in many engineering areas. However, numerical
solutions on the fine grid are often prohibitively expensive, and multiscale
model reduction techniques are introduced to efficiently solve for an accurate
approximation on the coarse grid. In this paper, we propose an energy
minimization based multiscale model reduction approach in the discontinuous
Galerkin discretization setting. The main idea of the method is to extract the
non-decaying component in the high conductivity regions by identifying dominant
modes with small eigenvalues of local spectral problems, and define multiscale
basis functions in coarse oversampled regions by constraint energy minimization
problems. The multiscale basis functions are in general discontinuous on the
coarse grid and coupled by interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin formulation.
The minimal degree of freedom in representing high-contrast features is
achieved through the design of local spectral problems, which provides the most
compressed local multiscale space. We analyze the method for solving Darcy flow
problem and show that the convergence is linear in coarse mesh size and
independent of the contrast, provided that the oversampling size is
appropriately chosen. Numerical results are presented to show the performance
of the method for simulation on flow problem and wave propagation in

galaxy populations, i.e., red sequence (RS), blue cloud (BC), and green valley
(GV) galaxies, according to their rest-frame extinction-corrected UV colors.
The correlation lengths of these populations are confirmed to be dependent on
their rest-frame UV color and redshift: UV redder galaxies are found to be more
clustered. In all redshift bins, the GV galaxies generally have medium
clustering amplitudes and are hosted within dark matter halos whose masses are
more or less between those of RS and BC galaxies; and the clustering amplitude
of GV galaxies is close to that of AGNs in the same redshift bin, suggesting
that AGN activity may be responsible for transforming galaxy colors. After
carefully examining their stellar masses, we find that the clustering
amplitudes of galaxy samples with different colors are all similar once they
have a similar median stellar mass and that the median stellar mass alone may
be a good predictor of galaxy clustering.

default metric suffers from ambiguity, and worse, all augmentations of

Instead we propose that the defining characteristic of a community is that

propose a novel metric for the community detection based directly on this

function: $$ \sum_{0 < \ell < \sqrt{xT}/2} \Psi([e^{\sqrt{x -
\frac{(2\ell)^2}{T}}},\ e^{\sqrt{x - \frac{(2\ell-1)^2}{T}}}])\
=\Psi(e^{\sqrt{x}})\left(\frac{1}{2} + O\left
(e^{-0.196\sqrt{x}}\right)\right), $$ where $T=e^{0.786\sqrt{x}}$, where
$\Psi([a,b]) := \sum_{n\in [a,b]} \Lambda(n)$ and $\Psi(x) = \Psi([1,x])$,
where $\Lambda$ is the von Mangoldt function. Note that this last equation (sum
over $\ell$) is stronger than one would get using a strong form of the Prime
Number Theorem and also a naive use of the Riemann Hypothesis in each interval,
since the widths of the intervals are smaller than $e^{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x}}$,
making the RH estimate ``trivial"".

  Segmentation","ICCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose the differentiable mask-matching network (DMM-Net)
for solving the video object segmentation problem where the initial object
masks are provided. Relying on the Mask R-CNN backbone, we extract mask
proposals per frame and formulate the matching between object templates and
proposals at one time step as a linear assignment problem where the cost matrix
is predicted by a CNN. We propose a differentiable matching layer by unrolling
a projected gradient descent algorithm in which the projection exploits the
Dykstra's algorithm. We prove that under mild conditions, the matching is
guaranteed to converge to the optimum. In practice, it performs similarly to
the Hungarian algorithm during inference. Meanwhile, we can back-propagate
through it to learn the cost matrix. After matching, a refinement head is
leveraged to improve the quality of the matched mask. Our DMM-Net achieves
competitive results on the largest video object segmentation dataset
YouTube-VOS. On DAVIS 2017, DMM-Net achieves the best performance without
online learning on the first frames. Without any fine-tuning, DMM-Net performs
comparably to state-of-the-art methods on SegTrack v2 dataset. At last, our
matching layer is very simple to implement; we attach the PyTorch code ($<50$
lines) in the supplementary material. Our code is released at

residual block network with attention mechanism is proposed. In this method, 10
kinds of communication signals with Gaussian white noise are generated from
standard data sets, such as MASK, MPSK, MFSK, OFDM, 16QAM, AM and FM. Based on
the original RNN neural network, residual block network is added to solve the
problem of gradient disappearance caused by deep network layers. Attention
mechanism is added to the network to accelerate the gradient descent. In the
experiment, 16QAM, 2FSK and 4FSK are used as actual samples, IQ data frames of
signals are used as input, and the RNN neural network combined with residual
block network and attention mechanism is trained. The final recognition results
show that the average recognition rate of real-time signals is over 93%. The

  Abstract",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from poor
performance on important subsets of a population that are not identified during

aggressive cancer subtype. We refer to this problem as hidden stratification,
and observe that it results from incompletely describing the meaningful
variation in a dataset. While hidden stratification can substantially reduce
the clinical efficacy of machine learning models, its effects remain difficult
to measure. In this work, we assess the utility of several possible techniques
for measuring and describing hidden stratification effects, and characterize
these effects on multiple medical imaging datasets. We find evidence that
hidden stratification can occur in unidentified imaging subsets with low
prevalence, low label quality, subtle distinguishing features, or spurious
correlates, and that it can result in relative performance differences of over
20% on clinically important subsets. Finally, we explore the clinical
implications of our findings, and suggest that evaluation of hidden

to determine the long-time dynamical behavior of the solution $u(t,x)$ by using
the notion of propagation terrace introduced by Ducrot, Giletti and Matano

very large class of nonlinearities, and show the convergence of the solution
$u(t,x)$ to the terrace as $t\to\infty$ under various conditions on $f$ or

$f$. Furthermore, if $u_0$ is more general such that it can be trapped between
two Heaviside type functions, but not necessarily monotone, we show that the
convergence result remains valid under a rather mild non-degeneracy assumption

ranging (Lidar) scans and uses it to classify the points and also map objects

point cloud, including intensity peak detection, dual return detection, plane
fitting, and finding the boundaries. These approaches can classify the point
cloud and detect the reflection in it. By mirroring the reflection points on
the detected window pane and adding classification labels on the points, we can
improve the map quality in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

identified with nonlinear Grassmannians of compact surfaces enclosing a given
volume and endowed with a closed 1-form describing the vorticity density. If
the vorticity density has discrete period group and is nonvanishing, the vortex
sheet is given by a surface of genus one fibered by its vortex lines over a
circle. We determine the Hamilton equations for such vortex sheets relative to
the Hamiltonian function suggested in Khesin (2012) and prove that there are no
stationary solutions having rotational symmetries. These coadjoint orbits are
shown to be prequantizable if the period group of the 1-form and the volume
enclosed by the surface satisfy an Onsager-Feynman relation, as argued in
Goldin et al. (1991) for the case of open vortex sheets (tubes/ribbons). We
find a character for the prequantizable coadjoint orbits, as well as a
polarization group on which the character extends, which is a first step beyond
prequantization.

to ask how can the global model be personalized for every such device,

Meta Learning (MAML), where one optimizes for a fast, gradient-based, few-shot
adaptation to a heterogeneous distribution of tasks, has a number of
similarities with the objective of personalization for FL. We present FL as a
natural source of practical applications for MAML algorithms, and make the
following observations. 1) The popular FL algorithm, Federated Averaging, can
be interpreted as a meta learning algorithm. 2) Careful fine-tuning can yield a
global model with higher accuracy, which is at the same time easier to
personalize. However, solely optimizing for the global model accuracy yields a
weaker personalization result. 3) A model trained using a standard datacenter
optimization method is much harder to personalize, compared to one trained
using Federated Averaging, supporting the first claim. These results raise new
questions for FL, MAML, and broader ML research.

one of the important functions to manipulate objects to the target pose. Since
in-hand manipulation tends to cause occlusions by the hand or the object
itself, image information only is not sufficient for in-hand object pose
estimation. Multiple modalities can be used in this case, the advantage is that
other modalities can compensate for occlusion, noise, and sensor malfunctions.
Even though deciding the utilization rate of a modality (referred to as

paper, we propose deep gated multi-modal learning, which self-determines the
reliability value of each modality through end-to-end deep learning. For the

variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system, which is used to make two
distant legitimate parties share identical corrected keys. The adaptive
reconciliation is necessary and important for practical systems to cope with
the variable channel. Many researchers adopt the punctured LDPC codes to
implement adaptive reconciliation. In this paper, a novel rateless
reconciliation protocol based on spinal code is proposed, which can achieve a
high-efficiency and adaptive reconciliation in a larger range of SNRs. Due to
the short codes length and simple tructure, our protocol is easy to implement
without the complex codes designs of fixed rate codes, e.g., LDPC codes.
Meanwhile, the structure of our protocol is highly parallel, which is suitable
for hardware implementation, thus it also has the potential of high-speed
hardware implementation. Besides, the security of proposed protocol is proved
in theory. Experiment results show that the reconciliation efficiency maintains
around 95% for ranging SNRs in a larger range (0,0.5), even exceeds 96.5% at
extremely low SNR (<= 0.03) by using this novel scheme. The proposed protocol
makes the long-distance CV-QKD systems much easier and stable to perform a
high-performance and adaptive reconciliation.

where $\phi(M)=\min_{S\subseteq[n],|S|\leq n/2}\left(\frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{i\in

$\phi(A)$ and the spectral gap $1-\text{Re}\lambda_{2}(A)$ for any doubly

nontrivial eigenvalue of $A$ with maximum real part. Fiedler showed that the
upper bound on $\phi(A)$ is unaffected, i.e.,
$\phi(A)\leq\sqrt{2\cdot(1-\text{Re}\lambda_{2}(A))}$. With regards to the
lower bound on $\phi(A)$, there are known constructions with \[
\phi(A)\in\Theta\left(\frac{1-\text{Re}\lambda_{2}(A)}{\log n}\right), \]

$A$, \[\phi(A)\geq\frac{1-\text{Re}\lambda_{2}(A)}{35\cdot n}.\]
  Our second result extends these bounds to general nonnegative matrices $R$,
obtaining a two-sided quantitative refinement of the Perron-Frobenius theorem
in which the edge expansion $\phi(R)$ (appropriately defined), a quantitative

ecosystems' dynamical stability have revealed that population dynamics, being

and field research has provided mounting evidence of chaos in species'
abundances, especially for discrete-time systems. Discrete-time dynamics,
mainly arising in boreal and temperate ecosystems for species with
non-overlapping generations, have been largely studied to understand the
dynamical outcomes due to changes in relevant ecological parameters. The local
and global dynamical behaviour of many of these models is difficult to
investigate analytically in the parameter space and, typically, numerical
approaches are employed when the dimension of the phase space is large. In this
article we provide topological and dynamical results for a map modelling a
discrete-time, three-species food chain with two predator species interacting
on the same prey population. The domain where dynamics live is characterized,
as well as the so-called escaping regions, for which the species go rapidly to
extinction after surpassing the carrying capacity. We also provide a full
description of the local stability of equilibria within a volume of the
parameter space given by the prey's growth rate and the predation rates. We
have found that the increase of the pressure of predators on the prey results
in chaos. The entry into chaos is achieved via a supercritical Neimarck-Sacker
bifurcation followed by period-doubling bifurcations of invariant curves.
Interestingly, an increasing predation directly on preys can shift the
extinction of top predators to their survival, allowing an unstable persistence
of the three species by means of periodic and strange chaotic attractors.

rank models accordingly. Although the nonparametric bootstrap is almost always
used to assess the variability of a parameter, it can be used as the basis for
cross-validation if one keeps track of which items were not selected in a given
bootstrap iteration. The items which were selected constitute the training data
and the omitted items constitute the testing data. This bootstrap
cross-validation (BS-CV) allows model selection to be made on the basis of
predictive ability by comparing the median values of ensembles of summary
statistics of testing data. BS-CV is herein demonstrated using several summary
statistics, including a new one termed the simple metric for prediction quality
(SMPQ), and using the warfarin data included in the Monolix distribution with
13 pharmacokinetics (PK) models and 12 pharmacodynamics (PD) models. Of note
the two best PK models by AIC had the worst predictive ability, underscoring
the danger of using single realizations of a random variable (such as AIC) as
the basis for model selection. Using these data BS-CV was able to discriminate
between similar indirect response models (inhibition of input versus

equally, but some marginal possible worlds may cause negative effects. (2) They
do not well utilize the consistency among possible worlds, since they conduct
clustering or construct the affinity matrix on each possible world
independently. In this paper, we propose a representative possible world based

representative loss and using Jensen-Shannon divergence as the distribution
measure, we design a heuristic strategy for the selection of representative
possible worlds, thus avoiding the negative effects caused by marginal possible

clustering to deal with the representative possible worlds synergistically,
thus utilizing the consistency to achieve better performance. Experimental

retrieval approach that allows to query visual media collections by sketching
concept maps, thereby merging sketch-based retrieval with the search for
semantic labels. Users can draw a spatial distribution of different concept
labels, such as ""sky"", ""sea"" or ""person"" and then use these sketches to find

Hence, this approach does not only take the semantic concepts themselves into

The efficient vector representation enables efficient retrieval even in large

in presence of two non-commuting observables. Like all other measures, we show
that the proposed measure satisfies some basic axioms. Also, we find that this

that the quantumness in a single system is still an interesting question to

for hyperbolic conservation laws of Del Rey Fernandez et al. (2019), is
extended from the compressible Euler equations to the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. A simple and flexible coupling procedure with planar
interpolation operators between adjoining nonconforming elements is used.
Curvilinear volume metric terms are numerically approximated via a minimization
procedure and satisfy the discrete geometric conservation law conditions.
Distinct curvilinear surface metrics are used on the adjoining interfaces to
construct the interface coupling terms, thereby localizing the discrete
geometric conservation law constraints to each individual element. The
resulting scheme is entropy conservative/stable, element-wise conservative, and
freestream preserving. Viscous interface dissipation operators are developed
that retain the entropy stability of the base scheme. The accuracy and
stability properties of the resulting numerical scheme are shown to be
comparable to those of the original conforming scheme (achieving ~p+1
convergence) in the context of the viscous shock problem, the Taylor-Green
vortex problem at a Reynolds number of Re=1,600, and a subsonic turbulent flow

  Results: We present Netboost, a three-step dimension reduction technique.
First, a boosting-based filter is combined with the topological overlap measure
to identify the essential edges of the network. Second, sparse hierarchical
clustering is applied on the selected edges to identify modules and finally
module information is aggregated by the first principal components. The primary
analysis is than carried out on these summary measures instead of the original

on cross-validated prediction error curve estimates, its prediction superiority
over variable selection on the full dataset as well as over an alternative

functions that are expensive to evaluate. While traditional methods optimize
each black-box function in isolation, there has been recent interest in
speeding up BO by transferring knowledge across multiple related black-box

search space by relying on evaluations of previous black-box functions. We
depart from the common practice of defining a set of arbitrary search ranges a
priori by considering search space geometries that are learned from historical

our approach considerably boosts BO by reducing the size of the search space,
thus accelerating the optimization of a variety of black-box optimization

results in a parameter-free, easy-to-implement, robust hyperparameter
optimization strategy. We hope it will constitute a natural baseline for
further research attempting to warm-start BO.

superconducting pairing originates as an instability of the effective

An important implication of this result is that the effective interaction
always remains finite, even at phase-transition points, directly contradicting
the often used assumption of linear relationship between the interaction and
susceptibility, established within the random-phase approximation. By analyzing
the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the context of unconventional superconductivity,
we find that the presence of a flat band close the Fermi level, found in
materials such as twisted bilayer graphene, has a twofold favorable impact
persisting beyond the weak-coupling approximation: a reduced kinetic energy
cost of the gap formation and an increased anisotropy of the effective
interaction, favoring a momentum dependent order parameter.

the observed data originates, is de facto a fundamental goal of representation
learning. Yet, most deep generative models do not address the question of
identifiability, and thus fail to deliver on the promise of the recovery of the
true latent sources that generate the observations. Recent work proposed
identifiable generative modelling using variational autoencoders (iVAE) with a
theory of identifiability. Due to the intractablity of KL divergence between
variational approximate posterior and the true posterior, however, iVAE has to
maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood, leading to
suboptimal solutions in both theory and practice. In contrast, we propose an
identifiable framework for estimating latent representations using a flow-based
model (iFlow). Our approach directly maximizes the marginal likelihood,
allowing for theoretical guarantees on identifiability, thereby dispensing with
variational approximations. We derive its optimization objective in analytical
form, making it possible to train iFlow in an end-to-end manner. Simulations on
synthetic data validate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed
method and demonstrate its practical advantages over other existing methods.

derive more advanced strategic policies. Two attention networks, the
inter-agent and inter-group attention layers, are used to effectively model
individual and group level interactions, respectively. The two attention

tasks with different agent compositions and allow one to interpret the learned

and the strangeness, have been calculated at finite temperature and chemical
potential up to the fourth order. The calculations are done in a 2+1 flavor low
energy effective theory, where quantum and thermal fluctuations are encoded
through the evolution of flow equations within the functional renormalization
group approach. Strangeness neutrality and a fixed ratio of the electric charge
to the baryon number density are implemented throughout the computation. We
find that higher-order correlations carry more sensitive critical dynamics in
comparison to the quadratic ones, and a non-monotonic dependence of the
fourth-order correlations between the baryon number and strangeness,
$-\chi^{BS}_{31}/\chi^{S}_{2}$ and $\chi^{BS}_{22}/\chi^{S}_{2}$, on the
collision energy is found.

which mark significant departures from classical notion. They basically refer
to the presence of quantum correlations between separated systems which violate
a non-local inequality, the violation being not possible if we restrict
ourselves only to classical correlations. In view of the importance of such
unique correlations one may be interested to generate more non-local states
starting from a few, a protocol which is termed as broadcasting. However in the
present submission we show that if one restricts to broadcasting through
quantum cloning, then such non-local states cannot be broadcasted. Our study is
done in the purview of the Bell-CHSH inequality and a steering inequality
pertaining to three measurement settings. We also find suitable restrictions on
the Werner and Bell diagonal states which will make them unsteerable under any
number of measurement settings, after broadcasting.

multiple-output (CFmMIMO) networks to support any federated learning (FL)
framework. This scheme allows each instead of all the iterations of the FL
framework to happen in a large-scale coherence time to guarantee a stable
operation of an FL process. To show how to optimize the FL performance using
this proposed scheme, we consider an existing FL framework as an example and
target FL training time minimization for this framework. An optimization
problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the local accuracy, transmit
power, data rate, and users' processing frequency. This mixed-timescale
stochastic nonconvex problem captures the complex interactions among the
training time, and transmission and computation of training updates of one FL
process. By employing the online successive convex approximation approach, we
develop a new algorithm to solve the formulated problem with proven convergence
to the neighbourhood of its stationary points. Our numerical results confirm
that the presented joint design reduces the training time by up to $55\%$ over
baseline approaches. They also show that CFmMIMO here requires the lowest
training time for FL processes compared with cell-free time-division multiple

to realize this protocol in a physical system of two Dicke models, with two

direction, the Bjorken flow is unable to describe certain observables in heavy
ion collisions. This caveat has motivated the introduction of analytical
relativistic hydrodynamics (RH) solutions with transverse expansion, in
particular, the 3+1 self-similar (SSF) and Gubser flows. Inspired by recent
generalizations of the Bjorken flow to the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD), we present a procedure for a generalization of RH solutions to RMHD.
Our method is mainly based on symmetry arguments. Using this method, we find
the relation between RH degrees of freedom and the magnetic field evolution in
the ideal limit for an infinitely conductive fluid, and determine the proper
time dependence of the magnetic field in aforementioned flows. In the case of
SSF, a family of solutions are found that are related through a certain
differential equation. To find the magnetic field evolution in the Gubser flow,
we solve RMHD equations for a stationary fluid in a conformally flat
$dS^3\times E^1$ spacetime. The result is then Weyl transformed back into the
Minkowski spacetime. In this case, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field
exhibits a transmission between $1/t$ to $1/t^3$ near the center of the
collision. The longitudinal component of the magnetic field is found to be
sensitive to the transverse size of the fluid. We also find the radial
evolution of the magnetic field for both flows. The radial domain of validity
in the case of SSF is highly restricted, in contrast to the Gubser flow. A
comparison of the results suggests that the Gubser RMHD may give a more
appropriate qualitative picture of the magnetic field decay in the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP).

choosing a design to minimise expectation of a given loss function over the
space of all designs. The loss function encapsulates the aim of the experiment,
and the expectation is taken with respect to the joint distribution of all
unknown quantities implied by the statistical model that will be fitted to
observed responses. In this paper, an extended framework is proposed whereby
the expectation of the loss is taken with respect to a joint distribution
implied by an alternative statistical model. Motivation for this includes
promoting robustness, ensuring computational feasibility and for allowing
realistic prior specification when deriving a design. To aid in exploring the
new framework, an asymptotic approximation to the expected loss under an
alternative model is derived, and the properties of different loss functions
are established. The framework is then demonstrated on a linear regression
versus full-treatment model scenario, on estimating parameters of a non-linear
model under model discrepancy and a cubic spline model under an unknown number
of basis functions.

It\^o-L\'{e}vy process, with a singular drift term. This can for example model
a situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which
intervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow
& Protter for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian
motion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas & Shreve (in the continuous
setting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in
the case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there
is a delay in the system.
  In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift
term modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay \theta>0
in the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price
dynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump
process (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are
essential in order to get more realistic financial market models.
  Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate
and portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long
as the delay \theta> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market
in that case. However, when \theta goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This
is in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no
delay.
  Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because
high frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close
to infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on
time sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the
pricing dynamics. See e.g. Lachapelle et al and the references therein.

computational costs of neural networks. Conventional approaches follow a fixed
paradigm which first trains a large and redundant network, and then determines
which units (e.g., channels) are less important and thus can be removed. In
this work, we find that pre-training an over-parameterized model is not
necessary for obtaining the target pruned structure. In fact, a fully-trained
over-parameterized model will reduce the search space for the pruned structure.
We empirically show that more diverse pruned structures can be directly pruned
from randomly initialized weights, including potential models with better
performance. Therefore, we propose a novel network pruning pipeline which
allows pruning from scratch. In the experiments for compressing classification
models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, our approach not only greatly reduces
the pre-training burden of traditional pruning methods, but also achieves
similar or even higher accuracy under the same computation budgets. Our results
facilitate the community to rethink the effectiveness of existing techniques

to color objects since the dawn of civilization. While it has been the
exclusive domain of artists and craftspeople for millennia, the last century
has seen the introduction of a scientific basis to color communication. The
ultimate goal of this development is for color communication to happen
seamlessly and in a transparent way. There are however two categories of
challenges here: first, understanding and quantifying color needs and
expectation and second, developing control mechanisms that deliver the desired
color. In this paper a review will be presented of the color needs in
end-to-end color journeys, from initial concept to final colored object and an
overview of recent developments in color printing will follow. Topics like
imaging pipelines (including the recently-introduced HP Pixel Control), the
ease of use of color workflows (including HP Smart Color Tools), the handling
of brand or corporate identity colors (via HP Professional PANTONE Emulation)
and the measurement of color difference under specific viewing arrangements
(i.e., the dENS metric for viewing samples without separation) will be
addressed. Finally, a series of challenges for the future will be set out, so
that their solution can be approached by both academic and industrial
communities.

from a quantum key distribution protocol under given conditions is one of the
most important things that need to be done in security proof. In addition to
source loopholes and detection loopholes, channel attacks are considered to be
the main ways of information leakage, while collective attacks are considered
to be the most powerful active channel attacks. Here we deduce in detail the
capability limit of Eve's collective attack in non-entangled quantum key
distribution, like BB84 and measurement-device-independent protocols, and
entangled quantum key distribution, like device-independent protocol, in which
collective attack is composed of quantum weak measurement and quantum
unambiguous state discrimination detection. The theoretical results show that
collective attacks are equivalent in entangled and non-entangled quantum key
distribution protocols. We also find that compared with the security proof
based on entanglement purification, the security proof based on collective
attack not only improves the system's tolerable bit error rate, but also
improves the key rate.

$\mathbb B^n$ in $\mathbb R^n$ which improves both the classical singular
Moser--Trudinger inequality and the classical Hardy inequality at the same
time. More precisely, we show that for any $\beta \in [0,n)$ there exists a
constant $C>0$ depending only on $n$ and $\beta$ such that \[ \sup_{u\in

$\alpha_n = n \omega_{n-1}^{\frac1{n-1}}$ with $\omega_{n-1}$ being the surface
area of the unit sphere $S^{n-1} = \partial \mathbb B^n$, and \[ \mathcal H(u)
= \int_{\mathbb B^n} |\nabla u|^n dx -\left(\frac{2(n-1)}n\right)^n
\int_{\mathbb B^n} \frac{|u|^n}{(1-|x|^2)^n} dx. \] This extends an inequality
of Wang and Ye in dimension two to higher dimensions and to the singular case
as well. The proof is based on the method of transplantation of Green's
functions and without using the blow-up analysis method. As a consequence, we
obtain a singular Moser--Trudinger inequality in the hyperbolic spaces which
confirms affirmatively a conjecture by Mancini, Sandeep and Tintarev

with approximately $3\%$ of persistent radio sources exhibiting variability
which is largely AGN-related. In the faint (<mJy) flux density regime, it is
widely accepted that the radio source population begins to change from AGN
dominated to star-formation dominated, together with an emergent radio-quiet
AGN component. Very little is known about the variable source component in this
sub-mJy regime. In this paper, we provide the first insight into the $\mu$Jy
variable sky by performing a careful analysis using deep VLA data in the well
studied GOODS-N field. Using five epochs spread across 22 years, we investigate
approximately 480 radio sources finding 10 which show signs of variability. We
attribute this variability to the presence of an AGN in these systems. We
confirm and extend the results of previous surveys, finding that variability in
the faint radio sky is rather modest with only $\leq$2\% of sources exhibiting
significant variability between any two epochs. We find that 70\% of variable
sources show variability on timescales of a few days whilst on longer decadal
time-scales, the fraction of variable sources decreases to $<1\%$. This
suggests that the radio variability peaks on shorter timescales as suggested by
other studies. We find that 80\% of variable sources have VLBI counterparts,
and we use multi-wavelength data to infer that these may well be core-dominated
FR-I sources as postulated by wide-field VLBI surveys and semi-empirical
simulations.

Main difficulties are related to the limited spatial resolution and angular
field of view of holographic displays in combination with the complexity of
steering and operating them for such tasks. Alternatively, non-holographic
displays - and in particular light-field displays - can be utilized to
visualize the numerically reconstructed content of a digital hologram. However,
their suitability as alternative for holographic displays has not been
validated. In this research, we have investigated this issue via a set of
comprehensive experiments. We used Fourier holographic principle to acquire a
diverse set of holograms, which were either computer-generated from point
clouds or optically recorded from real macroscopic objects. A final public data
set comprising 96 holograms was created using three compression methods which
encoded the holograms at four bit-depths. Three separate subjective-tests were
conducted using a holographic display, a light field display and a 2D display.
For these subjective experiments, a double stimulus, multi-perspective,
multi-depth subjective testing methodology was designed and implemented. The
tests show that the non-holographic displays indicate a higher sensitivity to
artifacts than the holographic display, though at the same time it is
demonstrated they are highly correlated. This indicates that the numerically
reconstructed holograms rendered on a light field or 2D display have a high
predictive value for the perceived quality on holographic display.

followed by negative magnetization is observed in the zero-field-cooled curve
of the sample, suggesting the formation of canted ferromagnetic domains or
antiparallel spins and clusters that are separated by an antiphase boundary.
The large bifurcation between the ZFC and FC curves has been observed,
suggesting strong spin frustration is present in the system. More
interestingly, sharp multiple steps in magnetization are observed in M-H curve
at 2 K and observed only in the forward field-sweep direction which vanishes on
increasing temperature. Moreover, prominent smaller peaks immediately above the
long-range ordering temperature are observed suggesting the presence of
preformed percolating clusters which eventually gives rise to Griffiths like
phase which is seen in DC as well in AC susceptibility. The real part of AC
susceptibility with DC bias shows an unusual sharp peak near TC that broadens
on increasing field strength and splits into two maxima around 750 Oe, which is
attributed to the presence of critical fluctuations associated with a
continuous transition to the FM state and large magnetic anisotropy in the

  Tyranny to Anarchy","Updated to final version published in Nature Scientific Reports",,,,"nlin.AO physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coordinated human behaviour takes place within a diverse range of social
organisational structures, which can be thought of as power structures with
""managers"" who influence ""subordinates"". A change in policy in one part of the
organisation can cause cascades throughout the structure, which may or may not
be desirable. As organisations change in size, complexity and structure, the
system dynamics also change. Here, we consider majority rule dynamics on
organisations modelled as hierarchical directed graphs, where the directed
edges indicate influence. We utilise a topological measure called the trophic
incoherence parameter, q, which effectively gauges the stratification of power
structure in an organisation. We show that this measure bounds regimes of
behaviour. There is fast consensus at low q (e.g. tyranny), slow consensus at
mid q (e.g. democracy), and no consensus at high q (e.g. anarchy). These
regimes are investigated analytically, numerically and empirically with diverse
case studies in the Roman Army, US Government, and a healthcare organisation.
Our work demonstrates the usefulness of the trophic incoherence parameter when
considering models of social influence dynamics, with widespread consequences
in the design and analysis of organisations.

\emph{tracking-by-detection} paradigm. It has 1) a detection model for target
localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having
the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the
running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential
structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on
real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially
real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we
propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to
be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance
embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can
simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further
propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the
joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced
compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for
future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this
work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22
to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution. Meanwhile, its tracking accuracy
is comparable to the state-of-the-art trackers embodying separate detection and
embedding (SDE) learning ($64.4\%$ MOTA \vs $66.1\%$ MOTA on MOT-16 challenge).

antipersistent. We estimate the probability $P(x,t)$ that the walker is at $x$

show ballistic behaviour, i.e., $\nu = 2$. As $p$ is varied from zero to 1, the
system is found in four different phases characterised by the value of $\nu$:
$\nu =2$ at $p=0$, $1 \leq \nu \leq 3/2$ for $0 < p < p_c$, $\nu = 3/2$ for $
p_c < p <1$ and $\nu = 2$ again at $p=1$. $p_c$ is found to be very close to
$1/3$ numerically. Close to $p=0,1$, the scaling behaviour shows a crossover in
time. Associated with this crossover, two diverging timescales varying as $1/p$

different scheme in which the antipersistence behaviour is suppressed, one gets
$\nu= 3/2$ for the entire region $0 < p< 1$. Further, a measure of the entropy

compression. The crystal field in the compressed Ba$_2$CuO$_4$ leads to an
inverted Cu $3d$ $e_g$ complex with the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital sitting below the
$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and an electronic structure highly unusual compared to the
conventional cuprates. We construct a two-orbital Hubbard model for the Cu
$d^9$ state at hole doping $x=2\delta$ and study the orbital-dependent strong
correlation and superconductivity. For the undoped case at $x=0$, we found that
strong correlation drives an orbital-polarized Mott insulating state with the
spin-$1/2$ moment of the localized $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. In contrast to the
single-band cuprates where superconductivity is suppressed in the overdoped
regime, hole doping the two-orbital Mott insulator leads to orbital-dependent
correlations and the robust spin and orbital exchange interactions produce a
high-$T_c$ antiphase $d$-wave superconductor even in the heavily doped regime
at $x=0.4$. We conjecture that Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ realizes mixtures of such
heavily hole-doped superconducting Ba$_2$CuO$_4$ and disordered Ba$_2$CuO$_{3}$
chains in a single-layer or predominately separated bilayer structure. Our
findings suggest that unconventional cuprates with liberated orbitals as doped
two-band Mott insulators can be a direction for realizing high-T$_c$
superconductivity with enhanced transition temperature $T_c$.

hard spheres each, generated by various static algorithms. Their packing
fraction varies from 0.370 up to 0.593. These aggregates are shown to be based
on two types of disordered structures: random regular polytetrahedra and random
aggregates, the former giving rise to $\delta$ peaks on pair distribution
functions. Distortion of structural (Delaunay) tetrahedra is studied by two
parameters, which show some similarities and some differences in terms of
overall tendencies. Isotropy of aggregates is characterized by the nematic
order parameter. The overall structure is then studied by distinguishing
spheres in function of their contact coordination number (CCN). Distributions
of average CCN around spheres of a given CCN value show trends that depend on
packing fraction and building algorithms. The radial dependency of the average
CCN turns out to be dependent upon the CCN of the central sphere and shows
discontinuities that resemble those of the pair distribution function.
Moreover, it is shown that structural details appear when the CCN is used as
pseudo chemical parameter, such as various angular distribution of bond angles,
partial pair distribution functions, Ashcroft-Langreth and Bhatia-Thornton
partial structure factors. These allow distinguishing aggregates with the same
values of packing fraction or average tetrahedral distortion or even similar

attention to contact coordination numbers to study more precisely the structure

metallicity on the strength of the winds of the hot hydrogen-rich subdwarfs HD
49798 and BD+18$^\circ\,$2647. We used UV and optical spectra to derive stellar
parameters and abundances. For derived stellar parameters, we predicted wind
structure (including mass-loss rates and terminal velocities) with our METUJE
code. We derived effective temperature $T_\text{eff}=45\,900\,$K and mass
$M=1.46\,M_\odot$ for HD 49798 and $T_\text{eff}=73\,000\,$K and
$M=0.38\,M_\odot$ for BD+18$^\circ\,$2647. The abundances can be interpreted as
a result of interplay between stellar evolution and diffusion. HD 49798 has a
strong wind that does not allow for chemical separation and consequently it
shows solar chemical composition modified by hydrogen burning. On the other
hand, we did not find any wind in BD+18$^\circ\,$2647 and its abundances are
therefore most likely affected by radiative diffusion. Accurate abundances do
not lead to a significant modification of wind mass-loss rate for HD 49798,
because the increase of the contribution of Fe and Ni to the radiative force is
compensated by the decrease of the force due to other elements. The resulting
wind mass-loss rate $\dot M=2.1\times10^{-9}\,M_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ predicts
an X-ray light curve during the eclipse which closely agrees with observations.
On the other hand, the absence of the wind in BD+18$^\circ\,$2647 for accurate
abundances is a result of its peculiar chemical composition. Wind models with
accurate abundances provide more reliable wind parameters, but the influence of
abundances on the wind parameters is limited in many cases.

received significant attention recently. However, it has been observed that in
terms of some attributes, e.g. the number of simple geometric primitives in an
image, GANs are not able to learn the target distribution in practice.
Motivated by this observation, we discover two specific problems of GANs
leading to anomalous generalization behaviour, which we refer to as the sample
insufficiency and the pixel-wise combination. For the first problem of sample
insufficiency, we show theoretically and empirically that the batchsize of the
training samples in practice may be insufficient for the discriminator to learn
an accurate discrimination function. It could result in unstable training
dynamics for the generator, leading to anomalous generalization. For the second
problem of pixel-wise combination, we find that besides recognizing the
positive training samples as real, under certain circumstances, the
discriminator could be fooled to recognize the pixel-wise combinations (e.g.
pixel-wise average) of the positive training samples as real. However, those
combinations could be visually different from the real samples in the target
distribution. With the fooled discriminator as reference, the generator would
obtain biased supervision further, leading to the anomalous generalization
behaviour. Additionally, in this paper, we propose methods to mitigate the
anomalous generalization of GANs. Extensive experiments on benchmark show our
proposed methods improve the FID score up to 30\% on natural image dataset.

exoplanets are elucidated. When computing the transit radius as a function of
wavelength, one needs to specify a reference transit radius corresponding to a
reference pressure. Mathematically, the reference transit radius is a constant
of integration that originates from evaluating an integral for the transit
depth. Physically, its interpretation has been debated in the literature.
Jordan & Espinoza (2018) suggested that the optical depth is discontinuous
across, and infinite below, the reference transit radius. Betremieux & Swain
(2017, 2018) interpreted the spherical surface located at the reference transit
radius to represent the boundary associated with an opaque cloud deck. It is
demonstrated that continuous functions for the optical depth may be found. The
optical depth below and at the reference transit radius need not take on
special or divergent values. In the limit of a spatially uniform grey cloud
with constant opacity, the transit chord with optical depth on the order of
unity mimics the presence of a ""cloud top"". While the surface located at the
reference pressure may mimic the presence of grey clouds, it is more natural to
include the effects of these clouds as part of the opacity function because the
cloud opacity may be computed from first principles. It is unclear how this
mimicry extends to non-grey clouds comprising small particles.

Differential Calculus (TDC) resulting in a unification in a threefold sense.
Firstly, ropes, membranes and three-dimensional continua are treated with one
set of governing equations. Secondly, the reformulated boundary value problem
applies to parametrized and implicit geometries. Therefore, the formulation is
more general than classical ones as it does not rely on parametrizations
implying curvilinear coordinate systems and the concept of co- and
contravariant base vectors. This leads to the third unification: TDC-based
models are applicable to two fundamentally different numerical approaches. On
the one hand, one may use the classical Surface FEM where the geometry is
discretized by curved one-dimensional elements for ropes and two-dimensional
surface elements for membranes. On the other hand, it also applies to recent
Trace FEM approaches where the geometry is immersed in a higher-dimensional
background mesh. Then, the shape functions of the background mesh are evaluated
on the trace of the immersed geometry and used for the approximation. As such,
the Trace FEM is a fictitious domain method for partial differential equations
on manifolds. The numerical results show that the proposed finite strain theory

regime for the upstream and downstream regions. MSD and TAMSD are in agreement
for the upstream energetic particle population, and both give a strong
indication of superdiffusive transport, consistent with interplanetary shock
observations. MSD and TAMSD are also in reasonable agreement downstream, where
indications of anomalous transport are also found. TAMSD shows evidence of
heterogeneity in the diffusion properties of the downstream particle
population, ranging from subdiffusive behaviour of particles trapped in the
strong magnetic field fluctuations generated at the shock, to superdiffusive
behaviour of particles transmitted and moving away from the shock.

six active sites that exhibits allostery: its catalytic rate is modulated by
the binding of various substrates at distal points from the active sites. A
recently developed method, bond-to-bond propensity analysis, has proven capable
of predicting allosteric sites in a wide range of proteins using an
energy-weighted atomistic graph obtained from the protein structure and given
knowledge only of the location of the active site. Bond-to-bond propensity
establishes if energy fluctuations at given bonds have significant effects on
any other bond in the protein, by considering their propagation through the
protein graph. In this work, we use bond-to-bond propensity analysis to study
different aspects of ATCase activity using three different protein structures
and sources of fluctuations. First, we predict key residues and bonds involved
in the transition between inactive (T) and active (R) states of ATCase by
analysing allosteric substrate binding as a source of energy perturbations in
the protein graph. Our computational results also indicate that the effect of
multiple allosteric binding is non linear: a switching effect is observed after
a particular number and arrangement of substrates is bound suggesting a form of
long range communication between the distantly arranged allosteric sites.
Second, cooperativity is explored by considering a bisubstrate analogue as the
source of energy fluctuations at the active site, also leading to the
identification of highly significant residues to the T-R transition that
enhance cooperativity across active sites. Finally, the inactive (T) structure
is shown to exhibit a strong, non linear communication between the allosteric
sites and the interface between catalytic subunits, rather than the active
site.

researched areas toward the realization of autonomous cars and robots. Certain
existing studies have split input point clouds into small regions such as 1m x
1m; one reason for this is that models in the studies cannot consume a large
number of points because of the large space complexity. However, because such
small regions occasionally include a very small number of instances belonging
to the same class, an evaluation using existing metrics such as mAP is largely
affected by the category recognition performance. To address these problems, we
propose a new method with space complexity O(Np) such that large regions can be
consumed, as well as novel metrics for tasks that are independent of the
categories or size of the inputs. Our method learns a mapping from input point
clouds to an embedding space, where the embeddings form clusters for each
instance and distinguish instances using these clusters during testing. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance using both existing and the
proposed metrics. Moreover, we show that our new metric can evaluate the
performance of a task without being affected by any other condition.

represents a Boolean function. OBDDs are also known as special cases of
oblivious read-once branching programs in the field of complexity theory. Since
OBDDs have many nice properties as data structures, they have been extensively
studied for decades in both theoretical and practical fields, such as VLSI
design, formal verification, machine learning, and combinatorial problems.
Arguably, the most crucial problem in using OBDDs is that they may vary
exponentially in size depending on their variable ordering (i.e., the order in
which the variable are to read) when they represent the same function. Indeed,
it is NP hard to find an optimal variable ordering that minimizes an OBDD for a
given function. Hence, numerous studies have sought heuristics to find an
optimal variable ordering. From practical as well as theoretical points of
view, it is also important to seek algorithms that output optimal solutions
with lower (exponential) time complexity than trivial brute-force algorithms
do. Friedman and Supowit provided a clever deterministic algorithm with
time/space complexity $O^\ast(3^n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables of
the function, which is much better than the trivial brute-force bound
$O^\ast(n!2^n)$. This paper shows that a further speedup is possible with
quantum computers by demonstrating the existence of a quantum algorithm that
produces a minimum OBDD together with the corresponding variable ordering in
$O^\ast(2.77286^n)$ time and space with an exponentially small error. Moreover,
this algorithm can be adapted to constructing other minimum decision diagrams
such as zero-suppressed BDDs, which provide compact representations of sparse
sets and are often used in the field of discrete optimization and enumeration.

sparse 3D point clouds is inefficient due to their irregular and unordered
nature. We propose a point attention network that learns rich local shape
features and their contextual correlations for 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation. Since the geometric distribution of the neighboring points is
invariant to the point ordering, we propose a Local Attention-Edge Convolution
(LAE Conv) to construct a local graph based on the neighborhood points searched
in multi-directions. We assign attention coefficients to each edge and then
aggregate the point features as a weighted sum of its neighbors. The learned
LAE-Conv layer features are then given to a point-wise spatial attention module
to generate an interdependency matrix of all points regardless of their
distances, which captures long-range spatial contextual features contributing
to more precise semantic information. The proposed point attention network
consists of an encoder and decoder which, together with the LAE-Conv layers and
the point-wise spatial attention modules, make it an end-to-end trainable
network for predicting dense labels for 3D point cloud segmentation.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds show that our
algorithm can perform at par or better than the existing state of the art
methods.

using of Pad\'e approximants as prescribed in [1] we consider quasinormal modes
of a test massless Dirac field in the Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) and

values of the angular parameter $\ell$ and show that the frequencies tend to
linear dependence on $p$. The allowed deviations of qausinormal modes from
their Schwarzschild limit are one order larger for the Einstein-Weyl theory
than for the Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet one, achieving the order of tens of
percents. In addition, we test the Hod conjecture which suggests the upper

We find high temperatures ($T_e \approx 10^4$ K), modest extinction ($A_V
\approx 2.5$ mag), and modest electron densities ($n_e \approx 200$ cm$^{-3}$)
in the ionized gas. Higher excitation lines trace the ionized outflow; both the
excitation and ionization in the outflow increase with distance from the opaque
globule. In contrast, lower excitation lines that are collisionally de-excited
at densities $\gtrsim 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ trace the highly collimated protostellar
jet. Assuming the globule is an isothermal sphere confined by the pressure of
the ionization front, we compute a Bonnor-Ebert mass of $\sim 3.7$ M$_{\odot}$.
This is two orders of magnitude higher than previous mass estimates, calling
into question whether small globules like the Tadpole contribute to the bottom
of the IMF. Derived globule properties are consistent with a cloud that has
been and/or will be compressed by the ionization front on its surface. At the
estimated globule photoevaporation rate of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$

to the stochastic nature of distributed energy sources and loads. Thanks to the
operation of ESSs, the main optimization objective is to minimize the dispatch
error, which accounts for the mismatch between the realization and prediction
of the power profile at the ADN connecting point to the upper layer grid, while
respecting the grid voltages and ampacity constraints. The proposed formulation
relies on the so-called Augmented Relaxed Optimal Power Flow (AR-OPF) method:
it expresses a convex full AC optimal power flow, which is proven to provide a
global optimal and exact solution in the case of radial power grids. The AR-OPF
is coupled with the proposed dispatching control resulting in a two-level
optimization problem. In the first block, the site and size of the ESSs are
decided along with the level of dispatchability that the ADN can achieve. Then,
in the second block, the adequacy of the ESS allocations and the feasibility of
the grid operating points are verified over operating scenarios using the
Benders decomposition technique. Consequently, the optimal size and site of the
ESSs are adjusted. To validate the proposed method, simulations are conducted
on a real Swiss ADN hosting a large amount of stochastic Photovoltaic (PV)

within the crust, but in some rare cases, ruptures reach supershear speeds. The
physics underlying the transition of natural subshear earthquakes to supershear
ones is currently not fully understood. Most observational studies of
supershear earthquakes have focused on determining which fault segments sustain
fully-grown supershear ruptures. Experimentally cross-validated numerical
models have identified some of the key ingredients required to trigger a
transition to supershear speed. However, the conditions for such a transition
in nature are still unclear, including the precise location of this transition.
In this work, we provide theoretical and numerical insights to identify the
precise location of such a transition in nature. We use fracture mechanics
arguments with multiple numerical models to identify the signature of
supershear transition in coseismic off-fault damage. We then cross-validate
this signature with high-resolution observations of fault zone width and early
aftershock distributions. We confirm that the location of the transition from
subshear to supershear speed is characterized by a decrease in the width of the
coseismic off-fault damage zone. We thus help refine the precise location of
such a transition for natural supershear earthquakes.

the staging environment"" are good indicators for predicting potential risks in
the incoming release. In order to prevent problems appearing in later stages of
production, an anomaly detection system can operate in the staging environment
to compare the current incoming release with previous ones according to
predefined metrics. The analysis is conducted before going into production to
identify anomalies which should be addressed by human operators that address
false-positive and negatives that can appear. In this paper, we describe a
prototypical implementation of the aforementioned idea in the form of a ""proof
of concept"". The current study effectively demonstrates the feasibility of the
approach for a set of implemented functionalities.

owners, users, and society. It limits the capacity of system installations, it
requires large cooling infrastructures, and it is the cause of a large carbon
footprint. Reducing power during application execution without changing the
application source code or increasing time-to-completion is highly desirable in
real-life high-performance computing scenarios. The power management run-time
frameworks proposed in the last decade are based on the assumption that the
duration of communication and application phases in an MPI application can be
predicted and used at run-time to trade-off communication slack with power
consumption. In this manuscript, we first show that this assumption is too
general and leads to mispredictions, slowing down applications, thereby
jeopardizing the claimed benefits. We then propose a new approach based on (i)
the separation of communication phases and slack during MPI calls and (ii) a
timeout algorithm to cope with the hardware power management latency, which
jointly makes it possible to achieve performance-neutral power saving in MPI
applications without requiring labor-intensive and risky application source
code modifications. We validate our approach in a tier-1 production environment
with widely adopted scientific applications. Our approach has a
time-to-completion overhead lower than 1%, while it successfully exploits slack
in communication phases to achieve an average energy saving of 10%. If we focus
on a large-scale application runs, the proposed approach achieves 22% energy
saving with an overhead of only 0.4%. With respect to state-of-the-art
approaches, COUNTDOWN Slack is the only that always leads to an energy saving
with negligible overhead (<3%).

important fraction of carbon in a molecular form, which can be used to
synthesize more complex, even biotic molecules. Hence, iCOMs are major actors
in the increasing molecular complexity in space and they might have played a
role in the origin of terrestrial life. Understand-ing how iCOMs are formed is
relevant for predicting the ultimate organic chemistry reached in the
interstellar medium. One possibility is that they are synthesized on the
interstellar grain icy surfaces, via recombination of previously formed
radicals. The present work focuses on the reactivity of HCO with CH3/NH2 on the
grain icy sur-faces, investigated by means of quantum chemical simulations. The
goal is to carry outa systematic study using different computational approaches

particle-matrix-type systems, and it is successfully employed for the
estimation of particle sizes in various scientific domains (e.g., soft matter

demonstrate its applicability for the example of nanocrystalline cobalt. It is
well-known that the magnetic microstructure of nanocrystalline ferromagnets is
highly nonuniform on the nanometer length scale and characterized by a spectrum
of continuously varying long-wavelength magnetization fluctuations, i.e., these
systems do not manifest sharp interfaces in their magnetization profile. The
magnetic Guinier radius depends on the applied magnetic field, on the magnetic
interactions (exchange, magnetostatics), and on the magnetic anisotropy-field
radius, which characterizes the size over which the magnetic anisotropy field
is coherently aligned into the same direction. In contrast to the nonmagnetic
conventional Guinier law, the magnetic version can be applied to fully dense
random-anisotropy-type ferromagnets.

measured in high Galactic latitude cirrus with those determined in a sample of
204 late-type DustPedia galaxies. The aim is to verify if it is appropriate to
use Milky Way dust properties to derive dust masses in external galaxies.
Methods: We used Herschel observations and atomic and molecular gas masses to
estimate the disc-averaged dust emissivity at 250 micrometres, and from this,
the absorption cross section per H atom and per dust mass. The emissivity
requires one assumption, which is the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor, and the dust
temperature is additionally required for the absorption cross section per H
atom; yet another constraint on the dust-to-hydrogen ratio D/H, depending on
metallicity, is required for the absorption cross section dust mass. Results:
We find epsilon(250) = 0.82 +/- 0.07 MJy sr^-1 (1E20 H cm^-2)^-1 for galaxies
with 4 < F(250)/F(500) < 5. This depends only weakly on the adopted CO-to-H_2
conversion factor. The value is almost the same as that for the Milky Way at
the same colour ratio. Instead, for F(250)/F(500) > 6, epsilon(250) is lower
than predicted by its dependence on the heating conditions. The reduction
suggests a variation in dust emission properties for spirals of earlier type,
higher metallicity, and with a higher fraction of molecular gas. When the
standard emission properties of Galactic cirrus are used for these galaxies,
their dust masses might be underestimated by up to a factor of two. Values for
the absorption cross sections at the Milky Way metallicity are also close to
those of the cirrus. Mild trends of the absorption cross sections with
metallicity are found, although the results depend on the assumptions made.

interaction model at the zeroth order. Using an improvised loop algorithm
within the Stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo method, we find two
distinct phases as we increase the temperature and magnetic-field. One of the
phase is the $\Pi_f$, the phase with long range ferroelectric order and the
other being an intermediate state with strong local correlations, i.e, a
quantum liquid-like state $\Pi_{ql}$. The transition to $\Pi_{f}$ shows a very
small anomalous peak in the specific heat with strong dependence of critical
temperature on the strength of dipole-dipole interaction. The presence of the
small peak is attributed to the absence of macroscopic degeneracy in the
presence of dipole-dipole interaction and re-entrance of such degeneracy to
some extent at small temperature. Though the degenerate ground state manifold
is identical for a four-spin interaction or appropriate two-spin interaction
model at zeroth order, we find that for the former case, the required strength
of dipole-dipole interaction is quite larger to induce a ferroelectric phase.
The work also presents an intricate connection of quantum fluctuation and
thermal fluctuation in the presence of competing interaction with entropic
effects.

  component features",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this era of big data, databases are growing rapidly in terms of the number
of records. Fast automatic detection of anomalous records in these massive
databases is a challenging task. Traditional distance based anomaly detectors
are not applicable in these massive datasets. Recently, a simple but extremely
fast anomaly detector using one-dimensional histograms has been introduced. The
anomaly score of a data instance is computed as the product of the probability
mass of histograms in each dimensions where it falls into. It is shown to
produce competitive results compared to many state-of-the-art methods in many
datasets. Because it assumes data features are independent of each other, it
results in poor detection accuracy when there is correlation between features.
To address this issue, we propose to increase the feature size by adding more
features based on principal components. Our results show that using the
original input features together with principal components improves the
detection accuracy of histogram-based anomaly detector significantly without
compromising much in terms of run-time.

description by means of a rank-two symmetric tensor, a description in which one
dualizes the corresponding (2,2)-curvature tensor on one column to get a
(D-2,2)-tensor, where D is the spacetime dimension. This tensor derives from a
gauge field with mixed Yound symmetry (D-3,1) called the ""dual graviton"" field.
The dual graviton field is related non-locally to the Pauli-Fierz field (even
on-shell), in much the same way as a p-form potential and its dual (D-p-2)-form
potential are related in the theory of an abelian p-form. Since the Pauli-Fierz
field has a Young tableau with two columns (of one box each), one can
contemplate a double dual description in which one dualizes on both columns and
not just on one. The double dual curvature is now a (D-2,D-2)-tensor and
derives from a gauge field with (D-3, D-3) mixed Young symmetry, the ""double
dual graviton"" field. We show, however, that the double dual graviton field is
algebraically and locally related to the original Pauli-Fierz field and, so,
does not provide a truly new description of the graviton. From this point of
view, it plays a very different role from the dual graviton field obtained
through a single dualization. We also show that these equations can be obtained
from a variational principle in which the variables to be varied in the action
are (all) the components of the double-dual field as well as an auxiliary field
with (2,1) Young symmetry. By gauge fixing the shift symmetries of this action
principle, one recovers the Pauli-Fierz action. Our approach differs from the
interesting approach based on parent actions and covers only the free,
sourceless theory. Similar results are argued to hold for higher spin gauge

monopnictide compound family several years ago, the growth of thin films has
remained a challenge. Here, we report the growth of epitaxial thin films of NbP

on MgO (001) substrates using thin Nb (Ta) buffer layers, and are found to be

surface states characteristic of a P-terminated surface and linear dispersion
bands in agreement with the calculated band structure, and a Fermi-level shift
of -0.2 eV with respect to the Weyl points. Consequently, the electronic
transport is dominated by both holes and electrons with carrier mobilities
close to 10^3 cm2/Vs at room-temperature. The growth of epitaxial thin films
opens up the use of strain and controlled doping to access and tune the
electronic structure of Weyl Semimetals on demand, paving the way for the

the hypothesis that the growth of a stellar bulge leads to a reduction in the
star-formation efficiency of a galaxy (or conversely a growth in the
gas-depletion timescale) as a result of the stabilisation of the gaseous disk
by the gravitational field of the bulge. We find a strong correlation between
star-formation efficiency and specific star-formation rate in galaxies without
prominent bulges and in galaxies of the same morphological type, showing that
there must be some other process besides the growth of a bulge that reduces the
star-formation efficiency in galaxies. However, we also find that galaxies with
more prominent bulges (Hubble types E to Sab) do have significantly lower
star-formation efficiencies than galaxies with later morphological types, which
is at least consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of a bulge leads to
the reduction in the star-formation efficiency. The answer to the question in
the title is therefore, yes and no: bulges may reduce the star-formation
efficiency in galaxies but there must also be some other process at work. We
also find that there is a significant but small difference in the
star-formation efficiencies of galaxies with and without bars, in the sense
that galaxies with bars have slightly higher star-formation efficiencies.

subset of data acquired from the most recent NaPiRE (Naming the Pain in

types, how often respondents state they document a specific type of NFR when
they also state that it is important. This allows us to quantify the occurrence

four NFR types (Maintainability, Reliability, Usability, and Performance) are
labelled as important but they are not documented by more than 22% of the
respondents. We interpret that these NFR types have a higher risk of Technical
Debt than other NFR types. Regarding Waste, 15% of the respondents state they
document NFRs related to Security and they do not consider it important.
Conclusions: There is a clear indication that there is a risk of Technical Debt
for a fixed set of NFRs since there is a lack of documentation of important
NFRs. The potential risk of incurring Waste is also present but to a lesser

behavior of the stratosphere has not been studied in detail. Understanding the
snowball stratosphere is important for developing an accurate account of the
Earth's radiative and chemical properties during these episodes. Here we
conduct the first analysis of the stratospheric circulation of the Snowball
Earth using ECHAM6 general circulation model simulations. In order to
understand the factors contributing to the stratospheric circulation, we extend
the Statistical Transformed Eulerian Mean framework. We find that the
stratosphere during a snowball with prescribed modern ozone levels exhibits a
weaker meridional overturning circulation, reduced wave activity, stronger
zonal jets, and is extremely cold relative to modern conditions. Notably, the
snowball stratosphere displays no sudden stratospheric warmings. Without ozone,
the stratosphere displays slightly weaker circulation, a complete lack of polar
vortex, and even colder temperatures. We also explicitly quantify for the first

efficiency during the snowball and show that our values do not change the

compact objects in the mass range of neutron stars, GW170817, several studies
have searched for an imprint of tidal effects in the signal, employing
different model assumptions. One important distinction is whether or not to
assume that both objects are neutron stars and obey the same equation of state.
Some studies assumed independent properties. Others assume a universal equation
of state, and in addition that the tidal deformability follows certain
phenomenological relations. An important question is whether the
gravitational-wave data alone constitute observational evidence for finite
tidal effects. All studies provide Bayesian credible intervals, often without
sufficiently discussing the impact of prior assumptions, especially in the case
of lower limits on the neutron-star tidal deformability or radius. In this
article, we scrutinize the implicit and explicit prior assumptions made in
those studies. Our findings strongly indicate that existing lower credible
bounds are mainly a consequence of prior assumptions combined with information
gained about the system's masses. Importantly, those lower bounds are typically
not informed by the observation of tidal effects in the gravitational-wave
signal. Thus, regarding them as observational evidence might be misleading
without a more detailed discussion. Further, we point out technical problems
and conceptual inconsistencies in existing studies. We also assess the
limitations due to systematic waveform model uncertainties in a novel way,
demonstrating that differences between existing models are not guaranteed to be
small enough for an unbiased estimation of lower bounds on the tidal
deformability. Finally, we propose strategies for gravitational-wave data
analysis designed to avoid some of the problems we uncovered.

metals is negligibly small. In fact, no changes of normal state resistance and
superconducting critical temperature were reported. Here, we review the
experimental results obtained in the realization of field-effect metallic
superconducting devices exploiting this unexplained phenomenon. We will start
by presenting the seminal results on superconducting BCS wires and
nano-constriction Josephson junctions (Dayem bridges) made of different
materials, such as titanium, aluminum and vanadium. Then, we show the mastering
of the Josephson supercurrent in superconductor-normal metal-superconductor
proximity transistors suggesting that the presence of induced superconducting
correlations are enough to see this unconventional field-effect. Later, we
present the control of the interference pattern in a superconducting quantum
interference device indicating the coupling of the electric field with
thesuperconducting phase. Among the possible applications of the presented
phenomenology, we conclude this review by proposing some devices that may
represent a breakthrough in superconducting quantum and classical computation.

agents satisfying the marginal probabilities with a sequential sampling

communicate by exchanging messages in order to achieve a common objective.
These messages have a finite precision in realistic networks, which may
necessitate to implement message quantization. Quantization, in turn, may
generate distortion and performance penalty in the distributed processing
tasks. This paper proposes a novel method for distributed graph filtering that
minimizes the error due to message quantization without compromising the
communication costs. It first bounds the exchanged messages and then allocates
a limited bit budget in an optimized way to the different messages and network
nodes. In particular, our novel quantization algorithm adapts to both the
network topology and the message importance in a distributed processing task.
Our results show that the proposed method is effective in minimizing the error
due to quantization and that it permits to outperform baseline distributed
algorithms when the bit budget is limited. They further show that errors
produced in nodes with high eccentricity or in the first steps of the
distributed algorithm contribute more to the global error. Also, sparse and
irregular graphs require more irregular bit distribution. Our method provides
one of the first quantization solutions for distributed graph processing, which
is able to adapt to the target task, the graph properties and the communication
constraints.

the machine learning model's performance is adversely impacted while the human
vision cannot perceive the difference in the poisoned dataset due to minimal

convolutional layers. Using two losses, one at an earlier level and another at
the last level of the decoder, MRCNet estimates crowd counts and
high-resolution crowd density maps as two different but interrelated tasks. In
addition, MRCNet utilizes contextual and detailed local information by
combining high- and low-level features through a number of lateral connections
inspired by the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) technique. We evaluated MRCNet on
the proposed DLR-ACD dataset as well as on the ShanghaiTech dataset, a
CCTV-based crowd counting benchmark. The results demonstrate that MRCNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art crowd counting methods in estimating the crowd
counts and density maps for both aerial and CCTV-based images.

crop-rows accurately and handles the switch to the next row seamlessly within

associations with core religious values diverge in the final outcome for the
folktale characters. Lying that serves a religious mission of either
Confucianism or Taoism (but not Buddhism) brings a positive outcome to a
character (\b{eta}T_and_Lie_O= 2.23; \b{eta}C_and_Lie_O= 1.47;
\b{eta}T_and_Lie_O= 2.23). A violent act committed to serving Buddhist missions
results in a happy ending for the committer (\b{eta}B_and_Viol_O= 2.55). What
is highlighted here is a glaring double standard in the interpretation and
practice of the three teachings: the very virtuous outcomes being preached,
whether that be compassion and meditation in Buddhism, societal order in
Confucianism, or natural harmony in Taoism, appear to accommodate two universal
vices-violence in Buddhism and lying in the latter two. These findings
contribute to a host of studies aimed at making sense of contradictory human
behaviors, adding the role of religious teachings in addition to cognition in
belief maintenance and motivated reasoning in discounting counterargument.

large amounts of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are
typically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of
the classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in
the same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes
co-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs,
biological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns.
Specifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called
neuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic
interactions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population
coding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes. Here, we
propose a novel Biologically Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN)
regularization to model neuronal correlations and dependencies, inspired by
cell assembly theory from neuroscience. Experimental results show that BEAN
enables the formation of interpretable neuronal functional clusters and
consequently promotes a sparse, memory/computation-efficient network without
loss of model performance. Moreover, our few-shot learning experiments
demonstrate that BEAN could also enhance the generalizability of the model when
training samples are extremely limited.

years for lightweight manufacturing, represents an important challenge in terms
of control technology. During the process, a resin fills the cavity where a
reinforcement fabric has previously been layered. This resin undergoes a
chemical reaction which is thermically activated. Therefore, assuring a proper
reaction requires a precise control of temperature in the entire mold cavity.
Three factors make this control problem especially hard: the coupling among the
large number of actuators and sensors, the variability of the test conditions
and the power limitations of the electric actuators which do not offer cooling
capability. The present work describes an optimized Model Predictive Control
(MPC) architecture capable of handling these difficulties and also achieving
the tight control requirements needed in the application. The thermal

from an experimentally validated Finite Element Model (FEM), using
AutoRegressive model with eXogenous terms (ARX) identification. In order to
maintain the simplicity of this linear representation, the time-varying model
parameters are estimated by using a perturbation observer. Additionally, the
performance of the basic algorithm is improved: firstly, an augmented observer
to estimate the temperature distribution of an extended spatial resolution; and
secondly, a symmetry condition in the calculation of the control commands. The
developed architectures have successfully been implemented in a RTM tool with
the fulfillment of the control requirements.

collisions at RHIC kinematics are dominated by quark-gluon and gluon-gluon
scattering processes. Therefore the longitudinal double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$
for jets is an effective channel to explore the longitudinal gluon polarization
in the proton. At STAR, jets are reconstructed in full azimuth, from the
charged-particle tracks seen by the Time Projection Chamber and
electro-magnetic energy deposited in the Barrel and Endcap electro-magnetic
calorimeters at both $\sqrt{s} = $ 200 and 510 GeV. Early STAR inclusive jet
$A_{LL}$ results at $\sqrt{s} = $ 200 GeV provided the first evidence of the
non-zero gluon polarization at $x > $ 0.05. At $\sqrt{s} = $ 510 GeV, the
inclusive jet $A_{LL}$ is sensitive to the gluon polarization as low as $x \sim
$ 0.015. In this talk, we will discuss recent STAR inclusive jet and dijet
$A_{LL}$ results at $\sqrt{s} = $ 510 GeV and highlight the new techniques
designed for this analysis, for example the underlying event correction to the
jet transverse energy and its effect on the jet $A_{LL}$. Dijet $A_{LL}$
results are shown for four topologies in regions of pseudo-rapidity,
effectively scanning the $x$-dependence of the gluon polarization.

to characterize the region of input space that excites a given neuron to a
certain level; we call this the inverse set. This inverse set is a complicated
high dimensional object that we explore by an optimization-based sampling
approach. Inspection of samples of this set by a human can reveal regularities
that help to understand the neuron. This goes beyond approaches which were
limited to finding an image which maximally activates the neuron or using
Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample images, but this is very slow, generates
samples with little diversity and lacks control over the activation value of
the generated samples. Our approach also allows us to explore the intersection
of inverse sets of several neurons and other variations.

that in-training factorization is capable of reducing nearly 50% of learnable

in-training matrix factorization is especially powerful on embedding layers,

cognitive science are the most profound open problems of the two research
fields, and certainly among the deepest of all unsettled conundrums in
contemporary science in general. Occasionally, scientists from both fields have
suggested some sort of interconnectedness of the two problems. Here we revisit
the main motives behind such expectations and try to put them on more formal
grounds. We argue not only that such a relation exists, but that it also bears
strong implications both for the interpretations of quantum mechanics and for
our understanding of consciousness. The paper consists of three parts. In the
first part, we formulate a ""no-go-theorem"" stating that a brain, functioning
solely on the principles of classical physics, cannot have any greater ability
to induce subjective experience than a process of writing (printing) a certain
sequence of digits. The goal is to show, with an attempt to mathematical rigor,
why the physicalist standpoint based on classical physics is not likely to ever
explain the phenomenon of consciousness -- justifying the tendency to look
beyond the physics of the 19th century. In the second part, we aim to establish
a clear relation, with a sort of correspondence mapping, between attitudes
towards the hard problem and interpretations of quantum mechanics. Then we
discuss these connections in the light of the no-go theorem, pointing out that
the existence of subjective experience might differentiate between otherwise
experimentally indistinguishable interpretations. Finally, the third part is an
attempt to illustrate how quantum mechanics could take us closer to the
solution of the hard problem and break the constraints set by the no-go
theorem.
