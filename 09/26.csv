cost of training a neural network on a novel task. We investigate the effect of
network width on learned features using activation atlases --- a visualization
technique that captures features the entire hidden state responds to, as
opposed to individual neurons alone. We find that, while individual neurons do
not learn interpretable features in wide networks, groups of neurons do. In
addition, the hidden state of a wide network contains more information about
the inputs than that of a narrow network trained to the same test accuracy.
Inspired by this observation, we show that when fine-tuning the last layer of a
network on a new task, performance improves significantly as the width of the
network is increased, even though test accuracy on the original task is
independent of width.

relations are captured by the embeddingspace. However, variability in images is
not just due to different depicted object classes, but also depends on other
latent characteristics such as viewpoint or illumination. In addition to these
structured properties, random noise further obstructs the visual relations of
interest. The common approach to metric learning is to enforce a representation
that is invariant under all factors but the ones of interest. In contrast, we
propose to explicitly learn the latent characteristics that are shared by and
go across object classes. We can then directly explain away structured visual
variability, rather than assuming it to be unknown random noise. We propose a
novel surrogate task to learn visual characteristics shared across classes with
a separate encoder. This encoder is trained jointly with the encoder for class
information by reducing their mutual information. On five standard image
retrieval benchmarks the approach significantly improves upon the

patterns from a given dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ in fragments of a given string

space proportional to the number of patterns $d=|\mathcal{D}|$ rather than
their total length, which could be $\Theta(n\cdot d)$.
  In particular, we consider the following types of queries: reporting and
counting all occurrences of patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ in a fragment $T[i..j]$
and reporting distinct patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ that occur in $T[i..j]$. We
show how to construct, in $\mathcal{O}((n+d) \log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n)$ time, a
data structure that answers each of these queries in time
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n+|output|)$.
  The case of counting patterns is much more involved and needs a combination
of a locally consistent parsing with orthogonal range searching. Reporting
distinct patterns, on the other hand, uses the structure of maximal repetitions
in strings. Finally, we provide tight---up to subpolynomial factors---upper and
lower bounds for the case of a dynamic dictionary.

  The method requires the computation of successive derivatives of two selected

$(1+\epsilon)f$-approximate minimum cost set cover with
$O(f\log(Cn)/\epsilon^2)$ amortized update time, when the input set system is
undergoing element insertions and deletions. Here, $n$ denotes the number of
elements, each element appears in at most $f$ sets, and the cost of each set
lies in the range $[1/C, 1]$. Our result, together with that of Gupta et al.
[STOC`17], implies that there is a deterministic algorithm for this problem
with $O(f\log(Cn))$ amortized update time and $O(\min(\log n,
f))$-approximation ratio, which nearly matches the polynomial-time hardness of
approximation for minimum set cover in the static setting. Our update time is
only $O(\log (Cn))$ away from a trivial lower bound.
  Prior to our work, the previous best approximation ratio guaranteed by
deterministic algorithms was $O(f^2)$, which was due to Bhattacharya et al.
[ICALP`15]. In contrast, the only result that guaranteed $O(f)$-approximation
was obtained very recently by Abboud et al. [STOC`19], who designed a dynamic
algorithm with $(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation ratio and $O(f^2 \log n/\epsilon)$
amortized update time. Besides the extra $O(f)$ factor in the update time
compared to our and Gupta et al.'s results, the Abboud et al. algorithm is
randomized, and works only when the adversary is oblivious and the sets are
unweighted (each set has the same cost).
  We achieve our result via the primal-dual approach, by maintaining a
fractional packing solution as a dual certificate. Unlike previous primal-dual
algorithms that try to satisfy some local constraints for individual sets at
all time, our algorithm basically waits until the dual solution changes
significantly globally, and fixes the solution only where the fix is needed.

show how phonon scattering at a kink in the graphene, e.g. formed by sidewall

Hamiltonian EPs (HEPs) are usually defined as degeneracies of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians such that at least two eigenfrequencies are identical and the
corresponding eigenstates coalesce. HEPs result from continuous, mostly slow,
nonunitary evolution without quantum jumps. Clearly, quantum jumps should be
included in a fully quantum approach to make it equivalent to, e.g., the
Lindblad master-equation approach. Thus, we suggest to define EPs via
degeneracies of a Liouvillian superoperator (including the full Lindbladian
term, LEPs), and we clarify the relations between HEPs and LEPs. We prove two
main theorems: Theorem 1 proves that, in the quantum limit, LEPs and HEPs must
have essentially different properties. Theorem 2 dictates a condition under
which, in the ``semiclassical'' limit, LEPs and HEPs recover the same
properties. In particular, we show the validity of Theorem 1 studying systems
which have (1) an LEP but no HEPs, and (2) both LEPs and HEPs but for shifted
parameters. As for Theorem 2, (3) we show that these two types of EPs become
essentially equivalent in the semiclassical limit. We introduce a series of
mathematical techniques to unveil analogies and differences between the HEPs

blazars. Their typical two-hump structured spectral energy distribution (SED)
peaks at higher energies with respect to conventional blazars. Multi-wavelength
(MWL) observations constrain their synchrotron peak in the medium to hard X-ray
band. Their gamma-ray SED peaks above the GeV band, and in some objects it
extends up to several TeV. Up to now, only a few EHBLs have been detected in
the TeV gamma-ray range. In this paper, we report the detection of the EHBL
2WHSP J073326.7+515354, observed and detected during 2018 in TeV gamma rays
with the MAGIC telescopes. The broad-band SED is studied within a MWL context,
including an analysis of the Fermi-LAT data over ten years of observation and
with simultaneous Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and KVA data. Our analysis results in
a set of spectral parameters that confirms the classification of the source as
an EHBL. In order to investigate the physical nature of this extreme emission,
different theoretical frameworks were tested to model the broad-band SED. The
hard TeV spectrum of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 sets the SED far from the energy
equipartition regime in the standard one-zone leptonic scenario of blazar
emission. Conversely, more complex models of the jet, represented by either a
two-zone spine-layer model or a hadronic emission model, better represent the
broad-band SED.

(CSPs) to search over encrypted datasets without learning the content of
queries and records. In recent years, many SE schemes have been proposed to
protect outsourced data from CSPs. Unfortunately, most of them leak sensitive
information, from which the CSPs could still infer the content of queries and
records by mounting leakage-based inference attacks, such as the count attack
and file injection attack.
  In this work, first we define the leakage in searchable encrypted databases
and analyse how the leakage is leveraged in existing leakage-based attacks.
Second, we propose a Privacy-preserving Multi-cloud based dynamic symmetric SE
(SSE) scheme for relational Database (P-McDb). P-McDb has minimal leakage,
which not only ensures confidentiality of queries and records, but also
protects the search, access, and size patterns from CSPs. Moreover, P-McDb
ensures both forward and backward privacy of the database. Thus, P-McDb could
resist existing leakage-based attacks, e.g., active file/record-injection
attacks. We give security definition and analysis to show how P-McDb hides the
aforementioned patterns. Finally, we implemented a prototype of P-McDb and test
it using the TPC-H benchmark dataset. Our evaluation results show the
feasibility and practical efficiency of P-McDb.

large, and irregular fetal movements. It is, therefore, performed through
visual monitoring of fetal motion and repeated acquisitions to ensure
diagnostic-quality images are acquired. Nevertheless, visual monitoring of
fetal motion based on displayed slices, and navigation at the level of
stacks-of-slices is inefficient. The current process is highly
operator-dependent, increases scanner usage and cost, and significantly
increases the length of fetal MRI scans which makes them hard to tolerate for
pregnant women. To help build automatic MRI motion tracking and navigation
systems to overcome the limitations of the current process and improve fetal
imaging, we have developed a new real time image-based motion tracking method
based on deep learning that learns to predict fetal motion directly from
acquired images. Our method is based on a recurrent neural network, composed of
spatial and temporal encoder-decoders, that infers motion parameters from
anatomical features extracted from sequences of acquired slices. We compared
our trained network on held out test sets (including data with different
characteristics, e.g. different fetuses scanned at different ages, and motion
trajectories recorded from volunteer subjects) with networks designed for
estimation as well as methods adopted to make predictions. The results show
that our method outperformed alternative techniques, and achieved real-time
performance with average errors of 3.5 and 8 degrees for the estimation and
prediction tasks, respectively. Our real-time deep predictive motion tracking
technique can be used to assess fetal movements, to guide slice acquisitions,
and to build navigation systems for fetal MRI.

Background (SGWB) is one of the main goals of Gravitational Wave (GW)
experiments. The observed SGWB will be the combination of GWs from cosmological
(as predicted by many models describing the physics of the early Universe) and
astrophysical origins, which will arise from the superposition of GWs from
unresolved sources whose signal is too faint to be detected. Therefore, it is
important to have a proper modeling of the astrophysical SGWB (ASGWB) in order
to disentangle the two signals; moreover, this will provide additional
information on astrophysical properties of compact objects. Applying the Cosmic
Rulers formalism, we compute the observed ASGWB angular power spectrum, hence
using gauge invariant quantities, accounting for all effects intervening
between the source and the observer. These are the so-called projection
effects, which include Kaiser, Doppler and gravitational potentials effect. Our
results show that these projection effects are the most important at the
largest scales, and they contribute to up to tens of percent of the angular
power spectrum amplitude, with the Kaiser term being the largest at all scales.
While the exact impact of these results will depend on instrumental and
astrophysical details, a precise theoretical modeling of the ASGWB will
necessarily need to include all these projection effects.

  Stochastic Optimisation","AAMAS 2020 Full Paper",,,,"cs.MA cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, $\alpha$-Rank, a graph-based algorithm, has been proposed as a
solution to ranking joint policy profiles in large scale multi-agent systems.
$\alpha$-Rank claimed tractability through a polynomial time implementation
with respect to the total number of pure strategy profiles. Here, we note that
inputs to the algorithm were not clearly specified in the original
presentation; as such, we deem complexity claims as not grounded, and
conjecture solving $\alpha$-Rank is NP-hard. The authors of $\alpha$-Rank
suggested that the input to $\alpha$-Rank can be an exponentially-sized payoff
matrix; a claim promised to be clarified in subsequent manuscripts. Even though
$\alpha$-Rank exhibits a polynomial-time solution with respect to such an
input, we further reflect additional critical problems. We demonstrate that due
to the need of constructing an exponentially large Markov chain, $\alpha$-Rank
is infeasible beyond a small finite number of agents. We ground these claims by
adopting amount of dollars spent as a non-refutable evaluation metric.
Realising such scalability issue, we present a stochastic implementation of
$\alpha$-Rank with a double oracle mechanism allowing for reductions in joint
strategy spaces. Our method, $\alpha^\alpha$-Rank, does not need to save
exponentially-large transition matrix, and can terminate early under required
precision. Although theoretically our method exhibits similar worst-case
complexity guarantees compared to $\alpha$-Rank, it allows us, for the first
time, to practically conduct large-scale multi-agent evaluations. On $10^4
\times 10^4$ random matrices, we achieve $1000x$ speed reduction. Furthermore,
we also show successful results on large joint strategy profiles with a maximum
size in the order of $\mathcal{O}(2^{25})$ ($\approx 33$ million joint
strategies) -- a setting not evaluable using $\alpha$-Rank with reasonable
computational budget.

considering feedbacks between energetic particle precipitation, climate,
atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and secondary particle
generation. We describe newly-combined state-of-the-art modeling tools to study
the impact of the radiation and particle environment on atmospheric particle
interaction, the influence on the atmospheric chemistry, and the
climate-chemistry coupling in a self-consistent model suite. To this end,
models like the Atmospheric Radiation Interaction Simulator (AtRIS), the
Exoplanetary Terrestrial Ion Chemistry model (ExoTIC), and the updated coupled
climate-chemistry model are combined. Amongst others, we model the atmospheric
response during quiescent solar periods and during a strong solar energetic
particle event as well as the scenario-dependent terrestrial transit spectra,
as seen by the NIR-Spec infrared spectrometer onboard the JWST. We find that
the comparatively weak solar event drastically increases the spectral signal of
HNO$_3$, while significantly suppressing the spectral feature of ozone. Because
of the slow recovery after such events, the latter indicates that ozone might
not be a good biomarker for planets orbiting stars with high flaring rates.

regimes achieving directional amplification can be elegantly obtained from a
topological `phase diagram', which provides a guiding principle for the design
of both phase-preserving and phase-sensitive multimode directional amplifiers.

square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, for a general Euclidean exclusion distance $D$.
The key point is an analysis of solutions to norm equations in the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[{\sqrt[6]{-1}}]$. We describe the ground states in terms of
M-triangles, i.e., non-obtuse $\mathbb{Z}^2$-triangles of a minimal area with
the side-lengths $\geq D$. Further, we identify $\mathbb{Z}^2$-triangles as
elements of $\mathbb{Z}[{\sqrt[6]{-1}}]$.
  First, there is a finite class (Class S) formed by values $D^2$ generating
sliding, a phenomenon leading to countable families of periodic ground states.
We identify all $D^2$ with sliding. Each of the remaining classes is proven to
be infinite; they are characterized by uniqueness or non-uniqueness of a
minimal triangle for a given $D^2$, up to $\mathbb{Z}^2$-congruencies. For
values of $D^2$ with uniqueness (Class A) we describe the periodic ground
states as admissible triangular sub-lattices $\mathbb{E}\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ of
maximum density. By using the Pirogov-Sinai theory, it allows us to identify
the extreme Gibbs measures (pure phases) for large values of fugacity and
describe symmetries between them.
  Next, we analyze the values $D^2$ with non-uniqueness. For some $D^2$ all
M-triangles are ${\mathbb{R}}^2$-congruent but not $\mathbb{Z}^2$-congruent
(Class B0). For other values of $D^2$ there exist
non-${\mathbb{R}}^2$-congruent M-triangles, with different collections of
side-lengths (Class B1). Moreover, there are values $D^2$ for which both cases
occur (Class B2). The phase diagram for Classes B0, B1, B2 is determined by
dominant ground states. Classes A, B0-B2 are described in terms of cosets in
$\mathbb{Z}[{\sqrt[6]{-1}}]$ by the group of units.

studied due to its substantial impact on mechanical properties, an
understanding of the detailed atomic processes associated with twin embryo
growth is still lacking. Conducting molecular dynamics simulations on Mg, we
show that the propagation of twinning disconnections emitted by basal-prismatic
interfaces controls the twin boundary motion and is the rate-limiting mechanism
during the initial growth of the twin embryo. The time needed for disconnection
propagation is related to the distance between the twin tips, with widely
spaced twin tips requiring more time for a unit twin boundary migration event
to be completed. Thus, a phenomenological model, which unifies the two
processes of disconnection and twin tip propagation, is proposed here to
provide a quantitative analysis of twin embryo growth. The model fits the
simulation data well, with two key parameters (twin tip velocity and twinning
disconnection velocity) being extracted. In addition, a linear relationship
between the ratio of twinning disconnection velocity to twin tip velocity and
the applied shear stress is observed. Using an example of twin growth in a
nanoscale single crystal from the recent literature, we find that our molecular

CCSD and QMC are high. Here, we present an Active Learning approach that
iteratively trains an ANN model to faithfully replicate the coarse-grained
energy surface of water clusters using only 426 total structures in its
training data. Our active learning workflow starts with a sparse training
dataset which is continually updated via a Monte Carlo scheme that sparsely
queries the energy landscape and tests the network performance. Next, the
network is retrained with an updated training set that includes failed
configurations/energies from previous iteration until convergence is attained.
Once trained, we generate an extensive test set of ~100,000 configurations
sampled across clusters ranging from 1 to 200 molecules and demonstrate that
the trained network adequately reproduces the energies (within mean absolute
error (MAE) of ~ 2 meV/molecule) and forces (MAE ~ 40 meV/{\r{A}}) compared to
the reference model. More importantly, the trained ANN model also accurately
captures both the structure as well as the free energy as a function of the

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2728",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the [CII] line intensity mapping (IM) signal from galaxies in
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) to assess its detectability, the possibility to
constrain the $L_{\rm CII}-{\rm SFR}$ relation, and to recover the [CII]
luminosity function (LF) from future experiments. By empirically assuming that
${\rm log}L_{\rm CII}={\rm log}A+\gamma {\rm SFR}\pm\sigma_L$, we derive the
[CII] LF from the observed UV LF, and the [CII] IM power spectrum. We study the
shot-noise and the full power spectrum separately. Although, in general, the
shot-noise component has a much higher signal-to-noise ratio than the
clustering one, it cannot be used to put independent constraints on log$A$ and
$\gamma$. Full power spectrum measurements are crucial to break such
degeneracy, and reconstruct the [CII] LF. In our fiducial survey S1 (inspired
by CCAT-p/1000 hr) at $z \sim 6$, the shot-noise (clustering) signal is
detectable for 2 (1) of the 5 considered $L_{\rm CII}-{\rm SFR}$ relations. The
shot-noise is generally dominated by galaxies with $L_{\rm CII}\gtrsim
10^{8-9}~L_\odot$ ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ to $-22$), already at reach of ALMA
pointed observations. However, given the small field of view of such telescope,
an IM experiment would provide unique information on the bright-end of the LF.
The detection depth of an IM experiment crucially depends on the (poorly
constrained) $L_{\rm CII}-{\rm SFR}$ relation in the EoR. If the $L_{\rm
CII}-{\rm SFR}$ relation varies in a wide log$A - \gamma$ range, but still
consistent with ALMA [CII] LF upper limits, even the signal from galaxies with
$L_{\rm CII}$ as faint as $\sim 10^7~L_\odot$ could be detectable. Finally, we
consider the contamination by continuum foregrounds (CIB, dust, CMB) and CO
interloping lines, and derived the requirements on the residual contamination
level to reliably extract the [CII] signal.

constraining them to only represent rotation and translation. We demonstrate

We
show how the attractive self-interactions of dark matter (DM) axions over a
broad range of masses, from $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^7$ GeV, can lead to
nongravitational growth of density fluctuations and the formation of bound
objects. This structure formation enhancement is driven by parametric resonance
when the initial field misalignment is large, and it affects axion density
perturbations on length scales of order the Hubble horizon when the axion field
starts oscillating, deep inside the radiation-dominated era. This effect can
turn an otherwise nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations
into one that has a spike at the aforementioned scales, producing objects
ranging from dense DM halos to scalar-field configurations such as solitons and
oscillons. We call this class of cosmological scenarios for axion DM production
""the large-misalignment mechanism.""
  We explore observational consequences of this mechanism for axions with
masses up to $10$ eV. For axions heavier than $10^{-5}$ eV, the compact axion
halos are numerous enough to significantly impact Earth-bound direct detection
experiments, yielding intermittent but coherent signals with repetition rates
exceeding one per decade and crossing times less than a day. These episodic
increases in the axion density and kinematic coherence suggest new approaches
for axion DM searches, including for the QCD axion. Dense structures made up of
axions from $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-5}$ eV are detectable through gravitational
lensing searches, and their gravitational interactions can also perturb
baryonic structures and alter star formation. At very high misalignment
amplitudes, the axion field can undergo self-interaction-induced implosions
long before matter-radiation equality, producing potentially-detectable
low-frequency stochastic gravitational waves.

warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) expected to dominate the baryon budget at

evolution models. We present a deep redshift survey in the field of
1ES1553+113, a blazar with a unique combination of UV+X-ray spectra for surveys
of the circum-/intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM). Nicastro et al. 2018 reported
the detection of two O VII WHIM absorbers at $z=0.4339$ and $0.3551$ in its
spectrum, suggesting that the WHIM is metal-rich and sufficient to close the
missing baryons problem. Our survey indicates that the blazar is a member of a
$z=0.433$ group and that the higher-$z$ O VII candidate arises from its
intragroup medium. The resulting bias precludes its use in baryon censuses. The
$z=0.3551$ candidate occurs in an isolated environment 630 kpc from the nearest
galaxy (with stellar mass $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9.7$) which we show is
unexpected for the WHIM. Finally, we characterize the galactic environments of
broad H I Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (Doppler widths of $b=40-80$ \kms;
$T\lesssim4\times10^5$ K) which provide metallicity independent WHIM probes. On
average, broad Ly$\alpha$, absorbers are ${\approx}2\times$ closer to the
nearest luminous ($L>0.25 L_*$) galaxy (700 kpc) than narrow ($b<30$ \kms;
$T\lesssim4\times10^5$ K) ones (1300 kpc) but ${\approx}2\times$ further than
O\,VI absorbers (350 kpc). These observations suggest that gravitational
collapse heats portions of the IGM to form the WHIM but with feedback that does
not enrich the IGM far beyond galaxy/group halos to levels currently observable
in UV/X-ray metal lines.

highly correlated ($r > 0.75$) with the 353 GHz $Q$ and $U$ maps of polarized
dust emission observed by Planck and reproduce many of its large-scale
features. The $E/B$ ratio of the dust emission maps agrees well with the
HI-derived maps at large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 120$), supporting the
interpretation that this asymmetry arises from the coupling of linear density

particles, which move under the combined influence of stochastic internal
self-propulsions (activity) and a heat bath. The main idea is to consider joint
trajectories of particles' positions and self-propulsions. It is then possible
to exploit formal similarity of an active system and a system consisting of two
subsystems interacting with different heat reservoirs and coupled by a
non-symmetric interaction. The resulting thermodynamic description closely
follows the standard stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, total entropy
production, $\Delta s_\text{tot}$, can be decomposed into housekeeping, $\Delta
s_\text{hk}$, and excess, $\Delta s_\text{ex}$, parts. Both $\Delta
s_\text{tot}$ and $\Delta s_\text{hk}$ satisfy fluctuation theorems. The
average rate of the steady-state housekeeping entropy production can be related
to the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem via a Harada-Sasa
relation. The excess entropy production enters into a Hatano-Sasa-like
relation, which leads to a generalized Clausius inequality involving the change
of the system's entropy and the excess entropy production. Interestingly,
although the evolution of particles' self-propulsions is free and uncoupled
from that of their positions, non-trivial steady-state correlations between
these variables lead to the non-zero excess dissipation in the reservoir
coupled to the self-propulsions.

the low energy couplings less transparent. We derive the field range of $\xi$
for generic forms of the axion kinetic metric and $U(1)$ charges, and identify
the field basis for which all non-derivative couplings of $\xi$ are quantized
in a manner manifestly consistent with the periodicity of $\xi$. Generically
St\""uckelberg mixing reduces the axion field range. In particular, the mixings
between $N$ axions and $(N-1)$ $U(1)$ gauge bosons typically result in an

experimental applications. However, for the use as Dark Matter (DM) detectors,
such crystals demand a high level of radio-purity, not achievable by means of
standard industrial techniques. One of the main difficulties comes from the
presence of potassium that always accompanies sodium in alkali halides. On the
other hand, the arguable DM detection by DAMA experiment using NaI(Tl)
scintillating crystals requires a reliable verification able to either confirm
the existence of DM or rule out the DAMA claim. Ultra-low radioactivity NaI(Tl)
crystals, particularly with very low potassium content, are therefore
indispensable to overcome the current stalemate in Dark Matter searches.
Nonetheless, apart from DAMA-LIBRA experiments, to date, no other experiment
has succeeded in building a detector from NaI(Tl) crystals with potassium
content of ppb level. This work describes recent results in the preparation of
ultra-radio-pure NaI(Tl) crystals using a modified Bridgman method. A
double-walled platinum crucible technique has been designed and reliability
tests show that 5 ppb of potassium in the NaI(Tl) crystals of 2 and 3 inches in
diameter can be achieved starting from NaI powder with potassium content of the
order of 10 ppb. The potassium excess is segregated in the tail-side of the as
grown ingot where measured potassium concentration is above 20 ppb. The
purifying effect of Bridgman growth for larger NaI(Tl) crystals is currently

  Relational Algebra",,,,,"cs.DB cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the expressive power of the LARA language -- a recently proposed
unified model for expressing relational and linear algebra operations -- both
in terms of traditional database query languages and some analytic tasks often
performed in machine learning pipelines. We start by showing LARA to be
expressive complete with respect to first-order logic with aggregation. Since
LARA is parameterized by a set of user-defined functions which allow to
transform values in tables, the exact expressive power of the language depends
on how these functions are defined. We distinguish two main cases depending on
the level of genericity queries are enforced to satisfy. Under strong
genericity assumptions the language cannot express matrix convolution, a very
important operation in current machine learning operations. This language is
also local, and thus cannot express operations such as matrix inverse that
exhibit a recursive behavior. For expressing convolution, one can relax the
genericity requirement by adding an underlying linear order on the domain.
This, however, destroys locality and turns the expressive power of the language
much more difficult to understand. In particular, although under complexity
assumptions the resulting language can still not express matrix inverse, a
proof of this fact without such assumptions seems challenging to obtain.

net-load curve and has a significant impact on power system operation and
planning. The concept of duck curve is widely used to describe the timing
imbalance between peak demand and PV generation. The traditional duck curve is
deterministic and only shows a single extreme or typical scenario during a day.
Thus, it cannot capture both the probability of that scenario and the
uncertainty of PV generation and loads. These weaknesses limit the application
of the duck curve on power system planning under high PV penetration. To
address this issue, the novel concepts of probabilistic duck curve (PDC) and
probabilistic ramp curve (PRC) are proposed to accurately model the uncertainty
and variability of electricity net load and ramp under high PV penetration. An
efficient method is presented for modeling PDC and PRC using kernel density
estimation, copula function, and dependent discrete convolution. Several
indices are designed to quantify the characteristics of the PDC and PRC. For
the application, we demonstrate how the PDC and PRC will benefit flexible
resource planning. Finally, an empirical study on the Qinghai provincial power
system of China validates the effectiveness of the presented method. The
results of PDC and PRC intuitively illustrate that the ramp demand and the
valley of net load face considerable uncertainty under high PV penetration. The
results of flexible resource planning indicate that retrofitting coal-fired
units has remarkable performance on enhancing the power system flexibility in
Qinghai. In average, reducing the minimal output of coal-fired units by 1 MW
will increase PV accommodation by over 4 MWh each day.

interpolated weighting schemes and then carefully characterize their asymptotic
performances. Our analysis reveals a U-shaped performance curve with respect to
the level of data interpolation, and proves that a mild degree of data
interpolation {\em strictly} improves the prediction accuracy and statistical
stability over those of the (un-interpolated) optimal $k$NN algorithm. This
theoretically justifies (predicts) the existence of the second U-shaped curve

However, breast is highly sensitive to x-ray radiation. It is critically
important for healthcare to reduce radiation dose. Few-view cone-beam CT only
uses a fraction of x-ray projection data acquired by standard cone-beam breast

perform a supervised learning to train the neural network from few-view CT

through meta-learning, where a meta-learner extracts information from observed
tasks during meta-training to quickly adapt to new tasks during meta-testing.
In this formulation, the number of shots exploited during meta-training has an

number used in meta-training should match the one used in meta-testing to
obtain the best performance. We introduce a theoretical analysis of the impact

  Pattern Recognition 2020",,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge of a cumbersome
teacher model into a lightweight student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities among categories
provided by the teacher model, and in this sense, only strong teacher models
are deployed to teach weaker students in practice. In this work, we challenge
this common belief by following experimental observations: 1) beyond the
acknowledgment that the teacher can improve the student, the student can also
enhance the teacher significantly by reversing the KD procedure; 2) a
poorly-trained teacher with much lower accuracy than the student can still
improve the latter significantly. To explain these observations, we provide a
theoretical analysis of the relationships between KD and label smoothing
regularization. We prove that 1) KD is a type of learned label smoothing
regularization and 2) label smoothing regularization provides a virtual teacher
model for KD. From these results, we argue that the success of KD is not fully
due to the similarity information between categories from teachers, but also to
the regularization of soft targets, which is equally or even more important.
  Based on these analyses, we further propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge
Distillation (Tf-KD) framework, where a student model learns from itself or
manuallydesigned regularization distribution. The Tf-KD achieves comparable
performance with normal KD from a superior teacher, which is well applied when
a stronger teacher model is unavailable. Meanwhile, Tf-KD is generic and can be
directly deployed for training deep neural networks. Without any extra
computation cost, Tf-KD achieves up to 0.65\% improvement on ImageNet over
well-established baseline models, which is superior to label smoothing
regularization.

Entropy Analysis (DEA), a technique designed to detect the action of crucial
events in time series generated by complex dynamical systems. The time distance
between two consecutive crucial events is described by an inverse power law
distribution density with a power index $\mu$ close to the value $\mu = 2$,
corresponding to an ideal $1/f$ noise. DEA was used in the recent past to study
neurophysiological processes that in the healthy condition are found to
generate $1/f$ noise and $\mu$ close to $2$. In this paper we find that the
seismic fluctuations in both California and Hindu-Kush of extended areas
implying the action of many faults, $\mu \approx 2.1$, while in regions
involving the action of only one fault, or of a very small number of faults,
$\mu \approx 2.4$. This observation led us the conjectures that the seismic
criticality is due to the interaction of many faults. To support this
conjecture we adopted a dynamical model for fault dynamics proposed by Brown
and Tosatti and we have extended it to describe the interaction between many
faults. The DEA applied to surrogate sequences generated by this dynamical
model, yields $\mu = 2.1$ for a single fault and $\mu = 2,4$ for many
interacting faults, in a good agreement with the observation of real seismic
fluctuations. This result supports our conjecture and suggests interesting
applications to neurophysiological and sociological processes.

Therefore, speech recognition and speech synthesis models need to be robust to
such variations. In this work, we present an analysis to show that it is
important to disentangle the latent causal factors of variation in the original
data to accomplish these tasks. Based on this, we present approaches to
disentangle such variations from the data using Latent Stochastic Models.
Specifically, we present a method to split the latent prior space into
continuous representations of dominant speech modes present in the magnitude
spectra of audio signals. We propose a completely unsupervised approach using
multinode latent space variational autoencoders (VAE). We show that the
constraints on the latent space of a VAE can be in-fact used to separate speech

cubes, from 13% to 99% when creating rows of 4 cubes, and from 84% to 95% when
clearing toys arranged in adversarial patterns. Efficiency with respect to
actions per trial typically improves by 30% or more, while training takes just
1-20k actions, depending on the task.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate direct sim to real transfer. We are able to
create real stacks in 100% of trials with 61% efficiency and real rows in 100%
of trials with 59% efficiency by directly loading the simulation-trained model
on the real robot with no additional real-world fine-tuning. To our knowledge,
this is the first instance of reinforcement learning with successful sim to
real transfer applied to long term multi-step tasks such as block-stacking and
row-making with consideration of progress reversal. Code is available at

individual iron lines are found to have uncertainties on the metallicities of
the individual stars that can be calibrated sufficiently well for the intrinsic
dispersion to be separated cleanly from random measurement error. The median
intrinsic iron spread is found to be 0.045 dex, which is small but
unambiguously measured to be non-zero in most cases. There is large variation
between clusters, but more luminous globular clusters, above 10^5 L_sun, have
increasingly large iron spreads on average; no trend between iron spread and

removal, would hinder a detection of the 21 cm power spectrum for the targeted
EoR line-of-sight modes in the range 0.2 < k_parallel < 0.5\ h^-1 Mpc. After
systematic removal, we find we can recover these modes in the power spectrum
down to the integrated noise-floor of a nightly observation, achieving a
dynamic range in the EoR window of 10^-6 in power (mK^2 units) with respect to
the bright galactic foreground signal. In the absence of other systematics and
assuming the systematic suppression demonstrated here continues to lower noise

capacity to set competitive upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum. For

Solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variability is one of the key inputs
to models of the Earth's climate. Understanding solar irradiance fluctuations
also helps to place the Sun among other stars in terms of their brightness
variability patterns and to set detectability limits for terrestrial
exo-planets.
  Aims. One of the most successful and widely used models of solar irradiance
variability is SATIRE-S. It uses spectra of the magnetic features and
surrounding quiet Sun computed with the ATLAS9 spectral synthesis code under
the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). SATIRE-S has been at
the forefront of solar variability modelling, but due to the limitations of the
LTE approximation its output SSI has to be empirically corrected below 300 nm,
which reduces the physical consistency of its results. This shortcoming is
addressed in the present paper.
  Methods. We replace the ATLAS9 spectra of all atmospheric components in
SATIRE-S with the spectra calculated using the non-LTE Spectral Synthesis Code
(NESSY). We also use Fontenla et al. (1999) temperature and density
stratification models of the solar atmosphere to compute the spectrum of the
quiet Sun and faculae.
  Results. We compute non-LTE contrasts of spots and faculae and combine them
with the SDO/HMI filling factors of the active regions to calculate the total
and spectral solar irradiance variability during solar cycle 24.
  Conclusions. The non-LTE contrasts result in total and spectral solar
irradiance in good agreement with the empirically corrected output of the LTE
version. This suggests that empirical correction introduced into SATIRE-S
output is well judged and that the corrected total and spectral solar
irradiance obtained from the SATIRE-S model in LTE is fully consistent with the
results of non-LTE computations.

of significant interest because of their photophysical properties, including
single-photon emission, and promising applications in quantum communication and

atomic vacancies within the triangular lattice is confounded by the exponential
scaling of defect candidates with the number of removed atoms. Herein, we
collect more than 1000 spectra consisting of single, isolated zero-phonon lines
between 1.69 and 2.25 eV, observing 6 quantized zero-phonon lines arising from
hexagonal boron nitride vacancies. A newly developed computational framework
for isomer cataloguing significantly narrows the number of candidate vacancies.
Direct lattice imaging of hexagonal boron nitride, electronic structure
calculations, and subsequent boric acid etching are used to definitively assign
the 6 features. Systematic chemical etching supports the assignment by
demonstrating the sequence of growth of successively larger vacancy centres
from smaller ones, with the defects including a single B vacancy and a 16-atom
triangular defect. These features exhibit a range of emission lifetimes from 1

hexagonal boron nitride near 1370 cm-1. This assignment should significantly
advance the solid-state chemistry and photophysics of such vacancy emitters.

by generalizing this model to include a disformal coupling between the scalar
field $\varphi$ and matter, where the Jordan frame metric ${\tilde g}_{\mu\nu}$
is related to the Einstein frame one $g_{\mu\nu}$ by ${\tilde
g}_{\mu\nu}=A(\varphi)^2 (g_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda\, \partial_\mu \varphi \,

attractor mechanism towards general relativity. However, the existence of this
attractor requires a value of disformal scale of the order $\Lambda\gtrsim
H_0^{-2}$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble parameter of today, which is much larger
than the scale relevant for spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars $\Lambda
\sim R_s^{2}$ with $R_s (\sim 10^{-22} H_0^{-1})$ being the typical radius of
these stars. The large values of $\Lambda$ necessary for the attractor
mechanism (i) suppress spontaneous scalarization altogether inside neutron
stars and (ii) induce ghost instabilities on scalar field fluctuations, thus
preventing a resolution of the tension. We argue that the problem arises

cities in China and facilitate people's lives. However, at the same time, it
also raises many problems about dock-less shared bike management due to the
mismatching between demands and real distribution of bikes. Before deploying
dock-less shared bikes in a city, companies need to make a plan for dispatching
bikes from places having excessive bikes to locations with high demands for
providing better services. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring
fine-grained bike demands anywhere in a new city before the deployment of
bikes. This problem is challenging because new city lacks training data and
bike demands vary by both places and time. To solve the problem, we provide
various methods to extract discriminative features from multi-source geographic
data, such as POI, road networks and nighttime light, for each place. We
utilize correlation Principle Component Analysis (coPCA) to deal with extracted
features of both old city and new city to realize distribution adaption. Then,
we adopt a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based model to mine daily patterns
for each place from fine-grained bike demand. We propose an attention based
local CNN model, \textbf{ALCNN}, to infer the daily patterns with latent
features from coPCA with multiple CNNs for modeling the influence of neighbor
places. In addition, ALCNN merges latent features from multiple CNNs and can
select a suitable size of influenced regions. The extensive experiments on
real-life datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms competitive
methods.

success of MPI. Extending MPI by composing its operations with user-level
operations provides useful integration with the progress engine and completion
notification methods of MPI. However, the existing extensibility mechanism in
MPI (generalized requests) is not widely utilized and has significant
drawbacks.
  MPI can be generalized via scheduled communication primitives, for example,
by utilizing implementation techniques from existing MPI-3 nonblocking
collectives and from forthcoming MPI-4 persistent and partitioned APIs.
Non-trivial schedules are used internally in some MPI libraries; but, they are
not accessible to end-users.
  Message-based communication patterns can be built as libraries on top of MPI.
Such libraries can have comparable implementation maturity and potentially
higher performance than MPI library code, but do not require intimate knowledge
of the MPI implementation. Libraries can provide performance-portable
interfaces that cross MPI implementation boundaries. The ability to compose
additional user-defined operations using the same progress engine benefits all
kinds of general purpose HPC libraries.
  We propose a definition for MPI schedules: a user-level programming model
suitable for creating persistent collective communication composed with new
application-specific sequences of user-defined operations managed by MPI and
fully integrated with MPI progress and completion notification. The API
proposed offers a path to standardization for extensible communication
schedules involving user-defined operations. Our approach has the potential to
introduce event-driven programming into MPI (beyond the tools interface),
although connecting schedules with events comprises future work.

This phenomenon is referred to as \textit{catastrophic forgetting} and
motivates the field called lifelong learning. Recently, episodic memory based
approaches such as GEM \cite{lopez2017gradient} and A-GEM
\cite{chaudhry2018efficient} have shown remarkable performance. In this paper,
we provide the first unified view of episodic memory based approaches from an

episodic memory based lifelong learning, called MEGA-I and MEGA-II. MEGA-I and
MEGA-II modulate the balance between old tasks and the new task by integrating
the current gradient with the gradient computed on the episodic memory.
Notably, we show that GEM and A-GEM are degenerate cases of MEGA-I and MEGA-II

the loss changes over time. Our proposed schemes address this issue by using
novel loss-balancing updating rules, which drastically improve the performance
over GEM and A-GEM. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed

loud vocalizations. A fully-coupled phase-averaging approach is used to model
the flow, bubble dynamics, and corresponding acoustics. A previously
hypothesized waveguiding mechanism is assessed for varying acoustic frequencies
and net void fractions. Reflections within the bubbly region result in
observable waveguiding for only a small range of flow parameters. A
configuration of multiple whales surrounding and vocalizing towards an annular
bubble net is also analyzed. For a range of flow parameters the bubble net
keeps its core region substantially quieter than the exterior. This approach
appears more viable, though it relies upon the cooperation of multiple whales.
A spiral bubble net configuration that circumvents this requirement is also
investigated. The acoustic wave behaviors in the spiral interior vary
qualitatively with the vocalization frequency and net void fraction. The
competing effects of vocalization guiding and acoustic attenuation are
quantified. Low void fraction cases allow low-frequency waves to partially
escape the spiral region, with the remaining vocalizations still exciting the
net interior. Higher void fraction nets appear preferable, guiding even
low-frequency vocalizations while still maintaining a quiet net interior.

without the need for a trusted data collector. Error-optimal primitives (for,
e.g., estimating means and item frequencies) under LDP have been well studied.
For analytical tasks such as range queries, however, the best known error bound
is dependent on the domain size of private data, which is potentially
prohibitive. This deficiency is inherent as LDP protects the same level of
indistinguishability between any pair of private data values for each data
downer.
  In this paper, we utilize an extension of $\epsilon$-LDP called Metric-LDP or
$E$-LDP, where a metric $E$ defines heterogeneous privacy guarantees for
different pairs of private data values and thus provides a more flexible knob
than $\epsilon$ does to relax LDP and tune utility-privacy trade-offs. We show
that, under such privacy relaxations, for analytical workloads such as linear
counting, multi-dimensional range counting queries, and quantile queries, we
can achieve significant gains in utility. In particular, for range queries
under $E$-LDP where the metric $E$ is the $L^1$-distance function scaled by
$\epsilon$, we design mechanisms with errors independent on the domain sizes;
instead, their errors depend on the metric $E$, which specifies in what

three families and an additional global anomala Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. The
breaking of the former allows us to give masses to the exotic fermionic sector
and the later generates the necessary zeros in the mass matrices to explain the
fermionic mass hierarchy. In addition, the large energy scale associated with
the spontaneously breaking (SSB) of the PQ symmetry provides a solution to the
strong CP-problem and an axion that could be a possible dark matter candidate.
Also, the SSB allows to generate right-handed neutrino masses, so the active

dots has been recently achieved in GaAs and Si/SiGe based quantum dots, opening
prospects for turning stationary spin qubits into mobile ones, and solving in
this way the problem of long-distance communication between quantum registers
in a scalable quantum computing architecture based on quantum dots. We consider
theoretically the process of such an electron transfer between two
tunnel-coupled quantum dots, focusing on control by slowly varying the detuning
of energy levels in the dots. We take into account the fluctuations in detuning
caused by $1/f$-type noise that is ubiquitous in semiconductor nanostructures,
and analyze their influence on probability of successful transfer of an
electron in a spin eigenstate. With numerical and analytical calculations we
show that probability of electron not being transferred due to $1/f^\beta$
noise in detuning is $\propto \sigma^2 t^{\beta-1}/v$, where $\sigma$
characterizes the noise amplitude, $t$ is the interdot tunnel coupling, and $v$
is the detuning sweep rate. Interestingly, this means that the noise-induced
errors in charge transfer are independent of $t$ for $1/f$ noise. For realistic
parameters taken from experiments on silicon-based quantum dots, we obtain the
minimal probability of charge transfer failure between a pair of dots is
limited by $1/f$ noise in detuning to be the on order of $0.01$. This means
that in order to reliably transfer charges across many quantum dots, charge
noise in the devices should be further suppressed, or tunnel couplings should
be increased, in order to allow for faster transfer (and less exposure to
noise), while not triggering the deterministic Landau-Zener excitation.

three different types of behaviour. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out
to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative
situations. When it is zero, the three types of behaviour extrapolate to the
three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak and strong topological

When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with
surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling
these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero
perpendicular Dirac velocity the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore
not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates

MONET achieves this by ensuring that the node embeddings are trained on a

unstructured embedding dimensions into an interpretable topology-only,

effectiveness of MONET though our experiments on a variety of real world

physical world. Spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are underpinning
concepts. There is a paucity of rigorous definitions for these quantities,
which are general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems,
while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative
evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems. This is particularly
true for many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the
acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to
an end-user. Here, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial
resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many forms of modern
computational imaging are discussed. An intrinsic duality of spatial resolution
and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related
uncertainty relationship determining a trade-off between the two quantities.
Examples are presented with applications to super-resolution imaging, inline
holography and ghost imaging.

is the dual of the value function, which satisfies Bellman's optimality

optimal control problem. The constrained optimal control problem is then solved
with a primal-dual algorithm. This formulation is extended to the case with
external disturbances, and we show that the robust constrained optimal control
can be solved with a modified primal-dual algorithm. We apply this formulation
to the problem of finding the optimal safe controller that minimizes the
cumulative intervention. An adaptive cruise control (ACC) example is used to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed, wherein we compare the result of the

boosting trees, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other
methods in many supervised learning scenarios. In particular, Forests dominate
other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured,
so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices.
However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and
speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks
(ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the
reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature
magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations
fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest
approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random
matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of
Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes
corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one
can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature
locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live
on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we
demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show
superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting
movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.
In all simulations and real data, Manifold Oblique Random Forest (MORF)
algorithm outperforms approaches that ignore feature space structure and
challenges the performance of ConvNets. Moreover, MORF runs fast and maintains
interpretability and theoretical justification.

blending flux comes from the lens star. The measured multiband lens flux,
combined with a constraint from the microlensing model, allows us to narrow
down the previously unresolved mass and distance of the lens system. We find
that the primary lens is a dwarf on the K/M boundary (0.581 \pm 0.033 M_sun)

planets and is comparable to the snow-line location at young ages. We calculate
that the a priori detection probability of Kojima-1Lb is only \sim 35%, which
may imply that Neptunes are common around the snow line, as recently suggested
by the transit and radial velocity techniques. The host star is the brightest
among the microlensing planetary systems (Ks = 13.7), offering a great

of SNRs is different between Type Ia and CC SNRs. This is in contrast to
previous investigations, which have shown that Type Ia and CC SNRs have
different asymmetries in the X-ray emission from their ejecta. The sample
consists of 19 SNRs which have been classified as either Type Ia or CC. The
quadrupole and octupole moments normalized to their monopole moments (total
emission) are used as a measure of asymmetry of the emission. A broad range (by
a factor of ~1000) is found for both quadrupole and octupole normalized
moments. The strongest correlation we find is that large quadrupole moments are
associated with large octupole moments, indicating that both serve as similar
indicators of asymmetry. The other correlation we find is that both moments
increase with SNR age or radius. This indicates that interstellar medium
structure is a strong contributor to asymmetries in the radio emission from
SNRs. This does not seem to apply to molecular clouds, because we find that
association of a SNR with a molecular cloud is not correlated with larger
quadrupole or octupole moments.

undergo collective motion, leading to persistent dynamical behavior out of
equilibrium. In cells, cytoskeletal filaments and motor proteins self-organize
into complex structures important for cell mechanics, motility, and division.
Collective dynamics of cytoskeletal systems can be reconstituted using filament
gliding experiments, in which cytoskeletal filaments are propelled by
surface-bound motor proteins. These experiments have observed diverse dynamical
states, including flocks, polar streams, and single-filament spirals. Recent
experiments with microtubules and kinesin motor proteins found that the
collective behavior of filaments can be tuned by altering the concentration of
the crowding macromolecule methylcellulose in solution. Increasing the
methycellulose concentration reduced filament crossing, promoted alignment, and
led to a transition from active, isotropically oriented filaments to locally
aligned polar streams. This emergence of collective motion is typically
explained as an increase in alignment interactions by Vicsek-type models of
active polar particles. However, it is not yet understood how steric
interactions and bending stiffness modify the collective behavior of active
filaments. We use simulations of driven filaments with tunable soft repulsion
and rigidity in order to better understand how the interplay between filament
flexibility and steric effects can lead to different active dynamic states. We
find that increasing filament stiffness decreases the probability of filament
alignment, yet increases collective motion and long-range order, in contrast to
the assumptions of a Vicsek-type model. In addition to repulsion and driving,
tuning filament stiffness can promote collective behavior, and controls the
transition between active isotropic filaments, locally aligned flocks, and
polar streams.

Spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres at high resolving powers is
rapidly gaining popularity to measure the presence of atomic and molecular
species. While this technique is robust against contaminant absorption in the
Earth's atmosphere, the non stationary stellar spectrum creates a
non-negligible source of noise that can alter or even prevent detection. Aims.
We aim at using three-dimensional stellar simulations to directly remove the
signature of the star from observations, and prior to cross correlation with
templates for the planet's atmosphere Methods. We compute synthetic spectra
from 3D simulations of stellar convection and we couple them with an analytical
model reproducing the correct geometry of a transiting exoplanet. We apply the
method to HD 189733, and analyse transmission and emission spectroscopy of its
hosted exoplanet. In addition, we analyse emission spectroscopy of the non
transiting exoplanet 51 Pegasi b. Results. We find a significant improvement in
the planet detectability when removing the stellar spectrum with our method. We
show that the method is superior to a simple parametrisation of the stellar
line profile or to the use of one-dimensional stellar models. This is due to
the intrinsic treatment of convection, which allows us to correctly reproduce
asymmetric spectral lines, and model center-to-limb variation and
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In the case of 51 Pegasi b, we succeed at
confirming a previous tentative detection of the planet's K-band spectrum due
to the improved suppression of stellar residuals. Future high-resolution
observations will benefit from the synergy with stellar spectroscopy, and can
be used to test the correct modelling of physical processes in stellar
atmospheres. We highlight key improvements in modelling techniques and

differential privacy (DP) dictates that the scale of DP noise must grow
linearly with the number of the queries, or that the privacy budget must be
split equally between all the queries, so that the privacy budget across all
the queries remains bounded and consistent with the privacy guarantees. To
avoid this drawback of DP, we consider datasets containing almost periodic time
series, composed of periodic components and noisy variations on top that are
independent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by
that, for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide
the privacy budget across the entire, possibly infinite, horizon. Instead, for
periodic time series, we generate DP reports for the first period and report
the same DP reports periodically. In practice, however, exactly periodic time
series do not exist as the data always contains small variations due to random
or uncertain events. For instance, the energy consumption of a household may
repeat the same daily pattern with slight variations due to minor changes to
the habits of the individuals. The underlying periodic pattern is a function of
the private information of the households. It might be desired to protect the
privacy of households by not leaking information about the recurring patterns
while the individual daily variations are almost noise-like with little to no
privacy concerns (depending on the situation). Motivated by this, we define DP
for almost periodic datasets and develop a Laplace mechanism for responding to
linear queries. We provide statistical tools for testing the validity of almost
periodicity assumption. We use multiple energy datasets containing smart-meter

determine the specific frequencies of gravitational waves from the evolving
PNSs with accretion from core bounce to black hole formation by the
relativistic Cowling approximation. We find that the frequency of the $f$-mode
gravitational waves can be expressed as a function of the average density of
the PNS at each time step almost independently of the progenitor models in
accord with the previous studies on ordinary PNSs. We also find that the ratio
of the $g_1$-mode frequency to the $f$-mode frequency is insensitive to the
progenitor, but strongly depends on the compactness of the PNSs. Having a
simultaneous observation of the $f$- and $g_1$-mode gravitational waves, it
would provide the information of the average density and compactness of PNS,
which can reconstruct the evolution of mass and radius of the PNSs as a

delay, or social cost, may be significantly greater than if people followed
routes assigned to them by a social planner. This effect is accentuated when
human drivers share roads with autonomous vehicles. When routed optimally,
autonomous vehicles can make traffic networks more efficient, but when acting
selfishly, the introduction of autonomous vehicles can actually worsen
congestion. We seek to mitigate this effect by influencing routing choices via
tolling. We consider a network of parallel roads with affine latency functions
that are heterogeneous, meaning that the increase in capacity due to to the
presence of autonomous vehicles may vary from road to road. We show that if
human drivers and autonomous users have the same tolls, the social cost may be
arbitrarily worse than when optimally routed. We then prove qualities of the
optimal routing and use them to design tolls that are guaranteed to minimize
social cost at equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
tolling scheme that yields a unique socially optimal equilibrium for parallel
heterogeneous network with affine latency functions.

domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. We
present our first step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a
high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven local causal
state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based
representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into
their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local
causal state variables. Complex spatiotemporal systems are generally highly
structured and organize around a lower-dimensional skeleton of coherent
structures, and in several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in
capturing such structures from observational and simulated scientific data. To

text representation often focuses on the so-called forward implication, i.e.,
preceding words are taken as the context of later words for creating
representations, thus ignoring the fact that the semantics of a text segment is
a product of the mutual implication of words in the text: later words
contribute to the meaning of preceding words. We introduce the concept of
interaction and propose a two-perspective interaction representation, that
encapsulates a local and a global interaction representation. Here, a local
interaction representation is one that interacts among words with
parent-children relationships on the syntactic trees and a global interaction
interpretation is one that interacts among all the words in a sentence. We
combine the two interaction representations to develop a Hybrid Interaction
Representation (HIR).
  Inspired by existing feature-based and fine-tuning-based pretrain-finetuning
approaches to language models, we integrate the advantages of feature-based and
fine-tuning-based methods to propose the Pre-train, Interact, Fine-tune (PIF)

dimensionless parameter, $Q$, which is determined by Fermi momentum, $k_F$ and
breakdown scale, $\Lambda_b$. The degree-of-belief (DoB) intervals predicted by
the chiral effective field theory are calculated within the corresponding
expansion coefficients and the specific prior probability distribution
functions in terms of Bayes theorem. The truncation errors of EOSs, generated
by the DoB intervals, exhibit good order-by-order convergences with different
chiral expansion order potentials. When DoB is considered as $1\sigma$

binding energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter
are consistent with the results given by a simple error analysis method

slopes including ""red"" (Orus, Leucus), ""less red"" (Eurybates,
Patroclus-Menoetius) and intermediate (Polymele), indicating a range of
compositional end-members or geological histories. We perform radiative
transfer modeling of several possible surface compositions. We find that the
mild-sloped spectra and low albedo of Patroclus and Eurybates imply similar
compositions. Eurybates (~7 wt.% water ice) and Patroclus (~4 wt.% water ice)
are consistent with a hydrated surface. Models for Orus and Leucus are
consistent with each other and require a significantly more reddening agent
(e.g. iron-rich silicates or tholin-like organics). Polymele has a linear
spectrum like Patroclus, but a higher albedo more closely aligned with
Orus/Leucus, defying simple grouping. Solar system formation models generally
predict that the Jovian Trojans accreted in the outer solar system. Our
observations and analysis are generally consistent with this expectation,

  Heuristic for a SAT Solver?","Camera-ready for NeurIPS 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Graph-$Q$-SAT, a branching heuristic for a Boolean SAT solver
trained with value-based reinforcement learning (RL) using Graph Neural
Networks for function approximation. Solvers using Graph-$Q$-SAT are complete
SAT solvers that either provide a satisfying assignment or proof of
unsatisfiability, which is required for many SAT applications. The branching
heuristics commonly used in SAT solvers make poor decisions during their
warm-up period, whereas Graph-$Q$-SAT is trained to examine the structure of
the particular problem instance to make better decisions early in the search.
Training Graph-$Q$-SAT is data efficient and does not require elaborate dataset
preparation or feature engineering. We train Graph-$Q$-SAT using RL interfacing
with MiniSat solver and show that Graph-$Q$-SAT can reduce the number of
iterations required to solve SAT problems by 2-3X. Furthermore, it generalizes
to unsatisfiable SAT instances, as well as to problems with 5X more variables
than it was trained on. We show that for larger problems, reductions in the
number of iterations lead to wall clock time reductions, the ultimate goal when
designing heuristics. We also show positive zero-shot transfer behavior when
testing Graph-$Q$-SAT on a task family different from that used for training.
While more work is needed to apply Graph-$Q$-SAT to reduce wall clock time in
modern SAT solving settings, it is a compelling proof-of-concept showing that
RL equipped with Graph Neural Networks can learn a generalizable branching
heuristic for SAT search.

  Feature Randomness and Feature Drift",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering using deep autoencoders has been thoroughly investigated in recent
years. Current approaches rely on simultaneously learning embedded features and
clustering the data points in the latent space. Although numerous deep
clustering approaches outperform the shallow models in achieving favorable
results on several high-semantic datasets, a critical weakness of such models
has been overlooked. In the absence of concrete supervisory signals, the
embedded clustering objective function may distort the latent space by learning
from unreliable pseudo-labels. Thus, the network can learn non-representative
features, which in turn undermines the discriminative ability, yielding worse
pseudo-labels. In order to alleviate the effect of random discriminative
features, modern autoencoder-based clustering papers propose to use the
reconstruction loss for pretraining and as a regularizer during the clustering
phase. Nevertheless, a clustering-reconstruction trade-off can cause the
\textit{Feature Drift} phenomena. In this paper, we propose ADEC (Adversarial
Deep Embedded Clustering) a novel autoencoder-based clustering model, which
addresses a dual problem, namely, \textit{Feature Randomness} and
\textit{Feature Drift}, using adversarial training. We empirically demonstrate
the suitability of our model on handling these problems using benchmark real
datasets. Experimental results validate that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art autoencoder-based clustering methods.

to two dimensions (2D). Similar to the 1D case, in some cases, 2D cyclic codes
can also be constructed to guarantee a specified minimum distance. Many aspects
of these codes are yet unexplored. Motivated by the problem of constructing
quantum codes, in this paper, we study some structural properties of certain
bicyclic codes. We show that a primitive narrow-sense bicyclic hyperbolic code
of length $n^2$ contains its dual if and only if its design distance is lower
than $n-\Delta$, where $\Delta=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. We extend the
sufficiency condition to the non-primitive case as well. We also show that over
quadratic extension fields, a primitive bicyclic hyperbolic code of length
$n^2$ contains Hermitian dual if and only if its design distance is lower than
$n-\Delta_h$, where $\Delta_h=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Our results are analogous
to some structural results known for BCH and Reed-Solomon codes. They further
our understanding of bicyclic codes. We also give an application of these

lower-limb exoskeleton. The method was tested on the exoskeleton ATALANTE,
which was designed and built by the French start-up company Wandercraft. The
main objective of this paper is to present a practical method of realizing more
robust walking on hardware through active ankle compensation. The nominal gait
was generated through the hybrid zero dynamic framework. The ankles are
individually controlled to establish three main directives; (1) keeping the
non-stance foot parallel to the ground, (2) maintaining rigid contact between
the stance foot and the ground, and (3) closing the loop on pelvis orientation
to achieve better tracking. Each individual component of this method was
demonstrated separately to show each component's contribution to stability. The
results showed that the ankle controller was able to experimentally maintain
static balance in the sagittal plane while the exoskeleton was balanced on one
leg, even when disturbed. The entire ankle controller was then also
demonstrated on crutch-less dynamic walking. During testing, an anatomically
correct manikin was placed in the exoskeleton, in lieu of a paraplegic patient.
The pitch of the pelvis of the exoskeleton-manikin system was shown to track
the gait trajectory better when ankle compensation was used. Overall, active
ankle compensation was demonstrated experimentally to improve balance in the
sagittal plane of the exoskeleton manikin system and points to an improved
practical approach for stable walking.

networks (RNNs) is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel neuro-evolution algorithm based on
ant colony optimization (ACO), called ant swarm neuro-evolution (ASNE), for
directly optimizing RNN topologies. The procedure selects from multiple modern
recurrent cell types such as Delta-RNN, GRU, LSTM, MGU and UGRNN cells, as well
as recurrent connections which may span multiple layers and/or steps of time.
In order to introduce an inductive bias that encourages the formation of
sparser synaptic connectivity patterns, we investigate several variations of
the core algorithm. We do so primarily by formulating different functions that
drive the underlying pheromone simulation process (which mimic L1 and L2
regularization in standard machine learning) as well as by introducing ant
agents with specialized roles (inspired by how real ant colonies operate),
i.e., explorer ants that construct the initial feed forward structure and
social ants which select nodes from the feed forward connections to
subsequently craft recurrent memory structures. We also incorporate a
Lamarckian strategy for weight initialization which reduces the number of
backpropagation epochs required to locally train candidate RNNs, speeding up
the neuro-evolution process. Our results demonstrate that the sparser RNNs
evolved by ASNE significantly outperform traditional one and two layer
architectures consisting of modern memory cells, as well as the well-known NEAT
algorithm. Furthermore, we improve upon prior state-of-the-art results on the
time series dataset utilized in our experiments.

complex chaotic dynamics, which manifests as the existence of a torus destroyed

plasticity fluctuation of metallic glasses tested at the same conditions can be
interpreted from the chaotic shear-band dynamics, which could leads to an
uncertainty on the appearance of the critical condition for runaway shear

between structural disordering and temperature rise within the shear band. By
tuning the deformation parameters, the chaotic dynamics can be transformed to a
periodic orbit state corresponding to a smaller plasticity fluctuation in

cost-effective and efficient. However, most existing research on operating PSDs
are based on inflexible heuristic algorithms or without considering the network
formulation, which may lead to strategies that violate operational

mitigating unbalances in LVDN via SVC and PSDs together. This paper, after
presenting the dispatch model of SVC, formulates the decision-making process as
a mixed-integer non-convex programming (MINCP) problem considering all

distribution of the future state of the atmosphere with a set of past
observations that correspond to the best analogs of a deterministic Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP). This model post-processing method has been
successfully used to improve the forecast accuracy for several weather-related
applications including air quality, and short-term wind and solar power
forecasting, to name a few. In order to provide a meaningful probabilistic
forecast, the AnEn method requires storing a historical set of past predictions
and observations in memory for a period of at least several months and spanning
the seasons relevant for the prediction of interest. Although the memory and
computing costs of the AnEn method are less expensive than using a brute-force
dynamical ensemble approach, for a large number of stations and large datasets,
the amount of memory required for AnEn can easily become prohibitive.
Furthermore, in order to find the best analogs associated with a certain
prediction produced by a NWP model, the current approach requires searching
over the entire dataset by applying a certain metric. This approach requires
applying the metric over the entire historical dataset, which may take a
substantial amount of time. In this work, we investigate an alternative way to
implement the AnEn method using deep generative models. By doing so, a
generative model can entirely or partially replace the dataset of pairs of
predictions and observations, reducing the amount of memory required to produce
the probabilistic forecast by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the
generative model can generate a meaningful set of analogs associated with a
certain forecast in constant time without performing any search, saving a
considerable amount of time even in the presence of huge historical datasets.

instrumental noise, which often contains transient non-Gaussian artifacts,
astronomers have traditionally relied on bootstrap methods such as time slides.
Bootstrap methods sample with replacement, comparing single-observatory data to
construct a background distribution, which is used to assign a false-alarm
probability to candidate signals. While bootstrap methods have played an
important role establishing the first gravitational-wave detections, there are
limitations. First, as the number of detections increases, it makes
increasingly less sense to treat single-observatory data as bootstrap-estimated
noise, when we know that the data are filled with astrophysical signals, some
resolved, some unresolved. Second, it has been known for a decade that
background estimation from time-slides eventually breaks down due to saturation
effects, yielding incorrect estimates of significance. Third, the false alarm
probability cannot be used to weight candidate significance, for example when
performing population inference on a set of candidates. Given recent debate
about marginally resolved gravitational-wave detection claims, the question of
significance has practical consequences. We propose a Bayesian framework for
calculating the odds that a signal is of astrophysical origin versus
instrumental noise without bootstrap noise estimation. We show how the
astrophysical odds can safely accommodate glitches. We argue that it is
statistically optimal. We demonstrate the method with simulated noise and
provide examples to build intuition about this new approach to significance.

the standard framework for astro-physical measurement in transient
gravitational-wave astronomy. Usually, stochastic sampling algorithms are used
to estimate posterior probability distributions over the parameter spaces of
models describing experimental data. The most physically accurate models
typically come with a large computational overhead which can render data
analysis extremely time consuming, or possibly even prohibitive. In some cases
highly specialized optimizations can mitigate these issues, though they can be
difficult to implement, as well as to generalize to arbitrary models of the
data. Here, we propose an accurate, flexible and scalable method for
astro-physical inference: parallelized nested sampling. The reduction in the
wall-time of inference scales almost linearly with the number of parallel
processes running on a high-performance computing cluster. By utilizing a pool
of several hundreds or thousands of CPUs in a high-performance cluster, the
large wall times of many astrophysical inferences can be alleviated while
simultaneously ensuring that any gravitational-wave signal model can be used
""out of the box"", i.e., without additional optimization or approximation. Our
method will be useful to both the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations and the wider

issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this
end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer
to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling
technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be
shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of
increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns,
the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices
use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end
devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for
aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks
since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL
for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex
mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are
involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation,
and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey,

alleviates these drawbacks by relying on two observations: (1) we find that a
small (coarse-grained) DTEM model is sufficient to classify the majority of the
classification queries correctly, such that a classification is valid only if
its corresponding confidence level is greater than or equal to a predetermined
classification confidence threshold; (2) we find that in these fewer harder

one of expert DTEM (fine-grained) models, which is explicitly trained for that
particular case. We implement RADE in Python based on scikit-learn and evaluate

consecutively capturing multiple evaders in the play region. The players have
heterogeneous moving speeds and the pursuers have heterogeneous capture radii.
Since this game is hard to analyze directly, we decompose the whole game as
many subgames which involve multiple pursuers and only one evader. Then, these
subgames are used as a building block for the pursuer-evader matching. First,
for multiple pursuers and one evader, we introduce an evasion space (ES) method
characterized by a potential function to construct a guaranteed pursuer winning
strategy. Then, based on this strategy, we develop conditions to determine
whether a pursuit team can guard the goal region against one evader. It is
shown that in 3D, if a pursuit team is able to defend the goal region against
an evader, then at most three pursuers in the team are necessarily needed. We
also compute the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation

horizon an MBMC is solved and the strategies of the pursuers are given. We also

by a variety of methods. The Desert Fireball Network--DFN--uses a network of
cameras to track and triangulate incoming fireballs to recover meteorites with
orbits. Fireball detection is done on-camera, but due to the design constraints
imposed by remote deployment, the cameras are limited in processing power and
time. We describe the processing software used for fireball detection under
these constrained circumstances. A cascading approach was implemented, whereby
computationally simple filters are used to discard uninteresting portions of
the images, allowing for more computationally expensive analysis of the
remainder. This allows a full night's worth of data; over 1000 36 megapixel
images to be processed each day using a low power single board computer. The
algorithms chosen give a single camera successful detection large fireball rate
of better than 96 percent, when compared to manual inspection, although
significant numbers of false positives are generated. The overall network
detection rate for triangulated large fireballs is estimated to be better than
99.8 percent, by ensuring that there are multiple double stations chances to
detect one fireball.

the following two approaches. The first approach is soft VAD, which performs a
soft selection of frame-level features extracted from a speaker feature

speaker embedding. The second approach is self-adaptive VAD, which fine-tunes
the pre-trained VAD on the speaker verification data to reduce the domain

the information from the input wavefunction into the output qubits. In this
Letter, we show that this process can also be viewed from the opposite
direction: the quantum information in the output qubits is scrambled into the
input. This observation motivates us to use the tripartite information, a
quantity recently developed to characterize information scrambling, to diagnose
the training dynamics of quantum neural networks. We empirically find strong
correlation between the dynamical behavior of the tripartite information and
the loss function in the training process, from which we identify that the
training process has two stages for randomly initialized networks. In the early
stage, the network performance improves rapidly and the tripartite information
increases linearly with a universal slope, meaning that the neural network
becomes less scrambled than the random unitary. In the latter stage, the
network performance improves slowly while the tripartite information decreases.
We present evidences that the network constructs local correlations in the
early stage and learns large-scale structures in the latter stage. We believe
this two-stage training dynamics is universal and is applicable to a wide range
of problems. Our work builds bridges between two research subjects of quantum
neural networks and information scrambling, which opens up a new perspective to
understand quantum neural networks.

localisation. Given a detected marker in an image, a frequent task is to
estimate the 6DOF pose of the marker relative to the camera, which is an
instance of planar pose estimation (PPE). Although there are mature techniques,
PPE suffers from a fundamental ambiguity problem, in that there can be more
than one plausible pose solutions for a PPE instance. Especially when
localisation of the marker corners is noisy, it is often difficult to
disambiguate the pose solutions based on reprojection error alone. Previous
methods choose between the possible solutions using a heuristic criteria, or
simply ignore ambiguous markers.
  We propose to resolve the ambiguities by examining the consistencies of a set
of markers across multiple views. Our specific contributions include a novel
rotation averaging formulation that incorporates long-range dependencies
between possible marker orientation solutions that arise from PPE ambiguities.
We analyse the combinatorial complexity of the problem, and develop a novel
lifted algorithm to effectively resolve marker pose ambiguities, without
discarding any marker observations. Results on real and synthetic data show
that our method is able to handle highly ambiguous inputs, and provides more
accurate and/or complete marker-based mapping and localisation.

satisfactory performance under quiet conditions. However, when noise signals

distorted, thereby resulting in poor recognition performance. To suppress noise
effects, speech enhancement (SE) is a necessary unit in EAS devices. Recently,
a time-domain speech enhancement algorithm based on the fully convolutional

objective function (termed FCN(S) in short) has received increasing attention
due to its simple structure and effectiveness of restoring clean speech signals
from noisy counterparts. With evidence showing the benefits of FCN(S) for
normal speech, this study sets out to assess its ability to improve the
intelligibility of EAS simulated speech. Objective evaluations and listening
tests were conducted to examine the performance of FCN(S) in improving the
speech intelligibility of normal and vocoded speech in noisy environments. The
experimental results show that, compared with the traditional minimum-mean
square-error SE method and the deep denoising autoencoder SE method, FCN(S) can
obtain better gain in the speech intelligibility for normal as well as vocoded
speech. This study, being the first to evaluate deep learning SE approaches for

integrated into an EAS processor to benefit users in noisy environments.

of Pd/Pt embedded planar carbon nitride (CN) for CO oxidation, has been
investigated via spin$-$polarized density functional theory calculations. We
find that Pd/Pt can be firmly anchored in the porous CN monolayer due to the
strong hybridization between Pd/Pt-d orbitals and adjacent N-2p orbitals. The
resulting high adsorption energy and large diffusion barrier of Pd/Pt, ensuring
the remarkable stability of the catalyst Pd/Pt@CN during CO oxidation reaction.
The three distinct CO reaction mechanisms, namely, Eley-Rideal (ER),
Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH), and Tri-molecular Eley-Rideal (TER), are taken into
consideration comparatively. Intriguingly, the oxidation reaction on Pd@CN
prefers to proceed through the less common TER mechanism, where two CO
molecules and one O2 molecule need to cross a small reaction barrier of 0.48
eV, and finally dissociate into two CO2 molecules. However, the LH mechanism is
the most relevant one on Pt@CN with a rate-limiting reaction barrier of 0.68
eV. Moreover, the origin of SAC's reactivity enhancement is the electronic
""acceptance$-$donation"" interaction caused by orbital hybridization between
Pd/Pt and preadsorbed O2/CO. Our findings are expected to widen the catalytic

is given as the intersection of a (possibly infinite) number of closed convex

inequality, where the associated convex function is general (possibly
non-differentiable). For finding a point satisfying all the convex inequalities
we design and analyze random projection algorithms using special subgradient
iterations and extrapolated stepsizes. Moreover, the iterate updates are
performed based on parallel random observations of several constraint
components. For these minibatch stochastic subgradient-based projection methods
we prove sublinear convergence results and, under some linear regularity
condition for the functional constraints, we prove linear convergence rates. We
also derive conditions under which these rates depend explicitly on the
minibatch size. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deriving
conditions that show when minibatch stochastic subgradient-based projection
updates have a better complexity than their single-sample variants.

significantly improved by gradient-based search methods such as DARTS. However,
recent literature has brought doubt to the generalization ability of DARTS,
arguing that DARTS performs poorly when the search space is changed, i.e, when
different set of candidate operators are used. Regularization techniques such
as early stopping have been proposed to partially solve this problem. In this
paper, we tackle this problem from a different perspective by identifying two
contributing factors to the collapse of DARTS when the search space changes:
(1) the correlation of similar operators incurs unfavorable competition among
them and makes their relative importance score unreliable and (2) the
optimization complexity gap between the proxy search stage and the final
training. Based on these findings, we propose a new hierarchical search
algorithm. With its operator clustering and optimization complexity match, the
algorithm can consistently find high-performance architecture across various
search spaces. For all the five variants of the popular cell-based search
spaces, the proposed algorithm always obtains state-of-the-art architecture
with best accuracy on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet over other
well-established DARTS-alike algorithms. Code is available at

for a polynomial $f$ of degree $s$ on the boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$, which comes
from hypercontractivity, replacing the right hand side of this inequality by an
explicit bivariate function of $p$ and $s$, which is smaller than $(p-1)^{s/2}$
for any $p > 2$ and $s > 0$. We show the new bound to be tight, within a
smaller order factor, for the Krawchouk polynomial of degree $s$.
  This implies several nearly-extremal properties of Krawchouk polynomials and
Hamming spheres (equivalently, Hamming balls). In particular, Krawchouk
polynomials have (almost) the heaviest tails among all polynomials of the same
degree and $\ell_2$ norm (this has to be interpreted with some care). The
Hamming spheres have the following approximate edge-isoperimetric property: For
all $1 \le s \le \frac{n}{2}$, and for all even distances $0 \le i \le
\frac{2s(n-s)}{n}$, the Hamming sphere of radius $s$ contains, up to a
multiplicative factor of $O(i)$, as many pairs of points at distance $i$ as
possible, among sets of the same size (there is a similar, but slightly weaker
and somewhat more complicated claim for general distances). This also implies
that Hamming spheres are (almost) stablest with respect to noise among sets of
the same size. In coding theory terms this means that a Hamming sphere
(equivalently a Hamming ball) has the maximal probability of undetected error,
among all binary codes of the same rate.
  We also describe a family of hypercontractive inequalities for functions on
$\{0,1\}^n$, which improve on the `usual' ""$q \rightarrow 2$"" inequality by
taking into account the concentration of a function (expressed as the ratio
between its $\ell_r$ norms), and which are nearly tight for characteristic
functions of Hamming spheres.

achieves near-optimal query time for patterns compressed with the classic
Lempel-Ziv compression scheme. Along the way we develop several data structural
techniques of independent interest, including a novel data structure that
compactly encodes all LZ77 compressed suffixes of a string in linear space and
a general decomposition of tries that reduces the search time from logarithmic

the unbalanced classes in a dataset. Our DFL method is an improvement on the
recently reported Focal Loss (FL) cross-entropy function, which proposes a
scaling method that puts more weight on the examples that are difficult to
classify over those that are easy. However, the scaling parameter of FL is
empirically set, which is problem-dependent. In addition, like other CE
variants, FL only focuses on the loss of true classes. Therefore, no loss
feedback is gained from the false classes. Although focusing only on true
examples increases probability on true classes and correspondingly reduces
probability on false classes due to the nature of the softmax function, it does
not achieve the best convergence due to avoidance of the loss on false classes.
Our DFL method improves on the simple FL in two ways. Firstly, it takes the
idea of FL to focus more on difficult examples than the easy ones, but
evaluates loss on both true and negative classes with equal importance.
Secondly, the scaling parameter of DFL has been made learnable so that it can
tune itself by backpropagation rather than being dependent on manual tuning. In
this way, our proposed DFL method offers an auto-tunable loss function that can
reduce the class imbalance effect as well as put more focus on both true
difficult examples and negative easy examples.

neural network, containing a symmetric equilibrium generative adversarial
network (SEGAN), multi-scale features refine blocks (MSFRB), and attention

proposed network is granted powerful multi-scale representation capability to
extract detail information. First, SEGAN constructs a symmetric adversarial
architecture, which forces generator to produce more realistic images with
local details. Second, MSFRB are devised to prevent high-resolution features
from being obscured, thereby merging multi-scale features better. Finally, the
AM is employed to encourage the network to concentrate on discriminative

dimension reduction on X alone while considering all predictors in the

develop a novel dynamic partial dimension reduction method, which could handle
the dynamic dimension reduction issue and also allows the dependency of X on W.

revealing in terms of intermediate variables, the existence of a
Reynolds-number invariant logarithmic region. It provides a theoretical
foundation for addressing important questions in the scaling of the streamwise
mean velocity and variance. The key insight emerging from the analysis is that
the scale separation between two adjacent layers is proportional to
$\sqrt{Re_{\tau}}$, rather than $Re_{\tau}$. This suggests that, in order to
realise Reynolds-number asymptotic invariance, much higher Reynolds numbers may
be necessary to achieve sufficient scale separation. The formulation provides a
theoretical basis for explaining the presence of a power law for the mean
velocity in pipe flow at low Reynolds numbers and the co-existence of power and
log laws at higher Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, the Townsend-Perry `constant'
for the variance is shown to exhibit a systematic Reynolds-number dependence.

its significance in achieving promising performance. However, conventional
spatial context-based methods simply assume that spatially neighboring pixels
should correspond to the same land-cover class, so they often fail to correctly
discover the contextual relations among pixels in complex situations, and thus
leading to imperfect classification results on some irregular or inhomogeneous
regions such as class boundaries. To address this deficiency, we develop a new
HSI classification method based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the relations among arbitrarily
structured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN, there are two
novel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual
relations for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of
traditional GCN is often limited to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to
capture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing successive graph
convolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the
original 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the
connective relationships among image regions by learning the improved adjacency
matrix and the 'edge filter', so that the graph can be gradually refined to
adapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional layer. Such
updated graph will in turn result in accurate region representations, and vice
versa. The experiments carried out on three real-world benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvement in the
classification performance when compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.

continuing to train merely the EB tickets towards the target accuracy.
Experiments based on various deep networks and datasets validate: 1) the

multi-scale registration fields from convolutional feature pyramids. Our
contributions are two-fold: (i) we design a two-stream 3D encoder-decoder
network which computes two convolutional feature pyramids separately for a pair
of input volumes, resulting in strong deep representations that are meaningful
for deformation estimation; (ii) we propose a pyramid registration module able
to predict multi-scale registration fields directly from the decoding feature
pyramids. This allows it to refine the registration fields gradually in a
coarse-to-fine manner via sequential warping, and enable the model with the
capability for handling significant deformations between two volumes, such as
large displacements in spatial domain or slice space. The proposed Dual-PRNet
is evaluated on two standard benchmarks for brain MRI registration, where it

maximal load is one of the most basic problems in combinatorial optimization.
Motivated by product planing and data placement, we study a natural extension
called Class Constrainted Scheduling (CCS). In this problem, each job
additionally belongs to a class and each machine can only schedule jobs from at
most $c$ different classes. Even though this problem is closely related to the
Class Constraint Bin Packing, the Class Constraint Knapsack and the Cardinality
Constraint variants, CCS lacks results regarding approximation algorithms, even
though it is also well-known to be NP-hard. We fill this gap by analyzing the
problem considering three different ways to feasibly allot the jobs: The
splittable case, where we can split and allot the jobs arbitrarily; the
preemptive case, where jobs pieces belonging to the same job are not allowed to
be scheduled in parallel; and finally the non-preemptive case, where no
splitting is allowed at all. For each case we introduce the first PTAS where
neither $c$ nor the number of all classes have to be a constant. In order to
achieve this goal, we give new insights about the structure of optimal
solutions. This allows us to preprocess the instance appropriately and by
additionally grouping variables to set up a configuration Integer Linear
Program (ILP) with N-fold structure. This N-fold structure allows us to solve
the ILP efficiently. Further we developed the first simple approximation
algorithms with a constant approximation ratio running in strongly polynomial
time. The splittable and the preemptive case admit algorithms with ratio $2$
and a running time of $O(n^2 \log(n))$. The algorithm for the non-preemptive
case has a ratio of $7/3$ and a running time of $O(n^2 \log^2(n))$. All results
even hold if the number of machines cannot be bounded by a polynomial in $n$.

are available is a challenging task. One solution is a cut-and-paste method
that generates a training dataset by cutting object areas out of training
images and pasting them onto other background images. A detector trained on a
dataset generated with a cut-and-paste method suffers from the conventional
domain shift problem, which stems from a discrepancy between the source domain
(generated training dataset) and the target domain (real test dataset). Though
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods are able to reduce this gap, it is
limited because they do not consider the difference of domain gaps of
foreground and background. In this study, we present that the conventional
domain gap can be divided into two sub-domain gaps for foreground and
background. Then, we show that the original cut-and-paste approach suffers from
a new domain gap problem, an unbalanced domain gaps, because it has two
separate source domains for foreground and background, unlike the conventional
domain shift problem. Then, we introduce an advanced cut-and-paste method to
balance the unbalanced domain gaps by diversifying the foreground with GAN
(generative adversarial network)-generated seed images and simplifying the
background using image processing techniques. Experimental results show that
our method is effective for balancing domain gaps and improving the accuracy of
object instance detection in a cluttered indoor environment using only a few
seed images. Furthermore, we show that balancing domain gaps can improve the
detection accuracy of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

by the quasilocal mass. The small sphere limit of quasilocal mass provides us
the most local notion of gravitational energy. In four dimensions, the limits
were shown be the stress tensor in non-vacuum and the Bel-Robinson tensor in
vacuum. We study the local gravitational energy in higher dimensions through
the lens of the small sphere limits of various quasilocal mass proposals which
can be appropriately generalised beyond four dimensions, and report a new
quantity $\Q$ which potentially characterises the local gravitational energy
content in vacuum. We find that the limits at presence of matter yield the
stress tensor as expected, but the vacuum limits are not proportional to the
Bel-Robinson superenergy $Q$ in dimensions $n>4$. The result defies the role of
the Bel-Robinson superenergy as characterising the gravitational energy in
higher dimensions, albeit the fact that it uniquely generalises. More
surprisingly, $\Q$ replace the Bel-Robinson superenergy $Q$ in all three
quasilocal mass proposals that we study. However, $\Q$ cannot be directly
interpreted as a local gravitational energy because of its non-positivity. The
physical meaning of $\Q$ awaits more evidence from investigating other
quasilocal masses in higher dimensions.

invariant in a graph $G$ and the same invariant in the complement $G^c$ of $G$
is called a Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequality or relation. The Nordhaus-Gaddum

complementary graph $G^{bc}$ is a bipartite graph with $V(G^{bc})=V(G)$ and
$E(G^{bc})=\{xy:\ x\in X,\ y\in Y$ and $xy \notin E(G)\}$. In this paper, we
obtain the Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequalities for connectivity of bipartite

the image visibility. However, there is very few exploration about the quality

performance of various de-raining algorithms. In this paper, we first create a
de-raining quality assessment (DQA) database that collects 206 authentic rain

rain removal algorithms. Then, a subjective study is conducted on our DQA
database, which collects the subject-rated scores of all de-rained images. To
quantitatively measure the quality of de-rained image with non-uniform
artifacts, we propose a bi-directional feature embedding network (B-FEN) which
integrates the features of global perception and local difference together.
Experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms many
existing universal blind image quality assessment models. To help the research
towards perceptually preferred de-raining algorithm, we will publicly release

homomorphism $\omega \colon (\mathbb{R},+) \to \mathbb{T}$ the Dirichlet series
$\sum a_{n} \omega(\lambda_{n})e^{-\lambda_{n}s}$ converges on the open right

theory of Hardy spaces $\mathcal{H}_p$ of such series. The aim here is to prove
variants of Helson's theorem within our recent theory of Hardy spaces
$\mathcal{H}_{p}(\lambda),\,1\le p \le \infty,$ of general Dirichlet series. To
be more precise, in the reflexive case $1 < p < \infty$ we extend Helson's
result to Dirichlet series in $\mathcal{H}_{p}(\lambda)$ without any further

the wider class of frequencies satisfying the so-called Landau condition (more

of the independent branching process (IBP). In the IBP, each cell gives rise to
a daughter cell at a neighboring site at a constant rate. In the first
improvement, we do not allow such births along the bond connecting the cell to
its mother cell. In the second, we iteratively evolve the system by a growth as
IBP for a duration $\Delta$ t, followed by culling process in which if any cell
produced a descendant within this interval, who occupies the same site as the
cell itself, then the descendant is removed. We study the improvement on the
upper bound on the velocity for different dimensions d. The bounds are
asymptotically exact in the large-d limit. But in $d =2$, the improvement over
the IBP approximation is only a few percent.

spectral line survey in the range 72-350 GHz obtained with the IRAM 30m
telescope, complementary observations of the CO $J$=3-2 transition with the
JCMT, and observations at 1"" angular resolution of the CO $J$=2-1 transition
with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. In addition to CO, we have
detected rotational transitions from SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, CS, HCO$^{+}$ and HCN. A
strong chemical differentiation is observed in the southern and northern lobes
of the jet. Radiative transfer analysis in the Large Velocity Gradient
approximation yields typical molecular abundances of the order of $10^{-8}$ for
all molecular species other than CO. Overall, the jets exhibit an unusual
chemical composition, as CS, SO and H$_2$CO are found to be the most abundant
species, with a typical abundance of (3-4)$\times 10^{-8}$. The transverse size
of the CO jet emission estimated from interferometric observations is about
1000 au, suggesting that we are detecting emission from a turbulent layer of
gas entrained by the jet in its propagation and not the jet itself. We propose
that some molecular species could be the signatures of the specific

Agglomerates of different morphologies are fragmented via random bond removal.
The fragmentation algorithm relies on mapping each agglomerate onto an
adjacency matrix. The numerically-determined fragment size distributions are
U-shaped, clusters break predominantly into two largely dissimilar fragments,
becoming more uniform as the fractal dimension decreases. A symmetric beta
distribution reproduces the fragment distribution rather accurately. Its
exponent depends on the structure (fractal dimension) and number of monomers of
the initial agglomerate. A universal fragment distribution, a function only of
the initial fractal dimension, is derived by requiring that it satisfy the
fragmentation conversation laws and the straight-chain limit. We argue that the
fragmentation rate is proportional to the initial agglomerate size.

via simulation of 100 different patient conditions in each of six different
patient scenarios, and compared to standard PID control. Controller performance
was tracked using the sum of the absolute error (SAE) between the desired and
measured LVEDP. The lower SAE on control tracking performance means the
measured LVEDP follows the desired LVEDP faster and with less amplitude
oscillations preventing ventricle suction and pulmonary congestion (mean and

much less than non-keywords, the curated training set is naturally imbalanced.

tested using three unseen scientific corpora and one news corpus. Comparative
study of the results with several recent keyword and keyphrase extraction

This substantiates our claim that graph-theoretic properties of words are
effective discriminators between keywords and non-keywords. We support our
argument by showing that the improved performance of the proposed method is
statistically significant for all datasets. We also evaluate the effectiveness
of the pre-trained model on Hindi and Assamese language documents. We observe

titanium and becomes one of the primary mechanisms in titanium alloyed with
simple metals. As these solute elements also lead to a pronounced reduction of
the energy of the basal stacking fault, one can hypothesize that they promote
basal dissociation of dislocations which can then easily glide in the basal
planes. Here, we verify the validity of this hypothesis using ab initio
calculations to model the interaction of a screw dislocation with indium (In)
and tin (Sn). These calculations confirm that these simple metals are attracted
by the stacking fault existing in the dislocation core when it is dissociated
in a basal plane, but this interaction is not strong enough to stabilize a
planar configuration, even for a high solute concentration in the core. Energy
barrier calculations reveal that basal slip, in the presence of In and Sn,
proceeds without any planar dissociation, with the dislocation being spread in
pyramidal and prismatic planes during basal slip like in pure Ti. The
corresponding energy barrier is higher in presence of solute atoms, showing
that In and Sn do not ease basal slip but increase the corresponding lattice
friction. This strengthening of basal slip by solute atoms is discussed in view
of available experimental data.

phased antenna array in a typical European town. We systematically collect
fine-grained 3D angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) data,

of phased antenna arrays in terms of number of link opportunities, achievable

losses in estimated data rate occur for beam misalignments in the order of the
half-power beamwidth, with significant and irregular variations for larger

increasing with the misalignment. Our results strongly suggest that the effect

nonlinear behavior of the magnetic fields generated by an eMNS. Both machine
learning methods outperformed the state-of-the-art linear multipole
electromagnet method (LMEM). The RF and the ANN model reduced the root mean

80%, respectively, over the entire current range of the eMNS. At high current

Jordan","Towards Understanding the Transferability of Deep Representations",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks trained on a wide range of datasets demonstrate
impressive transferability. Deep features appear general in that they are
applicable to many datasets and tasks. Such property is in prevalent use in
real-world applications. A neural network pretrained on large datasets, such as
ImageNet, can significantly boost generalization and accelerate training if
fine-tuned to a smaller target dataset. Despite its pervasiveness, few effort
has been devoted to uncovering the reason of transferability in deep feature
representations. This paper tries to understand transferability from the
perspectives of improved generalization, optimization and the feasibility of
transferability. We demonstrate that 1) Transferred models tend to find flatter
minima, since their weight matrices stay close to the original flat region of
pretrained parameters when transferred to a similar target dataset; 2)
Transferred representations make the loss landscape more favorable with
improved Lipschitzness, which accelerates and stabilizes training
substantially. The improvement largely attributes to the fact that the
principal component of gradient is suppressed in the pretrained parameters,
thus stabilizing the magnitude of gradient in back-propagation. 3) The
feasibility of transferability is related to the similarity of both input and
label. And a surprising discovery is that the feasibility is also impacted by
the training stages in that the transferability first increases during
training, and then declines. We further provide a theoretical analysis to
verify our observations.

us to reason about why many relaxed methods in 3D vision behave so well? And
also allows us to offer a generic relaxed solver in a rather straightforward

convolution that solely operates on the object link graph without exploring

limits their modeling capability and may lead to inferior performance on noisy

to jointly model object links and attribute relations for graph representation
learning. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient dimensionwise
separable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC) for filtering node features.
Theoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node
features on both the object dimension and the attribute dimension to learn more
effective representations. Empirically, we demonstrate that by modeling
attribute relations, DSGC achieves significant performance gain over

particularly their entrained magnetic field, is crucial for understanding their

sensing techniques can probe these quantities in the corona, the region where
CMEs form and acquire their defining characteristics. Radio observations offer
the most direct means for estimating the magnetic field when gyrosynchontron
emission is detected. In this work we measure various CME plasma parameters,
including its magnetic field, by modelling the gyrosynchrotron emission from a
CME. The dense spectral coverage over a wide frequency range provided by the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) affords a much better spectral sampling than
possible before. The MWA images also provide much higher imaging dynamic range,
enabling us to image these weak emissions. Hence we are able to detect radio
emission from a CME at larger distances ($4.73 R_\odot$) than have been
reported before. The flux densities reported here are amongst the lowest
measured in similar works. Our ability to make extensive measurements on a slow
and otherwise unremarkable CME suggest that with the availability of data from
the new generation instruments like the MWA, it should now be possible to make
routine direct detections of radio counterparts of CMEs.

  dimensions?","Short version appears in ISAAC 2019",,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Packing is a classical problem where one is given a set of subsets of
Euclidean space called objects, and the goal is to find a maximum size subset
of objects that are pairwise non-intersecting. The problem is also known as the
Independent Set problem on the intersection graph defined by the objects.
Although the problem is NP-complete, there are several subexponential
algorithms in the literature. One of the key assumptions of such algorithms has
been that the objects are fat, with a few exceptions in two dimensions; for
example, the packing problem of a set of polygons in the plane surprisingly
admits a subexponential algorithm. In this paper we give tight running time
bounds for packing similarly-sized non-fat objects in higher dimensions.
  We propose an alternative and very weak measure of fatness called the
stabbing number, and show that the packing problem in Euclidean space of
constant dimension $d \geq 3$ for a family of similarly sized objects with
stabbing number $\alpha$ can be solved in $2^{O(n^{1-1/d}\alpha)}$ time. We
prove that even in the case of axis-parallel boxes of fixed shape, there is no
$2^{o(n^{1-1/d}\alpha)}$ algorithm under ETH. This result smoothly bridges the
whole range of having constant-fat objects on one extreme ($\alpha=1$) and a
subexponential algorithm of the usual running time, and having very ""skinny""
objects on the other extreme ($\alpha=n^{1/d}$), where we cannot hope to
improve upon the brute force running time of $2^{O(n)}$, and thereby
characterizes the impact of fatness on the complexity of packing in case of
similarly sized objects. We also study the same problem when parameterized by
the solution size $k$, and give a $n^{O(k^{1-1/d}\alpha)}$ algorithm, with an
almost matching lower bound.

separation result, proving that while shallow models can exhibit incremental
learning dynamics, they require the initialization to be exponentially small

success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional
disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively
learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable
behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group
theory. Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited
to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact
groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory). In this paper
we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and
implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups. In our approach the
differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a
generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra. This leads to a
flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions

adiabatically, so that the time-dependence of the interaction Hamiltonian is
entirely enclosed in the time-dependent mode functions, satisfying the boundary
conditions at the plate surface, at any given time. Using time-dependent
perturbation theory, we evaluate the transition rate to the ground-state of the

also show that the presence of the oscillating mirror significantly affects the
physical features of the spontaneous emission of the atom, in particular the

symmetric lateral peaks in the spectrum, not present in the case of a static
mirror, due to the modulated environment. The two lateral peaks are separated
from the central peak by the modulation frequency, and we discuss the
possibility to observe them with actual experimental techniques of dynamical

  1. Settle a conjecture of Talagrand [Tal97] proving that $$\int_{\left\{

C\cdot\mathrm{var}\left(f\right)\cdot\left(\log\left(\frac{1}{\sum\mathrm{Inf}_{i}^{2}\left(f\right)}\right)\right)^{1/2},$$
where $h_{f}\left(x\right)$ is the number of edges at $x$ along which $f$
changes its value, and $\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)$ is the influence of the
$i$-th coordinate.
  2. Strengthen several classical inequalities concerning the influences of a
Boolean function, showing that near-maximizers must have large vertex
boundaries. An inequality due to Talagrand states that for a Boolean function
$f$, $\mathrm{var}\left(f\right)\leq
C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)}{1+\log\left(1/\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)\right)}$.
We give a lower bound for the size of the vertex boundary of functions
saturating this inequality. As a corollary, we show that for sets that satisfy
the edge-isoperimetric inequality or the Kahn-Kalai-Linial inequality up to a
constant, a constant proportion of the mass is in the inner vertex boundary.
  3. Improve a quantitative relation between influences and noise stability
given by Keller and Kindler.

very similar form regardless of wavelength due to the mixing of star-forming

become apparent when an additional colour separation is included, which suggest
extensions to this work could look at different colours at fixed magnitude
limits. We test our fitting formula against observations, finding reasonable
agreement with some measurements within $1\sigma$ statistical uncertainties,

B 100, 014506 (2019)]. We argue that such structure may appear due to the
presence of superconductivity. In spite of the very small value of the exchange
field acting on the superconducting electrons in EuRbFe$_4$As$_4$, the exchange
mechanism of interaction between superconductivity and ferromagnetism could
dominate over the electromagnetic one and this circumstance could favor the
emergence of the short-period magnetic structure (with the period less than the
superconducting coherence length). Such a situation differs from one in the
similar compound P-doped EuFe$_2$As$_2$, where the electromagnetic mechanism
dominates and results in the magnetic structure with significantly larger
period (of the order of London penetration depth). We also analyze the effect
of the external magnetic field on the onset temperature of the modulated
magnetic structure.

this dataset, intrinsic evaluations on the resolution of ellipsis and
co-reference show that the GECOR model significantly outperforms the
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) baseline model in terms of EM, BLEU and F1 while
extrinsic evaluations on the downstream dialogue task demonstrate that our

final layers of a neural network (NN). Gradient boosting is an additive
expansion algorithm in which a series of models are trained sequentially to
approximate a given function. A neural network can also be seen as an additive
expansion where the scalar product of the responses of the last hidden layer
and its weights provide the final output of the network. Instead of training
the network as a whole, the proposed algorithm trains the network sequentially
in $T$ steps. First, the bias term of the network is initialized with a
constant approximation that minimizes the average loss of the data. Then, at
each step, a portion of the network, composed of $J$ neurons, is trained to
approximate the pseudo-residuals on the training data computed from the
previous iterations. Finally, the $T$ partial models and bias are integrated as
a single NN with $T \times J$ neurons in the hidden layer. Extensive
experiments in classification and regression tasks, as well as in combination
with deep neural networks, are carried out showing a competitive generalization
performance with respect to neural networks trained with different standard
solvers, such as Adam, L-BFGS, SGD and deep models. Furthermore, we show that
the proposed method design permits to switch off a number of hidden units
during test (the units that were last trained) without a significant reduction
of its generalization ability. This permits the adaptation of the model to
different classification speed requirements on the fly.

items and switch internal state information from the data plane at line rate.
With the support of programmable data planes and programming language P4,
switches parse telemetry instruction headers and determine which telemetry
items to attach using custom metadata. At the network edge, telemetry
information is removed and the original packets are forwarded while telemetry
reports are sent to a distributed stream processor for further processing by a
network monitoring platform. In order to avoid excessive load on the stream
processor, telemetry items should not be sent for each individual packet but
rather when certain events are triggered. In this paper, we develop a
programmable INT event detection mechanism in P4 that allows customization of
which events to report to the monitoring system, on a per-flow basis, from the
control plane. At the stream processor, we implement a fast INT report
collector using the kernel bypass technique AF_XDP, which parses telemetry
reports and streams them to a distributed Kafka cluster, which can apply
machine learning, visualization and further monitoring tasks. In our
evaluation, we use real-world traces from different data center workloads and
show that our approach is highly scalable and significantly reduces the network
overhead and stream processor load due to effective event pre-filtering inside
the switch data plane. While the INT report collector can process around 3 Mpps
telemetry reports per core, using event pre-filtering increases the capacity by
10-15x.

generalization Tetris have brought the theory of indexing and join processing
together by developing a geometric framework for joins. These algorithms take
as input an index $\mathcal{B}$, referred to as a box cover, that stores output
gaps that can be inferred from traditional indexes, such as B+ trees or tries,
on the input relations. The performances of these algorithms highly depend on
the certificate of $\mathcal{B}$, which is the smallest subset of gaps in
$\mathcal{B}$ whose union covers all of the gaps in the output space of a query
$Q$. We study how to generate box covers that contain small size certificates
to guarantee efficient runtimes for these algorithms. First, given a query $Q$
over a set of relations of size $N$ and a fixed set of domain orderings for the
attributes, we give a $\tilde{O}(N)$-time algorithm called GAMB which generates
a box cover for $Q$ that is guaranteed to contain the smallest size certificate
across any box cover for $Q$. Second, we show that finding a domain ordering to
minimize the box cover size and certificate is NP-hard through a reduction from
the 2 consecutive block minimization problem on boolean matrices. Our third
contribution is a $\tilde{O}(N)$-time approximation algorithm called ADORA to
compute domain orderings, under which one can compute a box cover of size
$\tilde{O}(K^r)$, where $K$ is the minimum box cover for $Q$ under any domain
ordering and $r$ is the maximum arity of any relation. This guarantees
certificates of size $\tilde{O}(K^r)$. We combine ADORA and GAMB with Tetris to
form a new algorithm we call TetrisReordered, which provides several new beyond
worst-case bounds. On infinite families of queries, TetrisReordered's runtimes
are unboundedly better than the bounds stated in prior work.

an important role even when taking the thermodynamic limit. We investigate the
bulk thermodynamic properties of the Ising model in two and three dimensional

the cornerstone of evolutionary game theory that explores the vitality of
competing strategies in different social dilemma situations. In our present
work we explore the possible consequences of two slightly modified imitation
protocols that are exaggerated and gradual learning rules. In the former case a
learner does not only adopt, but also enlarges the strategy change for the hope
of a higher income. Similarly, in the latter case a cautious learner does not
adopt the alternative behavior precisely, but takes only a smaller step towards
the other's strategy during the updating process. Evidently, both scenarios
assume that the players' propensity to cooperate may vary gradually between
zero (always defect) and one (always cooperate) where these extreme states
represent the traditional two-strategy social dilemma. We have observed that
while the usage of exaggerated learning has no particular consequence on the
final state, but gradual learning can support cooperation significantly. The
latter protocol mitigates the invasion speeds of both main strategies, but the
decline of successful defector invasion is more significant, hence the biased
impact of the modified microscopic rule on invasion processes explains our

reconstructing inclusions in the inverse problem of electrical impedance
tomography. Thus far the method has not been proven to be able to handle
extreme inclusions that correspond to some parts of the studied domain becoming
either perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating. The main obstacle has
arguably been establishing suitable monotonicity principles for the
corresponding Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary maps. In this work, we tackle this
shortcoming by first giving a convergence result in the operator norm for the
Neumann-to-Dirichlet map when the conductivity coefficient decays to zero
and/or grows to infinity in some given parts of the domain. This allows passing
the necessary monotonicity principles to the limiting case. Subsequently, we
show how the monotonicity method generalizes to the definite case of
reconstructing either perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating inclusions,
as well as to the indefinite case where the perturbed conductivity can take any
values between, and including, zero and infinity.

these methods barely take the classification criteria of the first stage into
consideration in the second prediction stage. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage representation method (TSR), and convert it to a Single-Teacher
Single-Student (STSS) problem in our two-stage image classification framework.
We seek the nearest neighbours of the test sample to choose candidate target
classes. Meanwhile, the first stage classifier is formulated as the teacher,
which holds the classification scores. The samples of the candidate classes are
utilized to learn a student classifier based on L2-minimization in the second
stage. The student will be supervised by the teacher classifier, which approves
the student only if it obtains a higher score. In actuality, the proposed
framework generates a stronger classifier by staging two weaker classifiers in
a novel way. The experiments conducted on several face and object databases
show that our proposed framework is effective and outperforms multiple popular
classification methods.

conclude that the total current remains zero in any system, which is obtained
by smooth modification of the one with the gapped charged fermions, periodical
boundary conditions, and vanishing total electric current. We analyse several
examples, in which the fermions are gapless. In some of them the total electric
current vanishes. At the same time we propose the counterexamples of the

conventional magnets. This makes them very promising for motors and generators.
However, ripple magnetic fields in these machines present a cross-field
component that demagnetizes the stacks. At present, there is no quantitative
agreement between measurements and modeling of cross-field demagnetization,
mainly due to the need of a 3D model that takes the end effects and real
micron-thick superconducting layer into account. This article presents 3D
modeling and measurements of cross-field demagnetization in stacks of up to 5
tapes and initial magnetization modeling of stacks of up to 15 tapes. 3D
modeling of the cross-field demagnetization explicitly shows that the critical
current density, $J_c$, in the direction perpendicular to the tape surface does
not play a role in cross-field demagnetization. When taking the measured
anisotropic magnetic field dependence of $J_c$ into account, 3D calculations
agree with measurements with less than 4 % deviation, while the error of 2D
modeling is much higher. Then, our 3D numerical methods can realistically
predict cross-field demagnetization. Due to the force-free configuration of
part of the current density, J, in the stack, better agreement with experiments
will probably require measuring the Jc anisotropy for the whole solid angle
range, including $J$ parallel to the magnetic field.

dynamics in hosts who could be or not quarantined and treated. Considering a
lice population structured by age and gender we formulate the model as a system
of hyperbolic PDEs, which can be reduced to compartmental systems of delay or
ordinary differential equations. Besides studying fundamental properties of the
model, such as existence, uniqueness and nonnegativity of solutions, we show
the existence of (in certain cases multiple) equilibria at which the

quick and efficient eradication of lice infestations; (ii) dimeticone-based
products applied every 4 days effectively remove lice in at most three
applications even in case of severe infestations and (iii) minimization of the
reinfection risk, e.g. by mean of synchronized treatments in
families/classrooms is recommended.

the two-photon detuning and the atomic momentum. We detect the number of atoms

it can be used with very small clouds.

the Andreev reflection counters the effect of the otherwise lowered conduction.
At low temperatures, the magnetoresistance shows irreversible yet strong
colossal oscillations that are known to be quantum in nature. In addition, we
have found evidence for seemingly granular SC as well as ferromagnetism.

stronger cycles rise faster than the weaker ones. This is popularly known as
the Waldmeier Effect, which is known for more than 80 years. This fundamental
feature of the solar cycle has not only practical implications, e,g., in
predicting the solar cycle, but also implications in understanding the solar
dynamo. Here we ask the question whether the Waldmeier Effect exists in other
Sun-like stars. To answer this question, we analyze the Ca \II{} H \& K S-index
from Mount Wilson Observatory for 21 Sun-like G--K stars. We specifically check
two aspects of Waldmeier Effect, namely, WE1: the anti-correlation between the
rise times and the peaks and WE2: the positive correlation between rise rates
and amplitudes. We show that except HD~16160, HD~81809, HD~155886 and
HD~161239, all stars considered in the analysis show WE2. While WE1 is found to
be present only in some of the stars studied. Further, the WE1 correlation is
weaker than the WE2. Both WE1 and WE2 exist in the solar S-index as well.
Similar to the solar cycles, the magnetic cycles of many stars are asymmetric
about their maxima. The existence of the Waldmeier Effect and asymmetric cycles
in Sun-like stars suggests that the dynamo mechanism which operates in the Sun
is also operating in other stars.

developed in the context of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory
preparatory phase. The dual-mirror SC design is aplanatic and characterized by
a small plate scale, allowing us to implement large field of view cameras with
small-size pixel sensors and a high compactness. The curved focal plane of the
ASTRI camera is covered by silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs), managed by an
unconventional front-end electronics based on a customized peak-sensing
detector mode. The system includes internal and external calibration systems,
hardware and software for control and acquisition, and the complete data
archiving and processing chain. The observations of the Crab Nebula were
carried out in December 2018, during the telescope verification phase, for a
total observation time (after data selection) of 24.4 h, equally divided into
on- and off-axis source exposure. The camera system was still under
commissioning and its functionality was not yet completely exploited.
Furthermore, due to recent eruptions of the Etna Volcano, the mirror reflection
efficiency was reduced. Nevertheless, the observations led to the detection of
the source with a statistical significance of 5.4 sigma above an energy
threshold of ~3 TeV. This result provides an important step towards the use of
dual-mirror systems in Cherenkov gamma-ray astronomy. A pathfinder mini-array
based on nine large field-of-view ASTRI-like telescopes is under

fail to easily adapt to the task of recognition of new AUs (i.e., those not
initially used to train the target models). In this paper, we propose a deep
learning approach for facial AU detection that can easily and in a fast manner
adapt to a new AU or target subject by leveraging only a few labeled samples
from the new task (either an AU or subject). To this end, we propose a modeling
approach based on the notion of the model-agnostic meta-learning, originally
proposed for the general image recognition/detection tasks (e.g., the character
recognition from the Omniglot dataset). Specifically, each subject and/or AU is
treated as a new learning task and the model learns to adapt based on the
knowledge of the previous tasks (the AUs and subjects used to pre-train the
target models). Thus, given a new subject or AU, this meta-knowledge (that is
shared among training and test tasks) is used to adapt the model to the new
task using the notion of deep learning and model-agnostic meta-learning. We
show on two benchmark datasets (BP4D and DISFA) for facial AU detection that
the proposed approach can be easily adapted to new tasks (AUs/subjects). Using

trijunction into a microwave cavity allows to study the intricate dynamics of
the low-energy Majorana bound states (MBSs) coupled to the cavity electric
field under a braiding operation. Extending a previous work (Phys. Rev. Lett.

invariant under both time reversal (TR) and spatial inversion (SI) operations,
is the last remaining category of ferroics to be observed after the
ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and ferro-toroidal orders. This order has become
increasingly popular in many new quantum materials, especially in complex
oxides, and is considered responsible for a number of novel phenomena such as
polar vortices, giant magnetoelectric coupling, and type-II multiferroics.
However, physical properties of the ferro-rotational order have been rarely
studied either theoretically or experimentally. Here, using high sensitivity
rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation (RA SHG), we have, for the
first time, exploited the electric quadrupole (EQ) contribution to the SHG to
directly couple to this centrosymmetric ferro-rotational order in an archetype
of type-II multiferroics, RbFe(MoO4)2. Surprisingly, we have found that two
types of domains with opposite ferro-rotational vectors emerge with distinct
populations at the critical temperature Tc ~195 K and gradually evolve to reach
an even ratio at lower temperatures. Moreover, we have identified the
ferro-rotational order phase transition as weak first order, and have revealed
its conjugate coupling field as a unique combination of the induced EQ SHG and
the incident fundamental electric fields. Our results on physical properties of
a ferro-rotational order provide crucial knowledge for understanding and
searching for novel phases of matter built upon the ferro-rotational order.
Further, these results open the possibility of revealing unconventional

from an Anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild geometry. The first one is obtained by
introducing a new foliation of the Schwarzschild geometry such that the
conformal boundary takes the FLRW form. The other one is to consider a brane
universe moving in the Schwarzschild background. For each case, we compute the
complexity growth rate in a closed universe and a flat universe by using both
the complexity-volume and complexity-action dualities. We find that there are
two kinds of contributions to the growth rate: one is from the interaction
among the degrees of freedom, while the other one from the change of the
spatial volume of the universe. The behaviors of the growth rate depend on the
details to realize the FLRW universe as well as the holographic conjecture for
the complexity. For the realization of the FLRW universe on the asymptotic
boundary, the leading divergent term for the complexity growth rate obeys a
volume law which is natural from the field theory viewpoint. For the brane
universe scenario, the complexity-volume and complexity-action conjectures give
different results for the closed universe case. A possible explanation of the
inconsistency when the brane crosses the black hole horizon is given based on
the Lloyd bound.

consistent procedure is developed for calculating non-classical asymptotic
power terms in the total and the direct correlation functions of a critical
fluid. Analyzing the Ornstein-Zernike equation allows us to find, for the first
time, the values of transcendental exponents 1.73494 and 2.26989 which
determine the asymptotic terms next to the leading one in the total correlation
function. It is shown that already the simplest approximation based on only two
asymptotic terms leads to the correlation functions, which are quantitatively
close to the corresponding ones of the Lennard-Jones fluid (argon) in the
near-critical state. The obtained results open a way for consistent theoretical
interpretation of the experimental data on the critical characteristics of real
substances. Both the theoretical arguments and analysis of published data on
the experimentally measured critical exponents of real fluids lead to the
conclusion that the known assumption of the sameness of the critical
characteristics of the Ising model and the fluid in the vicinity of critical

would deepen understanding of the underlying physics. Unfortunately, one often

of computing the partition function in many systems of interest. Emerging
hardware, such as quantum annealers, provide novel tools for such
investigations, but it is well known that studying general, non-native systems
on such devices requires graph minor embedding, at the expense of introducing
additional variables. The effect of embedding for sampling is more pronounced
than for optimization; for optimization one is just concerned with the ground

lessened through favorable parameter choices, certain physical constraints

from either random, dilute configurations (Protocol 1) or thermalized, dense
configurations (protocol $2$), which allows us to tune the orientational order

for superellipsoid packings are hypostatic, with $z_J < z_{\rm iso}$, where
$z_{\rm iso} = 2d_f$ and $d_f = 5$ or $6$ depending on whether the particles
are axi-symmetric or not. Over the full range of orientational order, we find
that the number of quartic modes of the dynamical matrix for the packings
always matches the number of missing contacts relative to the isostatic value.
This result suggests that there are no mechanically redundant contacts for
ordered, yet hypostatic packings of superellipsoidal particles. Additionally,
we find that the packing fraction at jamming onset for disordered packings of
superellipsoidal particles can be collapsed using two particle shape
parameters, e.g. the asphericity $\mathcal{A}$ and reduced aspect ratio $\beta$
of the particles.

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offers a practical solution to
localize the robots without relying on an external positioning system (e.g.

SLAM systems are vulnerable to perception outliers and therefore tend to use
very conservative parameters for inter-robot place recognition. However, being
too conservative comes at the cost of rejecting many valid loop closure
candidates, which results in less accurate trajectory estimates. This paper
introduces DOOR-SLAM, a fully distributed SLAM system with an outlier rejection
mechanism that can work with less conservative parameters. DOOR-SLAM is based
on peer-to-peer communication and does not require full connectivity among the
robots. DOOR-SLAM includes two key modules: a pose graph optimizer combined
with a distributed pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm
to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures; and a distributed SLAM front-end
that detects inter-robot loop closures without exchanging raw sensor data. The
system has been evaluated in simulations, benchmarking datasets, and field
experiments, including tests in GPS-denied subterranean environments. DOOR-SLAM
produces more inter-robot loop closures, successfully rejects outliers, and

different object manipulation tasks on a real robot platform. Given
demonstrations of a task together with task-agnostic recorded experience, we
use a special form of human annotation as supervision to learn a reward
function, which enables us to deal with real-world tasks where the reward
signal cannot be acquired directly. Learned rewards are used in combination
with a large dataset of experience from different tasks to learn a robot policy
offline using batch RL. We show that using our approach it is possible to train
agents to perform a variety of challenging manipulation tasks including
stacking rigid objects and handling cloth.

In an extensive experimental evaluation on the acoustically very challenging

lead to substantial error rate reductions, and (ii) enhancement in training is
advisable as long as enhancement in test is at least as strong as in training.

the gradient dynamics of the proposed method is not achievable by base methods

different adaptive activation functions are shown to induce different implicit

because it is shared by the attacker and the victim processes even if they are
located on different cores. These timing attacks evict the victim cache lines
using small conflict groups(SCG), and monitor the cache to observe when the
victim uses these cache lines again. A conflict group is a collection of cache
lines which will evict the target cache line. Randomization is often used by
defenses to prevent creation of SCGs.
  We introduce new attacks to demonstrate that the current randomization
schemes require an extremely high refresh rate to be secure, on average a 15\%
performance overhead, and upto 50\% in the worst case. Next, we propose a new
randomization strategy using an indirection table, which mitigates this issue.
Addresses of cache lines are encrypted and used to lookup the indirection table
entry. Each indirection table entry stores a mapping to a randomly chosen cache
set. The cache line is placed into this randomly chosen set. The encryption key
changes upto 50x faster than CEASER's default rate, by using evictions to
trigger the re-randomization. Instead of moving cache lines, this mechanism
re-randomizes one iTable entry at a time, whenever the cache lines
corresponding to the iTable entry are naturally evicted. Thus, the miss rate is
not much worse than the baseline.
  We quantitatively show that our scheme does almost as well as a fully
associative cache to defend against these attacks. We also demonstrate new
attacks that target the iTable by oversubscribing its entries, and
quantitatively show that our scheme is resilient against new attacks for
trillions of years. We estimate low area ( < 7\%) and power overhead compared
to a baseline inclusive last-level cache. Lastly, we evaluate a low performance
overhead (<4%) using the SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC 3.0 benchmarks.

in the literature, such an identification is typically performed in the
light-front (LF) frame while the radial component of the meson wave function is
rather postulated than computed from the first principles. The massive
photon-like $V\to Q\bar Q$ vertex, besides the $S$-wave component, also
contains an extra $D$-wave admixture in the $Q\bar Q$ rest frame. However, the
relative weight of these contributions cannot be justified by any reasonable
nonrelativistic $Q\bar Q$ potential model. In this work, we investigate the
relative role of the $D$-wave contribution starting from the photon-like
quarkonium $V\to Q\bar Q$ transition in both frames: in the $Q\bar Q$ rest
frame (with subsequent Melosh spin transform to the LF frame) and in the LF
frame (without Melosh transform). We show that the photon-like transition
imposed in the $Q\bar Q$ rest frame leads to significant discrepancies with the
experimental data. In the second case we find that the corresponding total
$J/\psi(1S)$ photoproduction cross sections are very close to those obtained
with the ""$S$-wave only"" $V\to Q\bar Q$ transition, both leading to a good
description of the data. However, we find that the ""$S$-wave only"" transition
leads to a better description of photoproduction data for excited heavy
quarkonium states, which represent a more effective tool for study of $D$-wave
effects. Consequently, the predictions for production of excited states based
on the photon-like structure of $V\to Q\bar Q$ transition should be treated
with a great care due to a much stronger sensitivity of the $D$-wave
contribution to the nodal structure of quarkonium wave functions.

factorizing Maxwell's equations and using an isometric transform. We prove that

Riemannian metric $g$, the electromagnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
$\Lambda_{g,\Gamma}$ uniquely determines all order tangential and normal

Therefore, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are completely determined in $M$ by

given a graph. It is a central problem in many machine learning tasks (e.g.,
node classification, recommendation, community detection). The key problem in
graph node embedding lies in how to define the dependence to neighbors.
Existing approaches specify (either explicitly or implicitly) certain
dependencies on neighbors, which may lead to loss of subtle but important
structural information within the graph and other dependencies among neighbors.
This intrigues us to ask the question: can we design a model to give the
maximal flexibility of dependencies to each node's neighborhood. In this paper,
we propose a novel graph node embedding (named PINE) via a novel notion of
partial permutation invariant set function, to capture any possible dependence.
Our method 1) can learn an arbitrary form of the representation function from
the neighborhood, withour losing any potential dependence structures, and 2) is
applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph embedding, the latter of
which is challenged by the diversity of node types. Furthermore, we provide
theoretical guarantee for the representation capability of our method for
general homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Empirical evaluation results on
benchmark data sets show that our proposed PINE method outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches on producing node vectors for various learning
tasks of both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.

meaningful, and powerful approximation that trades completeness by speed, and
is both time and space exponential in the problem causal width. It is then
shown empirically that the algorithm combined with simple heuristics yields
state-of-the-art real-time performance in domains with high widths but low
causal widths such as Minesweeper, Battleship, and Wumpus.

observations is pervasive and yet computationally intractable. In this work we
show however that probabilistic beliefs can be maintained in factored form
exactly and efficiently across a number of causally closed beams, when the
state variables that appear in more than one beam obey a form of backward
determinism. Since computing marginals from the factors is still
computationally intractable in general, and variables appearing in several
beams are not always backward-deterministic, the basic formulation is extended
with two approximations: forms of belief propagation for computing marginals
from factors, and sampling of non-backward-deterministic variables for making
such variables backward-deterministic given their sampled history. Unlike,
Rao-Blackwellized particle-filtering, the sampling is not used for making
inference tractable but for making the factorization sound. The resulting
algorithm involves sampling and belief propagation or just one of them as
determined by the structure of the model.

it experiences. The typical shape of a power curve is well known and has been
studied extensively; however, the power curves of individual turbine models can
vary widely from one another. This is due to both the technical features of the
turbine (power density, cut-in and cut-out speeds, limits on rotational speed
and aerodynamic efficiency), and environmental factors (turbulence intensity,
air density, wind shear and wind veer). Data on individual power curves are
often proprietary and only available through commercial databases.
  We therefore develop an open-source model which can generate the power curve
of any turbine, adapted to the specific conditions of any site. This can employ
one of six parametric models advanced in the literature, and accounts for the
eleven variables mentioned above. The model is described, the impact of each
technical and environmental feature is examined, and it is then validated
against the manufacturer power curves of 91 turbine models. Versions of the
model are made available in MATLAB, R and Python code for the community.

Chaplygin gas (MCCG). In comparison to the previous model (modified Chaplygin
AdS black hole) existed in the literature, we now have two new parameters: the
cosmic parameter and the black hole's electric charge. We examine the
asymptotically charged AdS black hole thermodynamics with MCCG under the
assumption of a negative cosmological constant as a thermodynamics pressure.
Using MCCG, we developed a new solution to Einstein's AdS black hole field
equations.The mass parameter, volume, electric potential, entropy, and
temperature of the charged AdS black hole have all been computed. We also study
the various energy conditions for the MCCG as a source fluid of AdS black hole.
For some restrictions on the involved parameters, we show that these conditions
are met. Then, we study the thermodynamical stability, critical points, and
Joule-Thompson expansion for the back hole obtained. We reveal that while the
existence of cosmic parameter yields to a complete stable mode, its absence
gives rise to some unstable regions. Then, using MCCG, we treat the obtained
black hole's thermodynamics as a heat engine and calculate the work done as
well as the heat engine's maximum efficiency in the Carnot cycle. The work
done, the efficiency, and the Rankine cycle's efficiency are also investigated.
All of the findings are graphically depicted and discussed.

non-negative tensor patch dictionary learning in the context of X-ray CT
imaging and based on a tensor-tensor product called the $t$-product (Kilmer and
Martin, 2011) was presented. Building on that work, in this paper, we use of
non-negative tensor patch-based dictionaries trained on other data, such as
facial image data, for the purposes of either compression or image deblurring.
We begin with an analysis in which we address issues such as suitability of the
tensor-based approach relative to a matrix-based approach, dictionary size and
patch size to balance computational efficiency and qualitative representations.
Next, we develop an algorithm that is capable of recovering non-negative tensor
coefficients given a non-negative tensor dictionary. The algorithm is based on
a variant of the Modified Residual Norm Steepest Descent method. We show how to
augment the algorithm to enforce sparsity in the tensor coefficients, and note
that the approach has broader applicability since it can be applied to the
matrix case as well. We illustrate the surprising result that dictionaries
trained on image data from one class can be successfully used to represent and
compress image data from different classes and across different resolutions.
Finally, we address the use of non-negative tensor dictionaries in image
deblurring. We show that tensor treatment of the deblurring problem coupled
with non-negative tensor patch dictionaries can give superior restorations as
compared to standard treatment of the non-negativity constrained deblurring
problem.

by two-dimensional convective turbulent flows display a coexistence of regular
and chaotic features. We numerically demonstrate that very elongated particles
(rods) align preferentially with the direction of the fluid flow, i.e.,
horizontally close to the isothermal walls and dominantly vertically in the
bulk. This behaviour is due to the the presence of a persistent large scale
circulation flow structure, which induces strong shear at wall boundaries and
in up/down-welling regions. The near-wall horizontal alignment of rods persists
at increasing the Rayleigh number, while the vertical orientation in the bulk
is progressively weakened by the corresponding increase of turbulence
intensity. Furthermore, we show that very elongated particles are nearly
orthogonal to the orientation of the temperature gradient, an alignment
independent of the system dimensionality and which becomes exact only in the
limit of infinite Prandtl number. Tumbling rates are extremely vigorous
adjacent to the walls, where particles roughly perform Jeffery orbits. This
implies that the root-mean-square near-wall tumbling rates for spheres are much
stronger than for rods, up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times at $Ra\simeq 10^9$. In
the turbulent bulk the situation reverses and rods tumble slightly faster than
isotropic particles, in agreement with earlier observations in two-dimensional
turbulence.

the joint study of all three types of behavior states. We call this database
Aff-Wild2. We conduct extensive experiments with CNN and CNN-RNN architectures
