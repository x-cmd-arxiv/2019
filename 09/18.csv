maximum-sized tree of bounded degree in a given graph.
  The connection to longest path motivates the study of MBT in directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs), since the longest path problem is solvable efficiently in DAGs.
In contrast, we show that MBT in DAGs is in fact hard: it has no efficient
$\exp(-O(\log n/ \log \log n))$-approximation algorithm under the exponential
time hypothesis, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. In
undirected graphs, we show that MBT has no efficient
$\exp(-O(\log^{0.63}{n}))$-approximation under the exponential time hypothesis.
Our inapproximability results rely on self-improving reductions and structural
properties of binary trees. We also show constant-factor inapproximability

proposed control architecture enforces the system state trajectories to evolve

time projection chambers (LArTPCs) will enable the study of astrophysical
neutrinos in DUNE and could enhance the physics reach of oscillation analyses.
Liquid argon scintillation light has the potential to improve energy
reconstruction for low-energy electrons over charge-based measurements alone.
Here we demonstrate light-augmented calorimetry for low-energy electrons in a
single-phase LArTPC using a sample of Michel electrons from decays of stopping
cosmic muons in the LArIAT experiment at Fermilab. Michel electron energy
spectra are reconstructed using both a traditional charge-based approach as
well as a more holistic approach that incorporates both charge and light. A
maximum-likelihood fitter, using LArIAT's well-tuned simulation, is developed
for combining these quantities to achieve optimal energy resolution. A sample
of isolated electrons is simulated to better determine the energy resolution
expected for astrophysical electron-neutrino charged-current interaction final
states. In LArIAT, which has very low wire noise and an average light yield of
18 pe/MeV, an energy resolution of $\sigma/E \simeq 9.3\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus
1.3\%$ is achieved. Samples are then generated with varying wire noise levels
and light yields to gauge the impact of light-augmented calorimetry in larger
LArTPCs. At a charge-readout signal-to-noise of S/N $\simeq$ 30, for example,
the energy resolution for electrons below 40 MeV is improved by $\approx$ 10%,
$\approx$ 20%, and $\approx$ 40% over charge-only calorimetry for average light
yields of 10 pe/MeV, 20 pe/MeV, and 100 pe/MeV, respectively.

  algorithms",,"10.1109/TAES.2021.3074205",,"eess.SP math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces two new algorithms to accurately estimate the process
noise covariance of a discrete-time Kalman filter online for robust orbit
determination in the presence of dynamics model uncertainties. Common orbit
determination process noise techniques, such as state noise compensation and
dynamic model compensation, require offline tuning and a priori knowledge of
the dynamical environment. Alternatively, the process noise covariance can be
estimated through adaptive filtering. However, many adaptive filtering
techniques are not applicable to onboard orbit determination due to
computational cost or the assumption of a linear time-invariant system.
Furthermore, existing adaptive filtering techniques do not constrain the
process noise covariance according to the underlying continuous-time dynamical
model, and there has been limited work on adaptive filtering with colored
process noise. To overcome these limitations, a novel approach is developed
which optimally fuses state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation
with covariance matching adaptive filtering. This yields two adaptive and
dynamically constrained process noise covariance estimation techniques. Unlike
many adaptive filtering approaches, the new techniques accurately extrapolate
over measurement outages and do not rely on ad hoc methods to ensure the
process noise covariance is positive semi-definite. The benefits of the
proposed algorithms are demonstrated through two case studies: an illustrative
linear system and the autonomous navigation of two spacecraft orbiting an
asteroid.

for studying populations of pulsating red giants. Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2)
provides a large data set including many long-period variables (LPVs) on which
this tool can be applied.
  Aims: We investigate the location of LPVs from the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds in the PLD using various optical and infrared luminosity indicators from
Gaia and 2MASS, respectively. We thereby distinguish between stars of different
masses and surface chemistry.
  Methods: The data set taken from the Gaia DR2 catalogue of LPVs allows for a
homogeneous study from low- to high-mass LPVs. These sources are divided into
sub-populations of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars according to their mass
and their O- or C-rich nature using the Gaia-2MASS diagram developed by our
group. This diagram uses a Wesenheit index Wrp based on Wesenheit functions in
the Gaia and 2MASS photometric bands. Four different luminosity indicators are
used to study the period-luminosity (P-L) relations.
  Results: We provide the first observational evidence of a P-L relation offset
for both fundamental and 1O pulsators between low- and intermediate-mass O-rich
stars, in agreement with published pulsation predictions. Among the luminosity
indicators explored, sequence C' is the narrowest in the P-Wrp diagram, and is
thus to be preferred over the other PLDs for the determination of distances
using LPVs. The majority of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red
supergiants form a smooth extension of sequence C of low- and intermediate-mass
AGB stars in the P-Wrp diagram, suggesting that they pulsate in the fundamental
mode. All results are similar in the two Magellanic Clouds.

acquisition and reconstruction technique for submillimeter whole human brain

  Methods: We extend the ultra-high resolution diffusion MRI acquisition
technique, gSlider, by allowing under-sampling in q-space and Radio-Frequency
(RF)-encoded data, thereby accelerating the total acquisition time of
conventional gSlider. The novel method, termed gSlider-SR, compensates for the
lack of acquired information by exploiting redundancy in the dMRI data using a
basis of Spherical Ridgelets (SR), while simultaneously enhancing the
signal-to-noise ratio. Using Monte-Carlo simulation with realistic noise levels
and several acquisitions of in-vivo human brain dMRI data (acquired on a
Siemens Prisma 3T scanner), we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using
several quantitative metrics.
  Results: For high-resolution dMRI data with realistic noise levels
(synthetically added), we show that gSlider-SR can reconstruct high-quality
dMRI data at different acceleration factors preserving both signal and angular
information. With in-vivo data, we demonstrate that gSlider-SR can accurately
reconstruct 860 ${\mu}m$ diffusion MRI data (64 diffusion directions at b =
2000 $s/ {mm}^2$), at comparable quality as that obtained with conventional
gSlider with four averages, thereby providing an eight-fold reduction in scan
time (from 1 h 20 min to 10 min).
  Conclusion: gSlider-SR enables whole-brain high angular resolution dMRI at a
submillimeter spatial resolution with a dramatically reduced acquisition time,
making it feasible to use the proposed scheme on existing clinical scanners.

patients, making cross-subject comparisons difficult. 3: functional correlation
networks can vary over time but are currently assumed as static. In this study
we address these three substantial challenges using intracranial EEG data from
55 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients additionally underwent
preoperative MR imaging, intra-operative CT, and post-operative MRI allowing
accurate localisation of electrodes and delineation of removed tissue. We show
that normalising for spatial proximity between nearby electrodes improves
prediction of post-surgery seizure outcomes. Moreover, patients with more
extensive electrode coverage were more likely to have their outcome predicted
correctly (ROC-AUC >0.9, p<<0.05), but not necessarily more likely to have a
better outcome. Finally, our predictions are robust regardless of the time
segment. Future studies should account for the spatial proximity of electrodes
in functional network construction to improve prediction of post-surgical
seizure outcomes. Greater coverage of both removed and spared tissue allows for
predictions with higher accuracy.

the predictions for cosmological observables by Taylor expanding up to a low

power spectrum of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, we
analyze the BOSS DR12 data by scanning over all the parameters of $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology with massive neutrinos. We impose several sets of priors, the widest
of which is just a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the current fractional
energy density of baryons, $\Omega_b h^2$, and a bound on the sum of neutrino
masses to be less than 0.9 eV. In this case we measure the primordial amplitude
of the power spectrum, $A_s$, the abundance of matter, $\Omega_m$, the Hubble

about $19\%$, $5.7\%$, $2.2\%$ and $7.3\%$ respectively, obtaining $\ln (

color change rule in which vertices change white vertices to blue. The
throttling number of a graph minimizes the sum of the number of vertices
initially colored blue and the number of time steps required to color the
entire graph. Positive semidefinite (PSD) zero forcing is a commonly studied
variant of standard zero forcing that alters the color change rule. This paper
introduces a method for extending a graph using a PSD zero forcing process.
Using this extension method, graphs with PSD throttling number at most $t$ are
characterized as specific minors of the Cartesian product of complete graphs
and trees. A similar characterization is obtained for the minor monotone floor
of PSD zero forcing. Finally, the set of connected graphs on $n$ vertices with
throttling number at least $n-k$ is characterized by forbidding a finite family
of induced subgraphs. These forbidden subgraphs are constructed for standard
throttling.

  Human-Robot Interaction","6+1 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICRA 2020",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In gaze based Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), it is important to determine the
human intention for further interaction. The gaze intention is often modelled
as fixation. However, when looking at an object, it is not natural and it is
difficult to maintain the gaze fixating on one point for a long time. Saccades
may happen while a human is still focusing on the object. The prediction of
human intention will be lost during saccades. In addition, while the human
intention is on object, the gazes may be located outside of the object bounding
box due to different noise sources, which would cause false negative
predictions. In this work, we propose a novel approach to detect whether a
human is focusing on an object in HRI application. We determine the gaze
intention by comparing the similarity between the hypothetic gazes on objects
and the actual gazes. We use Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure the
similarity and 1 Nearest Neighbour to classify which object a human is looking
at. Our experimental results indicate that, compare to fixation, our method can
successfully determine the human intention even during saccadic eye movements
and increase the classification accuracy with noisy gaze data. We also
demonstrate that, in the interaction with a robot, the proposed approach can
obtain a high accuracy of object selection within successful predictions.

accreting neutron stars. Matching observed bursts to computational models can
help to constrain system properties, such as the neutron star mass and radius,
crustal heating rates, and the accreted fuel composition, but systematic
parameter studies to date have been limited. We apply Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods to 1D burst models for the first time, and obtain system parameter
estimations for the `Clocked Burster', GS 1826$-$238, by fitting multiple
observed epochs simultaneously. We explore multiple parameters which are often
held constant, including the neutron star mass, crustal heating rate, and
hydrogen composition. To improve the computational efficiency, we precompute a
grid of 3840 KEPLER models - the largest set of 1D burst simulations to date -
and by interpolating over the model grid, we can rapidly sample burst
predictions. We obtain estimates for a CNO metallicity of $Z_\mathrm{CNO} =

acceptable limits of our stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, which we
construct using the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) theory.
Assuming DF44 is in isolation and using Jeans analysis, we calculate
$\sigma_{los}$ profiles of DF44 in Milgromian dynamics (MOND) and modified
gravity (MOG) theories without invoking dark matter. Comparing with the
observed kinematics, the best-fitting MOND model has $M_{dyn}/L_I =
3.6_{-1.2}^{+1.6}$ and a constant orbital anisotropy of
$\beta=-0.5_{-1.6}^{+0.4}$. In MOG, we first fix its two theoretical parameters
$\alpha$ and $\mu$ based on previous fits to the observed rotation curve data
of The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). The DF44 $\sigma_{los}$ profile is
best fit with $M_{dyn}/L_I=7.4_{-1.4}^{+1.5}$, larger than plausible SPS
values. MOG produces a $\sigma_{los}$ profile for DF44 with acceptable
$M_{dyn}/L_I$ and isotropic orbits if $\alpha$ and $\mu$ are allowed to vary.
MOND with the canonical $a_0$ can explain DF44 at the $2.40 \sigma$ confidence
level (1.66\%) if considering both its observed kinematics and typical star
formation histories in an IGIMF context. However, MOG is ruled out at $5.49
\sigma$ ($P$-value of $4.07 \times 10^{-8}$) if its free parameters are fixed
at the highest values consistent with THINGS data.

gapless topological phase of matter in three dimensions, which extends the
notion of Dirac phase to a higher-order topological version. Topologically
distinct from the traditional topological superconductors and known Dirac
superconductors, a HOTDSC features helical Majorana hinge modes between
adjacent surfaces, which are direct consequences of the symmetry-protected
higher-order band topology manifesting in the system. Specifically, we show
that rotational, spatial inversion, and time-reversal symmetries together
protect the coexistence of bulk Dirac nodes and hinge Majorana modes in a
seamless way. We define a set of topological indices that fully characterizes
the HOTDSC. We further show that a practical way to realize the HOTDSC phase is
to introduce unconventional odd-parity pairing to a three-dimensional Dirac
semimetal while preserving the necessary symmetries. As a concrete
demonstration of our idea, we construct a corresponding minimal lattice model
for HOTDSC obeying the symmetry constraints. Our model exhibits the expected
topological invariants in the bulk and the defining spectroscopic features on
an open geometry, as we explicitly verify both analytically and numerically.
Remarkably, the HOTDSC phase offers an example of a higher-order topological
quantum critical point, which enables realizations of various higher-order
topological phases under different symmetry-breaking patterns. In particular,
by breaking the inversion symmetry of a HOTDSC, we arrive at a higher-order
Weyl superconductor, which is yet another new gapless topological state that
exhibits hybrid higher-order topology.

explained by the massive cores fragmenting into stars of much lower mass,
thereby washing out any signature of mass segregation in pre-main sequence

function, we find that the resultant distribution of pre-main sequence stars is
mass segregated to an even higher degree than that of the cores, because
massive cores still produce massive stars if the number of fragments is
reasonably low (between one and five). We therefore suggest that the reason

by TESS and orbits a metallic-line A-type star with a period of $P=3.6772 \pm
0.0001$ days. The light curve from TESS indicates that TOI-503b transits its
host star in a grazing manner, which limits the precision with which we measure
the brown dwarf's radius ($R_b = 1.34^{+0.26}_{-0.15} R_J$). We obtained
high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the FIES, Ond\v{r}ejov, PARAS,
Tautenburg, and TRES spectrographs and measured the mass of TOI-503b to be $M_b
= 53.7 \pm 1.2 M_J$. The host star has a mass of $M_\star = 1.80 \pm 0.06
M_\odot$, a radius of $R_\star = 1.70 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$, an effective
temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 7650 \pm 160$K, and a relatively high metallicity
of $0.61\pm 0.07$ dex. We used stellar isochrones to derive the age of the
system to be $\sim$180 Myr, which places its age between that of RIK 72b (a
$\sim$10 Myr old brown dwarf in the Upper Scorpius stellar association) and AD
3116b (a $\sim$600 Myr old brown dwarf in the Praesepe cluster). We argue that
this brown dwarf formed in-situ, based on the young age of the system and the
long circularization timescale for this brown dwarf around its host star.
TOI-503b joins a growing number of known short-period, intermediate-mass brown
dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars, and is the second such brown dwarf known
to transit an A star, after HATS-70b. With the growth in the population in this
regime, the driest region in the brown dwarf desert ($35-55 M_J \sin{i}$) is
reforesting and its mass range shrinking.

earliest stages and to constrain theories of high-mass star formation. A total
of 12 massive (>500 $M_{\odot}$), cold (<15 K), 3.6-70 $\mu$m dark prestellar
clump candidates, embedded in IRDCs, were carefully selected in the pilot
survey to be observed with ALMA. We mosaiced each clump (~1 arcmin^2) in dust
and line emission with the 12m/7m/TP arrays at 224 GHz, resulting in ~1.2""
resolution (~4800 AU). As the first paper of the series, we concentrate on the
dust emission to reveal the clump fragmentation. We detect 294 cores, from
which 84 (29%) are categorized as protostellar based on outflow activity or
'warm core' line emission. The remaining 210 (71%) are considered prestellar
core candidates. The number of detected cores is independent of the mass
sensitivity range of the observations. On average, more massive clumps tend to
form more cores. We find a large population of low-mass (<1 M) cores and no
high-mass (>30 $M_{\odot}$) prestellar cores. The most massive prestellar core
has a mass of 11 $M_{\odot}$. From the prestellar CMF, we derive a power law
index of 1.17+-0.1, slightly shallower than Salpeter (1.35). We use the MST
technique to characterize the separation between cores and their spatial
distribution, and derive mass segregation ratios. While there is a range of
core masses and separations detected in the sample, the mean separation and
mass of cores are well explained by thermal fragmentation and are inconsistent
with turbulent Jeans fragmentation. The core spatial distribution is well
described by hierarchical subclustering rather than centrally peaked
clustering. There is no conclusive evidence of mass segregation. We test
several theoretical conditions, and conclude that overall, competitive
accretion and global hierarchical collapse scenarios are favored over the
turbulent core accretion scenario.

Background radiation (CMB), in terms of two fundamental distance scales set by

beyond the Standard Model or residual systematics. We examine recently updated
distance calibrations from Cepheids, gravitational lensing time-delay
observations, and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Calibrating the Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae with combinations of the
distance indicators, we obtain a joint and self-consistent measurement of $H_0$
and $r_d$ at low redshift, independent of cosmological models and CMB
inference. In an attempt to alleviate the tension between late-time and
CMB-based measurements, we consider four extensions of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. The sound horizon from our different measurements is
$r_d=(137\pm3^{stat.}\pm2^{syst.})$~Mpc. Depending on the adopted distance
indicators, the $combined$ tension in $H_0$ and $r_d$ ranges between 2.3 and
5.1 $\sigma$. We find that modifications of $\Lambda$CDM that change the
physics after recombination fail to solve the problem, for the reason that they
only resolve the tension in $H_0$, while the tension in $r_d$ remains
unchanged. Pre-recombination extensions (with early dark energy or the
effective number of neutrinos $\rm{N}_{\rm{eff}}=3.24 \pm 0.16$) are allowed by
the data, unless the calibration from Cepheids is included. Results from
time-delay lenses are consistent with those from distance-ladder calibrations
and point to a discrepancy between absolute distance scales measured from the
CMB (assuming the standard cosmological model) and late-time observations. New
proposals to resolve this tension should be examined with respect to
reconciling not only the Hubble constant but also the sound horizon derived
from the CMB and other cosmological probes.

VIMOS/VLT spectroscopy from CLASH-VLT, which covers a central region
corresponding to almost 2 virial radii. The fluxes of [OII], Hbeta, [OIII],
Halpha and [NII] emission lines were measured allowing the derivation of (O/H)
gas metallicities, star formation rates based on extinction-corrected Halpha
fluxes and active galactic nuclei (AGN) contamination. We compare our sample of
cluster galaxies to a population of field galaxies at similar redshifts. We use
the location of galaxies in projected phase-space to distinguish between
cluster and field galaxies. Both populations follow the star-forming-sequence
in the diagnostic diagrams, which allow disentangling between the ionising
sources in a galaxy, with only few galaxies classified as Seyfert II. Both
field and cluster galaxies follow the ""Main-Sequence"" of star forming galaxies,
with no substantial difference observed between the two populations. In the
Mass - Metallicity (MZ) plane, both high mass field and cluster galaxies show
comparable (O/H)s to the local SDSS MZ relation, with an offset of low mass
galaxies towards higher metallicities. While both the metallicities of
""accreted"" (R < R500) and ""infalling"" (R > R500) cluster members are comparable
at all masses, the cluster galaxies from the intermediate, mass complete bin
show more enhanced metallicities than their field counterparts. The
intermediate mass field galaxies are in accordance with the expected (O/H)s
from the Fundamental Metallicity relation, while the cluster members deviate
strongly from the model predictions. The results of this work are in accordance
with studies of other clusters at z < 0.5 and favour the scenario in which the
hot halo gas of log(M/Msun)<10.2 cluster galaxies is removed due to mild ram
pressure stripping, leading to an increase in their gas-phase metallicity.

we recognize that the symmetry of the Moir\'{e} systems leads to a crucial

lead to a special non-Fermi liquid behavior near the order-disorder nematic

orbital orders. We also discuss the interplay of the three order parameters and
the possible rich phase diagram at finite temperature. Within the three orbital
orders, the valley polarization and the ""compass order"" likely strongly compete
with the superconductor.

temperature after inflation $T_\text{RH}$. However, the temperature of the
thermal bath can be significantly higher in certain scenarios, reaching a value
denoted T max , a fact which is only apparent away from the instantaneous decay

sufficiently high mass dimension then the dark matter abundance can be enhanced
by a 'boost factor' depending on ($T_\text{max}/T_\text{RH}$) relative to naive

non-standard cosmological histories the critical mass dimension of the operator
above at which the instantaneous decay approximation breaks down, and the

bimetric gravity models). We comment on the transition from kination domination

with top-hat star-formation histories to model an early and abrupt quenching,
and using a probabilistic approach to select only robust candidates. Using
libraries without (with) spectral lines emission, starting from a total of more
than 20,000 $z>3$ sources we end up with 102 (40) candidates, including one at
$z=6.7$. This implies a minimal number density of $1.73 \pm 0.17 \times
10^{-5}$ ($6.69 \pm 1.08 \times 10^{-6}$) Mpc$^{-3}$ for $3<z<5$; applying a
correction factor to account for incompleteness yields $2.30 \pm 0.20 \times
10^{-5}$. We compare these values with those from five recent hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations, finding a reasonable agreement at $z<4$; tensions
arise at earlier epochs. Finally, we use the star-formation histories from the
best-fit models to estimate the contribution of the high-redshift passive
galaxies to the global Star Formation Rate Density during their phase of
activity, finding that they account for $\sim5-10\%$ of the total star
formation at $3<z<8$, despite being only $\sim0.5\%$ of the total in number.
The resulting picture is that early and strong star formation activity,
building massive galaxies on short timescales and followed by a quick and

evolution of the cosmos must be heavily influenced by the short but powerful
activity of these pristine monsters.

exhibit narrow helium lines with little hydrogen. They trace the presence of
circumstellar material (CSM) formed via pre-SN eruptions of their
stripped-envelope progenitors. Early work has generally assumed that SNe Ibn
come from massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars via single star evolution. In this
paper, we report ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations of two nearby Type
Ibn SNe 2006jc and 2015G conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at
late times. A point source is detected at the position of SN 2006jc, and we
confirm the conclusion of Maund et al. that it is the progenitor's binary
companion. Its position on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram corresponds to
a star that has evolved off the main sequence (MS); further analysis implies a
low initial mass for the companion star ($M_2$ $\le$ 11.9$^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$
$M_\odot$) and a secondary-to-primary initial mass ratio very close to unity
($q$ = $M_2/M_1$ $\sim$ 1); the SN progenitor's hydrogen envelope had been
stripped through binary interaction. We do not detect the binary companion of
SN 2015G. For both SNe, the surrounding stellar populations have relatively old
ages and argue against any massive WR stars as their progenitors. These results
suggest that SNe Ibn may have lower-mass origins in interacting binaries. As a
result, they also provide evidence that the giant eruptions commonly seen in
massive luminous blue variables (LBVs) can also occur in much lower-mass,
stripped-envelope stars just before core collapse.

to operate in both TDD and FDD. Operating a large antenna array base station
requires the system to overcome several implementation challenges caused by
hardware impairments making practical solutions non-ideal and expensive to
deploy at scale. It is important to learn from existing challenges and
solutions in order to prepare for larger scale deployment for example with cell
free massive MIMO. Hence in this paper, we specifically study the phase and
amplitude instability due to RF impairments using measurements carried out in
the lab and in the field in a commercial LTE network. We investigate the effect
of phase and magnitude errors on the performance of FD-MIMO systems. We discuss
and characterize various sources creating these errors including time varying
phase drift from low cost local oscillator (LO) and internal temperature
variations affecting frequency response of RF chains. The minimum requirements
and tradeoffs of different LO architectures and calibration mechanisms for
practical cellular deployment are discussed. We then provide details of a novel
coherent LO distribution mechanism and related novel array calibration
mechanism that can be applied to both TDD and FDD systems. Measurement results
are provided to validate the performance of these methods used in a 2D

the velocity data again make it extremely likely that the PN belongs to the

From HST's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations and Cloudy

linear time invariant (LTI) followers that are interacting over a directed
acyclic graph. Only a subset of the followers has access to the state of the
leader in specific sampling times. The dynamics of the leader that generates
its sampled states is unknown to the followers. For interaction topologies in
which the leader is a global sink in the graph, we propose a distributed
algorithm that allows the followers to arrive at the sampled state of the
leader by the time the next sample arrives. Our algorithm is a practical
solution for a leader-following problem when there is no information available
about the state of the leader except its instantaneous value at the sampling
times. Our algorithm also allows the followers to track the sampled state of
the leader with a locally chosen offset that can be time-varying. When the
followers are mobile agents whose state or part of their state is their
position vector, the offset mechanism can be used to enable the followers to
form a transnational invariant formation about the sampled state of the leader.
We prove that the control input of the followers to take them from one sampled
state to the next one is minimum energy. We also show in case of the
homogeneous followers, after the first sampling epoch the states and inputs of
all the followers are synchronized with each other. Numerical examples

that the occurrence of the Hall effect depends on the superlattice geometry and
on the parity of the chiral pairing. In particular, due to the mixed

the one-loop level of the current-current correlator in our effective model.

$A_1^{(10)}[\text{no lepton loops}]=6.793(90)$ that is slightly different than
the value $7.668(159)$ presented by T. Aoyama, T. Kinoshita, and M. Nio in

on (a) a subtraction procedure for removing all ultraviolet and infrared
divergences in Feynman parametric space before integration; (b) a nonadaptive
Monte Carlo integration that uses the probability density functions that are
constructed for each Feynman graph individually using its combinatorial
structure. The method is described briefly in the paper (with the corresponding

pipelines are tested on mock halo catalogues extracted from large N-body

monopole and quadrupole multipole moments of the redshift-space two-point
correlation function, as well as the radial and transverse clustering wedges,
in the comoving scale range $10<r[$\Mpch$]<55$. Moreover, we investigate the
impact of redshift measurement errors on the growth rate and linear bias
measurements due to the assumptions in the redshift-space distortion model.
Considering both the dispersion model and two widely-used models based on
perturbation theory, we find that the linear growth rate is underestimated by
about $5-10\%$ at $z<1$, while limiting the analysis at larger scales, $r>30$
\Mpch, the discrepancy is reduced below $5\%$. At higher redshifts, we find
instead an overall good agreement between measurements and model predictions.
Though this accuracy is good enough for clustering analyses in current redshift
surveys, the models have to be further improved not to introduce significant
systematics in RSD constraints from next generation galaxy surveys. The effect
of redshift errors is degenerate with the one of small-scale random motions,
and can be marginalised over in the statistical analysis, not introducing any
statistically significant bias in the linear growth constraints, especially at

Disruptions to them can
be costly. Centrally managed supply chains invest in ensuring their resilience.
Decentralized supply chains, however, must rely upon the self-interest of their
individual components to maintain the resilience of the entire chain.
  We examine the incentives that independent self-interested agents have in
forming a resilient supply chain network in the face of production disruptions
and competition. In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield
uncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time
uncertainty or, ""soft"" supply caps). Competing retailers must decide which
suppliers to link to based on both price and reliability. In the presence of
yield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse.
Retailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea
that they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base.
This happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that
competition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as
well, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander
graphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby,
providing the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain
networks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs. Finally, we
show that a supplier's investments in improved yield can make it worse off.
This happens because high production output saturates the market, which, in
turn lowers prices and profits for participants.

  Functional Data, with Application to EEG Experiments",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many studies collect functional data from multiple subjects that have both
multilevel and multivariate structures. An example of such data comes from
popular neuroscience experiments where participants' brain activity is recorded
using modalities such as EEG and summarized as power within multiple
time-varying frequency bands within multiple electrodes, or brain regions.
Summarizing the joint variation across multiple frequency bands for both
whole-brain variability between subjects, as well as location-variation within
subjects, can help to explain neural reactions to stimuli. This article
introduces a novel approach to conducting interpretable principal components
analysis on multilevel multivariate functional data that decomposes total
variation into subject-level and replicate-within-subject-level (i.e.
electrode-level) variation, and provides interpretable components that can be
both sparse among variates (e.g. frequency bands) and have localized support
over time within each frequency band. The sparsity and localization of
components is achieved by solving an innovative rank-one based convex
optimization problem with block Frobenius and matrix $L_1$-norm based
penalties. The method is used to analyze data from a study to better understand
reactions to emotional information in individuals with histories of trauma and
the symptom of dissociation, revealing new neurophysiological insights into how
subject- and electrode-level brain activity are associated with these
phenomena.

After the thermal emission of dust is modeled and subtracted, the remaining 2
mm emission is dominated by free-free emission, with the exception of the
brightest nonthermal filament (NTF) that runs though the middle of the bundle
of filaments known as the Radio Arc. This is the shortest wavelength at which
any NTF has been detected. The GISMO observations clearly trace this NTF over a
length of ~0.2$^\circ$, with a mean 2 mm spectral index which is steeper than
at longer wavelengths. The 2 mm to 6 cm (or 20 cm) spectral index steepens from
$\alpha \approx -0.2$ to $-0.7$ as a function distance from the Sickle H II
region, suggesting that this region is directly related to the NTF. A number of
unresolved (at $21''$) 2 mm sources are found nearby. One appears to be thermal
dust emission from a molecular cloud that is associated with an enigmatic radio
point source whose connection to the Radio Arc is still debated. The morphology

the extreme astrophysical environments of neutron stars. As a prequel to that
work, and with the aim of understanding better the role of the geometry of the
conducting surface on the structure of Landau levels, in this article we study
the quantum dynamics of a quantum particle on a squashed sphere. More
specifically, we study the dynamics of a single particle on an oblate squashed
Haldane sphere i.e. a 2-sphere enclosing a single magnetic monopole at its
center. While several features of the conventional Haldane sphere persist, by
numerically solving the Schrodinger equation in this background, we find that
the particle becomes increasingly localised in a band between the equator and
the poles, with a corresponding increase of the eccentricity of the spheroid.

these higher-order interactions can stabilize strongly synchronized states even

components during autonomous driving, especially in a crowded urban

quantify and associate the risk of taking a certain action. Risk assessment and
planning is usually done by first tracking and predicting trajectories of other
agents, such as vehicles and pedestrians, and then choosing an action to avoid
collision in the future. However, few existing risk assessment algorithms
handle occlusion and other sensory limitations effectively. This paper explores
the possibility of efficient risk assessment under occlusion via both forward
and backward reachability. The proposed algorithm can not only identify where
the risk-induced factors are, but also be used for motion planning by executing
low-level commands, such as throttle. The proposed method is evaluated on
various four-way highly occluded intersections with up to five other vehicles
in the scene. Compared with other risk assessment algorithms, the proposed
method shows better efficiency, meaning that the ego vehicle reaches the goal
at a higher speed. In addition, it also lowers the median collision rate by

alternate LLL criteria and also removes a number of nuisance parameters and

the distributed nature of mTBI and recovery, we employ connectomes to probe the
brain's structural organisation. We present a diffusion MRI study on adolescent

controls. Longitudinal global network changes over time suggests an altered and
more 'diffuse' network topology post-injury (specifically lower transitivity
and global efficiency). Stratifying the connectome by its back-bone, known as
the 'rich-club', these network changes were driven by the 'peripheral' local
subnetwork by way of increased network density, fractional anisotropy and
decreased diffusivities. This increased structural integrity of the local
subnetwork may be to compensate for an injured network, or it may be robust to
mTBI and is exhibiting a normal developmental trend. The rich-club also
revealed lower diffusivities over time with controls, potentially indicative of
longer-term structural ramifications. Our results show evolving, diffuse

source rates of ion, electron and neutral fluid momentum and energy due to
ionization and recombination are derived using a simple method that enables
determination of the volumetric rate of thermal energy transfer from electrons
to photons and neutral particles in the radiative recombination reaction. This
quantity can not be evaluated with the standard formal procedure of taking
moments of the relevant collision operator, and has been neglected in other
studies. The plasma/neutral fluid interaction model was applied to study CT
formation in the SMRT and SPECTOR magnetized Marshall guns, enabling
clarification of the mechanisms behind the significant increases in CT electron
density that are routinely observed well after formation on the SPECTOR
experiment. Neutral gas, which remains concentrated below the gas valves after
CT formation, diffuses up the gun barrel to the CT containment region where it
is ionized, leading to the observed electron density increases. This
understanding helps account for the exceptionally significant increase in
temperature, and markedly reduced density, observed during the electrode edge
biasing experiment conducted on SPECTOR. It is thought that edge fueling
impediment, a consequence of a biasing-induced transport barrier, is largely
responsible for the observed temperature increase and density decrease.

liquid crystalline film in general modify the thermal pseudo-Casimir
interaction. Anchoring disorder of the quenched type is in general decoupled
from the thermal pseudo-Casimir force and gives rise to an additional
disorder-generated interaction, in distinction to the annealed disorder, whose
effect on the pseudo-Casimir force is non-additive. We consider the effects of
the surface anchoring disorder by assuming that one of the substrates of the
film is contaminated by a disorder source, resulting in a Gaussian-weighted
distribution of the preferred molecular anchoring orientation (easy axes) on
that substrate, having a finite mean and variance or, more generally, a
homogeneous in-plane, two-point correlation function. We show that the presence
of disorder, either of the quenched or annealed type, leads to a significant
reduction in the magnitude of the net thermal fluctuation force between the
confining substrates of the film. In the quenched case this is a direct
consequence of an additive free energy dependent on the variance of the
disorder, while in the annealed case, the suppression of the interaction force
can be understood based on a disorder-renormalized, effective anchoring
strength.

of charge carriers, and so its evolution with doping gives crucial information
about the nature of the charge transport. Here we report a study of the high

holes doped into the parent insulating state, over a wide range of doping. The
evolution of $n_{\rm H}$ correlates with the emergence of the anomalous

only 2.1 % from that of TS-ASR given oracle speaker embeddings. Furthermore,
our method can solve speaker diarization simultaneously as a by-product and
achieved better DER than that of the conventional clustering-based speaker

  Optimization Applications",,,,"LA-UR-19-28981","math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advent of efficient interior point optimization methods has enabled the
tractable solution of large-scale linear and nonlinear programming (NLP)
problems. A prominent example of such a method is seen in Ipopt, a widely-used,
open-source nonlinear optimization solver. Algorithmically, Ipopt depends on
the use of a sparse symmetric indefinite linear system solver, which is heavily
employed within the optimization of barrier subproblems. As such, the
performance and reliability of Ipopt is dependent on the properties of the
selected linear solver. Inspired by a trend in mathematical programming toward
solving larger and more challenging NLPs, this work explores two core
questions: first, how does the scalability of available linear solvers, many of
which exhibit shared-memory parallelism, impact Ipopt performance; and second,
does the best linear solver vary across NLP problem classes, including
nonlinear network problems and problems constrained by partial differential
equations? To better understand these properties, this paper first describes
available open- and closed-source, serial and parallel linear solvers and the
fundamental differences among them. Second, it introduces the coupling of a new
open-source linear solver capable of heterogeneous parallelism over multi-core
central processing units and graphics processing units. Third, it compares
linear solvers using a variety of mathematical programming problems, including
standard test problems for linear and nonlinear optimization, optimal power
flow benchmarks, and scalable two- and three-dimensional partial differential
equation and optimal control problems. Finally, linear solver recommendations
are provided to maximize Ipopt performance across different application
domains.

environment is a challenging robotic manipulation task encountered in many
robotic applications. In such conditions, the target object touches or is
covered by adjacent obstacle objects, thus rendering traditional grasping
techniques ineffective. In this paper, we propose a pushing policy aiming at
singulating the target object from its surrounding clutter, by means of lateral
pushing movements of both the neighboring objects and the target object until
sufficient 'grasping room' has been achieved. To achieve the above goal we
employ reinforcement learning and particularly Deep Q-learning (DQN) to learn
optimal push policies by trial and error. A novel Split DQN is proposed to
improve the learning rate and increase the modularity of the algorithm.
Experiments show that although learning is performed in a simulated environment
the transfer of learned policies to a real environment is effective thanks to
robust feature selection. Finally, we demonstrate that the modularity of the
algorithm allows the addition of extra primitives without retraining the model
from scratch.

system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay
attacks that record measurement signals and then play them back to the system,
can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a
private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals,
have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been
restricted to linear time invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are
sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles,
require more complex models. This paper develops a linear time-varying (LTV)
extension to previous Dynamic Watermarking methods by designing a matrix
normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system.
Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems.
The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay

evaluate building performance. To this end, we leverage the recent advances in
deep learning and develop a physics-guided convolutional neural network
(PhyCNN) framework for data-driven seismic response modeling and serviceability
assessment of buildings. The proposed PhyCNN approach is capable of accurately
predicting building's seismic response in a data-driven fashion without the
need of a physics-based analytical/numerical model. The basic concept is to
train a deep PhyCNN model based on available seismic input-output datasets
(e.g., from simulation or sensing) and physics constraints. The trained PhyCNN
can then used as a surrogate model for structural seismic response prediction.
Available physics (e.g., the law of dynamics) can provide constraints to the
network outputs, alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need of big training
datasets, and thus improve the robustness of the trained model for more
reliable prediction. The trained surrogate model is then utilized for fragility
analysis given certain limit state criteria (e.g., the serviceability state).
In addition, an unsupervised learning algorithm based on K-means clustering is
also proposed to partition the limited number of datasets to training,
validation and prediction categories, so as to maximize the use of limited
datasets. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through
three case studies including both numerical and experimental examples.
Convincing results illustrate that the proposed PhyCNN paradigm outperforms

gait planning and control of bipedal robots. This paper aims to extend the HZD
methods to address walking, ambling and trotting behaviors on a quadrupedal
robot. We present a framework that systematically generates a wide range of
optimal trajectories and then provably stabilizes them for the full-order,
nonlinear and hybrid dynamical models of quadrupedal locomotion. The gait
planning is addressed through a scalable nonlinear programming using direct
collocation and HZD. The controller synthesis for the exponential stability is
then achieved through the Poincar\'e sections analysis. In particular, we
employ an iterative optimization algorithm involving linear and bilinear matrix
inequalities (LMIs and BMIs) to design HZD-based controllers that guarantee the
exponential stability of the fixed points for the Poincar\'e return map. The
power of the framework is demonstrated through gait generation and HZD-based
controller synthesis for an advanced quadruped robot, ---Vision 60, with 36
state variables and 12 control inputs. The numerical simulations as well as
real world experiments confirm the validity of the proposed framework.

strength. Here we report a prediction of the superrandiant instability driven
by Anderson localization, realized with a hybrid system of Dicke and
Aubry-Andre (DAA) model for bosons trapped in a one-dimensional (1D)
quasiperiodic optical lattice and coupled to a cavity. Our central finding is
that for bosons condensed in localized phase given by the DAA model, the
resonant superradiant scattering is induced, for which the critical optical
pumping of superradiant phase transition approaches zero, giving an instability
driven by Anderson localization. The superradiant phase for the DAA model with
or without a mobility edge is investigated, showing that the localization
driven superradiant instability is in sharp contrast to the superradiance as
widely observed for Bose condensate in extended states, and should be
insensitive to temperature of the system. This study unveils an insightful
effect of localization on the Dicke superradiance, and is well accessible based
on the current experiments.

Popular among these are techniques that apply the Shapley value method from

offer little justification for the game formulations used, and do not address
the uncertainty implicit in their methods' outputs. For instance, the popular

differences in the attributions for a prediction. We then present a general
game formulation that unifies existing methods, and enables straightforward
confidence intervals on their attributions. Furthermore, it allows us to
interpret the attributions as contrastive explanations of an input relative to
a distribution of reference inputs. We tie this idea to classic research in
cognitive psychology on contrastive explanations, and propose a conceptual
framework for generating and interpreting explanations for ML models, called

as a local property of a medium. In the context of nonlinear optics, both Kerr
and Raman processes are considered local, meaning that optical fields at one
location do not produce a nonlinear response at distinct locations in space.
This is because the electronic and phononic disturbances produced within the
material are confined to a region that is smaller than an optical wavelength.
By comparison, Brillouin interactions can result in a highly nonlocal nonlinear
response, as the elastic waves generated through the Brillouin process can
occupy a region in space much larger than an optical wavelength. The
nonlocality of these interactions can be exploited to engineer new types of
processes, where highly delocalized phonon modes serve as an engineerable
channel that mediates scattering processes between light waves propagating in
distinct optical waveguides. These types of nonlocal optomechanical responses
have been recently demonstrated as the basis for information transduction,
however the nontrivial dynamics of such systems has yet to be explored. In this
work, we show that the third-order nonlinear process resulting from spatially
extended Brillouin-active phonon modes involves mixing products from spatially
separated, optically decoupled waveguides, yielding a nonlocal
'joint-susceptibility'. We further explore the coupling of multiple acoustic
modes and show that multi-mode acoustic interference enables a tailorable
nonlocal-nonlinear susceptibility, exhibiting a multi-pole frequency response.

dynamic, with their links switching on and off over time. The evolution of
these networks is often non-Markovian, and the dynamics of their links
correlated. Hence, to accurately model these networks, predict their evolution,
and understand how information and other quantities propagate over them, the
inclusion of both memory and dynamical dependencies between links is key. We
here introduce a general class of models of temporal networks based on discrete
autoregressive processes. As a case study we concentrate on a specific model
within this class, generating temporal networks with a specified underlying
backbone, and with precise control over the dynamical dependencies between
links and the strength and length of their memories. In this network model the
presence of each link is influenced by its own past activity and the past
activities of other links, as specified by a coupling matrix, which directly
controls the causal relations and correlations among links. We propose a method
for estimating the models parameters and how to deal with heterogeneity and
time-varying patterns, showing how the model allows for a more realistic
description of real world temporal networks and also to predict their
evolution. We then investigate the role that memory and correlations in link
dynamics have on processes occurring over a temporal network by studying the
speed of a spreading process, as measured by the time it takes for diffusion to
reach equilibrium. Through both numerical simulations and analytical results,
we are able to separate the roles of autocorrelations and neighbourhood
correlations in link dynamics, showing that the speed of diffusion is
non-monotonically dependent on the memory length, and that correlations among
neighbouring links can speed up the spreading process, while autocorrelations
slow it down.

interaction models with network fixed effects, or in spatial panel models with
individual or time fixed effects. However, spatial autoregressions present
specific challenges for this type of adjustment, because recentering the
profile score may cause the adjusted estimate to be outside the usual parameter
space for $\lambda$. Conditions for this to happen are given, and implications
are discussed. For inference, we propose confidence intervals based on a
Lugannani--Rice approximation to the distribution of the adjusted QMLE of
$\lambda$. Based on our simulations, the coverage properties of these intervals
are excellent even in models with a large number of covariates.

adversarial training method, such as those used in generative adversarial

applied to nonlinear Burgers' equation, where the models' architecture is

such a large ZBCP in junction structures of normal metal (titanium/gold Ti/Au)

shows up as a zero-bias peak because of the circuitry and thermal fluctuations
of the supercurrent phase, a mechanism conceived by Ivanchenko and Zil'berman

extreme caution when assigning the origin of a large ZBCP to MZMs in a

interactions between kinetics and thermodynamics. High entropy alloys (HEAs),
for example, draw a fundamentally new concept to enable exploring unknown
regions in phase diagrams. The exploration, however, is hindered by traditional
metallurgies based on liquid-solid transformation. Vapor-solid transformation
that is permissible on pressure-temperature phase diagrams, offers the most
kinetically efficient pathway to form any desired alloy (e.g., HEA). Here, we
report that a technique called ""sparking mashups"", which involves a rapidly
quenched vapor source and induces unrestricted mixing for alloying 55 distinct
types of ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable compositions. Unlike
the precursor feed in wet chemistry, a microseconds-long oscillatory spark
controls the vapour composition, which is eventually retained in the alloy NPs.
The resulting NPs range from binary to HEAs with marked thermal stability at
room temperature. We show that a nanosize-effect ensures such thermal stability
and mimics the role of mixing entropy in HEAs. This discovery contradicts the
traditional ""smaller is less stable"" view while enabling the elemental
combinations that have never been alloyed to date. We even break the
miscibility limits by mixing bulk-immiscible systems in alloy NPs. As powerful
examples, we demonstrate the alloy NPs as both high-performance fuel-cell

construct HEA nanostructure arrays of various architectures and compositions.
Our results form the basis of new rules for guiding HEA-NP synthesis and

important problem for realization of safe and effective navigation of
autonomous systems in dynamic environments. This paper focuses on two important
aspects of future trajectory forecast which are particularly relevant for
mobile platforms: 1) modeling uncertainty of the predictions, particularly from
egocentric views, where uncertainty in the interactive reactions and behaviors
of other agents must consider the uncertainty in the ego-motion, and 2)
modeling multi-modality nature of the problem, which are particularly prevalent
at junctions in urban traffic scenes. To address these problems in a unified
approach, we propose NEMO (Noisy Ego MOtion priors for future object
localization) for future forecast of agents in the egocentric view. In the
proposed approach, a predictive distribution of future forecast is jointly
modeled with the uncertainty of predictions. For this, we divide the problem
into two tasks: future ego-motion prediction and future object localization. We
first model the multi-modal distribution of future ego-motion with uncertainty
estimates. The resulting distribution of ego-behavior is used to sample
multiple modes of future ego-motion. Then, each modality is used as a prior to
understand the interactions between the ego-vehicle and target agent. We
predict the multi-modal future locations of the target from individual modes of
the ego-vehicle while modeling the uncertainty of the target's behavior. To
this end, we extensively evaluate the proposed framework using the publicly
available benchmark dataset (HEV-I) supplemented with odometry data from an

nonsingular linear system $Vc=b$ where the rows of a square matrix $V$ are
constructed by progression of the power polynomials. It has many applications
in scientific computing including interpolation, super-resolution, and
construction of special matrices applied in cryptography. Despite its numerous
applications, the matrix is highly ill-conditioned where specialized treatments
are considered for approximation such as conversion to Cauchy matrix, spectral
decomposition, and algorithmic tailoring of the numerical solutions. In this
paper, we propose a generalized algorithm that takes arbitrary pairwise
(non-repetitive) sample nodes for solving inverse Vandermonde matrix. This is
done in two steps: first, a highly balanced recursive algorithm is introduced
with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity to solve the combinatorics summation of the
elementary symmetric polynomials; and second, a closed-form solution is
tailored for inverse Vandermonde where the matrix' elements utilize this
recursive summation for the inverse calculations. The numerical stability and
accuracy of the proposed inverse method is analyzed through the spectral
decomposition of the Frobenius companion matrix that associates with the
corresponding Vandermonde matrix. The results show significant improvement over

described by its neural tangent kernel (NTK) as introduced in [20], where it
was proven that in the infinite width limit the NTK converges to an explicit
limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. The NTK was also
implicit in some other recent papers [6,13,14]. In the overparametrization
regime, a fully-trained deep neural network is indeed equivalent to the kernel
regression predictor using the limiting NTK. And the gradient descent achieves
zero training loss for a deep overparameterized neural network. However, it was
observed in [5] that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression
using the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. This performance gap is
likely to originate from the change of the NTK along training due to the finite
width effect. The change of the NTK along the training is central to describe
the generalization features of deep neural networks.
  In the current paper, we study the dynamic of the NTK for finite width deep
fully-connected neural networks. We derive an infinite hierarchy of ordinary
differential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) which captures the
gradient descent dynamic of the deep neural network. Moreover, under certain
conditions on the neural network width and the data set dimension, we prove
that the truncated hierarchy of NTH approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to
arbitrary precision. This description makes it possible to directly study the
change of the NTK for deep neural networks, and sheds light on the observation
that deep neural networks outperform kernel regressions using the corresponding
limiting NTK.

find that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ admits two one-parameter families of
left-invariant CR structures, called the elliptic and hyperbolic families,
characterized by the incidence of the contact distribution with the null cone
of the Killing metric. Low dimensional complex representations of
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ provide CR embedding or immersions of these

described by a natural language referring expression in an image. This task is
compositional and inherently requires visual reasoning on top of the

process is guided by the linguistic structure of the referring expression.
However, existing approaches treat the objects in isolation or only explore the
first-order relationships between objects without being aligned with the
potential complexity of the expression. Thus it is hard for them to adapt to
the grounding of complex referring expressions. In this paper, we explore the
problem of referring expression comprehension from the perspective of
language-driven visual reasoning, and propose a dynamic graph attention network
to perform multi-step reasoning by modeling both the relationships among the

particular, we construct a graph for the image with the nodes and edges
corresponding to the objects and their relationships respectively, propose a
differential analyzer to predict a language-guided visual reasoning process,

irreversible deformations - a form of 4D printing - which also enlarges the
range of linear response of the actuators. Finally, we show how to leverage
such thermoplastic relaxations to accumulate plastic deformations and obtain
very large deformations by alternatively driving both layers of a bilayer; we

pruning algorithm called Gate Decorator, which transforms a vanilla CNN module
by multiplying its output by the channel-wise scaling factors, i.e. gate. When
the scaling factor is set to zero, it is equivalent to removing the
corresponding filter. We use Taylor expansion to estimate the change in the
loss function caused by setting the scaling factor to zero and use the
estimation for the global filter importance ranking. Then we prune the network
by removing those unimportant filters. After pruning, we merge all the scaling
factors into its original module, so no special operations or structures are
introduced. Moreover, we propose an iterative pruning framework called
Tick-Tock to improve pruning accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches. For example, we achieve the
state-of-the-art pruning ratio on ResNet-56 by reducing 70% FLOPs without
noticeable loss in accuracy. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our pruned model with

due to the lack of the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the AFM order. X-ray

decades. This increase is heavily burdening the electricity distributors.
Therefore, predicting the future demand for electricity consumption will
provide an upper hand to the electricity distributor. Predicting electricity
consumption requires many parameters. The paper presents two approaches with
one using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and another one using a Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) network, which only considers the previous electricity
consumption to predict the future electricity consumption. These models were
tested on the publicly available London smart meter dataset. To assess the
applicability of the RNN and the LSTM network to predict electricity
consumption, they were tested to predict for an individual house and a block of
houses for a given time period. The predictions were done for daily, trimester
and 13 months, which covers short term, mid-term and long term prediction. Both
the RNN and the LSTM network have achieved an average Root Mean Square error of
0.1.

learning can be embedded into deep networks to learn more transferable features
to reduce the distribution discrepancy between two domains. Existing
adversarial domain adaptation methods either learn a single domain
discriminator to align the global source and target distributions or pay
attention to align subdomains based on multiple discriminators. However, in
real applications, the marginal (global) and conditional (local) distributions
between domains are often contributing differently to the adaptation. There is
currently no method to dynamically and quantitatively evaluate the relative
importance of these two distributions for adversarial learning. In this paper,
we propose a novel Dynamic Adversarial Adaptation Network (DAAN) to dynamically
learn domain-invariant representations while quantitatively evaluate the
relative importance of global and local domain distributions. To the best of
our knowledge, DAAN is the first attempt to perform dynamic adversarial
distribution adaptation for deep adversarial learning. DAAN is extremely easy
to implement and train in real applications. We theoretically analyze the
effectiveness of DAAN, and it can also be explained in an attention strategy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAAN achieves better classification
accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep and adversarial methods. Results
also imply the necessity and effectiveness of the dynamic distribution
adaptation in adversarial transfer learning.

an increasing number of disks around young stellar objects. The majority of the
observations show polarization patterns that are consistent with
self-scattering, especially at ALMA Band 7. The inferred sizes of the grains
are typically of order 100 microns, which is very different from the millimeter
size commonly inferred from the dust opacity index beta. In an effort to
resolve this discrepancy, we first introduced the so-called ""Coplanar Isotropic
Radiation Field"" approximation, which enables the computation of the (signed)
polarization fraction analytically. With an oft-adopted dust composition (used,
e.g., by DSHARP), we find that models with big dust grains produce very small
polarization with reversed orientation, which hasn't been observed. The
semi-analytic results are validated through Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations. In these models, the ""correct"" polarization orientation and the
small beta index are mutually exclusive. To resolve this tension, we explore a
wide range of dust models, parameterized by their complex refractive index. We
find that both the fraction of the polarization and whether it is reversed or
not depend on the refractive index in a complex way, and this dependence is
mapped out on an n-k plane for a representative dust size distribution (MRN
with amax=3mm) and wavelength of 870 microns. In particular, refractory
organics dust grains produce reversed polarization, whereas grains of the same
size but made of absorptive carbonaceous materials can produce a percent-level
polarization that is not reversed; the latter may alleviate the tension between
the grain sizes inferred from the scattering-induced polarization and the
opacity index beta. We conclude that scattering-induced polarization has the
potential to probe not only the sizes of the grains but also their composition.

the surface of the films. Due to Zn/Cd inter-diffusion during the growth

composition film. According to X- ray diffraction characterization the layers
grew coherently with the (100) oriented GaAs substrates although they showed a
relatively high mosaicity. Theta-2theta plots show very wide diffraction peaks
as expected from variable composition samples. The band gap grading effect in
light absorption was also verified through transmission measurements, using
transparent substrates. Graded composition profiles of the thin films were
confirmed by x-ray photoelectron and secondary ion mass spectroscopies.
Moreover, quantitative Cd, Zn and Te profiles were obtained by the analysis of
Rutherford backscattering spectra of the samples. This analysis showed a CdTe
molar fraction profile ranging from approximately x = 0.8 at the surface of the

out a detailed analysis of the layer by using the numerical simulations of

increases from 1000 cm$^{-3}$ to more than $10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ within 0.3 Myrs
by compression, and the turbulence and the magnetic field in the layer are
amplified by a factor of $\sim 5$, increasing the mass accretion rate by two
orders of magnitude to more than $10^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The layer
becomes highly filamentary due to gas flows along the magnetic field lines, and
dense cores are formed in the filaments. The massive dense cores have size and
mass of 0.03 -- 0.8 pc and 8 -- 50 $M_{\odot}$ and they are usually
gravitationally unstable. The mass function of the dense cores is significantly
top-heavy as compared with the universal IMF, indicating that the cloud-cloud

argue that the cloud-cloud collision is a versatile mechanism which creates a
variety of stellar clusters from a single O star like RCW120 and M20 to tens of
O stars of a super star cluster like RCW38 and a mini-starburst W43. The core
mass function predicted by the present model is consistent with the massive
dense cores obtained by recent ALMA observations in RCW38 (Torii et al. 2019)

emission, characterized by H95, is influenced by the outflowing hot gas
entrained in star formation driven winds, whereas the strong emission close to
the disk which is often rich in cool gas characterized by H50 or H75, is

as a probabilistic model and its training is to maximize a product of

mapping is proposed to describe the relationship between the visible and hidden
layers and the training is to minimize a squared error on the visible layer by
a finite difference learning. This paper presents three new properties in using
the RBM: 1) nodes on the visible and hidden layers can take real-valued matrix
data without a probabilistic interpretation; 2) the famous CD1 is a finite
difference approximation of the gradient descent; 3) the activation can take
non-sigmoid functions such as identity, relu and softsign. The data mapping
provides a unified framework on the dimensionality reduction, the feature
extraction and the data representation pioneered and developed by Hinton and
his colleagues. As an approximation of the gradient descent, the finite
difference learning is applicable to both directed and undirected graphs.
Numerical experiments are performed to verify these new properties on the very
low dimensionality reduction, the collinearity of timer series data and the use

This is done to investigate the connection between the symmetry properties in

the dynamics in an open quantum system. We derive the influence functional
explicitly in this setting, which captures the effect of the coupling to the

invariant under a set of transformations of path integral variables. The
fluctuation-dissipation relation is obtained as a consequence of this symmetry.
When the system is driven by an external time-dependent protocol, the symmetry
is broken. From the terms that break the symmetry, we derive a quantum
Jarzynski-like equality for quantum mechanical work given as a function of
fluctuating quantum trajectory. In the classical limit, the transformations
becomes those used in the functional integral formalism of the classical

a frequent ingredient of existing domain-specific heuristics, e.g., for placing
an item that has not been placed yet in bin packing. Therefore, in our novel
semantics negation as failure and aggregates in heuristic conditions are
evaluated on a partial solver state. State-of-the-art solvers do not allow such
a declarative specification. Our implementation in the lazy-grounding ASP

additional information to further improve the results of making the optimal

  We model decision-making in an uncertain system with a PLP and a set of
top-level queries, with a set of utility measures over the distributions of
these queries. The PLP is annotated with a set of atoms labeled as
""observable""; in the medical diagnosis example, the observable atoms will be

setting of optimally selecting observations based on VoI is more general than
that considered by any prior work. Given a limited budget, optimally choosing
observable atoms based on VoI is intractable in general. We give a greedy
algorithm for constructing a ""conditional plan"" of observations: a schedule
where the selection of what atom to observe next depends on earlier
observations. We show that, preempting the algorithm anytime before completion
provides a usable result, the result improves over time, and, in the absence of

in presence of a probabilistic absorber. The probabilistic absorber is an
absorber which absorbs molecules upon collision with probability q. With random
walk analysis, the discrete probability function of particle location in the
presence of a probabilistic absorber can be found. Then, a continuous
probability function is fitted to this Markov-based results with introducing
several fitting parameters to the known probability function of particle
location in an unbounded environment without an absorbing barrier. With this
approach, a single receptor is modeled as an M/M/1/1 queue in which q
represents the complementary blocking probability and the mean service time is
the mean trafficking time. Therefore, we are able to model the stochastic
nature of ligand-receptor binding, which comes from the incapability of a
receptor to receive all molecules in its space; and also known as receptor
occupancy. The proper consideration of the absorption effect leads to the
accurate calculation of the concentration at the desired site, which is
definitely less than the concentration obtained when neglecting it. These
findings can have a crucial role in designing drug delivery systems in which
determining the optimal rate of the drug transmitting nanomachines is critical

equivalences between LPMLN programs in this paper, which is regarded as an
important property in the field of logic programming. In the field of ASP, two

characterization of the notions by generalizing the SE-model approach in ASP.
Finally, we show the use of strong equivalences in simplifying LPMLN programs,

microwave photons like a classical radar. At the same time, it employs quantum
phenomena to improve detection, identification, and resolution capabilities.
However, the entanglement is so fragile, unstable, and difficult to create and
to preserve for a long time. Also, more importantly, the entangled states have
a tendency to leak away as a result of noise. The points mentioned above
enforces that the entangled states should be carefully studied at each step of
the quantum radar detection processes as follows. Firstly, the creation of the
entanglement between microwave and optical photons into the tripartite system
is realized. Secondly, the entangled microwave photons are intensified.
Thirdly, the intensified photons are propagated into the atmosphere
(attenuation medium) and reflected from a target. Finally, the backscattered
photons are intensified before the detection. At each step, the parameters
related to the real mediums and target material can affect the entangled states
to leak away easily. In this article, the entanglement behavior of a designed

system to define the parameters influencing the entanglement behavior. The
tripartite system dynamics of equations of motions are derived using the

rules driven by the demand from the query. Prior work has shown their precise
complexity analysis and relationships. However, when Datalog is extended with

aggregates often prevented their use in the recursive statements of logic

Pre-mappability (PreM) has shown that, in key applications of interest,
aggregates can be used in recursion to optimize the perfect-model semantics of
aggregate-stratified programs. Therefore we can preserve the declarative formal
semantics of such programs while achieving a highly efficient operational
semantics that is conducive to scalable implementations on parallel and
distributed platforms. In this paper, we show that with PreM, a wide spectrum
of classical algorithms of practical interest, ranging from graph analytics and
dynamic programming based optimization problems to data mining and machine
learning applications can be concisely expressed in declarative languages by
using aggregates in recursion. Our examples are also used to show that PreM can
be checked using simple techniques and templatized verification strategies. A
wide range of advanced BigData applications can now be expressed declaratively
in logic-based languages, including Datalog, Prolog, and even SQL, while
enabling their execution with superior performance and scalability.

for instance the typical setting in which, e.g., artificial agents for
video-games (the so called ""bots""), cleaning robots, bomb clearing robots, and
so on are deployed. In all these settings one can follow the classical approach
in which the operations of the agent are distinguished in ""sensing"" the
environment with proper interface devices, ""thinking"", and then behaving
accordingly using proper actuators. In order to operate in an highly reactive
environment, an artificial agent needs to be: 1. Responsive -> The agent must
be able to react repeatedly and in a reasonable amount of time; 2. Elastic ->
The agent must stay reactive also under varying workload; 3. Resilient -> The
agent must stay responsive also in case of internal failure or failure of one
of the programmed actions in the environment. Nowadays, thanks to new
technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, it is already technically
possible to create AI agents that are able to operate in reactive environments.
Nevertheless, several issues stay unsolved, and are subject of ongoing
research.

dust in the Universe. Although dust has been detected in galaxies at redshift
$z>7$, it is difficult to constrain the dominant dust sources only from the
total dust amount. Thus, we calculate the evolution of grain size distribution,
expecting that different dust sources predict different grain size
distributions. Using the star formation time-scale and the total baryonic mass
constrained by the data in the literature, we calculate the evolution of grain
size distribution. To explain the total dust masses in ALMA-detected $z>7$
galaxies, the following two solutions are possible: (i) high dust condensation
efficiency in stellar ejecta, and (ii) efficient accretion (dust growth by
accreting the gas-phase metals in the interstellar medium). We find that these
two scenarios predict significantly different grain size distributions: in (i),
the dust is dominated by large grains ($a\gtrsim 0.1~\mu$m, where $a$ is the
grain radius), while in (ii), the small-grain ($a\lesssim 0.01~\mu$m) abundance
is significantly enhanced by accretion. Accordingly, extinction curves are
expected to be much steeper in (ii) than in (i). Thus, we conclude that
extinction curves provide a viable way to distinguish the dominant dust sources
in the early phase of galaxy evolution.

in the Galactic Center, located near several prominent HII regions (Sickle and
Pistol) and the Quintuplet stellar cluster. We present observations of the Arc
NTFs using the S-, C-, and X-bands of the Very Large Array interferometer. Our
images of total intensity reveal large-scale helical features that surround the
Arc NTFs, very narrow sub-filamentation, and compact sources along the NTFs.
The distribution of polarized intensity is confined to a relatively small area
along the NTFs. There are elongated polarized structures that appear to lack
total intensity counterparts. We detect a range of rotation measure values from
-1000 to -5800 rad m$\rm^{-2}$, likely caused by external Faraday rotation
along the line of sight. After correcting for Faraday rotation, the intrinsic
magnetic field orientation is found to generally trace the extent of the NTFs.
However, the intrinsic magnetic field in several regions of the Arc NTFs shows
an ordered pattern that is rotated with respect to the extent of the NTFs. We
suggest this changing pattern may be caused by an additional magnetized source
along the line of sight, so that we observe two field systems superposed in our
observations. We suggest that the large scale helical segments near the Radio
Arc could be components of such a source causing these changes in intrinsic
magnetic field, and some variations in the polarization and rotation measure
values along the NTFs.

  Cooperative Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typically, objects with the same semantics are not always prominent in images
containing different backgrounds. Motivated by this observation that accurately
salient object detection is related to both foreground and background, we
proposed a novel cooperative attention mechanism that jointly considers
reciprocal relationships between background and foreground for efficient
salient object detection. Concretely, we first aggregate the features at each
side-out of traditional dilated FCN to extract the initial foreground and
background local responses respectively. Then taking these responses as input,
reciprocal attention module adaptively models the nonlocal dependencies between
any two pixels of the foreground and background features, which is then
aggregated with local features in a mutual reinforced way so as to enhance each
branch to generate more discriminative foreground and background saliency map.
Besides, cooperative losses are particularly designed to guide the multi-task
learning of foreground and background branches, which encourages our network to
obtain more complementary predictions with clear boundaries. At last, a simple
but effective fusion strategy is utilized to produce the final saliency map.
Comprehensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of all compared evaluation metrics.

photo-induced thermionic emission mechanism at the graphene/MoS2 van der Waals

the infrared light is absorbed and an electron-hole pair is generated. When the
energy of a photoexcited electron exceeds the band offset energy at the
graphene/MoS2 interface, the electron transfer occurs from graphene to the
conduction band of MoS2, and the hole remains in graphene. This creates an
electron-hole separation at the graphene/MoS2 interface at cyclotron resonance
and a photovoltage is generated. The proposed method is an infrared
photodetection technique through out-of-plane transport at the vdW junction,
which is distinct from the previously reported methods that use in-plane
transport in graphene for electronic detection of the cyclotron resonance.
Despite the simple structure of our device with a single-vdW junction, our
method exhibits a very high sensitivity of about 10^6 V/W, which shows an
improvement of three orders of magnitude over the previously reported values.
Therefore, the proposed method displays a high potential for cyclotron
resonance-based infrared photodetector applications.

employed, leading to the simple per-subcarrier one tap equalization. The
time-varying nature of the channel, in particular, the

thus inter-carrier interference (ICI). Existing works address both effects
separately, focus on the one effect while ignoring the respective other. This
paper considers both effect simultaneously for cyclic prefix (CP)-, zero padded

a galaxy. However, a close encounter of a star with one of the supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) may tidally disrupt it to produce a tidal disruption event
(TDE) and temporarily light up the SMBH. In a previous work, we investigated
with direct N-BODY simulations the evolution of TDE rates of SMBHB systems in
galaxy mergers of equal mass. In this work we extend to unequal mass mergers.
Our results show that, when two SMBHs are far away from each other, the TDE
rate of each host galaxy is similar as in an isolated galaxy. As the two
galaxies and their SMBHs separation shrinks, the TDE rate is increasing
gradually until it reaches a maximum shortly after the two SMBHs become bound.
In this stage, the averaged TDE rate can be enhanced by several times to an
order of magnitude relative to isolated single galaxies. Our simulations show
that the dependence of the TDE accretion rate on the mass ratio in this stage
can be well fitted by power law relations for both SMBHs. After the bound SMBHB
forms, the TDE rate decreases with its further evolution. We also find that in
minor mergers TDEs of the secondary SMBH during and after the bound binary
formation are mainly contributed by stars from the other galaxy.

large-scale (or mean-field) dynamo operating in their interstellar medium. A
key driver of mean magnetic field growth is the turbulent electromotive force
(EMF), which represents the influence of correlated small-scale (or
fluctuating) velocity and magnetic fields on the mean field. The EMF is usually
expressed as a linear expansion in the mean magnetic field and its derivatives,
with the dynamo tensors as expansion coefficients. Here, we adopt the singular
value decomposition (SVD) method to directly measure these turbulent transport
coefficients in a simulation of the turbulent interstellar medium that realizes
a large-scale dynamo. Specifically, the SVD is used to least-square fit the
time series data of the EMF with that of the mean field and its derivatives, to
determine these coefficients. We demonstrate that the spatial profiles of the
EMF reconstructed from the SVD coefficients match well with that taken directly
from the simulation. Also, as a direct test, we use the coefficients to
simulate a 1-D mean-field dynamo model and find an overall similarity in the
evolution of the mean magnetic field between the dynamo model and the direct
simulation. We also compare the results with those which arise using simple
regression and the ones obtained previously using the test-field (TF) method,
to find reasonable qualitative agreement. Overall, the SVD method provides an
effective post-processing tool to determine turbulent transport coefficients
from simulations.

better describe the movements of body parts across the whole video, is not
considered. In this letter, we propose a novel global temporal representation
named optical-flow stacked difference image (OFSDI) and extract robust and
discriminative feature from the infrared action data by considering the local,
global, and spatial temporal information together. Due to the small size of the
infrared action dataset, we first apply convolutional neural networks on local,
spatial, and global temporal stream respectively to obtain efficient
convolutional feature maps from the raw data rather than train a classifier
directly. Then these convolutional feature maps are aggregated into effective
descriptors named three-stream trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptors
by trajectory-constrained pooling. Furthermore, we improve the robustness of
these features by using the locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) method.
With these features, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to
classify the action data in our scheme. We conduct the experiments on infrared

on the setting with competitive robots in a decentralized environment, where
robots may strategically reveal their information to get prioritized. We
propose the mechanism SPARCAS in this setting that, using principles of
mechanism design, ensures truthful revelation of the robots' private
information and provides locally efficient movement of the robots. It is free
from collisions and deadlocks, and handles a dynamic arrival of robots. In
practice, this mechanism scales well for a large number of robots where the
optimal collision-avoiding path-finding algorithm (M*) does not scale. Yet,
SPARCAS does not compromise the path optimality too much. Our mechanism
prioritizes the robots in the order of their `true' higher needs, but for a
higher payment. It uses monetary transfers which is small enough compared to
the value received by the robots.

magnetic susceptibly measurements indicate a second order phase transition from
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic where the Curie temperature (T$_{\rm C}$) of
Co$_2$CrAl increases from 330~K to 445~K with Ti substitution. Neutron powder
diffraction data of the $x=$ 0 sample across the magnetic phase transition
taken in a large temperature range confirm the structural stability and exclude
the possibility of antiferromagnetic ordering. The saturation magnetization of
the $x=$ 0 sample is found to be 8000~emu/mol (1.45~$\mu_{\rm B}$/{\it f.u.})
at 5~K, which is in good agreement with the value (1.35$\pm$0.05~$\mu_{\rm

diffraction pattern measured at temperature of 4~K. By analysing the
temperature dependence of the neutron data of the $x=$ 0 sample, we find that
the change in the intensity of the most intense Bragg peak (220) is consistent
with the magnetization behavior with temperature. Furthermore, an enhancement
of change in the magnetic entropy and relative cooling power values has been
observed for the $x=$ 0.25 sample. Interestingly, the critical behavior
analysis across the second order magnetic phase transition and extracted
exponents ($\beta\approx$ 0.496, $\gamma\approx$ 1.348, and $\delta\approx$

proposed to solve the problem of limited infrared action data. In the proposed

Generalization (CDFAG) framework to map the infrared data and visible light

infrared data and visible light data, and can classify the features derived
from infrared data. The proposed method is evaluated on InfAR, which is a
publicly available infrared human action dataset. To build up auxiliary data,
we set up a novel visible light action dataset XD145. Experimental results show
that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with

effect of a flat 1000 Euro state-dependent university tuition fee on the

show how the variation in the introduction scheme across states and times can
be exploited to identify the federal average causal effect of tuition fees by
controlling for a large amount of potentially influencing attributes for state
heterogeneity. We suggest a stability post-double selection methodology to
robustly determine the causal effect across types in the transparently modeled
unknown response components. The proposed stability resampling scheme in the
two LASSO selection steps efficiently mitigates the risk of model
underspecification and thus biased effects when the tuition fee policy decision
also depends on relevant variables for the state enrollment rates. Correct
inference for the full cross-section state population in the sample requires
adequate design -- rather than sampling-based standard errors. With the
data-driven model selection and explicit control for spatial cross-effects we
detect that tuition fees induce substantial migration effects where the
mobility occurs both from fee but also from non-fee states suggesting also a
general movement for quality. Overall, we find a significant negative impact of
up to 4.5 percentage points of fees on student enrollment. This is in contrast
to plain one-step LASSO or previous empirical studies with full fixed effects

insignificant effect.

support vector regression for interpolation, a parameterized ridgeline leading
out of the data domain, scaling from Tomiyama and Fukagata (2013), and a
discovered self-similar structure of the actuation effect. The model yields
high prediction accuracy outside the training data range.

bandgap energies and charge carrier dynamics making them highly attractive as
building blocks for a broad range of photonic devices. For optimal solutions
concerning device performance and cost, a crucial element is the selection of a
suitable material system which could enable a large wavelength tunability,
strong light interaction and simple integration with the mainstream silicon
technologies. The emerging GaBiAs alloys offer such promising features and may
lead to a new era of technologies. Here, we apply million-atom atomistic
simulations to design GaBiAs/GaAs core-shell nanowires suitable for low-loss
telecom-wavelength photonic devices. The effects of internal strain, Bi
Composition (x), random alloy configuration, and core-to-shell diameter ratio
($\rm \rho_D$) are analysed and delineated by systematically varying these
attributes and studying their impact on the absorption wavelength and charge
carrier confinement. The complex interplay between x and $\rm \rho_D$ results
in two distinct pathways to accomplish 1.55 um optical transitions: either
fabricate nanowires with $\rm \rho_D \geq$ 0.8 and $x \sim$15\%, or increase
$x$ to $\sim$30\% with $\rm \rho_D \leq$ 0.4. Upon further analysis of the
electron hole wave functions, inhomogeneous broadening and optical transition
strengths, the nanowires with $\rm \rho_D \leq$ 0.4 are unveiled to render
favourable properties for the design of photonic devices. Another important
outcome of our study is to demonstrate the possibility of modulating the strain
character from a compressive to a tensile regime by simply engineering the
thickness of the core region. The availability of such a straightforward knob
for strain manipulation would be highly desirable for devices involving
polarisation-sensitive light interactions.

drawings or transforming shapes within the same modality, e.g., color images.
Our key insight is to decompose unsupervised sketch-to-photo synthesis into a
two-stage translation task: First shape translation from sketches to grayscale
photos and then content enrichment from grayscale to color photos. We also
incorporate a self-supervised denoising objective and an attention module to
handle abstraction and style variations that are inherent and specific to
sketches. Our synthesis is sketch-faithful and photo-realistic to enable
sketch-based image retrieval in practice. An exciting corollary product is a
universal and promising sketch generator that captures human visual perception

of these diadic products is close to $I$. The $\ln d$ term cannot be removed.
  On the other hand, the recent fundamental result of Batson, Spielman and

$\ln d$ term can be removed, if one wants to show the existence of a good
approximation of $I$ as the average of a few diadic products. It is known that
essentially the same proof as Rudelson's yields a more general statement about
the average of positive semi-definite matrices.

result of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava cannot be extended to this wider

This yields applications to the study of the Banach--Mazur distance of convex

the deformable mirror. The absolute wavefront retrieval is performed with a
non-linear algorithm. The focal-plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) performance of
the vAPP and the algorithm are evaluated with numerical simulations, to test
various photon and read noise levels, the sensitivity to the 100 lowest Zernike
modes and the maximum wavefront error (WFE) that can be accurately estimated in
one iteration. We apply these methods to the vAPP within SCExAO, first with the
internal source and subsequently on-sky. In idealised simulations we show that
for $10^7$ photons the root-mean-square (RMS) WFE can be reduced to
$\sim\lambda/1000$, which is 1 nm RMS in the context of the SCExAO system. We
find that the maximum WFE that can be corrected in one iteration is
$\sim\lambda/8$ RMS or $\sim$200 nm RMS (SCExAO). Furthermore, we demonstrate
the SCExAO vAPP capabilities by measuring and controlling the lowest 30 Zernike
modes with the internal source and on-sky. On-sky, we report a raw contrast
improvement of a factor $\sim$2 between 2 and 4 $\lambda/D$ after 5 iterations
of closed-loop correction. When artificially introducing 150 nm RMS WFE, the
algorithm corrects it within 5 iterations of closed-loop operation. FPWFS with
the vAPP's coronagraphic PSFs is a powerful technique since it integrates
coronagraphy and wavefront sensing, eliminating the need for additional probes
and thus resulting in a $100\%$ science duty cycle and maximum throughput for
the target.

bandwidth reduction because various kinds of local data can be involved in the

simulation of time dependent problems by time domain decomposition. The
available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency
limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high
dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel
efficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on
combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse
physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive
solver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the
algorithm provides a solution that has the fine solver's high-fidelity physics
and high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high
accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel
efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this
obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the
parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes
very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is
small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability
become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed
theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the
success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the
quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal
steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiff ODEs, which
are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is
time and efficiency is affected by the cost of the coarse solver.

potential of modeling time-dependent signals. The firing rate of spiking

thus, whether the firing rate is adequate for modeling actual time series
relies on fortune. Though it is demanded to have an adaptive control rate, it
is a non-trivial task because the control rate and the connection weights

to have adaptable eigenvalues rather than parametric control rates, we develop
the Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network (BSNN), which has an adaptive firing

and as a result, improve its performance and scalability. In this model, there
are communication channels only between each client and the server, while only
clients provide inputs to the computation. Hence, it is a centralized
communication pattern, i.e., a star network. We propose different approaches

answer the question: what kind of the near fields arising from a sample of such

experimental technique that is based on an effective coupling to the violation
of spatial as well as temporal inversion symmetry. To observe the ME energy in

how a number of these parameters affect that measured accretion rate of a

using the FARGOCA-code. The planet is represented by a gravitational potential
with a smoothing length at the location of the planet. No mass or energy sink
is used, instead luminosity and gas accretion rates are self-consistently
computed. We find that the gravitational smoothing length must be resolved by
at least 10 grid cells to obtain converged measurements of the gas accretion
rates. Secondly, we find gas accretion rates into planetary envelopes
compatible with previous studies, and continue to explain those via the
structure of our planetary envelopes and their luminosities. Our measured gas
accretion rates are formally in the stage of Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction due
to the modest entropy loss that can be obtained over the simulation time-scale,
but our accretion rates are compatible with those expected during late run-away
accretion. Our detailed simulations of the gas flow into the envelope of a

the data to be classified may contain sensitive information belonging to
different parties. In this paper, we, therefore, address the problem of
privately evaluating a decision tree on private data. This scenario consists of
a server holding a private decision tree model and a client interested in
classifying its private attribute vector using the server's private model. The
goal of the computation is to obtain the classification while preserving the
privacy of both - the decision tree and the client input. After the
computation, the classification result is revealed only to the client, and
nothing else is revealed neither to the client nor to the server. Existing
privacy-preserving protocols that address this problem use or combine different
generic secure multiparty computation approaches resulting in several
interactions between the client and the server. Our goal is to design and
implement a novel client-server protocol that delegates the complete tree
evaluation to the server while preserving privacy and reducing the overhead.
The idea is to use fully (somewhat) homomorphic encryption and evaluate the
tree on ciphertexts encrypted under the client's public key. However, since
current somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes have high overhead, we combine
efficient data representations with different algorithmic optimizations to keep
the computational overhead and the communication cost low. As a result, we are
able to provide the first non-interactive protocol, that allows the client to
delegate the evaluation to the server by sending an encrypted input and
receiving only the encryption of the result. Our scheme has only one round and
can evaluate a complete tree of depth 10 within seconds.

simple analytical scheme based on one atomic parameter that allows determining
electron-impact ionization cross sections. The quality of the cross sections
calculated with the MRBEB method is shown through: (i) comparison with those
obtained with the general ionization processes in the presence of electrons and
radiation (GIPPER) code and the flexible atomic code (FAC), and (ii)
determination of their effects on the ionic structure and cooling of an
optically thin plasma.
  Results. The three sets of cross sections show deviations among each other in
different energy regions. The largest deviations occur near and in the peak
maximum. Ion fractions and plasma emissivities of an optically thin plasma that
evolves under collisional ionization equilibrium, derived using each set of
cross sections, show deviations that decrease with increase in temperature and
ionization degree. In spite of these differences, the calculations using the
three sets of cross sections agree overall. Conclusions. A simple model like
the MRBEB is capable of providing cross sections similar to those calculated
with more sophisticated quantum mechanical methods in the GIPPER and FAC codes.

effective interaction between their structural units. This softness often leads
to complex behavior. In particular, ultrasoft systems under pressure
demonstrate polymorphism of complex crystal and quasicrystal structures.
Therefore, it is of interest to investigate how different can be the structure
of the fluid state in such systems at different pressures. Here we address this
issue for the model liquid composed of particles interacting through the
harmonic-repulsive pair potential. This system can form different crystal
structures as the liquid is cooled. We find that, at certain pressures, the
liquid exhibits unusual properties, such as the negative thermal expansion
coefficient. Besides, the volume and the potential energy of the system can
increase during crystallization. At certain pressures, the system demonstrates
high stability against crystallization and it is hardly possible to crystallize
it on the timescales of the simulations. To address the liquid's structure at
high pressures, we consider the scaled pair distribution function (PDF) and the
bond-orientational order (BOO) parameters. The marked change happening with the
PDF, as pressure increases, is the splitting of the first peak which is caused
by the appearance of non-negligible interaction with the second neighbors and
the following rearrangement of the structure. Our findings suggest that
non-trivial effects, usually explained by different interactions at different
spatial scales, can be observed also in one-component systems with simple
one-length-scale ultrasoft repulsive interactions.

targeting both the molecular and ionized components of the outflows. The
outflow kinematics is studied at milliarcsecond scales through VLBI
observations of the 22 GHz water masers. We employed the JVLA at 6, 13, and 22
GHz in the A- and B-Array configurations to determine the spatial structure and
the spectral index of the radio continuum emission. In about half of the
targets, the water masers observed at separation <= 1000 au from the YSOs trace
either or both of these kinematic structures: 1) a spatially elongated
distribution oriented at close angle with the direction of collimation of the
maser proper motions (PM), and 2) a linear LSR velocity (Vlsr) gradient across
the YSO position. The kinematic structure (1) is readily interpreted in terms
of a protostellar jet, as confirmed in some targets via the comparison with
independent observations of the YSO jets, in thermal (continuum and line)
emissions, reported in the literature. The kinematic structure (2) is
interpreted in terms of a disk-wind (DW) seen almost edge-on on the basis of
several pieces of evidence: first, it is invariably directed perpendicular to
the YSO jet; second, it agrees in orientation and polarity with the Vlsr
gradient in thermal emissions (when reported in the literature) identifying the
YSO disk at scales of <= 1000~au; third, the PMs of the masers delineating the
Vlsr gradients hint at flow motions at a speed of 10-20 km/s directed at large
angles with the disk midplane. In the remaining targets, the maser PMs are not
collimated but rather tend to align along two almost perpendicular directions,
and could originate in DW-jet systems slightly inclined (<= 30 deg) with
respect to edge-on.

of satisfying this guarantee for multiple overlapping groups is not
straightforward and show that for the simple objective of unweighted average of
false negative and false positive rate, satisfying this for overlapping
populations can be statistically impossible even when we are provided
predictors that perform well separately on each subgroup. On the positive side,
we show that when individuals are equally important to the different groups

sleeping experts literature in online learning. Motivated by the one-sided
feedback in natural settings of interest, we extend our results to such a
feedback model. We also provide a game-theoretic interpretation of our results,
examining the incentives of participants to join the system and to provide the

interesting open problems concerning the strength of guarantees that can be

Center region but comes to grief with higher longitudes. The model is given via
the solution of a transport equation that allows for a radial dependency of the
mass distribution. In order to move from this semi-analytical approximation
toward a full understanding of the PeVatron signature, we present a new 3D
analytical model of the gas distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ).
Furthermore, we derive for the first time a 3D model of the magnetic field
configuration and strength in the CMZ, which is analytical and divergence-free.
The model is built via a combination of a model for the diffuse inter-cloud
medium, local molecular clouds and non-thermal filaments at which local
information are based on investigations from previous works and the molecular
gas density. It can be shown that without an efficient longitudinal CR
entrapment, a single source at the center does not facilely suffice the diffuse
gamma-ray detection. Further, we show that the new magnetic field model GBFD19
is compatible with recent polarization data and has a significant impact on the
longitudinal profiles of CR propagation.

procedures are complicated, since they set several constraints on the quantum
states used as inputs of the process to be characterized. In this paper, we
extend QPT so as to avoid two such constraints. On the one hand, usual QPT
methods requires one to know, hence to precisely control (i.e. prepare), the
specific quantum states used as inputs of the considered quantum process, which
is cumbersome. We therefore propose a Blind, or unsupervised, extension of QPT
(i.e. BQPT), which means that this approach uses input quantum states whose
values are unknown and arbitrary, except that they are requested to meet some
general known properties (and this approach exploits the output states of the
considered quantum process). On the other hand, usual QPT methods require one
to be able to prepare many copies of the same (known) input state, which is
constraining. On the contrary, we propose ""single-preparation methods"", i.e.
methods which can operate with only one instance of each considered input
state. These two new concepts are here illustrated with practical BQPT methods
which are numerically validated, in the case when: i) random pure states are
used as inputs and their required properties are especially related to the
statistical independence of the random variables that define them, ii) the
considered quantum process is based on cylindrical-symmetry Heisenberg spin
coupling. These concepts may be extended to a much wider class of processes and
to BQPT methods based on other input quantum state properties.

lines of code controlling almost every function in the vehicle including
safety-critical functions. It has recently been shown that IVNs are becoming
increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks capable of taking control of vehicles,
thereby threatening the safety of the passengers. Several countermeasures have
been proposed in the literature in response to the arising threats, however,
hurdle requirements imposed by the industry is hindering their adoption in
practice. In particular, detecting attacks on IVNs is challenged by strict
resource constraints and utterly complex communication patterns that vary even
for vehicles of the same model. In addition, existing solutions suffer from two
main drawbacks. First, they depend on the underlying vehicle configuration, and
second, they are incapable of detecting certain attacks of a stealthy nature.

mechanism that does not abide by the strict specifications predefined for every
vehicle model and addresses key real-world deployability challenges. Our fast,
lightweight, and system-agnostic approach learns the normal behavior of IVN
dynamics from historical data and detects deviations by continuously monitoring
IVN traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CASAD by conducting various
experiments on a CAN bus prototype, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and publicly available

effective against different attack scenarios, including the prompt detection of
stealthy attacks, and has considerable potential applicability to real

and excluding the mass contribution of the neutral gas component, and when
using HI or hybrid RCs. Pseudo-isothermal (ISO) core and Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) cuspy DM halo profiles are used with various fiducial fitting procedures.
Mass models using H$\alpha$ RCs including or excluding the HI gas component
provide compatible disc M/L. The correlations between DM halo and baryon
parameters do not strongly depend on the RC. Clearly, the differences between
the fitting procedures are larger than between the different datasets. Hybrid
and HI RCs lead to higher M/L values for both ISO and NFW best fit models but
lower central densities for ISO halos and higher concentration for NFW halos
than when using H$\alpha$ RCs only. The agreement with the mass model
parameters deduced using hybrid RCs, considered as a reference, is better for
HI than for H$\alpha$ RCs. ISO density profiles better fit the RCs than the NFW
ones, especially when using H$\alpha$ or hybrid RCs. Halo masses at the optical
radius determined using the various datasets are compatible even if they tend
to be overestimated with H$\alpha$ RCs. Hybrid RCs are thus ideal to study the

$W[1]$-hard problem. In stark contrast, polynomial-time algorithms are known
when the inputs are restricted to structured graph classes such as, for
instance, perfect graphs (which includes bipartite graphs, chordal graphs,
co-graphs, etc.) or claw-free graphs. In this paper, we introduce some variants
of co-graphs with parameterized noise, that is, graphs that can be made into
disjoint unions or complete sums by the removal of a certain number of vertices
and the addition/deletion of a certain number of edges per incident vertex,
both controlled by the parameter. We give a series of FPT Turing-reductions on
these classes and use them to make some progress on the parameterized
complexity of MIS in $H$-free graphs. We show that for every fixed $t \geqslant
1$, MIS is FPT in $P(1,t,t,t)$-free graphs, where $P(1,t,t,t)$ is the graph
obtained by substituting all the vertices of a four-vertex path but one end of
the path by cliques of size $t$. We also provide randomized FPT algorithms in
dart-free graphs and in cricket-free graphs. This settles the FPT/W[1]-hard
dichotomy for five-vertex graphs $H$.

equations for steady-state flow. However, models of lithospheric flexure reveal
differences in lithospheric strength that are difficult to reconcile based on
such flow laws. Recent rheological data from low-temperature deformation
experiments on olivine suggest that this discrepancy may be largely explained
by strain hardening. Details of the mechanical data, specifically the effects
of temperature-independent back stresses stored in the samples, indicate that
strain hardening in olivine occurs primarily due to long-range elastic
interactions between dislocations. These interpretations provided the basis for
a new flow law that incorporates hardening by development of back stress. Here,
we test this hypothesis by examining the microstructures of olivine samples
deformed plastically at room temperature either in a deformation-DIA apparatus
at differential stresses of < 4.3 GPa or in a nanoindenter at applied contact
stresses of > 10.2 GPa. High-angular resolution electron backscatter
diffraction maps reveal the presence of geometrically necessary dislocations
with densities commonly above 10$^{14}$ m$^{-2}$ and intragranular
heterogeneities in residual stress on the order of 1 GPa in both sets of
samples. Scanning transmission electron micrographs reveal straight
dislocations aligned along slip bands and interacting with dislocations of
other types that act as obstacles. The stress heterogeneities and accumulations
of dislocations along their slip planes are consistent with strain hardening
resulting from long-range back-stresses acting between dislocations. These
results corroborate the mechanical data in supporting the form of the new flow
law for low-temperature plasticity and provide new microstructural criteria for
identifying the operation of this deformation mechanism in natural samples.

to fill this gap in the literature by proposing new estimators of the
conditional cure rate and the conditional survival function using extrapolation

is based on nearby, low-reddening Galactic GCs, for which we can obtain
accurate F275W photometry. In this work we exploit $HST$ photometry in F336W,
F438W, and F814W to characterize MPs in 68 Galactic and extragalactic GCs by
using the pseudo-color $C_{F336W,F438W,F814W}$, which is more efficient in
terms of observation time than the pseudo-color $C_{F275W,F336W,F438W}$ adopted
in previous works. We first analyzed the Galactic GCs alone and find that the
RGB color width strongly correlates with [Fe/H]. After removing the dependence
from metallicity, we obtain a strong correlation with cluster mass, thus
confirming previous findings. We then exploited the RGB width to compare MPs in
Galactic and extragalactic GCs. Similarly to Galactic GCs, the RGB width of
Magellanic Cloud GCs correlates with clusters mass, after removing the
dependence from metallicity. This fact demonstrates that cluster mass is the
main factor affecting the properties of MPs. Magellanic Cloud clusters exhibit,
on average, narrower RGBs than Galactic GCs with similar mass and metallicity.
We suggest that this difference is a signature of stellar mass loss in Galactic
GCs. As an alternative, the mass-RGB-width relation would depend on the host
galaxy. Finally, we used ground-based photometry to investigate Terzan\,7
through the $C_{U,B,I}$ pseudo-color, ground-based analogous of
$C_{F336W,F438W,F814W}$, and find that this cluster is consistent with a simple

is interpreted in terms of phonon bottleneck dynamics characteristic of
LO-phonon mediated energy relaxation. Excitons, having a small binding energy
of 60 meV, are formed below the CBM quasi-instantaneously and subsequently
relax to the 1S-exciton state of the yellow series within 1.5 ps. We find that,

We determine the electronic current contributions relative to photon absorption

Yet, we show in this work that a significant contribution to the Urbach tail
comes from carriers-phonon interactions, an intrinsic properties of the

results is still lacking. We systematize various theories of helical transport
with the help of the spin conservation analysis which allows one to single out

conductance remains ballistic even if the time-reversal symmetry on the edge is
(locally) broken but the total spin is conserved. Another example focuses on
the effects of the space-fluctuating spin-orbit interaction on the QSH edge. It
reveals weakness of the protection in several cases, including, e.g., the

flowing supercurrents or external electromagnetic fields and may be strongly

in previous experiments is that as the temperature is lowered, vortex motion is
suppressed, leading to a decreased resistance. A new generation of materials
provides access to the previously inaccessible regime of clean-limit
superconductivity in atomically thin superconducting layers. We show
experimentally that for few-layer 2H-NbSe$_2$ the resistance below the
superconducting transition temperature may be non-monotonic, passing through a
minimum and then increasing again as temperature is decreased further. The
effects exists over a wide range of current and magnetic fields, but is most
pronounced in monolayer devices at intermediate currents. Analytical and
numerical calculations confirm that the findings can be understood in a
two-fluid vortex model, in which a fraction of vortices flow in channels while
the rest are pinned but thermally fluctuating in position. We show
theoretically that the pinned, fluctuating vortices effectively control the
mobility of the free vortices. The findings provide a new perspective on
fundamental questions of vortex mobility and dissipation in superconductors.

larger than the equilibrium tide value in a thin region near the surface of the
star. This is because non--adiabatic effects dominate in a region that extends
from below the outer edge of the convection zone up to the stellar surface, and
the equilibrium tide approximation is inconsistent with non--adiabaticity.
Although this approximation generally applies in the low frequency limit, it
also fails in the parts of the convection zone where the forcing frequency is
small but larger than the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency. We derive analytical
estimates which give a good approximation to the numerical values of the

the horizontal displacement may therefore be more achievable than previously
thought, and brightness perturbations may be the result of flux perturbations
rather than due to the radial displacement. We discuss the implication of this

the prospect of utilising the large horizontal motion for observations of

to the electrical resistivity undergo a step-wise increase at the transition

to be induced in epsilon-Fe by many-electron effects; its experimental
signatures are analyzed. Next section focuses on the geophysically relevant
pressure-temperature regime of the Earth's inner core (EIC) corresponding to
the extreme pressure of 360 GPa combined with temperatures up to 6000 K. The
three iron allotropes (bcc, hcp and face-centered-cubic) previously proposed as

different many-electron effects as evidenced by a strongly non-Fermi-liquid

  We use our time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC to study the acceleration
of cosmic rays and their escape in post-adiabatic Supernova remnants and
calculate the subsequent gamma-ray emission from inverse-Compton scattering and
Pion decay.
  We performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations in which we simultaneously
solve the transport equations for CRs, magnetic turbulence, and the
hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in a volume large enough to keep all
CRs in the simulation. The transport equations for cosmic-rays and magnetic
turbulence are coupled via the cosmic-ray gradient and the spatial diffusion
coefficient of the cosmic rays, while the cosmic-ray feedback onto the shock
structure can be ignored. Our simulations span 100kyrs, thus covering the
remnants evolution until the beginning of the post-adiabatic phase.
  At later stages of the evolution cosmic rays over a wide range of energy can
reside outside of the remnant, creating spectra that are softer than predicted

of cosmic rays released into the interstellar medium has a spectral index of

processes leading to their formation are still far from being understood.
Current planet population synthesis models, which aim to describe the planet
formation process from the protoplanetary disk phase to the time exoplanets are
observed, rely on prescriptions for the underlying properties of protoplanetary
disks where planets form and evolve. The recent development in measuring disk
masses and disk-star interaction properties, i.e., mass accretion rates, in
large samples of young stellar objects demand a more careful comparison between
the models and the data. We performed an initial critical assessment of the
assumptions made by planet synthesis population models by looking at the
relation between mass accretion rates and disk masses in the models and in the
currently available data. We find that the currently used disk models predict
mass accretion rate in line with what is measured, but with a much lower spread
of values than observed. This difference is mainly because the models have a
smaller spread of viscous timescales than what is needed to reproduce the
observations. We also find an overabundance of weakly accreting disks in the
models where giant planets have formed with respect to observations of typical
disks. We suggest that either fewer giant planets have formed in reality or
that the prescription for planet accretion predicts accretion on the planets
that is too high. Finally, the comparison of the properties of transition disks
with large cavities confirms that in many of these objects the observed
accretion rates are higher than those predicted by the models. On the other
hand, PDS70, a transition disk with two detected giant planets in the cavity,
shows mass accretion rates well in line with model predictions.

F$ of sets in zero-, one- and two-dimensional (pseudo)manifolds and graphs. The
only requirement is that for each $\mathcal G\subseteq\mathcal F$ the
intersection $\bigcap\mathcal G$ has bounded number of path-connected
components. As a consequence we obtain Helly's and Tverberg's theorems,
fractional and colorful Helly theorems, existence of weak $\varepsilon$-nets

  More precisely, if $\mathcal F$ is an intersection-closed family in a
topological space $X$ and $S\subseteq X$, we define its convex hull
$\text{conv}_{\mathcal F}(S)$ as the smallest set in $\mathcal F$ that contains
$S$. The Radon number $r(\mathcal F)$ is then the smallest integer $r$ such
that every set $S\subseteq X$ of size $r$ can be split into two disjoint
subsets with intersecting convex hulls.
  For every graph $G$ with $n$ vertices we construct a polynomial $p_G(x)$
satisfying the following three conditions. 1) If $n=1$, $p_G(x)=1$. 2) If
$n\geq 2$, the degree of $p_G(x)$ is at most $2n-3$. 3) If the graph $G$ does
not almost-embed into a topological space $X$, and $\mathcal F$ is a finite and
intersection-closed family of sets in $X$, such that each member of $\mathcal

  In particular, if $\mathcal F$ is a family of sets in $\mathbb R^2$,
$r(\mathcal F)\leq r_{K_{3,3}}(b)\leq 2b^6 - 5b^5 + 10b^4 - 10b^3 + 9b^2 - 3b +

from linguistics to analyse the representation learned by neural networks --
the gating paradigm -- and show that the correct representation of a word is
only activated if the network has access to first phoneme of the target word,
suggesting that the network does not rely on a global acoustic pattern.
Furthermore, we find out that not all speech frames (MFCC vectors in our case)
play an equal role in the final encoded representation of a given word, but
that some frames have a crucial effect on it. Finally, we suggest that word

the advent of approaches based on deep learning. Such methods typically require
large amounts of labelled training data, which in the case of music consist of
mixtures and corresponding instrument stems. However, stems are unavailable for
most commercial music, and only limited datasets have so far been released to
the public. It can thus be difficult to draw conclusions when comparing various
source separation methods, as the difference in performance may stem as much
from better data augmentation techniques or training tricks to alleviate the
limited availability of training data, as from intrinsically better model
architectures and objective functions. In this paper, we present the
synthesized Lakh dataset (Slakh) as a new tool for music source separation
research. Slakh consists of high-quality renderings of instrumental mixtures
and corresponding stems generated from the Lakh MIDI dataset (LMD) using
professional-grade sample-based virtual instruments. A first version,
Slakh2100, focuses on 2100 songs, resulting in 145 hours of mixtures. While not
fully comparable because it is purely instrumental, this dataset contains an
order of magnitude more data than MUSDB18, the {\it de facto} standard dataset
in the field. We show that Slakh can be used to effectively augment existing
datasets for musical instrument separation, while opening the door to a wide
array of data-intensive music signal analysis tasks.

investigated to accelerate the processing of deep neural networks (DNNs). Due
to the in-situ computation capability, analog ReRAM crossbars yield significant
throughput improvement and energy reduction compared to traditional digital
methods. However, the power hungry analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) prevent
the practical deployment of ReRAM-based DNN accelerators on end devices with
limited chip area and power budget. We observe that due to the limited
bit-density of ReRAM cells, DNN weights are bit sliced and correspondingly
stored on multiple ReRAM bitlines. The accumulated current on bitlines resulted
by weights directly dictates the overhead of ADCs. As such, bitwise weight
sparsity rather than the sparsity of the full weight, is desirable for
efficient ReRAM deployment. In this work, we propose bit-slice L1, the first
algorithm to induce bit-slice sparsity during the training of dynamic
fixed-point DNNs. Experiment results show that our approach achieves 2x
sparsity improvement compared to previous algorithms. The resulting sparsity
allows the ADC resolution to be reduced to 1-bit of the most significant
bit-slice and down to 3-bit for the others bits, which significantly speeds up
processing and reduces power and area overhead.

for the possibility that individuals' outcomes are affected by group-level
discrimination. Injecting a single non-classical assumption, that the agent is
overconfident about himself, we explain key observed patterns in social
beliefs, and make a number of additional predictions. First, the agent believes
in discrimination against any group he is in more than an outsider does,
capturing widely observed self-centered views of discrimination. Second, the
more group memberships the agent shares with an individual, the more positively
he evaluates the individual. This explains one of the most basic facts about
social judgments, in-group bias, as well as ""legitimizing myths"" that justify
an arbitrary social hierarchy through the perceived superiority of the
privileged group. Third, biases are sensitive to how the agent divides society
into groups when evaluating outcomes. This provides a reason why some
ethnically charged questions should not be asked, as well as a potential
channel for why nation-building policies might be effective. Fourth, giving the
agent more accurate information about himself increases all his biases. Fifth,
the agent is prone to substitute biases, implying that the introduction of a
new outsider group to focus on creates biases against the new group but lowers
biases vis a vis other groups. Sixth, there is a tendency for the agent to
agree more with those in the same groups. As a microfoundation for our model,
we provide an explanation for why an overconfident agent might allow for
potential discrimination in evaluating outcomes, even when he initially did not
conceive of this possibility.

$\nu=\varepsilon_0(\nu)G_0+\cdots+\varepsilon_\ell(\nu)G_\ell$ for $\ell \in

Analytical conditions for the existence of resonance may be reduced to

strength of resonant energy transfer differs between wavenumber scales. This
suggests uniform current is a fundamental source of spatial inhomogeneity. The

stresses can be designed in a far-from-equilibrium fluid by applying to its
constituents a time-modulated drive. If the drive induces a rotation whose rate
is slowed down when the constituents point along specific directions,
anisotropic structures and mechanical responses arise at long timescales. We
demonstrate that the viscous response of such anisotropic driven fluids can
acquire a tensorial, dissipationless component called anisotropic odd (or Hall)
viscosity. Classical fluids with internal torques can display additional
components of the odd viscosity neglected in previous studies of quantum Hall
fluids that assumed angular momentum conservation. We show that these
anisotropic and angular momentum-violating odd-viscosity coefficients can
change even the bulk flow of an incompressible fluid by acting as a source of
vorticity. In addition, shear distortions in the shape of an inclusion result
in torques.

analyse dozens of transitions from deuterated methanol isotopologues coming
from various existing observational datasets from the IRAM-PdBI and ALMA sub-mm
interferometers to estimate the methanol deuteration surrounding three low-mass

derive a [CH$_2$DOH]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratio of 3-6 % and a
[CH$_3$OD]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of 0.4-1.6 % in the warm inner protostellar
regions. These values are ten times lower than those derived with previous
single-dish observations towards these sources but they are 10-100 times higher
than the methanol deuteration measured in massive hot cores. Dust temperature
maps obtained from Herschel and Planck observations show that massive hot cores
are located in warmer molecular clouds than low-mass sources, with temperature
differences of $\sim$10 K. Comparison with the predictions of the gas-grain
astrochemical model GRAINOBLE shows that such a temperature difference is
sufficient to explain the different deuteration observed in low- to high-mass
sources, suggesting that the physical conditions of the molecular cloud at the
origin of the protostars mostly govern the present observed deuteration of
methanol. The methanol deuteration measured in this work is higher by a factor
of 5 than the upper limit in methanol deuteration estimated in comet Hale-Bopp,

storm-time features of electron fluxes throughout the studied storm in

dynamics of the low energy population at L* = 6.6 increases fluxes closer to
the heart of the belt and has a strong impact in the VERB simulations at all

design of novel tools for observation and measurements, as well as the
development of new methods and approaches for quantification and understanding.
The paper first reviews the author's previously developed weakly nonlocal or
gradient models for elasticity, diffusion and plasticity within a unifying
internal length gradient (ILG) framework. It then proposes a similar extension
for fluids and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. Finally, it ventures a
gradient modification of Newton's law of gravity and examines its implications
to some problems of elementary particle physics, also relevant to cosmology.
Along similar lines, it suggests an analogous extension of London's quantum
mechanical potential to include both an ""attractive"" and a ""repulsive"" branch.
It concludes with some comments on a fractional generalization of the ILG
framework.

obtaining a large, coherent, and properly labeled dataset is a challenging

this paper, we investigate the impact of corrupted ground-truth masks on the
performance of a neural network for a brain tumor segmentation task. Our
findings suggest that a) the performance degrades about 8% less than it could
be expected from simulations, b) a neural network learns the simulated biases
of annotators, c) biases can be partially mitigated by using an

of an image by removing extraneous content from it. Most of the existing image
cropping databases provide only one or several human-annotated bounding boxes
as the groundtruths, which can hardly reflect the non-uniqueness and
flexibility of image cropping in practice. The employed evaluation metrics such
as intersection-over-union cannot reliably reflect the real performance of a
cropping model, either. This work revisits the problem of image cropping, and
presents a grid anchor based formulation by considering the special properties
and requirements (e.g., local redundancy, content preservation, aspect ratio)
of image cropping. Our formulation reduces the searching space of candidate
crops from millions to no more than ninety. Consequently, a grid anchor based
cropping benchmark is constructed, where all crops of each image are annotated
and more reliable evaluation metrics are defined. To meet the practical demands
of robust performance and high efficiency, we also design an effective and
lightweight cropping model. By simultaneously considering the region of
interest and region of discard, and leveraging multi-scale information, our
model can robustly output visually pleasing crops for images of different

features have improved the security to a certain extent, they have the
characteristics of passive authentication and easiness to be stolen. The
existing behavioral data collected based on mobile phone sensors is mainly used
for human activity recognition and fall detection and health management.
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive
model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily
seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have
strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is
robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers
well. Based on the time series behavior data of mobile terminal users, this
paper uses Prophet algorithm to decompose the time series of six kinds of daily
behavior and strip off the singular value, to get the inherent cycle and trend
of each behavior, and to verify the legitimacy of the behavior user at the next
moment. The experimental results on the UniMiB SHAR public dataset show that
the user only needs to do 2 cycles of specified actions to realize the
prediction of the next time series. The main contribution of this paper is that
we propose a new idea for smartphone user authentication. It is based on
real-time data of smartphone user behavior, through Phophet algorithm for
feature decomposition and time series prediction, and to find the inherent
cycle and other characteristics, so as to perform user behavior recognition.
This data-driven auxiliary authentication method can effectively solve the
problem of easy forgery of static feature recognition such as password,

occurrence of spontaneous seizures, which affects about one percent of the

rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent
situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation, we
propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that
effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient
noises. Methods: A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the
pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore,
to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to
automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure
diagnosis procedure. Results: The proposed approach is evaluated over the
Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results
illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art
baselines with low latency. Moreover, the designed attention mechanism is
demonstrated ables to provide fine-grained information for pathological

lines move with the fluid without dissipation. When a metal becomes
superconducting in the presence of a magnetic field, magnetic field lines move
from the interior to the surface (Meissner effect) in a reversible way. This
indicates that a perfectly conducting fluid is flowing outward. We point this
out and show that this fluid carries neither charge nor mass, but carries
$effective$ $mass$. This implies that the effective mass of carriers is lowered
when a system goes from the normal to the superconducting state, which agrees
with the prediction of the unconventional theory of hole superconductivity and
with optical experiments in some superconducting materials. The 60-year old
conventional understanding of the Meissner effect ignores Alfven's theorem and

investigated in the context of general relativity. The exact solutions of
Einstein field equations are obtained with when the source for energy momentum
tensor is generated by a cloud of strings with particles attached to them. The
dynamical and physical properties of the model universe are discussed by
comparing with the present observational findings. The interesting feature
obtained here is that our model universe starts with a big bang and as time
passes both particle density and string tension density decreases with
expansion of our Universe so that in the late time string vanishes and thus
leaving only the particles.

  of the power-Maxwell black holes","11 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.101.064019",,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Employing a new approach toward thermodynamic phase space, we investigate the
phase transition, critical behavior and microscopic structure of higher
dimensional black holes in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background and in the
presence of Power-Maxwell field. In contrast to the usual extended $P-V$ phase
space where the cosmological constant (pressure) is treated as a thermodynamic
variable, we fix the cosmological constant and treat the charge of the black
hole (or more precisely $Q^s$) as a thermodynamic variable. Based on this new
standpoint, we develop the resemblance between higher dimensional nonlinear
black hole and Van der Waals liquid-gas system. We write down the equation of
state as $% Q^s=Q^s(T,\psi)$, where $\psi$ is the conjugate of $Q^s$, and
construct a Smarr relation based on this new phase space as $M=M(S,P,Q^s)$,
while $% s=2p/(2p-1)$ and $p$ is the power parameter of the Power-Maxwell
Lagrangian. We obtain the Gibbs free energy of the system and find a
swallowtail behaviour in Gibbs diagrams, which is a characteristic of
first-order phase transition and express the analogy between our system and van
der Waals fluid-gas system. Moreover, we calculate the critical exponents and
show that they are independent of the model parameters and are the same as
those of Van der Waals system which is predicted by the mean field theory.
Finally , we successfully explain the microscopic behavior of the black hole by
using thermodynamic geometry. We observe a gap in the scalar curvature $R$
occurs between small and large black hole. The maximum amount of the gap
increases as the number of dimensions increases. We finally find that character
of the interaction among the internal constituents of the black hole
thermodynamic system is intrinsically a strong repulsive interaction.

proposed algorithm is both context and sequence aware. We embed user intentions
as weighted nodes in an n-dimensional vector space where each dimension
represents a specific user context factor. Through a neighborhood searching
method followed by a sequence matching algorithm, we search for the most
relevant node to make the prediction. An evaluation of our methodology was done

minerals, enabling living organisms to reach specific functions. In nature,
vaterite and calcite monocrystals typically form self-assembled polycrystal

that alpine plants belonging to the Saxifraga genus can tailor light scattering
channels and utilize multipole interference effect to improve light collection
efficiency via producing CaCO3 polycrystal nanoparticles on the margins of
their leaves. To provide a clear physical background behind this concept, we
study optical properties of artificially synthesized vaterite nanospherulites
and reveal the phenomenon of directional light scattering. Darkfield
spectroscopy measurements are supported by a comprehensive numerical analysis,
accounting for the complex microstructure of particles. We demonstrate the
appearance of generalized Kerker condition, where several higher order
multipoles interfere constructively in the forward direction, governing the
interaction phenomenon. As a result, highly directive forward light scattering
from vaterite nanospherulites is observed in the entire visible range.
Furthermore, ex vivo studies of microstructure and optical properties of leaves
for the alpine plants Saxifraga 'Southside Seedling' and Saxifraga Paniculata
Ria are performed and underlined the importance of Kerker effect for these

tailoring light propagation directly to the photosynthetic tissue with minimal

then also be launched in the cloud, in the same geographic zone and/or in
different zones anywhere else on the planet, and those clients are then subject
to the real-world latencies introduced by planetary-scale cloud communication
interconnections. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of
our simulator, called DBSE, which is based on a previous public-domain
simulator, extended in ways that are partly inspired by the architecture of the
real-world Jane Street Exchange. DBSE relies fundamentally on UDP and TCP
network communications protocols and implements a subset of the FIX de facto
standard protocol for financial information exchange. We show results from an
example in which the exchange server is remotely launched on a cloud facility
located in London (UK), with trader clients running in Ohio (USA) and Sydney
(Australia). We close with discussion of how our simulator could be further
used to study planetary-scale latency arbitrage in financial markets.

train the object detector to produce physically plausible object motion when
