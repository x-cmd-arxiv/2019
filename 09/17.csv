Ising and non-Ising behavior under specific field switching protocols because
of the inclusion of coupled nanomagnets into the unit cell. In the Ising
regime, a magnetic switching mechanism that generates a uni- or bimodal
distribution of states dependent on the alignment of the field is demonstrated
with respect to the lattice unit cell. In addition, a method for generating a
plethora of randomly distributed energy states across the lattice, consisting
of Ising and Landau states, is investigated through magnetic force microscopy
and micromagnetic modeling. We demonstrate that the dispersed energy
distribution across the lattice is a result of the intrinsic design and can be
finely tuned through control of the incident angle of a critical field. The
present manuscript explores a complex frustrated environment beyond the
16-vertex Ising model for the development of novel logic-based technologies.

2018ivc, an unusual Type II supernova that exploded in NGC 1068 (D=10.1 Mpc).
The light curve of SN 2018ivc declines piecewise-linearly, changing slope
frequently, with four clear slope changes in the first 30 days of evolution.
This rapidly changing light curve indicates that interaction between the
circumstellar material and ejecta plays a significant role in the evolution.
Circumstellar interaction is further supported by a strong X-ray detection. The
spectra are rapidly evolving and dominated by hydrogen, helium, and calcium
emission lines. We identify a rare high-velocity emission-line feature
blueshifted at ~7800 km/s (in Ha, Hb, Pb, Pg, HeI, CaII), which is visible from
day 18 until at least day 78 and could be evidence of an asymmetric progenitor
or explosion. From the overall similarity between SN 2018ivc and SN 1996al, the
\Ha{} equivalent width of its parent HII region, and constraints from
pre-explosion archival Hubble Space Telescope images, we find that the
progenitor of SN 2018ivc could be as massive as 52 Msun but is more likely <12
Msun. SN 2018ivc demonstrates the importance of the early discovery and rapid
follow-up observations of nearby supernovae to study the physics and
progenitors of these cosmic explosions.

reduces the coupling of the variables by splitting the system of equations and

pair $\left( P, A\right),$ which is invariant under Sobolev gauge changes and
coincides with the usual notions for regular bundles and connections. This is
based on a regularity result which says any bundle in the critical dimension in

smooth connections on smooth bundles. Finally, we prove that for sequences

varying specificity as part of the clauses, rendering the clauses
multigranular. This makes it easier to configure the TM because the

hyperparameter tuning involved in applying the MTM to new problems. Further, we
demonstrate empirically that the MTM provides similar performance to what is
achieved with a finely specificity-optimized TM, by comparing their performance
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

also known, in other literatures, as $M^\natural$-concave, matroidal and

access to a valuation or demand oracle to find equilibrium.
  We compute market-clearing prices using algorithms that apply existing

these prices then requires solving a novel constrained matching problem. Our
algorithm iteratively simplifies the allocation problem, perturbing bids and

(LLAGNs). Our galaxy sample includes 15 objects with detected 2-10 keV X-ray
emission, dynamical black hole mass estimates from the literature, and
available Gemini/NIFS integral field spectroscopy (IFU) data. We find evidence
for red continuum components at the center of most galaxies, consistent with
the hot dust emission seen in higher luminosity AGN. We decompose the spectral
data cubes into a stellar and continuum component, assuming the continuum
component comes from thermal emission from hot dust. We detect nuclear thermal
emission in 14 out of 15 objects. This emission causes weaker CO absorption
lines and redder continuum ($2.05-2.28\:\mu$m) in our $K$-band data, as
expected from hot dust around an AGN. The NIR emission is clearly correlated
with the 2-10 keV X-ray flux, with a Spearman coefficient of
$r_{spearman}=0.69$ suggesting a $>99\%$ significance of correlation, providing
further evidence of an AGN origin. Our sample has typical X-ray and NIR fluxes
$3-4$ orders of magnitude less luminous than previous work studying the NIR
emission from AGN. We find that the ratio of NIR to X-ray emission increases
towards lower Eddington ratios. The NIR emission in our sample is often
brighter than the X-ray emission, with our $K$-band AGN luminosities comparable
to or greater than the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities in all objects with
Eddington ratios below $0.01\%$. The nature of this LLAGN NIR emission remains
unclear, with one possibility being an increased contribution from jet emission
at these low luminosities. These observations suggest JWST will be a useful
tool for detecting the lowest luminosity AGN.

data over the past few decades, but remain under-explored for point processes.
A first attempt on the notion of point process depth was conducted recently
where the depth was defined as a weighted product of two terms: (1) the
probability of the number of events in each process and (2) the depth of the
event times conditioned on the number of events by using a Mahalanobis depth.
We point out that multivariate depths such as the Mahalanobis depth cannot be
directly used because they often neglect the important ordered property in the
point process events. To deal with this problem, we propose a model-based
approach for point processes systematically. In particular, we develop a
Dirichlet-distribution-based framework on the conditional depth term, where the
new methods are referred to as Dirichlet depths. We examine the mathematical
properties of the new depths and conduct the asymptotic analysis. In addition,
we illustrate the new methods using various simulated and real experiment data.
It is found that the proposed framework provides a proper center-outward rank
and the new methods have superior decoding performance to previous methods in
two neural spike train datasets.

of view, invoking commonplace mathematical tools from general topology and
dynamical systems theory which connect magnetic field evolution to time
reversal invariance, entropy increase and the second law of thermodynamics. We
show that in fact magnetic topology is well-defined only in the phase space
corresponding to a dynamical system governed by the induction equation. Hence
the field's topology and stochasticity can be studied in terms of the
corresponding phase space trajectories rather than the field lines in real
Euclidean space. In fact, our results suggest that magnetic field lines should
not be taken too literally because their existence and uniqueness and more
importantly continuity in time require strong mathematical conditions, hardly
satisfied in astrophysical systems. As for magnetic topology change, it is
shown that the phase space topology is preserved in time for a magnetic field
which, besides satisfying few continuity conditions, solves a time reversal
invariant induction equation. What breaks the time symmetry in the induction
equation is the presence of non-ideal plasma effects at small scales such as
resistivity, which results from random collisions between diffusing electrons
and other particles. The small scale, stochastic disturbances produced thereby
are super-linearly amplified by Richardson diffusion in the turbulent cascade,
which are eventually manifested as large scale reconnection events, somehow
similar to stretching quantum fluctuations during inflation to seed large scale
cosmological structures. This suggests that reconnection is rooted in the
second law of thermodynamics that dictates entropy increase which in turn
breaks the time symmetry.

for NP-hard high-multiplicity problems since the pioneering work of Gilmore and
Gomory [Oper. Res., 1961]. Configuration IPs have a variable for each possible
configuration, which describes a placement of items into a location, and whose
value corresponds to the number of locations with that placement. In high
multiplicity problems items come in types, and are represented succinctly by a
vector of multiplicities; solving the configuration IP then amounts to deciding
whether the input vector of multiplicities of items of each type can be
decomposed into a given number of configurations.
  We make this implicit notion explicit by observing that the set of all input
vectors decomposable into configurations forms a monoid, and solving the
configuration IP is the Monoid Decomposition problem. Motivated by
applications, we enrich this problem in two ways. First, sometimes each
configuration additionally has an objective value, yielding an optimization
problem of finding a ""best"" decomposition under the given objective. Second,
there are often different types of configurations for different types of
locations. The resulting problem is to optimize over decompositions of the
input multiplicity vector into configurations of several types, and we call it
Multitype Integer Monoid Optimization, or MIMO.
  We develop fast exact algorithms for various MIMO with few or many location
types and with various objectives. Our algorithms build on a novel proximity
theorem connecting the solutions of a certain configuration IP to those of its
continuous relaxation. We then cast several fundamental scheduling and bin
packing problems as MIMOs, and thereby obtain new or substantially faster
algorithms for them.
  We complement our positive algorithmic results by hardness results.

evolution equation retaining the Darrieus-Landau (DL) instability, a curvature
effect and a geometric nonlinearity. Here it also keeps forcing by longitudinal
shearflow and wrinkle stretch by transverse flow; both imposed stimuli vary in
time and space as to make the front slope comprise a given fluctuating spatial
harmonics and unknown pole-decomposed pieces. A DL-free Burgers version is
examined in parallel, also with Neumann conditions and symmetry. As is shown
for both models, solving Ntot equations of motion for the poles in principle
yields the front dynamics, the arclength increment V(t) and its time-average
Vav. Yet this could be worked out analytically (or nearly so) only in
high-frequency HF or low-frequency LF limits. These tackle one or two pairs of
poles per cell, then a large number of pairs Ntot forming two piles viewed as
continua, one per crest. Despite ample pole motions that make some commute
between crests, Vav grows in a nearly parabolic way with the combined intensity
of forcing and stretch. LF stimuli and DL instability can induce multiple
branches and relaxation phenomena. Numerical t-averages are needed even if V(t)
is analytically known. For Ntot=1,2 and short wrinkles, or Burgers fronts, Vav
transitions from quadratic to sublinear as the forcing grows ; for longer
wrinkles Vav keeps its MS value at moderate forcing, then bifurcates to an
ultimately sublinear growth that depends on the stimulus phases. For very long
wrinkles, coupled integral equations give analytical slope and pole-density

computation complexity, our approach combines the dimensionality reduction
technique (using an autoencoder) with convex-hull and one-class
support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible
responses in the latent (or the reduced) response space of the EM
nanostructure. We show that by using a small set of training instances

accuracy in assessing the feasibility of a given response. More importantly,
the one-class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility
(or unfeasibility) of a response from a given nanostructure. This important

that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of
our approach, we apply it to two important classes of binary metasurfaces

An asymmetric broad line profile, peaking at 6.67 keV, is possibly due to
Doppler effects and gravitational redshift. The 1.2--79 keV broadband spectrum

in translating low-resourced languages, due to the significant amount of
parallel data that is required to learn useful mappings between languages. In
this work, we show how the so-called multilingual NMT can help to tackle the
challenges associated with low-resourced language translation. The underlying
principle of multilingual NMT is to force the creation of hidden
representations of words in a shared semantic space across multiple languages,
thus enabling a positive parameter transfer across languages. Along this
direction, we present multilingual translation experiments with three languages
(English, Italian, Romanian) covering six translation directions, utilizing
both recurrent neural networks and transformer (or self-attentive) neural
networks. We then focus on the zero-shot translation problem, that is how to
leverage multi-lingual data in order to learn translation directions that are
not covered by the available training material. To this aim, we introduce our
recently proposed iterative self-training method, which incrementally improves
a multilingual NMT on a zero-shot direction by just relying on monolingual
data. Our results on TED talks data show that multilingual NMT outperforms
conventional bilingual NMT, that the transformer NMT outperforms recurrent NMT,
and that zero-shot NMT outperforms conventional pivoting methods and even
matches the performance of a fully-trained bilingual system.

algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required
quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices.
In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of
equations of the form $Ax = b$. We investigate the use of variational
algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of
linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren
plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and
adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To
circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the
classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several
provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of
the linear system on a so-called Ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the Ansatz
tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a
gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear
systems as large as $2^{300} \times 2^{300}$ by considering cases where we can
simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer. These
experiments demonstrate the algorithms' ability to scale to system sizes within
reach in near-term quantum devices of about $100$-$300$ qubits.

factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA
cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC)

Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are
realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are
widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms,

well as particle creation inside the falling cavity, with respect to a comoving
observer. Working in the Lema\^itre chart and assuming a cavity size $L$ much
smaller than the Schwarzschild radius ($L/r_g\ll 1$), we solve the Klein-Gordon
equation for a massless scalar field confined within the cavity in the
reference frame of the comoving observer. We follow Schwinger's proper time
approach, evaluating the one-loop effective action for the field in the falling
cavity hence evaluating the corrections to the vacuum energy. We find a small
reduction in the absolute value of Casimir energy as the cavity approaches the
black hole horizon due to the changing spacetime geometry. Since the spacetime
geometry for the cavity changes dynamically, we further find the energy density
of the created particles due to the dynamical Casimir effect. These dynamical
contributions exactly match the deficit to the static Casimir energy. Combined,
the observer measures a net increase in energy within the cavity as she falls.

gravitational field and fluid equations are invariant under a combination of
time-dependent transformations of the coordinates and fields. This symmetry
allows one to construct a physical adiabatic mode which fixes the
perturbation-theory kernels in the squeezed limit and ensures that the
well-known consistency relations for large-scale structure, originally derived
in general relativity, hold in modified gravity as well. For theories beyond
Horndeski, instead, one generally cannot construct such an adiabatic mode.
Because of this, the perturbation-theory kernels are modified in the squeezed

show, however, that the modification of the squeezed limit depends only on the
linear theory. We investigate the observational consequences of this violation
by computing the matter bispectrum. In the squeezed limit, the largest effect
is expected when considering the cross-correlation between different tracers.
Moreover, the individual contributions to the 1-loop matter power spectrum do
not cancel in the infrared limit of the momentum integral, modifying the power

formed from two massive stars in isolation. For this isolated-binary formation
channel, binaries need to survive two supernova (SN) explosions in addition to
surviving common-envelope evolution. For the SN explosions, both the mass loss
and natal kicks change the orbital characteristics, producing either a bound or
unbound binary. We show that gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced not only
from the core-collapse SN process, but also from the SN mass loss and SN natal
kick during the pre-SN to post-SN binary transition. We model the dynamical
evolution of a binary at the time of the second SN explosion with an equation
of motion that accounts for the finite timescales of the SN mass loss and the
SN natal kick. From the dynamical evolution of the binary, we calculate the GW
burst signals associated with the SN natal kicks. We find that such GW bursts
may be of interest to future mid-band GW detectors like DECIGO. We also find
that the energy radiated away from the GWs emitted due to the SN mass loss and
natal kick may be a significant fraction, ${\gtrsim}10\%$, of the post-SN
binary's orbital energy. For unbound post-SN binaries, the energy radiated away
in GWs tends to be higher than that of bound binaries.

but only for a relatively small fraction of exoplanets are they both available.
Mass is often derived from radial velocity measurements, while the radius is
almost always measured using the transit method. For a large number of
exoplanets, either the radius or the mass is unknown, while the host star has
been characterised. Several mass-radius relations that are dependent on the
planet's type have been published that often allow us to predict the radius.
Our goal is to derive the radius of exoplanets using only observables extracted
from spectra used primarily to determine radial velocities and spectral
parameters. Our objective is to obtain a mass-radius relation independent of
the planet's type. We worked with a database of confirmed exoplanets with known
radii and masses, as well as the planets from our Solar System. Using random
forests, a machine learning algorithm, we computed the radius of exoplanets and
compared the results to the published radii. Our code, Bem, is available
online. The estimated radii reproduces the spread in radius found for high mass
planets better than previous mass-radius relations. The average radius error is
1.8 $R_{\oplus}$ across the whole range of radii from 1-22 $R_{\oplus}$. We
find that a random forest algorithm is able to derive reliable radii,
especially for planets between 4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 20 $R_{\oplus}$ for which the
error is under 25$\%$. The algorithm has a low bias yet a high variance, which
could be reduced by limiting the growth of the forest, or adding more data. The
random forest algorithm is a promising method for deriving exoplanet
properties. We show that the exoplanet's mass and equilibrium temperature are
the relevant properties that constrain the radius, and do so with higher
accuracy than the previous methods.

cusp-to-core transition in the total dark matter profile. The mechanism works
for PBHs in the 25-100 M$_{\sun}$ mass window, consistent with the LIGO

is between 1 and 8 Gyr. This time-scale is also a constant multiple of the

the mass, the mass fraction and the scale radius of the initial density profile

via deep HST imaging in the SSA22 survey area reported in Fletcher et al.
(2019). Using new measures of [OII] emission secured from Keck MOSFIRE spectra
we re-examine, for a larger sample, earlier claims that Lyman continuum

ratio is indeed a necessary condition for Lyman continuum leakage,
strengthening earlier claims made using smaller samples at various redshifts.
However, not all LAEs with large [OIII]/[OII] line ratios are leakers and
leaking radiation appears not to be associated with differences in other
spectral diagnostics. This suggests the detection of leaking radiation is
modulated by an additional property, possibly the viewing angle for porous HII

resolution of few hundred parsecs along the major axis. The rotation curve of
the molecular gas is steeper than the rotation curve of the ionized gas. In the

Using simulations, we investigate the effect of the thickness of the gas disk

extended and thicker disk smooths the curve. We also find that the presence of
a strongly inclined thick disk (>1 kpc) can smooth the rotation curve because
it degrades the spatial resolution along the line of sight. By building a model
using a stellar disk and two gas disks, we reproduce the rotation curves of the
Cosmic Snake with a molecular gas disk that is more massive and more radially
and vertically concentrated than the ionized gas disk. Finally, we also obtain
an intrinsic velocity dispersion in the Cosmic Snake of 18.5+-7 km/s and
19.5+-6 km/s for the molecular and ionized gas, respectively, which is
consistent with a molecular disk with a smaller and thinner disk. For A521, the
intrinsic velocity dispersion values are 11+-8 km/s and 54+-11 km/s, with a
higher value for the ionized gas. This could indicate that the ionized gas disk
is thicker and more turbulent in this galaxy. These results highlight the

the radius where the gas is rotationally-supported, R_circ, i.e. the existence
of the hot mode depends on physical conditions at the galaxy scale rather than
on physical conditions at the halo scale. When allowing for the depletion of
the halo baryon fraction relative to the cosmic mean, the longer cooling times
imply that a virialized gaseous halo may form in halo masses below the
threshold of ~10^12 M_sun derived for baryon-complete halos. We show that for
any halo mass there is a maximum accretion rate for which the gas is virialized
throughout the halo and can accrete via the hot mode of Mdot_crit ~ 0.7(v_c/100

virialized in the outer halo but cool and free-falling near the galaxy. We
compare Mdot_crit to the average star formation rate (SFR) in halos at 0<z<10

ionization rate derived from molecular ions such as H$^+_3$, is at least two to
three orders of magnitudes higher than in the Galactic disk. The other is
bipolar X-ray and radio emission away from the Galactic plane. These features
are consistent with a scenario in which high cosmic ray pressure drives
large-scale winds away from the Galactic plane. The interaction of such a wind
with stellar wind bubbles may explain the energetic nonthermal radio filaments
found throughout the Galactic center. Some of the implications of this scenario
is the removal of gas driven by outflowing winds, acting as a feedback to
reduce the star formation rate in the central molecular zone (CMZ), and the
distortion of azimuthal magnetic field lines in the CMZ to vertical direction
away from the plane. The combined effects of the wind and vertical magnetic
field can explain why most magnetized filaments run perpendicular to the
Galactic plane. This proposed picture suggests our Milky Way nucleus has
recently experienced starburst or black hole activity, as recent radio and

coding for interactive communication. An infinite family of tree codes with
both rate and distance bounded by positive constants is called asymptotically
good. Rate being constant is equivalent to the alphabet size being constant.
Schulman proved that there are asymptotically good tree code families using the
Lovasz local lemma, yet their explicit construction remains an outstanding open
problem. In a major breakthrough, Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman constructed
explicit tree code families with constant distance, but over an alphabet
polylogarithmic in the length. Our main result is a randomized polynomial time
decoding algorithm for these codes making novel use of the polynomial method.
The number of errors corrected scales roughly as the block length to the
three-fourths power, falling short of the constant fraction error correction
guaranteed by the constant distance. We further present number theoretic
variants of Cohen-Haeupler-Schulman codes, all correcting a constant fraction

scattering (DLS) and small angle x-rays scattering (SAXS). Two populations of
aggregates, micelles and fibrils, dominated the time evolution of light
scattering intensity and of effective hydrodynamic diameter. SAXS experiments
allowed to resolve micelles and fibrils so that the time dependence of
scattering profile revealed structural evolution of the two populations. The
low-Q scattering intensity prior to an expected increase with time due to
fibril growth, shows an intriguing rapid decrease which is interpreted as the
release of monomers from micelles. This phenomenon, observed both in the
absence and in the presence of EGCG, indicates that under thermal stress free
native monomers are converted to amyloid-prone monomers that do not form
micelles. The consumption of free native monomers results in a release of
native monomers from micelles, because only native protein participate in
micelle-monomer (quasi-)equilibrium. This release is reversible, indicating
also that native-to-amyloid-prone monomers conversion is reversible as well. We
show that EGCG does not bind to protein in fibrils, neither does it
affect/prevent the pro-amyloid conversion of monomers. EGCG hinders the
addition of monomers to growing fibrils. These facts allowed us to propose
kinetics model for EGCG-controlled amyloid aggregation of micellar proteins.
Therein, we introduced the growth-rate inhibition function which quantitatively

demonstrate how to perform Clifford gates on this class of codes using code
deformation. To this end, we generalize punctures and wormhole defects, the
latter introduced in a companion paper. Together with state injection, we can
perform a universal set of gates within a single block of the class of
hypergraph product codes.

data-driven models for generating samples, particularly images. In this paper,
we formulate the problem of learning an IGM as minimizing the expected distance
between characteristic functions. Specifically, we minimize the distance
between characteristic functions of the real and generated data distributions
under a suitably-chosen weighting distribution. This distance metric, which we
term as the characteristic function distance (CFD), can be (approximately)
computed with linear time-complexity in the number of samples, in contrast with
the quadratic-time Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). By replacing the discrepancy
measure in the critic of a GAN with the CFD, we obtain a model that is simple
to implement and stable to train. The proposed metric enjoys desirable
theoretical properties including continuity and differentiability with respect
to generator parameters, and continuity in the weak topology. We further
propose a variation of the CFD in which the weighting distribution parameters
are also optimized during training; this obviates the need for manual tuning,
and leads to an improvement in test power relative to CFD. We demonstrate
experimentally that our proposed method outperforms WGAN and MMD-GAN variants
on a variety of unsupervised image generation benchmarks.

the system-on-a-chip (SoC) designers no longer design the complete SoC and
manufacture chips on their own. This outsourcing of the design and
manufacturing of Integrated Circuits (ICs) has resulted in several threats,
such as overproduction of ICs, sale of out-of-specification/rejected ICs, and
piracy of Intellectual Properties (IPs). Logic locking has emerged as a
promising defense strategy against these threats. However, various attacks
about the extraction of secret keys have undermined the security of logic
locking techniques. Over the years, researchers have proposed different
techniques to prevent existing attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel
attack that can break any logic locking techniques that rely on the stored
secret key. This proposed TAAL attack is based on implanting a hardware Trojan
in the netlist, which leaks the secret key to an adversary once activated. As
an untrusted foundry can extract the netlist of a design from the layout/mask
information, it is feasible to implement such a hardware Trojan. All three
proposed types of TAAL attacks can be used for extracting secret keys. We have
introduced the models for both the combinational and sequential hardware
Trojans that evade manufacturing tests. An adversary only needs to choose one
hardware Trojan out of a large set of all possible Trojans to launch the TAAL
attack.

topological superconductivity and MZMs in this most widely-studied platform
also requires eliminating spin degeneracy, which is realized by applying a
magnetic field to induce a helical gap. However, the applied field can
adversely impact the induced superconducting state in the NWs and also places
geometric restrictions on the device, which can affect scaling of future
MZM-based quantum registers. These challenges could be circumvented by
integrating magnetic elements with the NWs. With this motivation, in this work
we report the first experimental investigation of spin transport across InSb
NWs, which are enabled by devices with ferromagnetic (FM) contacts. We observe
signatures of spin polarization and spin-dependent transport in the
quasi-one-dimensional ballistic regime. Moreover, we show that electrostatic
gating tunes the observed magnetic signal and also reveals a transport regime
where the device acts as a spin filter. These results open an avenue towards
developing MZM devices in which spin degeneracy is lifted locally, without the
need of an applied magnetic field. They also provide a path for realizing
spin-based devices that leverage spin-orbital states in quantum wires.

approximate binary and CBP orbits; and 2) We allow additional aperiodicities on

estimates of iron meteorites. The details of outside-in solidification and fate
of residual core melt are poorly understood. For a core primarily composed of
Fe and Ni alloyed with lighter constituent elements, like sulfur, such inward
core growth would likely be achieved by growth of solid FeNi dendrites. Growth
of FeNi dendrites results in interconnected pockets of residual melt that
become progressively enriched in sulfur up to a eutectic composition of 31 wt
percent sulfur as FeNi continues to solidify. Here we show that regions of
residual sulfur-enriched FeNi melt in the core attain sufficient excess
pressures to propagate via dikes into the mantle. Thus, core material will
intrude into the overlying rocky mantle or possibly even erupt onto the
plantesimals surface. We refer to these processes collectively as
ferrovolcanism. Our calculation show that ferrovolcanic surface eruptions are
more likely on bodies with mantles less than 50 km thick. We show that
intrusive ferromagmatism can produce pallasites, an enigmatic class of

measurement from the carina to the most distal point of an individual airway
visible on CT. We show the applicability of using tapering measurements on
clinically acquired data by quantifying the reproducibility of the tapering
measure. Methods: We generate a spline from the centreline of an airway to
measure the area and arclength at contiguous intervals. The tapering
measurement is the gradient of the linear regression between area in log space
and arclength. The reproducibility of the measure was assessed by analysing
different radiation doses, voxel sizes and reconstruction kernel on single
timepoint and longitudinal CT scans and by evaluating the effct of airway
bifurcations. Results: Using 74 airways from 10 CT scans, we show a statistical
difference, p = 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ in tapering between healthy airways (n =
35) and those affected by bronchiectasis (n = 39). The difference between the
mean of the two populations was 0.011mm$^{-1}$ and the difference between the
medians of the two populations was 0.006mm$^{-1}$. The tapering measurement
retained a 95\% confidence interval of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ in a simulated 25
mAs scan and retained a 95% confidence of $\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ on simulated CTs
up to 1.5 times the original voxel size. Conclusion: We have established an
estimate of the precision of the tapering measurement and estimated the effect
on precision of simulated voxel size and CT scan dose. We recommend that the
scanner calibration be undertaken with the phantoms as described, on the
specific CT scanner, radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm that is to be

optical absorption feature. Their appearance is linked to the gravitational
stability of spiral disks; the fraction of edge-on galaxies that displays a
dust lane is a direct indicator of the typical vertical balance between gravity
and turbulence; a balance struck between the energy input from star-formation
and the gravitational pull into the plane of the disk.
  Based on morphological classifications by the Galaxy~Zoo project on the
Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) imaging data in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
fields, we explore the relation of dust lanes to the galaxy characteristics,
most of which were determined using the {\sc magphys} spectral energy
distribution fitting tool: stellar mass, total and specific star-formation
rates, and several parameters describing the cold dust component.
  We find that the fraction of dust lanes does depend on the stellar mass of
the galaxy; they start to appear at $M^* \sim 10^9 M_\odot$. A dust lane also
implies strongly a dust mass of at least $10^5 M_\odot$, but otherwise does not
correlate with cold dust mass parameters of the {\sc magphys} spectral energy
distribution analysis, nor is there a link with star-formation rate, specific
or total. Dust lane identification does not depend on disk ellipticity (disk
thickness) or Sersic profile but correlates with bulge morphology; a round
bulge favors dust lane votes.
  The central component along the line of sight that produces the dust lane is
not associated with either one of the components fit by {\sc magphys}, the cold
diffuse component or the localized, heated component in HII regions, but a mix
of these two.

them. While many individual genes, such as APP for Alzheimer disease and HTT
for Huntington disease, and biological pathways are studied for
neurodegenerative diseases, system-wide pathogenesis studies are limited. In
this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of RNA-Seq studies for three
neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to minimize the batch effect derived
differences and identify the similarly altered factors among studies. Our main
assumption is that these three diseases share some pathological pathway
pattern. For this purpose, we downloaded publicly available Alzheimer's disease

significantly differentially expressed genes common to these studies were first
identified and analyzed for the patterns in their pathways and variations. Our
meta-analysis revealed the shared nature of differential gene expression and
mutation load of the cellular heat stress response and GABA synthesis in
neurodegenerative diseases. The downregulated GABA synthesis-related genes
(e.g. GAD1 and GAD2) and the upregulated cellular heat stress response-related

X-ray sources and sub-femtosecond longitudinal diagnostics. Multicycle
THz-radiation can be generated by shooting an appropriate laser through a
periodically poled nonlinear crystal, e.g. lithium niobate (PPLN).
Unfortunately, the manufacturing processes of PPLNs require substantially
strong electric fields $\mathcal{O}(10~kV/mm)$ across the crystal width to
locally reverse the polarization domains; this limits the crystal apertures to
below 1 cm. Damage threshold limitations of lithium niobate thereby limits the
laser power which can be shone onto the crystal, which inherently limits the
production of high-power THz pulses. Here we show that in the THz regime, a
PPLN crystal can be mechanically constructed in-air by stacking lithium niobate
wafers together with 180$^{\circ}$ rotations to each other. The relatively long
(mm) wavelengths of the generated THz radiation compared to the small gaps
($\sim$10 $\mu$m) between wafers supports a near-ideal THz transmission between
wafers. We demonstrate the concept using a Joule-class laser system with
$\sim$50 mm diameter wafers and measure up to 1.3 mJ of THz radiation
corresponding to a peak power of $\sim$35 MW, a 50 times increase in THz power
compared to previous demonstrations. Our results indicate that high-power THz
radiation can be produced with existing and future high-power lasers in a

anatomic compartments called lobes. Accurate and automatic segmentation of

importance for lung disease assessment and treatment planning. However, this
task is challenging due to ambiguous lobar boundaries, anatomical variations
and pathological deformations. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution and
efficient 3D fully convolutional network to automatically segment the lobes. We
refer to the network as Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation Network (PLS-Net), which is
designed to efficiently exploit 3D spatial and contextual information from
high-resolution volumetric CT images for effective volume-to-volume learning
and inference. The PLS-Net is based on an asymmetric encoder-decoder
architecture with three novel components: (i) 3D depthwise separable
convolutions to improve the network efficiency by factorising each regular 3D
convolution into two simpler operations; (ii) dilated residual dense blocks to
efficiently expand the receptive field of the network and aggregate multi-scale
contextual information for segmentation; and (iii) input reinforcement at each
downsampled resolution to compensate for the loss of spatial information due to
convolutional and downsampling operations. We evaluated the proposed PLS-Net on
a multi-institutional dataset that consists of 210 CT images acquired from
patients with a wide range of lung abnormalities. Experimental results show
that our PLS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with better
computational efficiency. Further experiments confirm the effectiveness of each
novel component of the PLS-Net.

designs a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility
functions (ASU-DNN) by using prior behavioral knowledge. Unlike a fully
connected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by
using the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only
k's own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can dramatically reduce the
estimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser
connectivity. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2-3% higher prediction accuracy than
F-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset that we
collected in Singapore and a public dataset in R mlogit package. The
alternative-specific connectivity constraint, as a domain-knowledge-based
regularization method, is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose
explicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters.
ASU-DNN is also more interpretable because it provides a more regular
substitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does. The comparison
between ASU-DNN and F-DNN can also aid in testing the behavioral knowledge. Our
results reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an
alternative's own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice

recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons with randomly chosen weights.
So far only the weights of a linear readout were adapted for a specific task.
We wondered whether the performance of liquid state machines can be improved if
the recurrent weights are chosen with a purpose, rather than randomly. After
all, weights of recurrent connections in the brain are also not assumed to be
randomly chosen. Rather, these weights were probably optimized during
evolution, development, and prior learning experiences for specific task
domains. In order to examine the benefits of choosing recurrent weights within
a liquid with a purpose, we applied the Learning-to-Learn (L2L) paradigm to our
model: We optimized the weights of the recurrent connections -- and hence the
dynamics of the liquid state machine -- for a large family of potential
learning tasks, which the network might have to learn later through
modification of the weights of readout neurons. We found that this two-tiered
process substantially improves the learning speed of liquid state machines for
specific tasks. In fact, this learning speed increases further if one does not
train the weights of linear readouts at all, and relies instead on the internal
dynamics and fading memory of the network for remembering salient information
that it could extract from preceding examples for the current learning task.
This second type of learning has recently been proposed to underlie fast
learning in the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex, and hence it is of interest
to explore its performance also in models. Since liquid state machines share
many properties with other types of reservoirs, our results raise the question
whether L2L conveys similar benefits also to these other reservoirs.

examples that are often indistinguishable from the original inputs. These
adversarial examples are created by applying adversarial perturbations to input
samples, which would cause them to be misclassified by the target models.
Attacks that search and apply the perturbations to create adversarial examples
are performed in both white-box and black-box settings, depending on the
information available to the attacker about the target. For black-box attacks,
the only capability available to the attacker is the ability to query the
target with specially crafted inputs and observing the labels returned by the
model. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, requires a high
number of queries, or produce adversarial examples that are easily
distinguishable from their sources. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, a
black-box attack that uses fewer queries to create adversarial examples with
high success rates. AdversarialPSO is based on the evolutionary search
algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization, a populationbased gradient-free
optimization algorithm. It is flexible in balancing the number of queries
submitted to the target vs the quality of imperceptible adversarial examples.
The attack has been evaluated using the image classification benchmark datasets
CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Imagenet, achieving success rates of 99.6%, 96.3%, and
82.0%, respectively, while submitting substantially fewer queries than the
state-of-the-art. We also present a black-box method for isolating salient
features used by models when making classifications. This method, called Swarms
with Individual Search Spaces or SWISS, creates adversarial examples by finding
and modifying the most important features in the input.

so as to minimize the convex potential induced by a source while avoiding

the potential are available, i.e., without gradient information. To do so, it
construct an artificial potential over which an exact gradient dynamics would
generate a collision-free trajectory to the target in a world with convex
obstacles. Then, leveraging extremum seeking control loops, it minimizes this
artificial potential to navigate smoothly to the source location. We prove that
the proposed solution not only finds the source, but does so while avoiding any

In these studies the outer perturbations have been identified and classified
like tidal tails, stellar streams, and shells. These structures are tracers of
interacting and merging events and they keep a memory of the mass assembly of
galaxies. Cosmological numerical simulations are needed to estimate their
visibility time-scale (among other properties) in order to reconstruct the past
merger history of galaxies. In the present work, we analyze a hydrodynamical
cosmological simulation to build a comprehensive interpretation of the
properties of fine structures. We make a census of several types of LSB fine
structures by visual inspection of individual snapshots at various time. We
reconstruct the evolution of the number of fine structures detected around an
early-type galaxy and we compare with the merger history of the galaxy. We find
that most of fine structures are associated with major and intermediate mass
merger events. Their survival time scale ranges between 0.7 and 4 Gyr. Shells
and streams remain visible for a longer time than tidal tails. These estimates
of survival times provide clues to interpret the shape and frequency of fine
structures observed in deep images in terms of mass assembly. We find that the
detectability of stellar streams is the most sensitive to the surface
brightness limit. We see 2-3 times more streams with a surface brightness cut
of 33 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ than with 29 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The detection of shells
display a strong dependence on the projection angle.

the folding of proteins and RNA molecules that are kinetically trapped in
misfolded states for long times. Unassisted folding occurs by the kinetic
partitioning mechanism according to which folding to the native state, with low
probability as well as misfolding to one of the many metastable states, with
high probability, occur rapidly on similar time scales. GroEL is an all-purpose
stochastic machine that assists misfolded substrate proteins (SPs) to fold. The
RNA chaperones (CYT-19) help the folding of ribozymes that readily misfold.
GroEL does not interact with the folded proteins but CYT-19 disrupts both the
folded and misfolded ribozymes. Despite this major difference, the Iterative
Annealing Mechanism (IAM) quantitatively explains all the available
experimental data for assisted folding of proteins and ribozymes. Driven by ATP
binding and hydrolysis and GroES binding, GroEL undergoes a catalytic cycle
during which it samples three allosteric states, referred to as T (apo), R (ATP
bound), and R'' (ADP bound). In accord with the IAM predictions, analyses of
the experimental data shows that the efficiency of the GroEL-GroES machinery
and mutants is determined by the resetting rate $k_{R''\rightarrow T}$, which
is largest for the wild type GroEL. Generalized IAM accurately predicts the
folding kinetics of Tetrahymena ribozyme and its variants. Chaperones maximize
the product of the folding rate and the steady state native state fold by
driving the substrates out of equilibrium. Neither the absolute yield nor the
folding rate is optimized.

first courses in calculus and probability. In particular, one of the main
objectives here is to aid researchers who are interested in applying Benford's
law, and need to understand general principles clarifying when to expect the
appearance of Benford's law in real-life data and when not to expect it. A
second main target audience is students of statistics or mathematics, at all
levels, who are curious about the mathematics underlying this surprising and
robust phenomenon, and may wish to delve more deeply into the subject. This
survey of the fundamental principles behind Benford's law includes many basic
examples and theorems, but does not include the proofs or the most general
statements of the theorems; rather it provides precise references where both
may be found.

standard reinforcement learning algorithms at scale, we find that agents create
a self-supervised autocurriculum inducing multiple distinct rounds of emergent
strategy, many of which require sophisticated tool use and coordination. We
find clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our
environment, each of which creates a new pressure for the opposing team to
adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable
boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome
obstacles using ramps. We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition
may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior
that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised
reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we
propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted
capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation
and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific intelligence
tests.

operating voltage, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) have found widespread
application in many fields, including medical imaging, particle physics, and
high-energy astrophysics. However, the so-called optical crosstalk (OCT)
phenomenon of SiPMs is a major drawback to their adoption. Secondary infrared
photons are emitted inside the silicon substrate spontaneously after the
avalanche process caused by the primary incident photons, and they can be
detected by the surrounding photodiodes. As a result large output pulses that
are equivalent to multiple photoelectrons are observed with a certain
probability (OCT rate), even for single-photon events, making the charge
resolution worse and increasing the rate of accidental triggers by
single-photon events in applications such as atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
In our previous study, we found that the OCT rates of single-channel SiPMs was
dependent on the thickness of their protection resin window, which may be
explained by photon propagation inside the resin. In the present study, we
measured the OCT rate of a multichannel SiPM and those of neighboring channels
caused by photon propagation. Both OCT rates were found to be dependent on the
protection-window thickness. We report our OCT measurements of a multichannel
SiPM and comparisons with a ray-tracing simulation.

vortex atomic form factor is expressed in a unified spherical basis and
implemented in a MatLab code that numerically evaluates it using globally
adaptive quadrature. The results of this code show the influence of variation
in the photon wavelength, Rayleigh range, and scattering angle on differential
reaction cross sections and the twist factor, which measures the impact of
introducing orbital angular momentum. The recently suggested double mirror
effect that accounts for a non-zero effect in the forward direction for twisted
photon interactions is numerically confirmed. Finally, it is shown that
differential reaction cross sections are greatly amplified when the Rayleigh
range and photon wavelength are brought close to the scale of an atom.
Experimental considerations and applications are briefly discussed, including
quantum information, in which the scattering of twisted photons on atomic
targets can be used to transfer information between light and matter.

datasets may lead to the generation of inappropriate, biased, or offensive
text. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could
potentially address these issues, for example by allowing a dialog model to
optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However, previous approaches
which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making
it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term
conversational rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
hierarchical reinforcement learning, VHRL, which uses policy gradients to tune
the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This
hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term,
conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of
human-centered conversation metrics, and show that our approach provides
significant improvements -- in terms of both human evaluation and automatic
metrics -- over state-of-the-art dialog models, including Transformers.

formation of the bar triggers the gas funnelling into the central sub-kpc
region and leads to the formation of a kinematically cold nuclear stellar disc
(NSD). We demonstrate that this mechanism can be used to identify the formation
epoch of the Galactic bar, using an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of an
isolated Milky Way-like galaxy. As shown in many previous literature, our
simulation shows that the bar formation triggers an intense star formation for
~1 Gyr in the central region, and forms a NSD. As a result, the oldest age
limit of the NSD is relatively sharp, and the oldest population becomes similar
to the age of the bar. Therefore, the age distribution of the NSD tells us the
formation epoch of the bar. We discuss that a major challenge in measuring the
age distribution of the NSD in the Milky Way is contamination from other
non-negligible stellar components in the central region, such as a classical
bulge component. We demonstrate that because the NSD is kinematically colder
than the other stellar populations in the Galactic central region, the NSD
population can be kinematically distinguished from the other stellar
populations, if the 3D velocity of tracer stars are accurately measured. Hence,
in addition to the line-of-sight velocities from spectroscopic surveys, the
accurate measurements of the transverse velocities of stars are necessary, and
hence the near-infrared space astrometry mission, JASMINE, would play a crutial
role to identify the formation epoch of the Galactic bar. We also discuss that
the accuracy of stellar age estimation is also crucial to measure the oldest
limit of the NSD stellar population.

medium income countries; it is generally defined as a slower rate of growth
compared to a reference healthy population of the same age and gender. As
faltering is closely associated with reduced physical, intellectual and
economic productivity potential, it is important to identify faltered children
and be able to characterise different growth patterns so that targeted
treatments can be designed and administered. We introduce a multiclass
classification model for growth trajectory that flexibly extends a current
classification approach called the broken stick model, which is a piecewise
linear model with breaks at fixed knot locations. Heterogeneity in growth
patterns among children is captured using mixture distributed random effects,
whereby the mixture components determine the classification of children into
subgroups. The mixture distribution is modelled using a Dirichlet process
prior, which avoids the need to choose the ""true"" number of mixture components,
and allows this to be driven by the complexity of the data. Because children
have individual differences in the onset of growth stages, we introduce
child-specific random change points. Simulation results show that the random
change point model outperforms the broken stick model because it has fewer
restrictions on knot locations. We illustrate our model on a longitudinal birth
cohort from the Healthy Birth, Growth and Development knowledge integration
project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Analysis reveals 9
subgroups of children within the population which exhibit varying faltering
trends between birth and age one.

vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is
studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide
communications and illumination to service ground users. Ambient illumination
increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination
threshold of the UAVs. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination
distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem
is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total
transmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of
users. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning
framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed. Using GRUs, the UAVs can
model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future
illumination distribution. In order to reduce the complexity of the prediction
algorithm while accurately predicting the illumination distribution, a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is used to fit the illumination distribution of the target
area at each time slot. Based on the predicted illumination distribution, the
optimization problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem that can be
solved by using duality. Simulations using real data from the Earth
observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can
achieve up to 22.1% reduction in transmit power compared to a conventional
optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution.
The results also show that UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination,
thus providing useful guidelines on the deployment of VLC-enabled UAVs.

radiation force and the vertical component of the gravity of the black hole

will decrease with the disk height if the disk thickness is above a critical
value, which implies that gas at the disk surface may be driven into outflows
by radiation force when the disk thickness surpasses the critical value. In
this work, we derive a global solution to a slim disk with radiation-driven
outflows. We find that the outflows are driven from the disk surface if the
mass accretion rate $\dot{m} \gtrsim 1.78-1.91$ ($\dot{m}=\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd}$, and $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}=L_{\rm Edd}/0.1c^2$) depending on BH mass, while
the outflows are suppressed when the mass accretion rate is lower than this
critical value. The mass accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius in the
disk with outflows, and the rate of the gas swallowed by the BH is always
limited to $\dot{m}_{\rm in}\sim 1.78-1.91$ even if the mass accretion rate at
the outer edge of the disk is very high. This may set constraints on the
massive BH growth through accretion in the early Universe. Due to the presence
of outflows, there is an upper limit on the radiation flux of the disk, which
leads to saturation of the continuum spectra of the disk with outflows at the
high energy band. This may be tested by the observations of quasars or/and BH
X-ray binaries.

composition, Mars has a systematic depletion in moderately volatile lithophile
elements as a function of their condensation temperatures. Given this finding,
we constrain the abundances of siderophile and chalcophile elements in the bulk

strong radiation will power a massive wind that is optically thick and nearly
spherical, and will occult the central hard X-rays from irradiating the outer
disk. Instead, thermal emission from the wind will act as a new source of
irradiation. Here, we construct a self-irradiation model, in which the inner
disk (within the wind photosphere) is completely blocked by the wind, the
middle part (between the wind photosphere and scattersphere) is heated by the
wind directly, and the outer disk (beyond the wind scattersphere) is heated by
photons leaving the scattersphere. The model can adequately fit the UV/optical
SED of NGC 247 X-1, a candidate source with supercritical accretion, while the
standard irradiation model fails to produce a self-consistent result. The
best-fit parameters suggest that the source contains a stellar mass black hole

UV/optical fitting predicts a wind photosphere that is well consistent with
X-ray measurements, although it is an extrapolation over 3 orders of magnitude

6 DoF pose and dimensions of objects of interest. Using stereo cameras to solve
this task is a cost-effective alternative to the widely used LiDAR sensor. The
current state-of-the-art for stereo 3D object detection takes the existing
PSMNet stereo matching network, with no modifications, and converts the
estimated disparities into a 3D point cloud, and feeds this point cloud into a
LiDAR-based 3D object detector. The issue with existing stereo matching
networks is that they are designed for disparity estimation, not 3D object
detection; the shape and accuracy of object point clouds are not the focus.
Stereo matching networks commonly suffer from inaccurate depth estimates at
object boundaries, which we define as streaking, because background and
foreground points are jointly estimated. Existing networks also penalize
disparity instead of the estimated position of object point clouds in their
loss functions. We propose a novel 2D box association and object-centric stereo
matching method that only estimates the disparities of the objects of interest
to address these two issues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on
the KITTI 3D and BEV benchmarks.

Therefore, it is crucial for robots to perceive object affordances by reasoning
about physical interactions with the object. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to provide robots with an ability to imagine object affordances using
physical simulations. The class of chair is chosen here as an initial category
of objects to illustrate a more general paradigm. In our method, the robot
""imagines"" the affordance of an arbitrarily oriented object as a chair by
simulating a physical sitting interaction between an articulated human body and
the object. This object affordance reasoning is used as a cue for object
classification (chair vs non-chair). Moreover, if an object is classified as a
chair, the affordance reasoning can also predict the upright pose of the object
which allows the sitting interaction to take place. We call this type of poses
the functional pose. We demonstrate our method in chair classification on
synthetic 3D CAD models. Although our method uses only 30 models for training,
it outperforms appearance-based deep learning methods, which require a large
amount of training data, when the upright orientation is not assumed to be
known a priori. In addition, we showcase that the functional pose predictions
of our method align well with human judgments on both synthetic models and real

amplitude of the QSW in winter stratospheric temperatures is an indicator that
strong disturbances to the polar vortex are likely to occur, and may lead to
large reductions in both the area of the Antarctic ozone hole area and the
overall amount of stratospheric ozone that is depleted. In the sudden
stratospheric warming (SSW) preconditions in 2019, the maximum QSW amplitude
over Antarctica in August was approximately 12 K, which was only 2 K less than
conditions prior to the unprecedented major Antarctic SSW in 2002. Under these
conditions, the Antarctic SSW in 2019 has the potential to become a major SSW.
The additional factors disturbing the Antarctic stratosphere in 2019 was
anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central tropical
Pacific Ocean and western Indian Ocean, and the descending easterly phase of
the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. The combination of these factors - the large

and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have become a common method for analysing
the spatio-temporal coherence of dynamical systems. In particular, these
techniques are of interest for liquid injection systems due to the inherent
complexity of multiphase interactions and extracting the underlying flow
processes is desired. Although numerous works investigating flow processes have
implemented POD and DMD, the results are often highly interpretive with limited
link between the decomposition theory and the interpreted physical meaning of
the extracted modes. Here, we provide insight into the interpretation of POD
and DMD modes in a hierarchical structure. The interpretation of modes for
simple canonical systems is validated through knowledge of the underlying
processes which dominate the systems. We show that modes which capture true
underlying phenomena produce subsequent modes at higher harmonics, up until the
Nyquist limit, whose modal structure scales decrease proportionally with
increasing modal frequency. These higher harmonics primarily encode motion
information and may or may not capture additional structural information, which
is dependent on the system. We demonstrate these findings first on canonical
liquid injection systems to enhance the interpretation and understanding of
results extracted from practical jet in crossflow systems.

Algorithms that can

algorithms now exist for predicting missing links, given a partially observed

how link predictability varies across methods and networks from different
domains, and how close to optimality current methods are. We answer these
questions by systematically evaluating 203 individual link predictor
algorithms, representing three popular families of methods, applied to a large
corpus of 548 structurally diverse networks from six scientific domains. We
first show that individual algorithms exhibit a broad diversity of prediction
errors, such that no one predictor or family is best, or worst, across all
realistic inputs. We then exploit this diversity via meta-learning to construct
a series of ""stacked"" models that combine predictors into a single algorithm.
Applied to a broad range of synthetic networks, for which we may analytically
calculate optimal performance, these stacked models achieve optimal or nearly
optimal levels of accuracy. Applied to real-world networks, stacked models are
also superior, but their accuracy varies strongly by domain, suggesting that
link prediction may be fundamentally easier in social networks than in
biological or technological networks. These results indicate that the
state-of-the-art for link prediction comes from combining individual
algorithms, which achieves nearly optimal predictions. We close with a brief

accretion of interstellar matter onto a super-massive black hole (SMBH)
therein. Most of the observed energy is released in an accretion disk of
inspiralling gas surrounding the SMBH. An enormous amount of fueling material
is expected to be transported inwards. However, basic questions remain
unanswered as to whether and how the accretion disks are supplied with external
gas, since no disk-feeding inflow has hitherto been observed clearly. Here we
report the discovery of highly redshifted broad absorption lines arising from
neutral hydrogen and helium atoms in a small sample of quasars. Their
absorption troughs show a broad range of Doppler velocities from zero extending
continuously inward up to as high as $\sim 5,000$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus see
through streams of cold gas moving with a radially inward velocity component
that spans an immense gradient---a result of gravitational acceleration by the
central SMBH. Extensive photo-ionization modeling for the archetypical object
SDSS J103516.20+142200.6 indicates the inflowing gas to be dense, thick and
moderately ionized, with a characteristic distance to the SMBH of $\sim 1,000$
gravitational radii, possibly overlapping or close to the outer accretion disk.
Our results present the first compelling evidence for the long-sought inflow
directly feeding quasars' accretion disks with external materials, likely
originating from the dusty torus at a parsec scale. Our approach provides a new
tool to probe the bulk of the so far elusive fueling inflows in quasars. Their
studies may help address some of the fundamental questions concerning accretion
physics, the onset and sustainment of quasar activity, and the SMBH growth at
centers of most galaxies.

degrade routing performance. To cope with the reduced availability time and
unstable communications among nodes, data aggregation and transmission
approaches in such networks are designed more intelligently. In this paper, a
distributed method is proposed so as to set child balance among nodes. In this
method, the height of network graph is increased through restricting the

data aggregation approach -named as LA-RPL- is proposed for RPL networks. More
specifically, each node is equipped with a learning automata in order to
perform data aggregation and transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed approach outperforms previously suggested base approaches in terms
of energy consumption, network control overhead, and packet loss rate.

complex road scenes such as S-shaped road and unstructured scenes such as

derived methods, are flexible in generating paths for these complex road

Along with the convergence analysis, we provide recommended step size values
for SENSE and SPIRiT reconstructions to obtain fast and promising

to using backtracking and power iteration to determine the step size, our
recommended step size achieves more than five times acceleration in

finite-dimensional representations of $U_q(sl_N)$ is uniquely determined by
eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum $\cal{R}$-matrices. If this hypothesis
turns out to be true, then it will significantly simplify the computation of
Racah matrices. Also due to this hypothesis various interesting properties of
colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials will be proved. In addition, it allows one to
discover new symmetries of the quantum 6-j symbols, about which almost nothing
is known for $N>2$, with the exception of the tetrahedral symmetries, complex
conjugation and transformation $q \longleftrightarrow q^{-1}$.
  In this paper we prove the eigenvalue hypothesis in $U_q(sl_2)$ case and show
that it is equivalent to 6-j symbol symmetries (the Regge symmetry and two
argument permutations). Then we apply the eigenvalue hypothesis to inclusive
Racah matrices with 3 symmetric incoming representations of $U_q(sl_N)$ and an
arbitrary outcoming one. It gives us 8 new additional symmetries that are not
tetrahedral ones. Finally, we apply the eigenvalue hypothesis to exclusive
Racah matrices with symmetric representations and obtain 4 tetrahedral

  Crowd Counting","ACM Multimedia 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tremendous variation in the scale of people/head size is a critical problem
for crowd counting. To improve the scale invariance of feature representation,
recent works extensively employ Convolutional Neural Networks with multi-column
structures to handle different scales and resolutions. However, due to the
substantial redundant parameters in columns, existing multi-column networks
invariably exhibit almost the same scale features in different columns, which
severely affects counting accuracy and leads to overfitting. In this paper, we
attack this problem by proposing a novel Multi-column Mutual Learning (McML)
strategy. It has two main innovations: 1) A statistical network is incorporated
into the multi-column framework to estimate the mutual information between
columns, which can approximately indicate the scale correlation between
features from different columns. By minimizing the mutual information, each
column is guided to learn features with different image scales. 2) We devise a
mutual learning scheme that can alternately optimize each column while keeping
the other columns fixed on each mini-batch training data. With such
asynchronous parameter update process, each column is inclined to learn
different feature representation from others, which can efficiently reduce the
parameter redundancy and improve generalization ability. More remarkably, McML
can be applied to all existing multi-column networks and is end-to-end
trainable. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that McML
can significantly improve the original multi-column networks and outperform the
other state-of-the-art approaches.

Comprehensive analysis of the SdH oscillations measured for the different
orientations of magnetic field relative to the quantum well plane and
crystallographic exes allows us to investigate the anisotropy of the Zeeman
effect. For the QWs with inverted spectrum, it has been shown that the ratio of
the spin splitting to the orbital one is strongly dependent not only on the
orientation of the magnetic field relative to the QW plane but also on the
orientation of the in-plane magnetic field component relative to
crystallographic axes laying in the QW plane that implies the strong anisotropy
of in-plane g-factor. In the QW with normal spectrum, this ratio strongly
depends on the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the QW plane
and reveals a very slight anisotropy in the QW plane. To interpret the data,
the Landau levels in the tilted magnetic field are calculated within the

synthesizing virtual unseen visual features, GAN-based methods convert the
challenging ZSL task into a supervised learning problem. However, GAN-based ZSL
methods have to train the generator on the seen categories and further apply it
to unseen instances. An inevitable issue of such a paradigm is that the
synthesized unseen features are prone to seen references and incapable to
reflect the novelty and diversity of real unseen instances. In a nutshell, the
synthesized features are confusing. One cannot tell unseen categories from seen
ones using the synthesized features. As a result, the synthesized features are
too subtle to be classified in generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) which
involves both seen and unseen categories at the test stage. In this paper, we

where the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain have distinctive
data distributions. Recently, adversarial training have been successfully
applied to domain adaptation and achieved state-of-the-art performance.
However, there is still a fatal weakness existing in current adversarial models
which is raised from the equilibrium challenge of adversarial training.
Specifically, although most of existing methods are able to confuse the domain
discriminator, they cannot guarantee that the source domain and target domain
are sufficiently similar. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named {\it
cycle-consistent conditional adversarial transfer networks} (3CATN) to handle
this issue. Our approach takes care of the domain alignment by leveraging
adversarial training. Specifically, we condition the adversarial networks with
the cross-covariance of learned features and classifier predictions to capture
the multimodal structures of data distributions. However, since the classifier
predictions are not certainty information, a strong condition with the
predictions is risky when the predictions are not accurate. We, therefore,
further propose that the truly domain-invariant features should be able to be
translated from one domain to the other. To this end, we introduce two feature
translation losses and one cycle-consistent loss into the conditional
adversarial domain adaptation networks. Extensive experiments on both classical

for combinatorial optimization with a gate-based quantum computer. The QAOA
consists of a particular ansatz for the quantum circuit architecture, together
with a prescription for choosing the variational parameters of the circuit. We
propose modifications to both. First, we define the Gibbs objective function
and show that it is superior to the energy expectation value for use as an
objective function in tuning the variational parameters. Second, we describe an
Ansatz Architecture Search (AAS) algorithm for searching the discrete space of
quantum circuit architectures near the QAOA to find a better ansatz. Applying
these modifications for a complete graph Ising model results in a $244.7\%$
median relative improvement in the probability of finding a low-energy state
while using $33.3\%$ fewer two-qubit gates. For Ising models on a 2d grid we
similarly find $44.4\%$ median improvement in the probability with a $20.8\%$
reduction in the number of two-qubit gates. This opens a new research field of
quantum circuit architecture design for quantum optimization algorithms.

via an improved kernel predicting network that performs kernel normalization
and applies the bias prior to the dynamic convolution. To enrich our data for

\tilde{p}(x)/Z_{p}$ using a proposal $q(x)$, s.t. $Mq(x) \geq \tilde{p}(x),

$D_\infty(p||q)$ equals $\log M(\theta)$ where $M(\theta)$ is the optimal value
of the RS constant for a given proposal $q_\theta(x)$. This enables us to
develop a \emph{two-stage} hybrid inference algorithm. Stage-1 performs RDVI to
learn $q_\theta$ by minimizing an estimator of $D_\alpha(p||q)$, and uses the

an example of performing the Steane code error correction on two current

that it is feasible to produce the $\phi (2170)$ via kaon beam scattering at

1.5 Gyr old. The situation is less extreme for Uranus and Neptune, whose cores
are only partially melted.
  To model Jupiter, the time evolution of the interior structure of the giant
planets and exoplanets in general, their luminosity, and the evolution of the
tidal effects over their lifetimes, the core should be considered as
crystallizing and growing rather than gradually mixing into the envelope due to
the solubility of its components.

propose a simple algorithm that is universally fair in the sense that it
returns allocations that have good approximation guarantees with respect to
four such fairness notions at once. In particular, this is the first algorithm
achieving a $(\phi-1)$-approximation of envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) and
a $\frac{2}{\phi +2}$-approximation of groupwise maximin share fairness (GMMS),
where $\phi$ is the golden ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$). The best known

The rotating wave approximation is applied and the conditions for its validity

vehicles in dynamic environments, the autonomous driving system may fail to
find a reasonable policy or even gets trapped in some situation due to the
complexity of global tasks and the incompatibility between upper-level maneuver
decisions with the low-level lower level trajectory planning. To solve this
problem, this paper presents a synchronous maneuver searching and trajectory
planning (SMSTP) algorithm based on the topological concept of homotopy.
Firstly, a set of alternative maneuvers with boundary limits are enumerated on
a multi-lane road. Instead of sampling numerous paths in the whole
spatio-temporal space, we, for the first time, propose using Trajectory
Profiles (TPs) to quickly construct the topological maneuvers represented by
different routes, and put forward a corridor generation algorithm based on
graph-search. The bounded corridor further constrains the maneuver's space in
the spatial space. A step-wise heuristic optimization algorithm is then
proposed to synchronously generate a feasible trajectory for each maneuver. To
achieve real-time performance, we initialize the states to be optimized with
the boundary constraints of maneuvers, and we set some heuristic states as
terminal targets in the quadratic cost function. The solution of a feasible
trajectory is always guaranteed only if a specific maneuver is given. The
simulation and realistic driving-test experiments verified that the proposed
SMSTP algorithm has a short computation time which is less than 37ms, and the
experimental results showed the validity and effectiveness of the SMSTP
algorithm.

reliability and risk assessment. We consider failure events that are expressed
in terms of a limit state function, which depends on the solution of a partial

computationally expensive, estimating such probabilities of failure by Monte
Carlo sampling is intractable. More efficient sampling methods from reliability
analysis, such as Subset Simulation, are popular, but can still be
impracticable if the PDE evaluations are very costly. In this article, we
develop a novel, highly efficient estimator for probabilities of rare events.
Our method is based on a Sequential Importance sampler using discretizations of
PDE-based limit state functions with different accuracies. A twofold adaptive
algorithm ensures that we obtain an estimate based on the desired
discretization accuracy. In contrast to the Multilevel Subset Simulation
estimator of [Ullmann, Papaioannou 2015; SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif.

models, such as the Danish model, before they can be used in realistic flow
modeling. These modifications include removal of bridges, which otherwise will
act as dams in flow modeling, and inclusion of culverts that transport water
underneath roads. In fact, the danish model is accompanied by a detailed set of
hydrological corrections for the digital elevation model. However, producing
these hydrological corrections is a very slow an expensive process, since it is
to a large extent done manually and often with local input. This also means
that corrections can be of varying quality. In this paper we propose a new

fluid-discrete element model. Starting from an initial deposit of small
spherical particles on top of a large particle bed, the segregation dynamics of
the bed is studied as it is driven by the fluid flow. Focusing on the
quasi-static part of the bed, the small particles are observed to segregate as
a layer of constant thickness at a velocity constant in time and independent of
the number of small particles. The segregation velocity is observed to be
directly linked to the inertial number at the bottom of the layer, and to
increase linearly with the size ratio. While the macroscopic behavior is
independent of the concentration in small particles, an analysis in the
framework of the continuous model of (Thornton et al. 2006) shows that the
dynamics results from an equilibrium between the influence of the local
concentration and the inertial number forcing. Deriving an analytical solution
of the continuous model, it is shown that the diffusion coefficient should have
the same dependency on the inertial number as the segregation flux.
Implementing the segregation and the diffusive fluxes in the continuous model,
it is shown that they quantitatively reproduce the discrete simulations. These
results improve the understanding of the size segregation dynamics and
represent a step forward in the upscaling process of polydisperse granular flow
in the context of turbulent bedload transport.

  Application of deep generative modelling",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In population synthesis applications, when considering populations with many
attributes, a fundamental problem is the estimation of rare combinations of
feature attributes. Unsurprisingly, it is notably more difficult to reliably
representthe sparser regions of such multivariate distributions and in
particular combinations of attributes which are absent from the original
sample. In the literature this is commonly known as sampling zeros for which no
systematic solution has been proposed so far. In this paper, two machine
learning algorithms, from the family of deep generative models,are proposed for
the problem of population synthesis and with particular attention to the
problem of sampling zeros. Specifically, we introduce the Wasserstein
Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder(VAE), and
adapt these algorithms for a large-scale population synthesis application. The
models are implemented on a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more
than 60 variables. The models are validated in a cross-validation scheme and a
set of new metrics for the evaluation of the sampling-zero problem is proposed.
Results show how these models are able to recover sampling zeros while keeping
the estimation of truly impossible combinations, the structural zeros, at a
comparatively low level. Particularly, for a low dimensional experiment, the
VAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and
26%, respectively, more structural zeros per sampling zero generated by the
WGAN, while for a high dimensional case, these figures escalate to 44%, 2217%
and 170440%, respectively. This research directly supports the development of
agent-based systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or
geographical representations are required.

particularly the case when the underlying stochastic process has complex
dependencies and the individual strength of an object has an impact that only
plays out over time. We propose a novel technique to deal with such problems
and show how it can be applied to a broad range of examples where it produces
new insight and surprising results. The method relies on two steps: In the
first step, which is highly problem dependent, the problem is embedded into
continuous time so that the evolution of the sizes of objects after their
individual birth times become approximately independent while we only need
minimal control over the birth times themselves. Once such an embedding is
achieved, the second step is to apply a Poisson limit theorem that allows a
comparison of object sizes in a critical window and therefore allows a
description of features of extremal objects. In this paper we prove such a
versatile limit theorem, based on extreme value theory, and show how the
technique can be used to study extremal behaviour in different types of
preferential attachment networks with fitness, branching processes with
selection and mutation, and random permutations with random cycle weights.

any explicit knowledge of the CSI distribution and prove that the proposed
algorithm attains a near-optimal solution within a guaranteed gap to the
optimal solution. We next consider fairness among the E-Rs and propose a
quality of service (QoS) aware fair policy that maximizes a generic network
utility function while guaranteeing the required QoS of each E-R. Finally, we
study a practical wirelessly powered communication scenario in which the E-Rs
utilize their energy harvested through WPT to transmit information to the E-AP.
We optimize the received information at the E-AP under its average and peak
transmission power constraints and the fairness constraints of the E-Rs.
Numerical results show the significant performance of our proposed solutions
compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

attracting much research attention for years. Almost all methods treat
foreground and background regions (""things and stuff"") in an image equally.
However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial
role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth
prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper,
we first analyse the data distributions and interaction of foreground and
background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth
estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground depth and background
depth using separate optimization objectives and depth decoders. Our method
significantly improves the depth estimation performance on foreground objects.
Applying ForeSeE to 3D object detection, we achieve 7.5 AP gains and set new

surveillance (CMPS), connectivity-constrained multi-robot reachability (CMR),
and connectivity-constrained multi-robot reachability with relay dropping

heuristics with different planning horizons for convex grid graphs and combine
these with a tree traversal approach which can be applied to a partitioning of
non-convex grid graphs (CMPS with tree traversal, CMPSTT). In simulation
studies we show that a short horizon greedy approach, which requires parameters
to be optimized beforehand, can outperform a full horizon approach, which
requires a tour through all sensing locations, if the number of robots is
larger than the minimum number of robots required to reach all sensing
locations. The minimum number required is the number of robots necessary for
building a chain to the farthest sensing location from the base station.
Furthermore, we show that partitioning the area and applying the tree traversal
approach can achieve a performance similar to the unpartitioned case up to a
certain number of robots but requires less optimization time.

predict which items a user might choose to buy in the future, based on their
shopping history. However, existing methods only represent each user and item
by single deterministic points in a low-dimensional continuous space. In
addition, most of these methods are trained by maximizing the co-occurrence
likelihood with a simple Skip-gram-based formulation, which limits the
expressive ability of their embeddings and the resulting recommendation
performance. In this paper, we propose the Variational Bayesian Context-Aware

variational Bayesian model that learns the user and item latent vectors by
leveraging basket context information from past user-item interactions. We
train our VBCAR model based on the Bayesian Skip-gram framework coupled with
the amortized variational inference so that it can learn more expressive latent
representations that integrate both the non-linearity and Bayesian behaviour.
Experiments conducted on a large real-world grocery recommendation dataset show
that our proposed VBCAR model can significantly outperform existing

where $K$ is a division algebra over the reals of dimension
$d=\dim_{\mathbb{R}} K$. Assume $d(n-1) \geq 2$.
  In this paper we generalize natural maps to measurable cocycles. Given a
standard Borel probability $\Gamma$-space $(X,\mu_X)$, we assume that a
measurable cocycle $\sigma:\Gamma \times X \rightarrow \text{G}(m)$ admits an
essentially unique boundary map $\phi:\partial_\infty \mathbb{H}^n_K \times X
\rightarrow \partial_\infty \mathbb{H}^m_K$ whose slices $\phi_x:\mathbb{H}^n_K
\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^m_K$ are atomless for almost every $x \in X$. Then,
there exists a $\sigma$-equivariant measurable map $F: \mathbb{H}^n_K \times X
\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^m_K$ whose slices $F_x:\mathbb{H}^n_K \rightarrow
\mathbb{H}^m_K$ are differentiable for almost every $x \in X$ and such that
$\text{Jac}_a F_x \leq 1$ for every $a \in \mathbb{H}^n_K$ and almost every $x
\in X$.
  The previous properties allow us to define the natural volume
$\text{NV}(\sigma)$ of the cocycle $\sigma$. This number satisfies the
inequality $\text{NV}(\sigma) \leq \text{Vol}(\Gamma \backslash
\mathbb{H}^n_K)$. Additionally, the equality holds if and only if $\sigma$ is
cohomologous to the cocycle induced by the standard lattice embedding $i:\Gamma
\rightarrow \text{G}(n) \leq \text{G}(m)$, modulo possibly a compact subgroup
of $\text{G}(m)$ when $m>n$.
  Given a continuous map $f:M \rightarrow N$ between compact hyperbolic
manifolds, we also obtain an adaptation of the mapping degree theorem to this
context.

lesions that have substantially higher susceptibility than healthy tissues in
order to test linearity of QSMnet for susceptibility. The results show that
QSMnet underestimates susceptibility in hemorrhagic lesions, revealing degraded
linearity of the network for the untrained susceptibility range. To overcome
this limitation, a data augmentation method is proposed to generalize the
network for a wider range of susceptibility. The newly trained network, which
is referred to as QSMnet+, is assessed in computer-simulated lesions with an
extended susceptibility range (-1.4 ppm to +1.4 ppm) and also in twelve
hemorrhagic patients. The simulation results demonstrate improved linearity of
QSMnet+ over QSMnet (root mean square error of QSMnet+: 0.04 ppm vs. QSMnet:
0.36 ppm). When applied to patient data, QSMnet+ maps show less noticeable
artifacts to those of conventional QSM maps. Moreover, the susceptibility
values of QSMnet+ in hemorrhagic lesions are better matched to those of the
conventional QSM method than those of QSMnet when analyzed using linear
regression (QSMnet+: slope = 1.05, intercept = -0.03, R2 = 0.93; QSMnet: slope

synchronization phenomenon of oscillatory systems, is limited to a first-order
harmonic coupling of phases. For higher-order coupling, there only exists a
low-dimensional theory in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, we extend the
formulation used by Watanabe and Strogatz to obtain a low-dimensional
description of a system of arbitrary size of identical oscillators coupled
all-to-all via their higher-order modes. To demonstrate an application of the
formulation, we use a second harmonic globally coupled model, with a mean-field
equal to the square of the Kuramoto mean-field. This model is known to exhibit
asymmetrical clustering in previous numerical studies. We try to explain the
phenomenon of asymmetrical clustering using the analytical theory developed
here, as well as discuss certain phenomena not observed at the level of
first-order harmonic coupling.

cases such as ANOVA, Student's t-test or location-scale inference - is a widely
used statistical procedure. In this case the ordinary least squares estimator
possesses remarkable properties but is very sensitive to outliers. Several
robust alternatives have been proposed, but there is still significant room for
improvement. This paper thus proposes an original method of estimation that
offers the best efficiency simultaneously in the absence and the presence of
outliers, both for the estimation of the regression coefficients and the scale
parameter. The approach first consists in broadening the normal assumption of
the errors to a mixture of the normal and the filtered-log-Pareto (FLP), an
original distribution designed to represent the outliers. The
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is then adapted and we obtain the N-FLP
estimators of the regression coefficients, the scale parameter and the
proportion of outliers, along with probabilities of each observation being an
outlier. The performance of the N-FLP estimators is compared with the best
alternatives in an extensive Monte Carlo simulation. The paper demonstrates
that this method of estimation can also be used for a complete robust
inference, including confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and model
selection.

have been discovered in the Local Universe. The origin of these planes of
galaxies remains unknown. One suggestion is that they are related to the
large-scale structure of the cosmic web. A recent study found that the normal
of a number of these dwarf galaxy planes are very closely aligned with the
eigenvector of the shear tensor corresponding to the direction of greatest
collapse obtained by reconstructing the full velocity field in the linear
regime. Here we extend that work by both considering an additional 5 planes
beyond the 5 examined previously and by examining the alignment with respect to
the quasi-linear field, a more sophisticated reconstruction, which is a better
approximation on smaller (quasi-linear) scales. Our analysis recovers the
previous result while not finding a significantly tight alignment with the
additional 5 planes. However, the additional 5 planes normals also do not
appear to be randomly oriented. We conclude that this could either be due to
the normals of the new planes being poorly defined and described; the
quasi-linear field at those locations being poorly constrained; or different
formation mechanisms for the orientation of planes of dwarf galaxies.

the para-to-ortho-H$_2$ conversion, and H$_2$ dissociation by H$_2$-H
collisions. At cosmic ray ionization rates $\zeta \geq 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ and
at moderate shock speeds, the H/H$_2$ ratio at the shock front is mainly
determined by the cosmic ray ionization rate. The H$_2$-H collisions play the
main role in the para-to-ortho-H$_2$ conversion and, at $\zeta \geq 10^{-15}$

in the shock. The H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of the shocked gas and column

applications such as humidity and temperature sensing in smart buildings,

remote places to sense the data information from the environment and to
transmit the sensing data to the Base Station (BS). When a sensor is drained of
energy, it can no longer achieve its role without a substituted source of
energy. However, limited energy in a sensor's battery prevents the long-term
process in such applications. In addition, replacing the sensors' batteries and
redeploying the sensors is very expensive in terms of time and budget. To
overcome the energy limitation without changing the size of sensors,
researchers have proposed the use of energy harvesting to reload the
rechargeable battery by power. Therefore, efficient power management is
required to increase the benefits of having additional environmental energy.
This paper presents a new self-management of energy based on Proportional

Here we meet both challenges for the spin reorientation transition in the

liquid-gas transition in the temperature-pressure plane, this transition is
centred on a first order line terminating in a critical end point in the

magnetic domain walls for the high temperature phase and then moves to self
organize at the domain centres of the high temperature phase. The dense domain
patterns and phase coexistence imply a complex inhomogeneous electronic
structure, which will yield anomalous contributions to the magnetic field- and

arbitrary coherent superpositions of two quantum states. It uses a sequence of
two adiabatic pulses split by a phase jump serving as a control parameter. Each
pulse has a chirped detuning, which induces a half crossing, and acts as a
$\pi/2$ pulse in the adiabatic regime. The phase jump is imprinted onto the
population ratio of the created superposition state. Of the various possible
relations between the two pulses, we select the case when the Rabi frequency
and the detuning of the second pulse are mirror images of those of the first
pulse, and the two detunings have opposite signs. Then the mixing angle of the
superposition state depends on the phase jump only. For other arrangements, the
superposition mixing angle is shifted by the dynamic phases of the propagators,
which makes these cases suitable for state tomography. This twin setup comes
along with the advantage that it reduces the error $\epsilon$ of each
individual pulse down to $4\epsilon^2$ overall. Therefore, the proposed
technique combines the benefits of robustness stemming from adiabatic evolution
with accuracy generated by the twin-pulse error suppression, and flexibility of
the superposition state controlled by the phase jump $\phi$. In addition, we
present a simple exactly soluble trigonometric model in order to illustrate the
proposed technique. In this model, when the pulse area $A$ increases the
nonadiabatic oscillations are damped as $A^{-1}$ for a single pulse and
$A^{-2}$ for the two-pulse sequence. Finally, the proposed technique is
extended to sequences of $N=2^n$ pulses by concatenating $\pi/2$ sequences and
splitting them by a phase jump, thereby further reducing the nonadiabatic error
$\epsilon$ to $(2\epsilon)^{N}$. This makes the proposed technique suitable for
generating high-fidelity quantum rotation gates.

facts: (1) medoids have the minimum degree in their clusters; (2) the minimax
distance between two objects in one cluster is smaller than the minimax
distance between objects in different clusters. Extensive experiments are
conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of
the GOPC algorithm. The results on synthetic datasets show that the GOPC
algorithm can recognize all kinds of clusters regardless of their shapes,
sizes, or densities. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the GOPC algorithm. In addition, the GOPC
algorithm needs only one parameter, i.e., the number of clusters, which can be
estimated by the decision graph. The advantages mentioned above make GOPC a
good candidate as a general clustering algorithm. Codes are available at

time-invariant system with discrete delays. The considered system is subject to
real-valued, structured, Frobenius norm bounded uncertainties on the
coefficient matrices. The robust H-infinity norm is the worst case value of the
H-infinity norm over the realisations of the system and hence an important
measure of robust performance in control engineering. However this robust
H-infinity norm is a fragile measure, as for a particular realization of the
uncertainties the H-infinity norm might be sensitive to arbitrarily small
perturbations on the delays. Therefore, we introduce the robust strong
H-infinity norm, inspired by the notion of strong stability of delay
differential equations of neutral type, which takes into account both the
perturbations on the system matrices and infinitesimal small delay
perturbations. This quantity is a continuous function of the nominal system
parameters and delays. The main contribution of this work is the introduction
of a relation between this robust strong H-infinity norm and the the
pseudo-spectrum of an associated singular delay eigenvalue problem. This
relation is subsequently employed in a novel algorithm for computing the robust
strong H-infinity norm of uncertain time-delay systems. Both the theoretical
results and the algorithm are also generalized to systems with uncertainties on
the delays, and systems described by a class of delay differential algebraic
equations.

Supersingular isogeny graphs were introduced as a hard problem into
cryptography by Charles, Goren, and Lauter for the construction of
cryptographic hash functions [CGL06]. These are large expander graphs, and the
hard problem is to find an efficient algorithm for routing, or path-finding,
between two vertices of the graph. We consider four aspects of supersingular
isogeny graphs, study each thoroughly and, where appropriate, discuss how they
relate to one another.
  First, we consider two related graphs that help us understand the structure:
the `spine' $\mathcal{S}$, which is the subgraph of
$\mathcal{G}_\ell(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$ given by the $j$-invariants in
$\mathbb{F}_p$, and the graph $\mathcal{G}_\ell(\mathbb{F}_p)$, in which both
curves and isogenies must be defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We show how to pass
from the latter to the former. The graph $\mathcal{S}$ is relevant for
cryptanalysis because routing between vertices in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is easier than
in the full isogeny graph. The $\mathbb{F}_p$-vertices are typically assumed to
be randomly distributed in the graph, which is far from true. We provide an
analysis of the distances of connected components of $\mathcal{S}$.
  Next, we study the involution on $\mathcal{G}_\ell(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$
that is given by the Frobenius of $\mathbb{F}_p$ and give heuristics on how
often shortest paths between two conjugate $j$-invariants are preserved by this
involution (mirror paths). We also study the related question of what
proportion of conjugate $j$-invariants are $\ell$-isogenous for $\ell = 2,3$.
We conclude with experimental data on the diameters of supersingular isogeny
graphs when $\ell = 2$ and compare this with previous results on diameters of
LPS graphs and random Ramanujan graphs.

{\em Type-I see-saw} mechanism and provides an explanation of the baryon
asymmetry of the Universe via thermal leptogenesis in the framework of
$Z_3$-symmetric three Higgs doublet model (3HDM) augmented with three
right-handed neutrinos. Here the thermal leptogenesis is initiated by the
out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest heavy neutrino $N_1$. The constraints
arising out of the scalar sector put strong bound on the model parameter $\tan
\beta$, which in turn takes part in the computation of the lepton asymmetry
$\epsilon$. Lepton asymmetry being converted partially into the baryon
asymmetry by electroweak sphelaron processes, will account for the required
baryon asymmetry satisfying the current data. We therefore analyse the
parameter space consistent with the constraints arising from neutrino
oscillation, lepton asymmetry and baryon asymmetry together, last one being the
most stringent one.

electroweakinos and sleptons in the EWSUSY can also contribute to the dark

them will provide the indirect evidence of SUSY. In this work, we confront the
EWSUSY with the muon $g-2$ anomaly, the DM relic density, the direct detection
limits and the latest LHC Run-2 data. We find that the sneutrino DM or the
neutralino DM with sizable higgsino component has been excluded by the direct
detections. Then two viable scenarios are pinned down: one has the light
compressed bino and sleptons but heavy higgsinos, and the other has the light
compressed bino, winos and sleptons. In the former case, the LSP and slepton
masses have to be smaller than about 350 GeV. While in the latter case, the LSP

Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool due to its ability to rapidly

measure changes in their arm lengths of order $10^{-18}~$m or smaller. This
requires very high laser power in order to raise the signal above shot noise.
One significant limitation to increased laser power is an opto-mechanical
interaction between the laser field and the detector's test masses that can
form an unstable feedback loop. Such parametric instabilities have long been
studied as a limiting effect at high power, and were first observed to occur in
LIGO in 2014. Since then, passive and active means have been used to avoid
these instabilities, though at power levels well below the final design value.
Here we report on the successful implementation of tuned, passive dampers to
tame parametric instabilities in LIGO. These dampers are applied directly to
all interferometer test masses to reduce the quality factors of their internal
vibrational modes, while adding a negligible amount of noise to the
gravitational-wave output. In accordance with our model, the measured mode
quality factors have been reduced by at least a factor of ten with no visible
increase in the interferometer's thermal noise level. We project that these
dampers should remove most of the parametric instabilities in LIGO when
operating at full power, while limiting the concomitant increase in thermal
noise to approximately 1%.

scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high
dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of
atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these
landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL)
techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity
to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the
dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations
that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2)
driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational
states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD
simulations can fold small proteins effectively on supercomputers. In
particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling
DL-coupled MD workflows by folding two prototypical systems, viz., Fs-peptide
and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate
that a DL driven MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent
representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional
MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in
sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Our study provides a quantitative
basis to understand how DL driven MD simulations, can lead to effective
performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.

ensuring a safe interaction between the pilots and the autopilots is still a
challenging problem, especially in the presence of severe anomalies. Current
approach consists of autopilot solutions that disengage themselves when they
become ineffective. This may cause reengagement of the pilot at the worst
possible time, which can result in undesired consequences. In this paper, a
series of research studies that propose pilot-autopilot interaction schemes
based on the Capacity for Maneuver (CfM) concept, are covered. CfM refers to
the remaining capacity of the actuators that can be used for bringing the
aircraft to safety. It is demonstrated that CfM-based pilot-autopilot
interaction schemes, or Shared Control Architectures (SCA), can be promising
alternatives to the existing schemes. Two SCAs are tested in the experiments.
In SCA1, the pilot takes over the control from the autopilot using the
monitored CfM information. In SCA2, the pilot takes on the role of a supervisor
helping the autopilot whenever a need arises, based on the CfM information.
Whenever the aircraft experiences a severe anomaly, the pilot assesses the
situation based on his/her CfM monitoring and intervenes by providing two
control system parameter estimates to the autopilot. This increases the
effectiveness of the autopilot. Using human-in-the-loop simulations, it is
shown that CfM based interactions provides smaller tracking errors and larger
overall CfM. The subjects including a commercial airline pilot and several
university students are trained using a systematic procedure. Creation of new
cyber physical & human systems is inevitable along with deeper engagement with
the social science community so as to get better insight into human decision
making. The results reported here should be viewed as a first of several steps
in this research direction.

It
quantifies the entanglement of the magnetic field within the plasma. The
transport and removal of helicity is crucial in both the dynamo in the solar
interior and active region evolution in the solar corona. This transport
typically leads to highly inhomogeneous distributions of entanglement.There
exists no consistent systematic means of decomposing helicity over varying
spatial scales and in localised regions. We apply a multiresolution wavelet
decomposition to the magnetic field and demonstrate how it can be applied to
various quantities associated with magnetic helicity, including the field line
helicity. We use a geometrical definition of helicity which allows these
quantities to be calculated for fields with arbitrary boundary conditions. It
is shown that the multiresolution decomposition of helicity has the crucial
property of local additivity and demonstrate a general linear energy-topology
conservation law which is a significant generalisation of the two point
correlation decomposition used in the analysis of homogeneous turbulence and
periodic fields. The localisation property of the wavelet representation is
shown to characterise inhomogeneous distributions which a Fourier
representation cannot. Using an analytic representation of a resistive braided
field relaxation we demonstrate a clear correlation between the variations in
energy at various length scales and the variations in helicity at the same
spatial scales. Its application to helicity flows in a surface flux transport
model show how various contributions to the global helicity input from active
region field evolution and polar field development are naturally separated by
this representation.

order of $\sim \mu$G. The non-thermal pressure exerted by magnetic fields also
contributes to the total pressure in galaxy clusters and can in turn affect the
estimates of the gas mass fraction, $f_{gas}$. In this paper, we have
considered a central magnetic field strength of $5\mu$G, motivated by
observations and simulations of galaxy clusters. The profile of the magnetic
field has also been taken from the results obtained from simulations and
observations. The role of magnetic field has been taken into account in
inferring the gas density distribution through the hydrostatic equilibrium
condition (HSE) by including the magnetic pressure. We have found that the
resultant gas mass fraction is smaller with magnetic field as compared to that
without magnetic field. However, this decrease is dependent on the strength and
the profile of the magnetic field. We have also determined the total mass using
the NFW profile to check for the dependency of $f_{gas}$ estimates on total
mass estimators. From our analysis, we conclude that for the magnetic field
strength that galaxy clusters seem to possess, the non-thermal pressure from
magnetic fields has an impact of $\approx 1~\%$ on the gas mass fraction of
galaxy clusters. However, with upcoming facilities like Square Kilometre Array

the magnetic field strength and profile in galaxy clusters, particularly in the

piezoelectric optomechanical devices, that are then coupled to microwave
circuits. Optical absorption, low quality factors and other challenges have up
to now prevented operation in the quantum regime, however. Here, we design and
characterize such a piezoelectric optomechanical device fabricated from gallium
phosphide in which a 2.9~GHz mechanical mode is coupled to a high quality
factor optical resonator in the telecom band. The large electronic bandgap and
the resulting low optical absorption of this new material, on par with devices
fabricated from silicon, allows us to demonstrate quantum behavior of the

transduction between microwaves and optics, but in principle also from various

establish an adaptive distributed observer for a neutrally stable linear leader

this adaptive distributed observer can estimate and pass the leader's state to
each follower through the communication network of the system without knowing
the leader's system matrix exactly. Under the additional assumption that the
leader's state is persistently exciting, this adaptive distributed observer can
also asymptotically learn the parameters of the leader's system matrix. On the
basis of this adaptive distributed observer, we further synthesize an adaptive
distributed control law to solve our problem via the certainty equivalence

symmetric for the [100] sample, possibly due to crystalline anisotropy becoming
more important at this sample thickness than it is in bulk samples.
Furthermore, we find that a metastable skyrmion state can be observed at low

metastable skyrmions does not significantly depend on cooling rate. We show
that a possible explanation for this is the change in the lowest temperature of

constrained minimization problems for functionals defined on function spaces on
metric measure spaces $(\mathcal M, d, \mu)$. We apply this theory to
functionals defined on metric graphs $\mathcal G$, in particular
$L^2$-constrained minimization problems for functionals of the form $$E(u) =
\frac{1}{2} a(u,u) - \frac{1}{q}\int_{\mathcal K} |u|^q \, \mathrm dx,$$ where
$q>2$, $a(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a suitable symmetric sesquilinear form on some
function space on $\mathcal G$ and $\mathcal K \subseteq \mathcal G$ is given.
  We show how the existence of solutions can be obtained via decomposition
methods using spectral properties of the operator $A$ associated with the form
$a(\cdot, \cdot)$ and discuss the spectral quantities involved. An example that
we consider is the higher-order variant of the stationary NLS (nonlinear
Schr\""odinger) energy functional with potential $V\in L^2+ L^\infty(\mathcal
G)$ $$ E^{(k)}(u)= \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathcal G} |u^{(k)}|^2+ V(x) |u|^2 \,
\mathrm dx - \frac{1}{p} \int_{\mathcal K} |u|^q \, \mathrm dx$$ defined on a
class of higher-order Sobolev spaces $H^k(\mathcal G)$ that we introduce. When
$\mathcal K$ is a bounded subgraph, one has localized nonlinearities, which we
treat as a special case. When $k=1$ we also consider metric graphs with
infinite edge set as well as magnetic potentials. Then the operator $A$
associated to the linear form is a Schr\""odinger operator, and in the
$L^2$-subcritical case $2<q<6$, we obtain generalizations of existence results
for the NLS functional as for instance obtained by Adami, Serra and Tilli [JFA

obtains near maximum likelihood detection performance in both fixed and varying

the lengths of our proposed confidence intervals are minimax optimal over

also study minimax rates of estimating a distribution under the Sliced

simulation study demonstrating the deficiencies of the classical bootstrap, and
the advantages of our proposed methods. We also show strong correspondences

new simple semi-empirical models for estimation of dynamic contact angle's
dependence on the wetting line velocity. These models should be applicable to
any geometry, a very large range of capillary numbers and static contact angles
and all solid-liquid-gas systems without requiring further experiments. Two
simple equations are intuitively derived from the most promising theoretical
dynamic contact angle models, the hydrodynamic and the molecular-kinetic
models. Then the models, along with the basic form of the Hoffman model, are
fitted to a large pool of data. The data are extracted from numerous studies
and cover over 5 decades of capillary number, include static contact angles up
to the superhydrophobic region and comprise of various geometries. The
resulting models are compared to each other where the hydrodynamic model's
predictions are found to be superior to the other two models by all statistical
measures. Then, noting that the molecular forces become dominant at lower
capillary numbers we separate the data into low and high capillary regions and
repeat the process. There was only a minuscule difference between the results
obtained for general models and high capillary models ($\textrm{Ca}>10^{-4}$)

control, either as action sequences or policy parameters. However, as
closed-form expressions of the objective functions are often not available, our
understanding of the optimization problems is limited. Building on recent work
on analyzing neural network training, we contribute novel visualizations of
high-dimensional control optimization landscapes; this yields insights into why
control optimization is hard and why common practices like early termination
and spline-based action parameterizations make optimization easier. For
example, our experiments show how trajectory optimization can become
increasingly ill-conditioned with longer trajectories, but parameterizing
control as partial target states---e.g., target angles converted to torques
using a PD-controller---can act as an efficient preconditioner. Both our
visualizations and quantitative empirical data also indicate that neural
network policy optimization scales better than trajectory optimization for long
planning horizons. Our work advances the understanding of movement optimization
and our visualizations should also provide value in educational use.

a crucial role in applications such as solar and plasma physics, relativistic
astrophysics, fluid and vortex dynamics, elasticity, and bio-elasticity. Often
the vector field's topology -- the entanglement of its field lines -- is
non-trivial, and can play a significant role in the vector field's evolution.
We present a complete topological characterisation of such vector fields (up to
isotopy) using a quantity called field line winding. This measures the
entanglement of each field line with all other field lines of the vector field,
and may be defined for an arbitrary tubular subdomain by prescribing a
minimally distorted coordinate system. We propose how to define such
coordinates, and prove that the resulting field line winding distribution
uniquely classifies the topology of a braided vector field. The field line
winding is similar to the field line helicity considered previously for
magnetic (solenoidal) fields, but is a more fundamental measure of the field
line topology because it does not conflate linking information with field
strength.

classical trajectory building or an image transformation, an efficient use of
both local and global information is undertaken while keeping competing choices
open. The measured hits of adjacent tracking layers are clustered first with
the help of a mutual nearest neighbor search in the angular distance. The
resulted chains of connected hits are used as initial clusters and as input for
cluster analysis algorithms, such as the robust $k$-medians clustering. This
latter proceeds by alternating between the hit-to-track assignment and the
track-fit update steps, until convergence. The calculation of the hit-to-track
distance and that of the track-fit $\chi^2$ is performed through the global
covariance of the measured hits. The clustering is complemented with elements
from a more sophisticated Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, with the
possibility of adding new track hypotheses or removing unnecessary ones.
Simplified but realistic models of today's silicon trackers, including the
relevant physics processes, are employed to test and study the performance

multiplicity in the collision event.

vehicle routing, where the routing engine learns from the subjective decisions
that human planners have made in the past, rather than optimizing a
distance-based objective criterion. This is an alternative to the practice of
formulating a custom VRP for every company with its own routing requirements.
Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions over similar
sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The approach is based on
the concept of learning a first-order Markov model, which corresponds to a
probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance matrix.
This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in
creating the actual route plans. For the learning, we explore different schemes
to construct the probabilistic transition matrix. Our results on a use-case
with a small transportation company show that our method is able to generate
results that are close to the manually created solutions, without needing to
characterize all constraints and sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of
changes in the client sets, our method is able to find solutions that are
closer to the actual route plans than when using distances, and hence,
solutions that would require fewer manual changes to transform into the actual
route plan.

the model, the producer can control the drift and/or the volatility of the
price whereas the trader can at most affect the volatility. The producer can
affect the volatility in two ways: either by randomizing her production rate
or, as the trader, using other means such as spreading false information.
Moreover, the producer contracts at time zero a fixed position in a European

first two models, or she can also affect the volatility of the commodity price,

closed--form expressions of the derivative price over a small time horizon,
preventing arbitrage opportunities to arise. We find that when the trader is
price-taker, the producer can always compensate the loss in expected production
profit generated by an increase of volatility by a gain in the derivative

the trader is active, the model takes the form of a nonzero-sum

One of the key requirements is that these resistive devices must change
conductance in a symmetrical fashion when subjected to positive or negative
pulse stimuli. Here, we present a new training algorithm, so-called the
""Tiki-Taka"" algorithm, that eliminates this stringent symmetry requirement. We
show that device asymmetry introduces an unintentional implicit cost term into

network and the unintentional cost term due to device asymmetry in a
self-consistent fashion. We tested the validity of this new algorithm on a

accuracy is achieved using the conventional SGD algorithm with symmetric

states between distinct materials has been a subject of great interest
recently. While lattices have been the main setting for these studies, a
relatively unexplored realm for this physics is that of continuum fluids. In
the typical case of a fluid model with a point spectrum, nontrivial topology
and associated edge modes have been observed previously. However, another
possibility is that a continuous spectrum can coexist with the point spectrum.
Here we demonstrate that a fluid plasma model can harbor nontrivial topology
within its continuous spectrum, and that there are boundary modes at the
interface between topologically distinct regions. We consider the ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. In the presence of magnetic shear, we find
nontrivial topology in the Alfv\'{e}n continuum. For strong shear, the Chern
number is $\pm 1$, depending on the sign of the shear. If the magnetic shear
changes sign within the plasma, a topological phase transition occurs, and
bulk-boundary correspondence then suggests a mode localized to the layer of
zero magnetic shear. We confirm the existence of this mode numerically.
Moreover, this reversed-shear Alfv\'{e}n eigenmode (RSAE) is well known within
magnetic fusion as it has been observed in several tokamaks. In examining how
the MHD model might be regularized at small scales, we also consider the
electron limit of Hall MHD. We show that the whistler band, which plays an
important role in planetary ionospheres, has nontrivial topology. More broadly,

processing. The reconstruction of signals sparse (highly concentrated) in
various transform domains is the primary problem analyzed in the thesis. The
considered domains include Fourier, discrete Hermite, one-dimensional and
two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, as well as various time-frequency
representations. Sparse signals are reconstructed using sparsity measures,
being, in fact, the measures of signal concentration in the considered domains.
The thesis analyzes the compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms and
introduces new approaches to the problem at hand. The missing samples influence
on analyzed transform domains is studied in detail, establishing the relations
with the general compressive sensing theory. This study provides new insights
on phenomena arising due to the reduced number of signal samples. The
theoretical contributions involve new exact mathematical expressions which
describe performance and outcomes of reconstruction algorithms, also including
the study of the influence of additive noise, sparsity level and the number of
available measurements on the reconstruction performance, exact expressions for
reconstruction errors and error probabilities. Parameter optimization of the
discrete Hermite transform is also studied, as well as the additive noise
influence on Hermite coefficients, resulting in new parameter optimization and
denoising algorithms. Additionally, an algorithm for the decomposition of
multivariate multicomponent signals is introduced, as well as an instantaneous
frequency estimation algorithm based on the Wigner distribution. Extensive
numerical examples and experiments with real and synthetic data validate the
presented theory and shed a new light on practical applications of the results.

over a realistic wireless network is studied. In particular, in the considered
model, wireless users execute an FL algorithm while training their local FL
models using their own data and transmitting the trained local FL models to a
base station (BS) that will generate a global FL model and send it back to the
users. Since all training parameters are transmitted over wireless links, the
quality of the training will be affected by wireless factors such as packet
errors and the availability of wireless resources. Meanwhile, due to the
limited wireless bandwidth, the BS must select an appropriate subset of users
to execute the FL algorithm so as to build a global FL model accurately. This
joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem is
formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize an FL loss
function that captures the performance of the FL algorithm. To address this
problem, a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL
algorithm is first derived to quantify the impact of wireless factors on FL.
Then, based on the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm, the optimal
transmit power for each user is derived, under a given user selection and
uplink resource block (RB) allocation scheme. Finally, the user selection and
uplink RB allocation is optimized so as to minimize the FL loss function.
Simulation results show that the proposed joint federated learning and
communication framework can reduce the FL loss function value by up to 10% and
16%, respectively, compared to: 1) An optimal user selection algorithm with
random resource allocation and 2) a standard FL algorithm with random user
selection and resource allocation.

scheme using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The architecture of the introduced
neural network is inspired from sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) and named as
Learned-SBL (L-SBL). We design a common architecture to recover sparse as well
as block sparse vectors from single measurement vector (SMV) or multiple
measurement vectors (MMV) depending on the nature of the training data. In the
MMV model, the L-SBL network can be trained to learn any underlying sparsity
pattern among the vectors including joint sparsity, block sparsity, etc. In
particular, for block sparse recovery, learned-SBL does not require any prior
knowledge of block boundaries. In each layer of the L-SBL, an estimate of the
signal covariance matrix is obtained as the output of a neural network. Then a
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of the unknown sparse vector is
implemented with non-trainable parameters. In many applications, the
measurement matrix may be time-varying. The existing DNN based sparse signal
recovery schemes demand the retraining of the neural network using current
measurement matrix. The architecture of L-SBL allows it to accept the
measurement matrix as an input to the network, and thereby avoids the need for
retraining. We also evaluate the performance of Learned-SBL in the detection of
an extended target using a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar.
Simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach offers superior sparse
recovery performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

phenomena in neuroimaging. These models typically rest on the premise that
oscillator dynamics do not evolve beyond their respective limit cycles, and
hence that interactions can be described purely in terms of phase differences.
Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature of phase-only models
can limit their explanatory power. We therefore propose a generalisation of
dynamic causal modelling that incorporates both phase and amplitude. This
allows for the separate quantifications of phase and amplitude contributions to
the connectivity between neural regions. We establish, using model-generated
data and simulations of coupled pendula, that phase-only models perform well
only under weak coupling conditions. We also show that, despite their higher
complexity, phase-amplitude models can describe strongly coupled systems more
effectively than their phase-only counterparts. We relate our findings to four
metrics commonly used in neuroimaging: the Kuramoto order parameter,
cross-correlation, phase-lag index, and spectral entropy. We find that, with
the exception of spectral entropy, the phase-amplitude model is able to capture
all metrics more effectively than the phase-only model. We then demonstrate,
using local field potential recordings in rodents and functional magnetic
resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, that amplitudes in oscillator models play
an important role in describing neural dynamics in anaesthetised brain states.

accessible, attackers increasingly leverage ML to perform automated large-scale
inference attacks in various domains. In such an ML-equipped inference attack,
an attacker has access to some data (called public data) of an individual, a
software, or a system; and the attacker uses an ML classifier to automatically
infer their private data. Inference attacks pose severe privacy and security
threats to individuals and systems. Inference attacks are successful because
private data are statistically correlated with public data, and ML classifiers
can capture such statistical correlations. In this chapter, we discuss the
opportunities and challenges of defending against ML-equipped inference attacks
via adversarial examples. Our key observation is that attackers rely on ML
classifiers in inference attacks. The adversarial machine learning community
has demonstrated that ML classifiers have various vulnerabilities. Therefore,
we can turn the vulnerabilities of ML into defenses against inference attacks.
For example, ML classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which add
carefully crafted noise to normal examples such that an ML classifier makes
predictions for the examples as we desire. To defend against inference attacks,
we can add carefully crafted noise into the public data to turn them into
adversarial examples, such that attackers' classifiers make incorrect
predictions for the private data. However, existing methods to construct
adversarial examples are insufficient because they did not consider the unique
challenges and requirements for the crafted noise at defending against
inference attacks. In this chapter, we take defending against inference attacks
in online social networks as an example to illustrate the opportunities and
challenges.

leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Since the source and the target
domains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus
on adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in
real applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have
different contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to
quantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions,
which will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is
capable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each
distribution. DDA can be easily incorporated into the framework of structural
risk minimization to solve transfer learning problems. On the basis of DDA, we
propose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution
Adaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic
Distribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer
learning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and
adversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image
classification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional
distributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our
DDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative

antijunction is of negative baryon charge, our neutral pomeron torus can be
covered with only a certain number of hexagons that are built of 3 junction and
3 antijunction each. This image is similar somehow to graphene tube. It is
reasonable to expect that the dynamics of rapidity gaps in DD should be
determined by the number of hexagons on the surface of pomeron torus.
Therefore, the gap distribution in DD events has the discrete structure in the
region of large gaps. Moreover, the SJ torus can be released in pp interactions

proposed, their focus has been largely on preserving the overall classification

accuracy however is not a good indicator of performance in case of class

  To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware classifier based on
AdaBoost that further updates the weights of the instances in each boosting
round taking into account a cumulative notion of fairness based upon all
current ensemble members, while explicitly tackling class-imbalance by
optimizing the number of ensemble members for balanced classification error.

believed to be one of the most efficient interface circuits for piezoelectric
vibration energy harvesting systems. It employs an inductor and the resulting
RLC loop to synchronously invert the charge across the piezoelectric material
to avoid charge and energy loss due to charging its internal capacitor ($C_P$).
The performance of the SSHI circuit greatly depends on the inductor and a large
inductor is often needed; hence significantly increases the volume of the
system. An efficient interface circuit using a synchronous charge inversion
technique, named as SSHC, was proposed recently. The SSHC rectifier utilizes
capacitors, instead of inductors, to flip the voltage across the harvester. For
a one-stage SSHC rectifier, one single intermediate capacitor ($C_T$) is
employed to temporarily store charge flowed from $C_P$ and inversely charge
$C_P$ to perform the charge inversion. In previous studies, the voltage flip
efficiency achieves 1/3 when $C_T = C_P$. This paper presents that the voltage
flip efficiency can be further increased to approach 1/2 if $C_T$ is chosen to
be much larger than $C_P$.

the model and nanofoaming measurements; it is deduced that the failure strain
of the cell walls is sensitive to cell wall thickness.

static dataset assumption. The prevalence of social media and web access has
led to the emergence of social, or human sensors who report on events globally.
This warrants development of event detectors that can take advantage of the
truly dense and high spatial and temporal resolution data provided by more than
3 billion social users. The phenomenon of concept drift, which causes terms and
signals associated with a topic to change over time, renders static machine
learning ineffective. Towards this end, we present an application for physical
event detection on social sensors that improves traditional physical event
detection with concept drift adaptation. Our approach continuously updates its
machine learning classifiers automatically, without the need for human
intervention. It integrates data from heterogeneous sources and is designed to
handle weak-signal events (landslides, wildfires) with around ten posts per
event in addition to large-signal events (hurricanes, earthquakes) with
hundreds of thousands of posts per event. We demonstrate a landslide detector
on our application that detects almost 350% more land-slides compared to static
approaches. Our application has high performance: using classifiers trained in
2014, achieving event detection accuracy of 0.988, compared to 0.762 for static
approaches.
