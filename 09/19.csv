become more relevant in the low-mass regime, this would allow the decay of

this direction has been mainly given in the context of corrections to
Einstein-Maxwell theory. Here we compute corrections to the charge-to-mass

depend on the solution considered, with the charge-to-mass ratio remaining
unchanged or deviating positively from one. Additionally, we observe that the
introduction of the higher-curvature terms increases the Wald entropy in all

diagrams. In this approach, fine-timescale components of paired spike train
interactions are isolated and subsequently attributed to synaptic parameters.
Recent perturbation studies strengthen the case for such an inference, yet the
complete set of measurements needed to calibrate statistical models are
unavailable. To address this gap, we study features of pairwise spiking in a
large-scale in vivo dataset where presynaptic neurons were explicitly decoupled
from network activity by juxtacellular stimulation. We then construct
biophysical models of paired spike trains to reproduce the observed
phenomenology of in vivo monosynaptic interactions, including both
fine-timescale spike-spike correlations and firing irregularity. A key
characteristic of these models is that the paired neurons are coupled by
rapidly-fluctuating background inputs. We quantify a monosynapse's causal
effect by comparing the postsynaptic train with its counterfactual, when the
monosynapse is removed. Subsequently, we develop statistical techniques for
estimating this causal effect from the pre- and post-synaptic spike trains. A
particular focus is the justification and application of a nonparametric
separation of timescale principle to implement synaptic inference. Using
simulated data generated from the biophysical models, we characterize the
regimes in which the estimators accurately identify the monosynaptic effect. A
secondary goal is to initiate a critical exploration of neurostatistical
assumptions in terms of biophysical mechanisms, particularly with regards to
the challenging but arguably fundamental issue of fast, unobservable
nonstationarities in background dynamics.

distribution of their projections using knotoids. The approximation of this
distribution depends on the number of projection directions that are sampled.
Here we investigate the relation between knotoids differing only by small
perturbations of the direction of projection. Since such knotoids are connected
by at most a single forbidden move, we characterise forbidden moves in terms of
equivariant band attachment between strongly invertible knots and of strand
passages between $\theta$-curves. This allows for the determination of the
optimal sample size needed to produce a well approximated knotoid distribution.
Based on that and on topological properties of the distribution, we propose a
numerical measure for the determination of deeply knotted proteins that does
not require the computationally expensive method of subchain analysis.

rapidly generate walking gaits and then recomposes these gaits to obtain
quadrupedal locomotion. We begin by decomposing the full-order, nonlinear and
hybrid dynamics of a three-dimensional quadrupedal robot, including its
continuous and discrete dynamics, into two bipedal systems that are subject to
external forces. Using the hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, gaits for
these bipedal robots can be rapidly generated (on the order of seconds) along
with corresponding controllers. The decomposition is achieved in such a way
that the bipedal walking gaits and controllers can be composed to yield dynamic
walking gaits for the original quadrupedal robot --- the result is the rapid
generation of dynamic quadruped gaits utilizing the full-order dynamics. This
methodology is demonstrated through the rapid generation (3.96 seconds on
average) of four stepping-in-place gaits and one diagonally symmetric ambling
gait at 0.35 m/s on a quadrupedal robot --- the Vision 60, with 36 state
variables and 12 control inputs --- both in simulation and through outdoor

planning using full-body dynamics, without the need for empirical model
simplification, wherein methods from dynamic bipedal walking can be directly
applied to quadrupeds.

from generating the dataset of reference calculations to the construction of

model. We will use the symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML)
framework due to its ability to reconstruct complex high-dimensional
potential-energy surfaces (PES) with high precision even when using just a few
hundreds of molecular conformations for training. The data efficiency of the
sGDML model allows using reference atomic forces computed with high-level
wavefunction-based approaches, such as the $gold$ $standard$ coupled cluster
method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)). We
demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML framework captures local and
non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, lone pairs, steric
repulsion, changes in hybridization states (e.g. $sp^2 \rightleftharpoons
sp^3$), $n\to\pi^*$ interactions, and proton transfer) without imposing any
restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML
models trained for different molecular structures at different levels of theory
(e.g. density functional theory and CCSD(T)) provides empirical evidence that a
higher level of theory generates a smoother PES. Additionally, a careful
analysis of molecular dynamics simulations yields new qualitative insights into
dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic
accuracy.

address settings where such symmetry is broken and unveil a number of

polarization separable states that occur in symmetric settings cease to exist.
The polar symmetry-breaking has stronger effects and transforms the BICs'

thresholds and $P$-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other
devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we
review simple aids to statistical interpretations. These aids emphasize logical
and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to
common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions. We use the Shannon
transform of the $P$-value $p$, also known as the binary surprisal or $S$-value
$s=-\log_{2}(p)$, to measure the information supplied by the testing procedure,
and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin
tossing. We also use tables or graphs of test statistics for alternative
hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart
fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. Finally, we reinterpret
$P$-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe
compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We
illustrate these methods with a reanalysis of data from an existing
record-based cohort study. In line with other recent recommendations, we advise
that teaching materials and research reports discuss $P$-values as measures of
compatibility rather than significance, compute $P$-values for alternative
hypotheses whenever they are computed for null hypotheses, and interpret
interval estimates as showing values of high compatibility with data, rather
than regions of confidence. Our recommendations emphasize cognitive devices for
displaying the compatibility of the observed data with various hypotheses of
interest, rather than focusing on single hypothesis tests or interval
estimates. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they
require.

gallery of uncropped scene images. Different from person re-identification
(re-ID), its performance also depends on the localization accuracy of a
pedestrian detector. The state-of-the-art methods train the detector
individually, and the detected bounding boxes may be sub-optimal for the
following re-ID task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a re-ID driven
localization refinement framework for providing the refined detection boxes for
person search. Specifically, we develop a differentiable ROI transform layer to
effectively transform the bounding boxes from the original images. Thus, the
box coordinates can be supervised by the re-ID training other than the original
detection task. With this supervision, the detector can generate more reliable
bounding boxes, and the downstream re-ID model can produce more discriminative
embeddings based on the refined person localizations. Extensive experimental
results on the widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art person search methods.

(auxiliary) assumptions that are rarely delineated or explicitly interrogated.
These include not only the usual modeling assumptions, but also deeper
assumptions about the data-generating mechanism that are implicit in
conventional statistical interpretations yet are unrealistic in most health,
medical and social research. We provide arguments and methods for
reinterpreting statistics such as P-values and interval estimates in
unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of observations with an
entire set of underlying assumptions, rather than with a narrow target
hypothesis conditional on the assumptions. Emphasizing unconditional
interpretations helps avoid overconfident and misleading inferences in light of
uncertainties about the assumptions used to arrive at the statistical results.
These include not only mathematical assumptions, but also those about absence
of systematic errors, protocol violations, and data corruption. Unconditional
descriptions introduce assumption uncertainty directly into the primary
statistical interpretations of results, rather than leaving it for the
discussion of limitations after presentation of conditional interpretations.
The unconditional approach does not entail different methods or calculations,
only different interpretation of the usual results. We view use of
unconditional description as a vital component of effective statistical
training and presentation. By interpreting statistical outputs in unconditional
terms, researchers can avoid making overconfident statements based on
statistical outputs. Instead, reports should emphasize the compatibility of
results with a range of plausible explanations, including assumption
violations.

orbital evolution of Jupiter Trojan asteroids. Methods. Clones of the observed
population with different sizes and different thermal properties were
numerically integrated for 1 Gyr with and without the Yarkovsky effect. The
escape rate of these objects from the Trojan region as well as changes in the
libration amplitude, eccentricity, and inclination were used as a metric of the
strength of the Yarkovsky effect on the Trojan orbits. Results. Objects with
radii $R\leq$1 km are significantly influenced by the Yarkovsky force. The
effect causes a depletion of these objects over timescales of a few hundred
million years. As a consequence, we expect the size-frequency distribution of
small Trojans to show a shallower slope than that of the currently observable
population ($R$ $\gtrsim$ 1 km), with a turning point between $R$ = 100 m and
$R$ = 1 km. The effect of the Yarkovsky acceleration on the orbits of Trojans
depends on the sense of rotation in a complex way. The libration amplitude of
prograde rotators decreases with time while the eccentricity increases.
Retrograde rotators experience the opposite effect, which results in retrograde
rotators being ejected faster from the 1:1 resonance region. Furthermore, for
objects affected by the Yarkovsky force, we find indications that the effect
tends to smooth out the differences in the orbital distribution between the two
clouds.

Here, we propose a first step in that direction by unveiling and characterizing
the patterns and symbolic dynamics originating from the nonlinear chaotic
time-resolved electrical signals generated experimentally by a nanocontact
vortex oscillator (NCVO). We use advanced filtering methods to dissociate
nonlinear deterministic patterns from thermal fluctuations and show that the
emergence of chaos results in the unpredictable alternation of simple
oscillatory patterns controlled by the NCVO's core-polarity switching. With
phase-space reconstruction techniques, we perform a symbolic analysis of the
time series to assess the level of complexity and entropy generated in the
chaotic regime. We find that at the centre of its incommensurate region, it can
exhibit maximal entropy and complexity. This suggests that NCVOs are promising
nonlinear nanoscale source of entropy that could be harnessed for information

appears in a variety of geoscience applications. A common discretization
strategy for these problems is a continuous Galerkin finite element scheme for
the momentum balance equations and a finite volume scheme for the mass balance
equations. When applied within a fully-implicit solution strategy, however,
this discretization is not intrinsically stable. In the limit of small time
steps or low permeabilities, spurious oscillations in the pressure field, i.e.
checkerboarding, may be observed. Further, eigenvalues associated with the
spurious modes will control the conditioning of the matrices and can
dramatically degrade the convergence rate of iterative linear solvers. Here, we
propose a stabilization technique in which the balance of mass equations are
supplemented with stabilizing flux terms on a macroelement basis. The
additional stabilization terms are dependent on a stabilization parameter. We
identify an optimal value for this parameter using an analysis of the
eigenvalue distribution of the macroelement Schur complement matrix. The
resulting method is simple to implement and preserves the underlying sparsity
pattern of the original discretization. Another appealing feature of the method
is that mass is exactly conserved on macroelements, despite the addition of
artificial fluxes. The efficacy of the proposed technique is demonstrated with

horizon. As such, the validity of strong cosmic censorship is tied to how
effectively the exterior damps fluctuations. In this thesis we will perform a
quantitative stability analysis of Cauchy horizons in electrically charged
black holes immersed in a de Sitter Universe. We will provide strong numerical
evidence which designate that the (linear analog of) strong cosmic censorship
is violated by near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter black holes.
Moreover, we shall investigate a superradiant instability in $d-$dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter black holes and show that the increment of
dimensions decreases the timescale of the instability.

motivated a theoretical framework consisting of layers of control loops with

explains why the errors from two control loops -- one fast but inaccurate
reflexive layer that corrects for bumps, and a planning layer that is slow but
accurate -- are additive, and show how the errors in each control loop can be
decomposed into the errors caused by the limited speeds and accuracies of the

approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions,
the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of
existing non-minimal solvers. In this paper, we enable the simultaneous use of
non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose
approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem
where a non-minimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end,
we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier
processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and
show that graduated non-convexity (GNC) can be used in conjunction with
non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial
guess. Although GNC's global optimality cannot be guaranteed, we demonstrate
the empirical robustness of the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in
applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph
optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape
alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80% of outliers, outperform RANSAC,
are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized

peak travel to incentivise driver participation and balance supply and demand

Combinatorial double auctions have been identified as a suitable alternative,
as they can achieve maximum social welfare in the allocation by relying on
customers and drivers stating their valuations. A shortcoming of current
models, however, is that they fail to account for the effects of trip detours
that take place in shared trips and their impact on the accuracy of pricing
estimates. To resolve this, we formulate a new shared-ride assignment and
pricing algorithm using combinatorial double auctions. We demonstrate that this
model is reduced to a maximum weighted independent set model, which is known to
be APX-hard. A fast local search heuristic is also presented, which is capable
of producing results that lie within 10% of the exact approach for practical
implementations. Our proposed algorithm could be used as a fast and reliable

another on a scattering trajectory, we might expect the tidal interaction to
spin up each black hole. We present the first exploration of this effect,
appearing at fourth post-Newtonian order, with full numerical relativity
calculations. The basic setup for the calculations involves two free
parameters: the initial boost of each black hole and the initial angle between
the velocity vectors and a line connecting the centers of the black holes, with
zero angle corresponding to a head-on trajectory. To minimize gauge effects, we
measure final spins only if the black holes reach a final separation of at
least $20M$. Fixing the initial boost, we find that as the initial angle
decreases toward the scattering/nonscattering limit, the spin-up grows
nonlinearly. In addition, as initial boosts are increased from $0.42c$ to
$0.78c$, the largest observed final dimensionless spin on each black hole
increases nonlinearly from $0.02$ to $0.20$. Based on these results, we
conclude that much higher spin-ups may be possible with larger boosts, although
achieving this will require improved numerical techniques.

based on two RR Lyrae stars. The system is faint (Mv = -2.8+0.2-0.3 mag) and
compact (r = 11.4+-1.0 pc). From the spectroscopy, we constrain the systemic
metallicity ([Fe/H]spectro = -1.8+-0.1 dex) but the metallicity and velocity
dispersions are both unresolved. Using Gaia DR2, we infer a mean proper motion
of (mu_alpha, mu_delta) = (0.51+-0.28, -0.83+-0.27) mas yr-1, which, combined

halo orbit with a pericenter and apocenter of 40.7+5.6-14.7 and 85.6+17.2-5.9

dramatic change in cosmic star-formation rate between $z\sim 2$ and the present

which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due
to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO
absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a
census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this
work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA
calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one
intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are
detected. However, thanks to the large redshift path surveyed ($\Delta z=182$),
we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function
beyond $z\sim 0$. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H$_2$) >
10$^{16}$ atoms~cm$^{-2}$, five orders of magnitude lower than in previous
studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show
that our upper limits of $\rho ({\rm H}_2)\lesssim 10^{8.3} \text{M}_{\odot}
\text{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $0 < z \leq 1.7$ already provide new constraints on current
theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results
are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to

depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to $z\sim 2$.

to $r$=21, matched to SDSS/DR13, and morphological parameters. The metric of
importance is defined as the relative decrease of the initial accuracy when all
correlations related to a certain feature is vanished. In general, the broad
photometric bands presented higher importance when compared to narrow ones. The
influence of the morphological parameters has been evaluated training the RF
with and without the inclusion of morphological parameters, presenting accuracy
values of 95.0\% and 88.1\%, respectively. Particularly, the morphological
parameter {\rm FWHM/PSF} performed the highest importance over all features to
distinguish between stars and galaxies, indicating that it is crucial to
classify objects into stars and galaxies. We investigate the misclassification
of stars and galaxies in the broad-band colour-colour diagram $(g-r)$ versus
$(r-i)$. The morphology can notably improve the classification of objects at
regions in the diagram where the misclassification was relatively high.
Consequently, it provides cleaner samples for statistical studies. The expected
contamination rate of red galaxies as a function of the redshift is estimated,
providing corrections for red galaxy samples. The classification of QSOs as
extragalactic objects is slightly better using photometric-only case. An
extragalactic point-source catalogue is provided using the classification
without any morphology feature (only the SED information) with additional
constraints on photometric redshifts and {\rm FWHM/PSF} values.

deep underground detectors, are challenged by an almost complete loss of
sensitivity for light dark matter particles. Consequently, there is a
significant effort in the community to devise new methods and experiments to
overcome these difficulties, constantly pushing the limits of the lowest dark
matter mass that can be probed this way. From a model-building perspective, the
scattering of sub-GeV dark matter on nucleons essentially must proceed via new
light mediator particles, given that collider searches place extremely
stringent bounds on contact-type interactions. Here we present an updated
compilation of relevant limits for the case of a scalar mediator, including a
new estimate of the near-future sensitivity of the NA62 experiment as well as a
detailed evaluation of the model-specific limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
We also derive updated and more general limits on DM particles upscattered by
cosmic rays, applicable to arbitrary energy- and momentum dependences of the
scattering cross section. Finally we stress that dark matter self-interactions,
when evaluated beyond the common s-wave approximation, place stringent limits
independently of the dark matter production mechanism. These are, for the
relevant parameter space, generically comparable to those that apply in the
commonly studied freeze-out case. We conclude that the combination of existing
(or expected) constraints from accelerators and astrophysics, combined with
cosmological requirements, puts robust limits on the maximally possible nuclear
scattering rate. In most regions of parameter space these are at least

remarkable defining trait of topologically ordered systems. In this work, we
investigate the experimentally relevant finite temperature regime in which one
species of quasiparticle acts as a stochastic background for another, more
energetically costly, species that hops coherently across the lattice. The
nontrivial statistical angle between the two species leads to interference
effects that we study using a combination of numerical and analytical tools. In
the limit of self-retracing paths, we are able to use a Bethe lattice
approximation to construct exact analytical expressions for the time evolution
of the site-resolved density profile of a spinon initially confined to a single
site. Our results help us to understand the temperature-dependent crossover
from ballistic to quantum (sub-)diffusive behaviour as a consequence of
destructive interference between lattice walks. The subdiffusive behaviour is
most pronounced in the case of semionic mutual statistics, and it may be
ascribed to the localised nature of the effective tight-binding description, an
effect that is not captured by the Bethe lattice mapping. In addition to
quantum spin liquids, our results are directly applicable to the dynamics of
isolated holes in the large-$U$ limit of the Hubbard model, relevant to
ultracold atomic experiments. A recent proposal to implement $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topologically ordered Hamiltonians using quantum annealers provides a further
exciting avenue to test our results.

there exists a unique order-two static crystalline symmetry/antisymmetry, such
that the two symmetries/antisymmetries give rise to the same topological

populations produced in low metallicity environments should be more X-ray
luminous, a trend supported by studies of nearby galaxies. This trend may be
responsible for the observed increase of the X-ray luminosity
($L_{\mathrm{X}}$) per star formation rate (SFR) with redshift due to the
decrease of metallicity ($Z$) at fixed stellar mass as a function of redshift.
To test this hypothesis, we use a sample of 79 $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies
with oxygen abundance measurements from the MOSDEF survey, which obtained
rest-frame optical spectra for $\sim1500$ galaxies in the CANDELS fields at
$1.37<z<3.80$. Using Chandra data from the AEGIS-X Deep, Deep Field North, and
Deep Field South surveys, we stack the X-ray data at the galaxy locations in
bins of redshift and $Z$ because the galaxies are too faint to be individually
detected. In agreement with previous studies, the average $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR
of our $z\sim2$ galaxy sample is enhanced by $\approx0.4-0.8$ dex relative to
local HMXB $L_{\mathrm{X}}$-SFR scaling relations. Splitting our sample by $Z$,
we find that $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR and $Z$ are anti-correlated with 97%
confidence. This observed $Z$ dependence for HMXB-dominated galaxies is
consistent both with the local $L_{\mathrm{X}}$-SFR-$Z$ relation and a subset
of population synthesis models. Although the statistical significance of the
observed trends is weak due to the low X-ray statistics, these results
constitute the first direct evidence connecting the redshift evolution of
$L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR and the $Z$ dependence of HMXBs.

monopoles under translation symmetries. Specifically, in $2d$ the monopole is a
source of $2\pi$-flux, and the polarization is determined by the crystal
momentum of the $2\pi$-flux. In $3d$ the polarization is determined by the
projective representation of translation symmetries on Dirac monopoles. Our
approach also leads to a concrete scheme to calculate polarization in $2d$,

facilities, continuum reverberation mapping is becoming of increasing
importance to measure the physical size of quasar accretion disks. The method
is based on the measurement of the time it takes for a signal to propagate from
the center to the outer parts of the central engine, assuming the continuum
light curve at a given wavelength has a time shift of the order of a few days
with respect to light curves obtained at shorter wavelengths. We show that with
high-quality light curves, this assumption is not valid anymore and that light
curves at different wavelengths are not only shifted in time but also
distorted: in the context of the lamp-post model and thin-disk geometry, the
multi-band light curves are in fact convolved by a transfer function whose size
increase with wavelength. We illustrate the effect with simulated light curves
in the LSST ugrizy bands and examine the impact on the delay measurements when
using three different methods, namely JAVELIN, CREAM, and PyCS. We find that
current accretion disk sizes estimated from JAVELIN and PyCS are underestimated
by $\sim30\%$ and that unbiased measurement are only obtained with methods that
properly take the skewed transfer functions into account, as the CREAM code
does. With the LSST-like light curves, we expect to achieve measurement errors
below $5\%$ with typical 2-day photometric cadence.

driven by the radiation pressure from the AGN. The dusty wind feeds back mass
into the galaxy at a rate of the order of ~0.1-100 $M_\odot$/yr, depending on

  Multi-Cell NOMA with Load Coupling",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this technical note, we present a new theoretical result for resource
optimization with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For multi-cell
scenarios, a so-called load-coupling model has been proposed to characterize
the presence of mutual interference for NOMA, and resource optimization relies
on the use of fixed-point iterations [1], [2] across cells. One difficulty here
is that the order of decoding for successive interference cancellation (SIC) in
NOMA is generally not known a priori. This is because the decoding order in one
cell depends on interference, which, in turn, is governed by resource
allocation in other cells, and vice versa. To achieve convergence, previous
works have used workarounds that pose restrictions to NOMA, such that the SIC
decoding order remains in optimization. As a comment to [1], [2], we derive and
prove the following result: The convergence is guaranteed, even if the order
changes over the iterations. The result not only waives the need of previous
workarounds, but also implies that a wide class of resource optimization
problems for multi-cell NOMA is tractable, as long as that for single cell is.

to its ability to focus energy towards desired spatial locations. In this
paper, the overall power transfer efficiency (PTE) and the energy efficiency
(EE) of a wireless-powered massive MIMO system is investigated where a
multi-antenna base-station (BS) uses wireless energy transfer to charge
single-antenna energy harvesting users on the downlink. The users may exploit
the harvested energy to transmit information to the BS on the uplink. The
overall system performance is analyzed while accounting for the nonlinear
nature of practical energy harvesters. First, for wireless energy transfer, the
PTE is characterized using a scalable model for the BS circuit power
consumption. The PTE-optimal number of BS antennas and users are derived. Then,
for wireless energy and information transfer, the EE performance is
characterized. The EE-optimal BS transmit power is derived in terms of the key
system parameters such as the number of BS antennas and the number of users. As
the number of antennas becomes large, increasing the transmit power improves
the energy efficiency for moderate to large number of antennas. Simulation
results suggest that it is energy efficient to operate the system in the
massive antenna regime.

account Landau-quantization effects in matter, we calculate hybrid magnetised
equations of state and some associated quantities, such as particle abundances
and matter magnetisation, for different sets of parameters and different
magnetic field strengths. Moreover, we compute the magnetised stable stellar

the $\sim 2M_\odot$ pulsars and the data obtained from GW170817. In addition,
we study the stability of stellar configurations assuming that slow and rapid
phase transitions occur at the sharp hadron-quark interface. We find that,
unlike in the rapid transition scenario, where $\partial M/\partial \epsilon_c
< 0$ is a sufficient condition for instability, in the slow transition scenario
there exists a connected extended stable branch beyond the maximum mass star,
for which $\partial M/\partial \epsilon_c < 0$. Finally, analysing the
gravitational mass versus baryon mass relationship, we have calculated the
energy released in transitions between stable stellar configurations. We find
that the inclusion of the magnetic field and the existence of new stable

return of an asset and the changes in its volatility. There is broad agreement
in the literature that the effect should be present for theoretical reasons,
and it has been consistently found in empirical work. However, a few papers
have pointed out a puzzle: the return distributions of many assets do not
appear to be affected by the leverage effect. We analyze the determinants of
the return distribution and find that the impact of the leverage effect comes
primarily from an interaction between the leverage effect and the
mean-reversion effect. When the leverage effect is large and the mean-reversion
effect is small, then the interaction exerts a strong effect on the return
distribution. However, if the mean-reversion effect is large, even a large
leverage effect has little effect on the return distribution. To better
understand the impact of the interaction effect, we propose an indirect method
to measure it. We apply our methodology to empirical data and find that the S&P
500 data exhibits a weak interaction effect, and consequently its returns
distribution is little impacted by the leverage effect. Furthermore, the
interaction effect is closely related to the size factor: small firms tend to
have a strong interaction effect and large firms tend to have a weak
interaction effect.

uniform steady-state simple shear applied at a fixed volume and a fixed finite
strain rate $\dot\gamma$. Energy dissipation is via a viscous drag with respect
to a uniformly sheared host fluid, giving a simple model for flow in a
non-Brownian suspension with Newtonian rheology. Considering a range of packing
fractions $\phi$ and particle asphericities $\alpha$ at small $\dot\gamma$, we
study the angular rotation $\dot\theta_i$ and the nematic orientational
ordering $\mathbf{S}_2$ of the particles induced by the shear flow, finding a
non-monotonic behavior as the packing $\phi$ is varied. We interpret this
non-monotonic behavior as a crossover from a small $\phi$ region where
single-particle-like behavior occurs, to a large $\phi$ region where the
geometry of the dense packing dominates, the reduced free volume inhibits
motion, and a random Poisson-like process for particle rotations results. We
also argue that the finite nematic ordering $\mathbf{S}_2$ is a consequence of
the shearing serving as an ordering field, rather than a result of long-ranged
cooperative behavior among the particles. We arrive at these conclusions by
consideration of (i) the distribution of waiting times for a particle to rotate
by $\pi$, (ii) the behavior of the system under pure, as compared to simple,
shearing, (iii) the relaxation of the nematic order parameter $\mathbf{S}_2$
when perturbed away from the steady state, and (iv) by construction a numerical
mean-field model for the rotational motion of a particle. Our results also help
to explain the singular behavior observed when taking the $\alpha\to 0$ limit
approaching circular disks.

4.23 days). However only an upper limit was placed on the planet mass (<1.3
Mj), and a highly uncertain planetary radius (0.7-1.7 Rj) was determined. We
aim to better characterise both the star and the planet and precisely measure
their orbital and physical parameters. In order to constrain the mass of the

joined them with those from the discovery paper. Photometric data from the
HATSouth survey and new multi-band, high-quality (precision reached up to
0.37~mmag) photometric follow-up observations of transit events were acquired
and analysed for getting accurate photometric parameters. We fit the model to
all the observations, including data from the TESS space telescope, in two
different modes: incorporating the stellar isochrones into the fit, and using
an empirical method to get the stellar parameters. The two modes resulted to be
consistent with each other to within 2 sigma. We confirm the grazing nature of
the WASP-174b transits with a confidence level greater than 5 sigma, which is
also corroborated by simultaneously observing the transit through four optical
bands and noting how the transit depth changes due to the limb-darkening
effect. We estimate that ~76% of the disk of the planet actually eclipses the
parent star at mid-transit of its transit events. We find that WASP-174b is a
highly-inflated hot giant planet with a mass of 0.330 Mj and a radius of 1.435
Rj, and is therefore a good target for transmission-spectroscopy observations.
With a density of 0.135 g/cm^3, it is amongst the lowest-density planets ever
discovered with precisely measured mass and radius.

tokamak plasma via the application of a static, externally generated, resonant
magnetic perturbation (RMP) is presented. This theory is based on the plausible
hypothesis that mode penetration at the top of the pedestal is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the RMP-induced suppression of ELMs. The theory also
makes use of a number of key insights gained in a recent publication
(Fitzpatrick R 2019). The first insight is that the response of the plasma to a
particular helical component of the RMP, in the immediate vicinity of the
associated resonant surface, is governed by nonlinear magnetic island physics,
rather than by linear layer physics. The second insight is that neoclassical
effects play a vital role in the physics of RMP-induced ELM suppression. The
final insight is that plasma impurities play an important role in the physics
of RMP-induced ELM suppression. The theory presented in this paper is employed
to gain a better understanding ELM suppression in DIII-D and ITER H-mode
discharges. It is found that ELM suppression is only possible when q_95 takes
values that lie in certain narrow windows. Moreover, the widths of these
windows decrease with increasing plasma density. Assuming a core plasma
rotation of 20 krad/s, the window width for a model ITER H-mode discharge is
found to be similar to, but slightly smaller than, the window width in a
typical DIII-D H-mode discharge.

gauge field along with chiral fields needed for the Stueckelberg mechanism to
operate and discuss the mixing between the hidden and the visible sectors. Here
if the stau is the lightest sparticle in the MSSM sector and the neutralino of
the hidden sector is the LSP of the full system and a dark matter candidate,
the stau can be long-lived and decay inside an LHC detector tracker. In the
second case we include extra vectorlike matter in the hidden sector which can
give rise to a Dirac fermion in addition to the two neutralinos in the hidden
sector. The neutralino sector now has six neutralinos and we assume that the
lightest of these is the LSP and is higgsino-like. In this case the dark matter
is constituted of a Majorana and a Dirac fermion, and a small $\mu$ leads to
heavy Higgs boson masses which reside in the observable range of HL-LHC and

We then show a much stronger result that if the gap distribution has a moment
generating function with large enough radius of convergence, then every large
enough multiple of the gcd of gap values can be written as a sum of $m$
distinct weights for any fixed $m \geq 2$.

only accurate under idealized conditions, and further show that when

electrical power density, by increasing the short-circuit current. To
practically illustrate these findings, we focus on surface polariton-mediated
near-field TPVs. We propose a versatile design strategy for broadening the
emission spectrum via stacking of multiple plasmonic thin film layers. As an
example, we consider a realistic ITO/InAs TPV, and predict a conversion
efficiency of $50\%$ simultaneously with a power density of nearly $80$

The structure of the embedded material was determined by x-ray diffraction

the etching of the PS surface before the ZnTe growth has two main effects: the
increase of the porosity and enhancing the reactivity of the inner surface. It
was observed that both effects benefit the filling process of the pores. Since
RBS and EDS cannot detect the porosity in the present system, we explore the

that spatial integration can be achieved by establishing interdependencies

distributed group of nodes. A key consensus problem in blockchains is that of
determining the next block (data element) in the sequence. Many blockchains
address this by electing a new node to propose each new block. The new block is
(typically) appended to the tip of the proposer's local blockchain, and
subsequently broadcast to the rest of the network. Without network delay (or
adversarial behavior), this procedure would give a perfect chain, since each
proposer would have the same view of the blockchain. A major challenge in
practice is forking. Due to network delays, a proposer may not yet have the
most recent block, and may, therefore, create a side chain that branches from
the middle of the main chain. Forking reduces throughput, since only one a
single main chain can survive, and all other blocks are discarded. We propose a
new P2P protocol for blockchains called Barracuda, in which each proposer,
prior to proposing a block, polls $\ell$ other nodes for their local blocktree
information. Under a stochastic network model, we prove that this lightweight
primitive improves throughput as if the entire network were a factor of $\ell$
faster. We provide guidelines on how to implement Barracuda in practice,
guaranteeing robustness against several real-world factors.

deriving a series solution for the transient evolution that recovers previous
results in the appropriate limits. This solution shows a transition in solute
transport behavior from early to late time that is captured by the first- and
zeroth-order terms. Mean solute transport velocity is increased at early times
and reduced at late times, while solute dispersion is initially reduced, but
shows a complex dependence on the partition coefficient $k$ at late times. In
the equilibrium sorption model, the time scale of the early regime and the
duration of the transition to the late regime both increase with $\text{ln} k$
for large $k$. The early regime is pronounced in strongly-sorbing systems
($k\gg 1$). The kinetic sorption model shows a similar transition from the
early to the late transport regime and recovers the equilibrium results when
adsorption and desorption rates are large. As the reaction rates slow down, the
duration of the early regime increases, but the changes in transport velocity
and dispersion relative to a tracer diminish. In general, if the partition
coefficient $k$ is large, the early regime is well-developed and the behavior
is well characterized by the analysis of the limiting case without desorption.

coincident with shock/radio lobe impact; 3) jet activity ceased well before
shock arrival (a ""radio phoenix"" scenario). The simulations follow relativistic
electrons (CRe) introduced by the jets, enabling synthetic radio synchrotron
images and spectra. Such encounters can be decomposed into an abrupt shock
transition and a subsequent long term post shock wind. Shock impact disrupts
the pre-formed, low density RG cavities into two ring vortices embedded in the
post shock wind. Dynamical processes cause the vortex pair to merge as they
propagate downwind somewhat faster than the wind itself. When the AGN jets
remain active ram pressure bends the jets downwind, generating a narrow angle
tail morphology aligned with the axis of the vortex ring. The deflected jets do
not significantly alter dynamical evolution of the vortex ring. However, active
jets and their associated tails do dominate the synchrotron emission,
compromising the observability of the vortex structures. Downwind-directed
momentum concentrated by the jets impacts and alters the post-encounter shock.
In the ""radio phoenix"" scenario, no DSA of the fossil electron population is
required to account for the observed brightening and flattening of the spectra,
adiabatic compression effects are sufficient.

emission can become non-Gaussian and often exhibits two distinct peaks.
Traditional line-fitting techniques can fail to account adequately for these
double-peaked profiles, providing inaccurate cloud kinematics measurements. We
present a new method called Convnet Line-fitting Of Velocities in Emission-line
Regions (CLOVER) for distinguishing between one-component, two-component, and
noise-only emission lines using 1D convolutional neural networks trained with
synthetic spectral cubes. CLOVER utilizes spatial information in spectral cubes
by predicting on $3\times3$ pixel sub-cubes, using both the central pixel's
spectrum and the average spectrum over the $3\times3$ grid as input. On an
unseen set of 10,000 synthetic spectral cubes in each predicted class, CLOVER
has classification accuracies of $\sim99\%$ for the one-component class and
$\sim97\%$ for the two-component class. For the noise-only class, which is
analogous to a signal-to-noise cutoff of four for traditional line-fitting
methods, CLOVER has classification accuracy of $100\%$. CLOVER also has
exceptional performance on real observations, correctly distinguishing between
the three classes across a variety of star-forming regions. In addition, CLOVER
quickly and accurately extracts kinematics directly from spectra identified as
two-component class members. Moreover, we show that CLOVER is easily scalable
to emission lines with hyperfine splitting, making it an attractive tool in the
new era of large-scale NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ mapping surveys.

ranks defined using the theory of measure transportation. Unlike other existing
proposals in the literature, these multivariate ranks share a number of useful
properties with the usual one-dimensional ranks; most importantly, these ranks
are distribution-free. This crucial observation allows us to design
nonparametric tests that are exactly distribution-free under the null
hypothesis. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach by constructing
exact distribution-free tests for two classical nonparametric problems: (i)
testing for mutual independence between random vectors, and (ii) testing for
the equality of multivariate distributions. In particular, we propose
(multivariate) rank versions of distance covariance (Sz\'ekely et al., 2007)
and energy statistic (Sz\'ekely and Rizzo, 2013) for testing scenarios (i) and
(ii) respectively. In both these problems, we derive the asymptotic null
distribution of the proposed test statistics. We further show that our tests
are consistent against all fixed alternatives. Moreover, the proposed tests are
tuning-free, computationally feasible and are well-defined under minimal
assumptions on the underlying distributions (e.g., they do not need any moment
assumptions). We also demonstrate the efficacy of these procedures via
extensive simulations. In the process of analyzing the theoretical properties
of our procedures, we end up proving some new results in the theory of measure
transportation and in the limit theory of permutation statistics using Stein's

equations (PDEs) poses interesting challenges not seen in flat space. The
discretization of these PDEs typically proceeds by either parametrizing the
surface, triangulating the surface, or embedding the surface in a higher
dimensional flat space. The closest point method (CPM) is an embedding method
that represents surfaces using a function that maps points in the embedding
space to their closest points on the surface. In the CPM, this mapping also
serves as an extension operator that brings surface intrinsic data onto the
embedding space, allowing PDEs to be numerically approximated by standard
methods in a narrow tubular neighborhood of the surface. We focus here on
numerically approximating the positive Helmholtz equation,
$\left(c-\Delta_\mathcal{S}\right)u=f,~c\in\mathbb{R}^+$ by the CPM paired with
finite differences. This yields a large, sparse, and non-symmetric system to
solve. Herein, we develop restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) and optimized
restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) solvers and preconditioners for this
discrete system. In particular, we develop a general strategy for computing
overlapping partitions of the computational domain, as well as defining the
corresponding Dirichlet and Robin transmission conditions. We demonstrate that
the convergence of the ORAS solvers and preconditioners can be improved by
using a modified transmission condition where more than two overlapping
subdomains meet. Numerical experiments are provided for a variety of analytical
and triangulated surfaces. We find that ORAS solvers and preconditioners
outperform their RAS counterparts, and that using domain decomposition as a
preconditioner gives faster convergence over using it as a solver, as expected.
The methods exhibit good parallel scalability over the range of process counts

asymmetric imperfect-information games, where the joint reward could depend on
the uncertain opponent type (a private information known only to the opponent
itself and its ally). In order to maximize the reward, the protagonist agent
has to infer the opponent type through agent modeling. We use multiagent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to learn opponent models through self-play, which
captures the full strategy interaction and reasoning between agents. However,
agent policies learned from self-play can suffer from mutual overfitting.
Ensemble training methods can be used to improve the robustness of agent policy
against different opponents, but it also significantly increases the
computational overhead. In order to achieve a good trade-off between the
robustness of the learned policy and the computation complexity, we propose to
train a separate opponent policy against the protagonist agent for evaluation
purposes. The reward achieved by this opponent is a noisy measure of the
robustness of the protagonist agent policy due to the intrinsic stochastic
nature of a reinforcement learner. To handle this stochasticity, we apply a
stochastic optimization scheme to dynamically update the opponent ensemble to
optimize an objective function that strikes a balance between robustness and
computation complexity. We empirically show that, under the same limited
computational budget, the proposed method results in more robust policy
learning than standard ensemble training.

characterized by a relatively low reactivity and so the intensity of the
combustion waves is moderate. Herewith, it is found that the flame can be
noticeably accelerated in the presence of suspended micro-droplets. In
particular, it is shown that the interaction between the flame front and the
droplets with a diameter larger than 25~$\mu$m results in the enhancement of
the flame instability that provides a substantial acceleration of the mixture
burn-out process. At increased number density of water droplets the combustion
proceeds in a similar way to the combustion within a porous medium, and similar
trends are observed such as the increase in flame speed and intensification of
the combustion process with the pressure increasing inside the confined vessel.
In such a way it can be concluded that the water should be atomized in a proper
way when attempting to use it as hydrogen explosion inhibitor. Otherwise, water
droplets could induce flame acceleration via the mechanisms distinguished in

where the square of the potential looks like a double bump function,
eigenvalues split in pairs exponentially close to reference points on the

spread unfounded rumors and create misinformation campaigns during recent

this problem, such as reducing the limit for forwarding a message to at most
five users at once. Despite the welcomed effort to counter the problem, there
is no evidence so far on the real effectiveness of such restrictions. In this

and often occur with probabilistic connections due to both intrinsic
stochasticity and disordered environments. Sparse non-Hermitian random matrices
arise naturally in this context, and are key to describing statistical
properties of the non-equilibrium dynamics that emerges from interactions
within the network structure. Here, we study one-dimensional (1d) spatial
structures and focus on sparse non-Hermitian random matrices in the spirit of
tight-binding models in solid state physics. We first investigate two-point
eigenvalue correlations in the complex plane for sparse non-Hermitian random
matrices using methods developed for the statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous
2d interacting particles. We find that eigenvalue repulsion in the complex
plane directly correlates with eigenvector delocalization. In addition, for 1d
chains and rings with both disordered nearest neighbor connections and
self-interactions, the self-interaction disorder tends to de-correlate
eigenvalues and localize eigenvectors more than simple hopping disorder.
However, remarkable resistance to eigenvector localization by disorder is
provided by large cycles, such as those embodied in 1d periodic boundary
conditions under strong directional bias. The directional bias also spatially
separates the left and right eigenvectors, leading to interesting dynamics in
excitation and response. These phenomena have important implications for
asymmetric random networks and highlight a need for mathematical tools to
describe and understand them analytically.

broken mirror symmetry. This is in contrast with the persistent heat current,
which is a uniquely non-reciprocal effect that can not exist in any reciprocal
system. Nevertheless, for a specific class of systems with $C_4$ rotational
symmetry, we note that the photon thermal Hall effect is uniquely
nonreciprocal, and moreover there is a direct connection between the persistent
heat current and the photon thermal Hall effect. In the near-equilibrium
regime, the magnitude of the photon thermal Hall effect is proportional to the
temperature derivative of the persistent heat current in such systems.
Therefore, the persistent heat current as predicted for the equilibrium

that slowly releases oil from its gelator matrix. Because the rate of release
determines the operation time of the bearing, we study this release process by
measuring the amount of extracted oil as a function of time, while we use
absorbing paper, to speed up the process. The oil concentration in the
resulting stain is determined by measuring the attenuation of light transmitted
through the paper, using a modified Lambert-Beer law. For grease the timescale
for paper imbibition is typically 2 orders of magnitude larger than for a bare
drop of the same base oil. This difference results from the high affinity, \it
i.e. wetting energy per unit volume, of the oil for the grease matrix. To
quantify this affinity, we developed a Washburn-like model describing the oil
flow from the porous grease into the paper pores. The stain radius versus time
curves for greases at various levels of oil content collapse onto a single
master curve, which allows us to extract a characteristic spreading time and
the corresponding oil-matrix affinity. Lowering the oil content results in a
small increase of the oil-matrix affinity yet in a significant change in the
spreading timescale. Even an affinity increase by a few per mill doubles the
timescale.

Programming (MINLP) problems, and some prominent examples include portfolio
optimization, remote sensing technology, and so on. Most of the models for
these applications are non-convex and always involve some conflicting
objectives. The mathematical and heuristic methods have their advantages in
solving this category of problems. In this work, we turn to Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) for finding elegant solutions for such
problems. In this framework, we investigate a multi-objective constrained
portfolio optimization problem, which can be cast as a classical financial
problem and can also be naturally modeled as an MINLP problem. Consequently, we
point out one challenge, faced by a direct coding scheme for MOEAs, to this
problem. It is that the dependence among variables, like the selection and
weights for one same asset, will likely make the search difficult. We thus,
propose a Compressed Coding Scheme (CCS), compressing the two dependent
variables into one variable to utilize the dependence and thereby meeting this
challenge. Subsequently, we carry out a detailed empirical study on two sets of
instances. The first part consists of 5 instances from OR-Library, which is
solvable for the general mathematical optimizer, like CPLEX, while the
remaining 15 instances from NGINX are addressed only by MOEAs. The two
benchmarks, involving the number of assets from 31 to 2235, consistently
indicate that CCS is not only efficient but also robust for dealing with the
constrained multi-objective portfolio optimization.

distribution's population statistics are robust under a certain family of
friendly perturbations. This generalizes a property called resilience
previously employed in the special case of mean estimation with outliers. We
justify the generalized resilience property by showing that it holds under
moment or hypercontractive conditions. Even in the total variation case, these
subsume conditions in the literature for mean estimation, regression, and
covariance estimation; the resulting analysis simplifies and sometimes improves
these known results in both population limit and finite-sample rate. Our robust
estimators are based on minimum distance (MD) functionals (Donoho and Liu,
1988), which project onto a set of distributions under a discrepancy related to
the perturbation. We present two approaches for designing MD estimators with
good finite-sample rates: weakening the discrepancy and expanding the set of

existing and upcoming radio observatories. The signal will be contaminated due
to absorption, the largest component of which will be the flux absorbed by the
HI emitting sources themselves from the flux incident on them from background
radio continuum sources. We, for the first time, provide a quantitative
estimate of the magnitude of the absorbed flux compared to the emitted HI flux
for various voxels placed at redshifts between 0.1 and 2.5. We use a
cosmological sky simulation of the atomic HI emission line, and sum over the
emitted and absorbed fluxes for all sources within voxels at different
redshifts. For estimating the absorbed flux we use various relations based on
existing observations as well as simulations. We find that for the same
co-moving volume of sky, the HI emission falls off quickly with increasing
redshift, while the absorption varies much less with redshift and follows the
redshift distribution of faint sources that dominate the number counts of radio
continuum sources. This results in the fraction of absorption compared to
emission to be negligible in the nearby Universe (up to a redshift of ~0.5),
increases to about 10% at a redshift of 1, and continues to increase to about
30% up to a redshift of 2.5. These numbers can vary significantly due to the
uncertainties on the exact forms of the various relations used, the largest
variation being driven by the uncertainty on the number counts of radio
continuum sources at sub-mJy flux densities. Absorption of flux incident from
background radio continuum sources might become an important contaminant to HI
IM signals beyond redshifts of 0.5, and needs to be quantified more accurately
using inputs from upcoming deep high resolution surveys of radio continuum
sources, HI absorption, and HI emission with the SKA and its precursors.

A crescent configuration is a set of $n$ points in the plane such that: 1) no
three points lie on a common line, 2) no four points lie on a common circle, 3)
for each $1 \leq i \leq n - 1$, there exists a distance which occurs exactly

for which there do not exist crescent configurations of size $n$ for all $n

  We extend the problem of crescent configurations to general normed spaces
$(\mathbb{R}^2, \| \cdot \|)$ by studying strong crescent configurations in $\|
\cdot \|$. In an arbitrary norm $\|\cdot \|$, we construct a strong crescent
configuration of size 4. We also construct larger strong crescent
configurations in the Euclidean, taxicab, and Chebyshev norms, of sizes $n \leq
6$, $n \leq 8$, and $n \leq 8$ respectively. When defining strong crescent
configurations, we introduce the notion of line-like configurations in $\|\cdot

distance graph is isomorphic to the distance graph of equally spaced points on
a line. In a broad class of norms, we construct line-like configurations of
arbitrary size.
  Our main result is a crescent-type result about line-like configurations in
the Chebyshev norm. A line-like crescent configuration is a line-like
configuration for which no three points lie on a common line and no four points
lie on a common $\|\cdot \|$ circle. We prove that for $n \geq 7$, every
line-like crescent configuration of size $n$ in the Chebyshev norm must have a
rigid structure. Specifically, it must be a perpendicular perturbation of
equally spaced points on a horizontal or vertical line.

from the Sun. The flux of type III radio burst has a time profile of rising and
decay phase at a given frequency, which has been actively studied since 1970s.
Several factors that may influence the duration of a type III radio burst has
been proposed. However, the major cause of the duration is still an open
question. In this work, to study the dominant cause of the duration, we
investigate the source positions of the front edge, the peak, and the tail edge
in the dynamic spectrum of a single and clear type III radio burst. The
duration of this type III burst at a given frequency is about 3 second for
decameter wave. The beam-formed observations by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR)
are used, which can provide the radio source positions and the dynamic spectra
at the same time. We find that, for this burst, the source positions of the
front edge, the peak, and the tail edge split with each other spatially. The
radial speed of the front edge, the peak, and the tail edge is 0.42 c, 0.25 c,
and 0.16 c, respectively. We estimate the influences of the corona density
fluctuation and the electron-velocity dispersion on the duration, and the
scattering effect by comparison with a few short-duration bursts from the same
region. The analysis yields that, in the frequency range of 30 - 41 MHz, the
electron-velocity dispersion is the dominant factor that determines the time
duration of type III radio bursts with long duration, while scattering may play
important role in the duration of short bursts.

coexistence of weak turbulence of internal gravity waves and strong turbulence
of eddies. Straightforward application of standard analyses developed in
isotropic turbulence sometimes masks important aspects of the anisotropic
turbulence. To capture detailed structures of the energy distribution in the
wave-number space, it is indispensable to examine the energy distribution with
non-integrated spectra by fixing the codimensional wave-number component or in
the two-dimensional domain spanned by both the horizontal and vertical wave
numbers. Indices which separate the range of the anisotropic weak-wave
turbulence in the wave-number space are proposed based on the decomposed
energies. In addition, the dominance of the waves in the range is also verified
by the small frequency deviation from the linear dispersion relation. In the
wave-dominant range, the linear wave periods given by the linear dispersion
relation are smaller than approximately one third of the eddy-turnover time.
The linear wave periods reflect the anisotropy of the system, while the
isotropic Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a period is used to evaluate the Ozmidov wave
number, which is necessarily isotropic. It is found that the time scales in
consideration of the anisotropy of the flow field must be appropriately
selected to obtain the critical wave number separating the weak-wave

We focus our attention on baryonic $B$-meson decays mediated dominantly through

observe for the first time the CP violating effects in $B$ decays to final

the unit outward normal to the boundary and $\bar\sigma$ is the nutrient

a unique $R\in(\rho,\infty)$ such that the corresponding radially symmetric

attention to emerging topics and breaking news, such as crisis events.
Collective attention is typically measured by aggregate counts, such as the
number of posts that mention a name or hashtag. But according to rationalist
models of natural language communication, the collective salience of each
entity will be expressed not only in how often it is mentioned, but in the form
that those mentions take. This is because natural language communication is
premised on (and customized to) the expectations that speakers and writers have
about how their messages will be interpreted by the intended audience. We test
this idea by conducting a large-scale analysis of public online discussions of
breaking news events on Facebook and Twitter, focusing on five recent crisis
events. We examine how people refer to locations, focusing specifically on
contextual descriptors, such as ""San Juan"" versus ""San Juan, Puerto Rico.""
Rationalist accounts of natural language communication predict that such
descriptors will be unnecessary (and therefore omitted) when the named entity
is expected to have high prior salience to the reader. We find that the use of
contextual descriptors is indeed associated with proxies for social and
informational expectations, including macro-level factors like the location's
global salience and micro-level factors like audience engagement. We also find
a consistent decrease in descriptor context use over the lifespan of each
crisis event. These findings provide evidence about how social media users
communicate with their audiences, and point towards more fine-grained models of
collective attention that may help researchers and crisis response
organizations to better understand public perception of unfolding crisis
events.

operate with large datasets, which implicitly constrains the complexity of the
clustering algorithm. Existing clustering techniques are only partially stable,
however, as they guarantee either determinism or robustness. To address this

capturing multiple optima. In addition, it leverages a novel consensus
approach, Mutual Maximal Gain, to ensure robustness and further improve the

pressure dependent terms were derived for energy dissipation due to thermal
damping (Td), radiation damping (Rd) and dissipation due to the viscosity of
liquid (Ld) and coating (Cd). The dissipated energies were solved for uncoated
and coated 2- 20 $\mu m$ bubbles over a frequency range of $0.25f_r-2.5f_r$
($f_r$ is the bubble resonance) and for various acoustic pressures
(1kPa-300kPa). Thermal effects were examined for air and C3F8 gas cores in each
case. For uncoated bubbles with an air gas core and a diameter larger than 4
$\mu m$, thermal damping is the strongest damping factor. When pressure
increases, the contributions of Rd grow faster and become the dominant damping
mechanism for pressure dependent resonance frequencies (e.g. fundamental and
super harmonic resonances). For coated bubbles, Cd is the strongest damping
mechanism. As pressure increases Rd contributes more to damping compared to Ld
and Td. In case of air bubbles, as pressure increases, the linear thermal model
largely deviates from the nonlinear model and accurate modeling requires
inclusion of the full thermal model. However, for coated C3F8 bubbles of
diameter 1-8 $\mu m$, typically used in medical ultrasound, thermal effects
maybe neglected even at higher pressures. We show that the scattering to

encoder-decoder structured generator is used to learn a pose disentangled face
representation, and the encoder-decoder structured discriminator is tasked to
perform real/fake classification, face reconstruction, determining identity and
estimating face pose. We further improve the proposed network architecture by
minimising the additional pixel-wise loss defined by the Wasserstein distance
at the output of the discriminator so that the adversarial framework can be
better trained. Additionally, we consider face pose variation to be continuous,
rather than discrete in existing literature, to inject richer pose information
into our model. The pose estimation task is formulated as a regression problem,
which helps to disentangle identity information from pose variations. The
proposed network is evaluated on the tasks of pose-invariant face recognition
(PIFR) and face synthesis across poses. An extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluation carried out on several controlled and in-the-wild

  Flow Problems in Electric Grids",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal power flow (OPF) is a key tool for planning and operations in energy
grids. The line-flow constraints, generator loading effect, piece-wise cost
functions, emission, and voltage quality cost make the optimization model
non-convex and computationally cumbersome to solve. Metaheuristic techniques
for solving the problem have emerged as a promising solution to solve the
complex OPF problem. Recently, the water cycle algorithm (WCA), a method
inspired by the observation of the water cycle process and the surface run-off
model was proposed for solving optimization problems. This paper proposes an
improved version of WCA that uses the concept of sharing global and local
information among individuals to improve the exploitation ability compared with
the standard WCA. The so called fully informed WCA (FIWCA) is tested against
standard WCA and other metaheuristic techniques studied in the literature on
IEEE 30 and 57 bus systems for various scenarios. Comparison and discussion
regarding the performance and reliability of the metaheuristics approaches
studied in literature are discussed. The obtained optimization results show
that the better performance of proposed FIWCA comparing with the WCA and other
algorithms especially in term of stability performance over replications.
Consequently, it emerges as a tool for solving OPF in a reliable and efficient
manner.

choose their routes from small sets of promising candidates. Many methods
developed to identify such choice sets rely on assumptions about the mechanisms
behind the route choice and require corresponding data sets. Furthermore,
existing approaches often involve considerable complexity or perform many
repeated shortest path queries. This makes it difficult to apply these methods
in comprehensive models with numerous origin-destination pairs. In this paper,
we address these issues by developing an algorithm that efficiently identifies
locally optimal routes. Such paths arise from travellers acting rationally on
local scales, whereas unknown factors may affect the routes on larger scales.
Though methods identifying locally optimal routes are available already, these
algorithms rely on approximations and return only few, heuristically chosen
paths for specific origin-destination pairs. This conflicts with the demands of
route choice models, where an exhaustive search for many origins and
destinations would be necessary. We therefore extend existing algorithms to
return (almost) all admissible paths between a large number of
origin-destination pairs. We test our algorithm on a road network modelling the
Canadian province British Columbia and analyze the distribution of locally
optimal paths in the province.

out-of-equilibrium, from the view of entanglement Hamiltonian. As a
prototypical example, we study quantum quench dynamics of a one-dimensional

operator emerges in entanglement Hamiltonian, implying that entanglement
spreading is carried by particle flow. In the long-time limit subsystem enters
a steady phase, evidenced by the dynamic convergence of the entanglement
Hamiltonian to the expectation of a thermal ensemble. Importantly, entanglement
temperature of steady state is spatially independent, which provides an
intuitive trait of equilibrium. We demonstrate that these features are
consistent with predictions from conformal field theory. These findings not

living systems, one needs a meaningful and systematic way to quantify the
complex dynamics, a challenge in both theoretical and empirical realms. The
present work shows how integrating approaches from computational algebraic
topology and dynamical systems may help us meet this challenge. In particular,
we focus on the application of multiscale topological analysis to coordinated
rhythmic processes. First, theoretical arguments are introduced as to why
certain topological features and their scale-dependency are highly relevant to
understanding complex collective dynamics. Second, we propose a method to
capture such dynamically relevant topological information using persistent
homology, which allows us to effectively construct a multiscale topological
portrait of rhythmic coordination. Finally, the method is put to test in
detecting transitions in real data from an experiment of rhythmic coordination
in ensembles of interacting humans. The recurrence plots of topological
portraits highlight collective transitions in coordination patterns that were
elusive to more traditional methods. This sensitivity to collective transitions
would be lost if the behavioral dynamics of individuals were treated as
separate degrees of freedom instead of constituents of the topology that they
collectively forge. Such multiscale topological portraits highlight collective
aspects of coordination patterns that are irreducible to properties of
individual parts. The present work demonstrates how the analysis of multiscale
coordination dynamics can benefit from topological methods, thereby paving the
way for further systematic quantification of complex, high-dimensional dynamics

invasive species. Though most road traffic is local, a small number of
long-distance trips can suffice to move an invasion or disease front forward.
Therefore, understanding how many agents travel over long distances and which
routes they choose is key to successful management of diseases and invasions.
Stochastic gravity models have been used to estimate the distribution of trips
between origins and destinations of agents. However, in large-scale systems it
is hard to collect the data required to fit these models, as the number of
long-distance travellers is small, and origins and destinations can have
multiple access points. Therefore, gravity models often provide only relative
measures of the agent flow. Furthermore, gravity models yield no insights into
which roads agents use. We resolve these issues by combining a stochastic
gravity model with a stochastic route choice model. Our hybrid model can be
fitted to survey data collected at roads that are used by many long-distance
travellers. This decreases the sampling effort, allows us to obtain absolute
predictions of both vector pressure and pathways, and permits rigorous model
validation. After introducing our approach in general terms, we demonstrate its
benefits by applying it to the potential invasion of zebra and quagga mussels

R-squared value of 0.73 for variance-corrected agent counts at survey

compilers to reduce program warm-up time. OSR allows switching from interpreted
to compiled code during the execution of this code. The main targets are long
running loops, which need to be represented explicitly, with dedicated
information about condition and body, to be optimized at run time. Bytecode
interpreters, however, represent control flow implicitly via unstructured jumps
and thus do not exhibit the required high-level loop representation. To enable
OSR also for jump-based - often called unstructured - languages, we propose the
partial reconstruction of loops in order to explicitly represent them in a
bytecode interpreter. Besides an outline of the general idea, we implemented
our approach in Sulong, a bytecode interpreter for LLVM bitcode, which allows
the execution of C/C++. We conducted an evaluation with a set of C benchmarks,
which showed speed-ups in warm-up of up to 9x for certain benchmarks. This
facilitates execution of programs with long-running loops in rarely called
functions, which would yield significant slowdown without OSR. While shown with
a prototype implementation, the overall idea of our approach is generalizable
for all bytecode interpreters.

observed having plasma density peaking near the edge of the obstacle. The depth

robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs can
accurately recognize images, recent studies have shown that the convolution
operations in CNNs commonly have structural sensitivity to specific noise
composed of Fourier basis functions. By exploiting this sensitivity, they
proposed a simple black-box adversarial attack: Single Fourier attack. To
reduce structural sensitivity, we can use regularization of convolution filter
weights since the sensitivity of linear transform can be assessed by the norm
of the weights. However, standard regularization methods can prevent
minimization of the loss function because they impose a tight constraint for
obtaining high robustness. To solve this problem, Absum imposes a loose
constraint; it penalizes the absolute values of the summation of the parameters
in the convolution layers. Absum can improve robustness against single Fourier
attack while being as simple and efficient as standard regularization methods
(e.g., weight decay and L1 regularization). Our experiments demonstrate that
Absum improves robustness against single Fourier attack more than standard
regularization methods. Furthermore, we reveal that robust CNNs with Absum are
more robust against transferred attacks due to decreasing the common
sensitivity and against high-frequency noise than standard regularization
methods. We also reveal that Absum can improve robustness against
gradient-based attacks (projected gradient descent) when used with adversarial
training.

cause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high data
rate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between
the transmitter and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being
artificially placed or occurring naturally, surfaces or volumes that resemble
an apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass. Contrary to
intuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication
performance, given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the
ones that take more directed paths towards the receiver. Furthermore, through
both computer simulations and a theoretical signal evaluation metric named
signal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the
size of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and
the ISI combating capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture
size that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). It is observed that the trend of
BER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed metric's
applicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the
optimal aperture size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations
and SINAR show that said optimal aperture size is affected by the location of
the aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of radial
and angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a
reduction in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values. Overall, our
results imply that apertured plane-like surfaces may actually help
communication efficiency, even though they reduce the received signal power.

Co or Ni, X = Si or Ge) ferromagnets at their first-order magnetostructural

magnetostructural transition to the magnetic field inevitably lead to a
sizeable irreversibility of the low-field magnetocaloric effect. In this work,
we show an alternative way to realize a reversible low-field magnetocaloric
effect in MnMX-based alloys by taking advantage of the second-order phase
transition. With introducing Cu into Co in MnCoGe alloy, the martensitic
transition is stabilized at high temperature, while the Curie temperature of
the orthorhombic phase is reduced to room temperature. As a result, a
second-order magnetic transition with negligible thermal hysteresis and a large
magnetization change can be observed, enabling a large reversible
magnetocaloric effect. By both calorimetric and direct measurements, a
reversible adiabatic temperature change of about 1 K is obtained under a field
change of 0-1 T at 304 K, which is larger than that obtained in a first-order
magnetostructural transition. To get a better insight into the origin of these
experimental results, first-principles calculations are carried out to
characterize the chemical bonds and the magnetic exchange interaction. Our work
provides a new understanding of the MnCoGe alloy and indicates a feasible route
to improve the reversibility of the low-field magnetocaloric effect in the MnMX

copying contents other than the patternized words---such as irrelevant
facts---into the generated summaries. To tackle these challenges, we design a
model named Prototype Editing based Summary Generator (PESG). PESG first learns
summary patterns and prototype facts by analyzing the correlation between a
prototype document and its summary. Prototype facts are then utilized to help
extract facts from the input document. Next, an editing generator generates new
summary based on the summary pattern or extracted facts. Finally, to address

interactions in urban scenarios, such as streets, shopping malls or squares, is
essential to develop socially compliant robots or self-driving cars. Autonomous
systems may gain advantage on anticipating human motion to avoid collisions or
to naturally behave alongside people. To foresee plausible trajectories, we
construct an LSTM (long short-term memory)-based model considering three
fundamental factors: people interactions, past observations in terms of
previously crossed areas and semantics of surrounding space. Our model
encompasses several pooling mechanisms to join the above elements defining
multiple tensors, namely social, navigation and semantic tensors. The network
is tested in unstructured environments where complex paths emerge according to
both internal (intentions) and external (other people, not accessible areas)
motivations. As demonstrated, modeling paths unaware of social interactions or
context information, is insufficient to correctly predict future positions.
Experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
comparison to LSTM-based models for human path prediction.

quite valuable. We present such a technique for localization with limited

possess a whole image label and no bounding box. We propose a novel loss
function for tackling this problem; the loss is a continuous relaxation of a
well-defined discrete formulation of weakly supervised learning and is
numerically well-posed. Furthermore, we propose a new architecture which
accounts for both patch dependence and shift-invariance, through the inclusion
of CRF layers and anti-aliasing filters, respectively. We apply our technique

question. Investigating this question is important, as it could provide a
better understanding on how to train candidates for job interviews and make
recruiters be aware of influential non verbal behaviour. This research has
recently been accelerated due to the development of tools for the automatic
analysis of social signals, and the emergence of machine learning methods.
However, these studies are still mainly based on hand engineered features,
which imposes a limit to the discovery of influential social signals. On the
other side, deep learning methods are a promising tool to discover complex
patterns without the necessity of feature engineering. In this paper, we focus
on studying influential non verbal social signals in asynchronous job video
interviews that are discovered by deep learning methods. We use a previously
published deep learning system that aims at inferring the hirability of a
candidate with regard to a sequence of interview questions. One particularity
of this system is the use of attention mechanisms, which aim at identifying the
relevant parts of an answer. Thus, information at a fine-grained temporal level
could be extracted using global (at the interview level) annotations on
hirability. While most of the deep learning systems use attention mechanisms to
offer a quick visualization of slices when a rise of attention occurs, we
perform an in-depth analysis to understand what happens during these moments.
First, we propose a methodology to automatically extract slices where there is
a rise of attention (attention slices). Second, we study the content of
attention slices by comparing them with randomly sampled slices. Finally, we
show that they bear significantly more information for hirability than randomly
sampled slices.

we observe that torsion effects decrease the compactness and total mass of
neutron star with respect to the General Relativity predictions, therefore
mimicking the effects of a repulsive massive field. The opposite occurs in the
metric theory, where mass and compactness increase with $\alpha$, thus inducing
an excess of mass that overtakes the standard General Relativity limit. We also
find that the sign of $\alpha$ must be reversed whether one considers the
metric theory (positive) or torsion (negative) to avoid blowing up solutions.
This could draw an easy test to either confirm or discard one or the other

are then given by a sum over tree-diagrams whose Feynman rules involve simple
Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) quantities. The internal vertices of these

corrections to bare charges. Our derivation follows closely the spirit of
recent works [1,2]. We also conjecture that the cumulants of total transport in

distortion in a passive opto-acoustic device would revolutionize the field of
acoustics. The photo-thermo-acoustic (PTA) effect allows to transduce light
into sound without any bulk electro-mechanically moving parts and electrical
connections, as for conventional loudspeakers. Also, PTA devices can be
integrated with standard silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
fabrication techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the ultimate PTA efficiency
of graphene aerogels, depending on their particular thermal and optical
properties, can be experimentally achieved by reducing their mass density.
Furthermore, we illustrate that the aerogels behave as an omnidirectional
point-source throughout the audible range with no harmonic distortion. This
research represents a breakthrough for audio-visual consumer technologies and
it could pave the way to novel opto-acoustic sensing devices.

prologue of the whole procedure. They play the role of sorting the parts
randomly placed in bins to the state with specified pose. With the help of the
parts feeding machines, the subsequent assembly processes by robot arm can
always start from the same condition. Thus it is expected that function of
parting feeding machine and the robotic assembly can be integrated with one
robot arm. This scheme can provide great flexibility and can also contribute to
reduce the cost. The difficulties involved in this scheme lie in the fact that
in the part feeding phase, the pose of the part after grasping may be not
proper for the subsequent assembly. Sometimes it can not even guarantee a
stable grasp. In this paper, we proposed a method to integrate parts feeding
and assembly within one robot arm. This proposal utilizes a specially designed
gripper tip mounted on the jaws of a two-fingered gripper. With the modified
gripper, in-hand manipulation of the grasped object is realized, which can
ensure the control of the orientation and offset position of the grasped
object. The proposal in this paper is verified by a simulated assembly in which
a robot arm completed the assembly process including parts picking from bin and
a subsequent peg-in-hole assembly.

We aim to determine the geometry, density gradient, and velocity
structure of jets in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries. Methods.
Our high cadence time series of high-resolution optical spectra of jet-creating
post-AGB binary systems provide us with a unique tomography of the jet. We
determine the spatio-kinematic structure of the jets based on these data by
fitting the synthetic spectral line profiles created by our model to the
observed, orbital phase-resolved, H{\alpha}-line profiles of these systems. The
fitting routine is provided with an initial spectrum and is allowed to test
three configurations, derived from three specific jet launching models: a
stellar jet launched by the star, an X-wind, and a disk wind configuration. We
apply a Markov-chain Monte Carlo routine in order to fit our model to the
observations. Our fitting code is tested on the post-AGB binary IRAS19135+3937.
Results. We find that a model using the stellar jet configuration gives a
marginally better fit to our observations. The jet has a wide half-opening
angle of about 76 degrees and reaches velocities up to 870 km/s. Conclusions.
Our methodology is successful in determining some parameters for jets in
post-AGB binaries. The model for IRAS19135+3937 includes a transparent, low
density inner region (for a half-opening angle < 40 degrees). The source
feeding the accretion disk around the companion is most likely the circumbinary
disk. We will apply this jet fitting routine to other jet-creating post-AGB
stars in order to provide a more complete description of these objects.

envisioned task-aware CBCT protocol. The traditional short-scan CBCT trajectory
is planar, with little room for scene-specific adjustment. We extend this
trajectory by autonomously adjusting out-of-plane angulation. This enables
C-arm source trajectories that are scene-specific in that they avoid acquiring
""poor images"", characterized by beam hardening, photon starvation, and noise.
The recommendation of ideal out-of-plane angulation is performed on-the-fly

that achieves both high resolution and wide field of view by stitching a series
of low-resolution images captured under angle-varied illumination. So far, many
supervised data-driven models have been applied to solve inverse imaging
problems. These models need massive amounts of data to train, and are limited
by the dataset characteristics. In FP problems, generic datasets are always
scarce, and the optical aberration varies greatly under different acquisition
conditions. To address these dilemmas, we model the forward physical imaging
process as an interpretable physics-guided neural network (PgNN), where the
reconstructed image in the complex domain is considered as the learnable
parameters of the neural network. Since the optimal parameters of the PgNN can
be derived by minimizing the difference between the model-generated images and
real captured angle-varied images corresponding to the same scene, the proposed
PgNN can get rid of the problem of massive training data as in traditional
supervised methods. Applying the alternate updating mechanism and the total
variation regularization, PgNN can flexibly reconstruct images with improved
performance. In addition, the Zernike mode is incorporated to compensate for
optical aberrations to enhance the robustness of FP reconstructions. As a
demonstration, we show our method can reconstruct images with smooth
performance and detailed information in both simulated and experimental
datasets. In particular, when validated in an extension of a high-defocus,
high-exposure tissue section dataset, PgNN outperforms traditional FP methods
with fewer artifacts and distinguishable structures.

  materials","Masters thesis, completed November 2016, 69 pages, 34 figures",,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modeling and simulation of heat source trajectories through phase-change
materials is a relevant problem both for space exploration and for terrestrial
climate research, among other fields. In space, the DLR and NASA are both
interested in exploring beneath the surfaces of icy moons, primarily Enceladus
and Europa, where conditions may alloy for extraterrestrial life. On Earth,
unique sub-glacial aquatic ecosystems offer potential for geo-biological
discoveries. Unfortunately, existing ice-drilling technology is dirty and
cumbersome.
  Melting probes are a clean and compact alternative technology which use
heaters to melt through the ice. A melting probe's trajectory can be controlled
with differential heating. Successful trajectory control requires advancements
not only in the modeling and simulation of the ambient dynamics, but also of
the probe's coupled rigid body dynamics. Fundamentally, the rigid body dynamics
can be modeled by the equations of motion; but this approach is prohibitively
complex.
  This work proposes an approach which exploits that the motion of the probe is
driven by contact with the evolving liquid-solid interface. From this
perspective, an energy minimization problem is formulated. The general
mathematical problem is formulated as two split operators, respectively for the
rigid body dynamics and the ambient dynamics. These operators are coupled with
feasibility constraints which ensure that the probe does not penetrate the
solid. Concrete examples are shown both for the energy minimization problem and
for the unsteady ambient dynamics. Finally, an algorithm is presented for the
temporal coupling of the split operators, which is implemented using Python and
C++. Example trajectories are shown, including the dynamic response of the
probe velocity to a rapid change in the heat flux.

Our goal is to find a converged cooling limit for fragmentation in
self-gravitating disks. This is especially interesting for the formation of
planets, brown dwarfs or stars and the growth of black holes. While
investigating the limit, we want to give a clear criterion for the state of
convergence.
  Methods. We run two-dimensional shearingsheet simulations with the
hydrodynamic package Fosite at high resolutions. Thereby resolution and
limiters are altered. Subsequently, we investigate the spectra of important
physical quantities at the length scales where fragmentation occurs. In order
to avoid prompt fragmentation at high resolutions we start these simulations
with a fully developed gravitoturbulent state obtained at a lower resolution.
  Results. We show nearly converged results for fragmentation with a critical
cooling timescale $t_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 10\,\Omega^{-1}$ . We can backtrace
this claim by investigating the spectra of relevant physical variables at
length scales around and below the pressure scale height. We argue that well
behaved results cannot be expected if counteracting quantities are varying too
much on these critical length scales, either by change of resolution or
numerical method. A comparison of fragmentation behaviour with the related
spectra reveals that simulations behave similar, if the spectra are converged
to the length scales where self-gravity leads to instabilities. Observable
deviations in the results obtained with different numerical setup are confined
to scales below these critical length scales.

distribution matching (DM) and sphere shaping (SpSh) algorithms for short
blocklength probabilistic amplitude shaping. For asymptotically large
blocklengths, constant composition distribution matching (CCDM) is known to
generate the target capacity-achieving distribution. As the blocklength
decreases, however, the resulting rate loss diminishes the efficiency of CCDM.
We claim that for such short blocklengths and over the additive white Gaussian
channel (AWGN), the objective of shaping should be reformulated as obtaining
the most energy-efficient signal space for a given rate (rather than matching
distributions). In light of this interpretation, multiset-partition DM (MPDM),
enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) and shell mapping (SM), are reviewed as
energy-efficient shaping techniques. Numerical results show that MPDM and SpSh
have smaller rate losses than CCDM. SpSh--whose sole objective is to maximize
the energy efficiency--is shown to have the minimum rate loss amongst all. We
provide simulation results of the end-to-end decoding performance showing that
up to 1 dB improvement in power efficiency over uniform signaling can be
obtained with MPDM and SpSh at blocklengths around 200. Finally, we present a
discussion on the complexity of these algorithms from the perspective of
latency, storage and computations.

  Logarithm Problem",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CG math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we intend to study the geometric meaning of the discrete
logarithm problem defined over an Elliptic Curve. The key idea is to reduce the
Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (EC-DLP) into a system of equations.
These equations arise from the interesection of quadric hypersurfaces in an
affine space of lower dimension. In cryptography, this interpretation can be
used to design attacks on EC-DLP. Presently, the best known attack algorithm
having a sub-exponential time complexity is through the implementation of
Summation Polynomials and Weil Descent. It is expected that the proposed
geometric interpretation can result in faster reduction of the problem into a
system of equations. These overdetermined system of equations are hard to
solve. We have used F4 (Faugere) algorithms and got results for primes less
than 500,000. Quantum Algorithms can expedite the process of solving these
over-determined system of equations. In the absence of fast algorithms for
computing summation polynomials, we expect that this could be an alternative.
We do not claim that the proposed algorithm would be faster than Shor's
algorithm for breaking EC-DLP but this interpretation could be a candidate as
an alternative to the 'summation polynomial attack' in the post-quantum era.

spintronic applications. Current research focuses on identifying and
controlling the interactions that define the magnetic chirality. The influence
of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and, recently, the

systems relevant for skyrmion research a uniform magnetic chirality across the

achieved for reduced iDMI values when exploiting the interlayer exchange
interaction. This work opens up new ways to control and tailor the magnetic

molecular clumps and associated with 17 dense cores. For five of these cores,
CO emissions appear to have line-wings at velocities of greater than 30 km

allocate indivisible goods, in which the agents take turns to pick the items
according to a predefined sequence. While this protocol is not strategy-proof,
it has been shown recently that finding a successful manipulation for an agent
is an NP-hard problem (Aziz et al., 2017). Conversely, it is also known that
finding an optimal manipulation can be solved in polynomial time in a few
cases: if there are only two agents or if the manipulator has a binary or a
lexicographic utility function. In this work, we take a parameterized approach
to provide several new complexity results on this manipulation problem. More
precisely, we give a complete picture of its parameterized complexity w.r.t.
the following three parameters: the number $n$ of agents, the number $\mu(a_1)$
of times the manipulator $a_1$ picks in the picking sequence, and the maximum
range $\mathtt{rg}^{\max}$ of an item. This third parameter is a correlation
measure on the preference rankings of the agents. In particular, we show that
the problem of finding an optimal manipulation can be solved in polynomial time
if $n$ or $\mu(a_1)$ is a constant, and that it is fixed-parameter tractable
w.r.t. $\mathtt{rg}^{\max}$ and $n+\mu(a_1)$. Interestingly enough, we show
that w.r.t. the single parameters $n$ and $\mu(a_1)$ it is W[1]-hard. Moreover,
we provide an integer program and a dynamic programming scheme to solve the
manipulation problem and we show that a single manipulator can increase the
utility of her bundle by a multiplicative factor which is at most 2.

of the particle beam in parallel to the collection of, for instance,
x-ray-diffraction patterns. As a rather simple experimental method, it requires
the generation of a small laser-light sheet using a cylindrical telescope and a

amongst Milky Way halo stars with retrograde motions. It is currently unclear
how these various structures are related to each other. This Letter aims to
shed light on this issue. Methods. We explore the retrograde halo with an
augmented version of the Gaia DR2 RVS sample, extended with data from three
large spectroscopic surveys, namely RAVE, APOGEE and LAMOST. In this dataset,
we identify several structures using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. We
discuss their properties and possible links using all the available chemical
and dynamical information. Results. In concordance with previous work, we find
that stars with [Fe/H] $<-1$ have more retrograde motions than those with
[Fe/H] $>-1$. The retrograde halo contains a mixture of debris from objects
like Gaia-Enceladus, Sequoia, and even the chemically defined thick-disc. We
find that the Sequoia has a smaller range in orbital energies than previously
suggested and is confined to high-energy. Sequoia could be a small galaxy in
itself, but since it overlaps both in integrals-of-motion space and chemical
abundance space with the less bound debris of Gaia-Enceladus, its nature cannot
be fully settled yet. In the low-energy part of the halo we find evidence for
at least one more distinct structure: Thamnos. Stars in Thamnos are on low
inclination, mildly eccentric retrograde orbits, moving at
$v_{\phi}\approx-150$ km/s, and are chemically distinct from the other
structures. Conclusions. Even with the excellent Gaia DR2 data it remains
challenging to piece together all the fragments found in the retrograde halo.
At this point, we are very much in need of large datasets with high-quality
high-resolution spectra and tailored high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations
of galaxy mergers.

between the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the phase estimation
algorithm (PEA) in terms of required quantum circuit resources and conceptual
simplicity. QFD uses a set of of time-propagated guess states as a variational
basis for approximate diagonalization of a sparse Pauli Hamiltonian. The
variational coefficients of the basis functions are determined by the
Rayleigh-Ritz procedure by classically solving a generalized eigenvalue problem
in the space of time-propagated guess states. The matrix elements of the
subspace Hamiltonian and subspace metric matrix are each determined in quantum
circuits by a one-ancilla extended swap test, i.e., statistical convergence of
a one-ancilla PEA circuit. These matrix elements can be determined by many
parallel quantum circuit evaluations, and the final Ritz estimates for the
eigenvectors can conceptually be prepared as a linear combination over separate
quantum state preparation circuits. The QFD method naturally provides for the
computation of ground-state, excited-state, and transition expectation values.
We numerically demonstrate the potential of the method by classical simulations
of the QFD algorithm for an N=8 octamer of BChl-a chromophores represented by
an 8-qubit ab initio exciton model (AIEM) Hamiltonian. Using only a handful of
time-displacement points and a coarse, variational Trotter expansion of the
time propagation operators, the QFD method recovers an accurate prediction of

ubiquitous in today's world. In many such scenarios the base text, from which
the knowledge graph is constructed, concerns itself with practical, on-hand,
actual or ground-reality information about the domain. Product documentation in
software engineering domain are one example of such base texts. Other examples
include blogs and texts related to digital artifacts, reports on emerging
markets and business models, patient medical records, etc. Though the above
sources contain a wealth of knowledge about their respective domains, the
conceptual knowledge on which they are based is often missing or unclear.
Access to this conceptual knowledge can enormously increase the utility of
available data and assist in several tasks such as knowledge graph completion,
grounding, querying, etc.
  Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we propose a novel
Markovian stochastic model for document generation from conceptual knowledge.
The uniqueness of our approach lies in the fact that the conceptual knowledge
in the writer's mind forms a component of the parameter set of our stochastic
model. Secondly, we solve the inverse problem of learning the best conceptual
knowledge from a given document, by finding model parameters which maximize the
likelihood of generating the specific document over all possible parameter
values. This likelihood maximization is done using an application of Baum-Welch
algorithm, which is a known special case of Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm. We run our conceptualization algorithm on several well-known natural
language sources and obtain very encouraging results. The results of our
extensive experiments concur with the hypothesis that the information contained
in these sources has a well-defined and rigorous underlying conceptual
structure, which can be discovered using our method.

efficiency for short and long unicast flows. SCDP achieves this by integrating
RaptorQ codes with receiver-driven data transport, packet trimming and
Multi-Level Feedback Queuing (MLFQ); (1) RaptorQ codes enable efficient
one-to-many and many-to-one data transport; (2) on top of RaptorQ codes,
receiver-driven flow control, in combination with in-network packet trimming,
enable efficient usage of network resources as well as multi-path transport and

the systematic nature of RaptorQ codes, in combination with MLFQ, enable fast,
decoding-free completion of short flows. We extensively evaluate SCDP in a wide

The inverse relation between jets and winds fits into a picture that connects

that neutron stars embody the small-scale analog of FRII quasars, an idea that

In this paper we study an important function in the multifractal theory, the
$L^{q}$-spectrum, $\tau (q)$, for measures of finite type, a class of
self-similar measures that includes these examples. Corresponding to each
measure, we introduce finitely many variants on the $% L^{q}$-spectrum which
arise naturally from the finite type structure and are often easier to
understand than $\tau $. We show that $\tau$ is always bounded by the minimum
of these variants and is equal to the minimum variant for $q\geq 0$. This
particular variant coincides with the $L^{q}$-spectrum of the measure $\mu$
restricted to appropriate subsets of its support. If the IFS satisfies
particular structural properties, which do hold for the above examples, then
$\tau$ is shown to be the minimum of these variants for all $q$. Under certain
assumptions on the local dimensions of $\mu$, we prove that the minimum variant
for $q \ll 0$ coincides with the straight line having slope equal to the
maximum local dimension of $\mu $. Again, this is the case with the examples
above. More generally, bounds are given for $\tau$ and its variants in terms of
notions closely related to the local dimensions of $\mu $.

with a particular focus on frequencies above 30 MHz. However, at frequencies
below 30 MHz, Earth-based observations are limited due to a combination of
severe ionospheric distortions, almost full reflection of radio waves below 10
MHz, solar eruptions and human-made radio frequency interference (RFI). A space
or Lunar-based ultra-low-frequency (or ultra-long-wavelength, ULW) array would
suffer significantly less from these limitations and hence would open up the
last, virtually unexplored frequency domain in the electromagnetic spectrum. A
roadmap has been initiated in order to explore the opportunity of building a
swarm of satellites to observe at the frequency band below 30 MHz. This
roadmap, dubbed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR),
presents a space-based ultra-low frequency radio telescope that will explore
the Universe's so-called dark ages, map the interstellar medium, and study
planetary and solar bursts in the solar system and search them in other
planetary systems. Such a system will comprise of a swarm of hundreds to
thousands of satellites, working together as a single aperture synthesis
instrument deployed sufficiently far away from Earth to avoid terrestrial RFI.
A number of key technologies of OLFAR are still to be developed and proven. The
first step in this roadmap is the NCLE (Netherlands China Low Frequency
Explorer) experiment launched in May 2018 on the Chinese Chang'e-4 mission. The
NCLE payload consists of a three monopole antenna system from which the first
data stream is expected in the second half of 2019, which will provide
important feedback for future science and technology opportunities. In this
paper, the roadmap towards OLFAR, a brief overview of the science
opportunities, and the technological and programmatic challenges of the mission
are presented.

Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope were released to the scientific
community. Understanding the centre to limb brightness function is necessary to
compare features in full disk images. Our goals are to find the empirical
centre to limb brightness functions in two available spectral bands and create
flattened images with centre to limb brightness variations removed. We used
second-order polynomial fit of the cosine of incidence angle to data points as
a function of radial distance to the centre of the solar disk. The method also
includes iterative removal of outliers based on the interquartile range.
Fitting functions for all available images proved to adequately describe the
data with comparatively small errors in the fitting coefficients. In both bands
we found brightening towards the limb which is a consequence of increase in
electron temperatures with radial distance in this region of the solar
atmosphere. This study found that the $T_{b}$ of an active region has about 180
K difference between with and without the limb brightening at radial distance
$\approx$0.75$R_{\odot}$ in Band 6. We also made flattened images with limb
brightening removed. The limb brightening effect in ALMA images is significant
enough (of the order of 10% for Band 3 and about 15% in Band 6) that it can not
be neglected in further analyses. Since the effect of the side lobes was not
included in this study, these values probably represent the lower limit of the
limb brightening. The shape of the limb brightening function can also be used
to constrain electron densities and temperatures in various layers of the solar
atmosphere.

bucket into multiple sub-token buckets with equal aggregate parameters and
offered the same job arrival process. The situation commonly arises in
distributed computing environments where job arrivals are rate controlled (each
job needs one token to enter the system), but capacity limitations call for
distributing jobs across multiple compute resources with scalability
considerations preventing the use of a centralized rate control component (each
compute resource is responsible for monitoring and enforcing that the job
stream it receives conforms to a certain traffic envelope). The question we
address is to what extent splitting a token bucket into multiple sub-token
buckets that individually rate control a subset of the original arrival process
affects job latency, when jobs wait for a token whenever the token bucket is
empty upon their arrival. Our contribution is to establish that independent of
the job arrival process and how jobs are distributed across compute resources
(and sub-token buckets), splitting a token bucket always increases the sum of
job latencies in the token buckets, and consequently the average job latency.

resistance in the hybrid pillared-graphene and graphene (PGG) system. This is
done through the classical molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and also with a
continuum model. At first, the thermal conductivity of both pillared-graphene
and graphene is calculated employing MD simulation and Fourier low. Our results
show that the thermal conductivity of the pillared-graphene is much smaller
than the graphene by an order of magnitude. Next, by applying positive and
negative temperature gradients along the longitudinal direction of PGG, the
thermal rectification is examined. The MD results indicate that for the lengths
in the range of 36 to 86nm, the thermal rectification remains almost constant
(~3-5%). We have also studied the phonon density of states (DOS) on both sides
of the interface of PGG. The DOS curves show that there is phonon scattering at
low frequencies (acoustic mode) that depends on the imposed temperature
gradient direction in the system. Therefore, we can introduce the PGG as a
promising thermal rectifier at room temperature. Furthermore, in the following
of this work, we also explore the temperature distribution over the PGG by
using the continuum model. The results that obtained from the continuum model
predict the MD results such as the temperature distribution in the upper half
layer and lower full layer graphene, the temperature gap and also the thermal
resistance at the interface.

counts of the 850-$\mu$m sources in 9/13 of these candidate protoclusters show
significant overdensities compared to the field, with the probability
$<$10$^{-2}$ assuming the sources are randomly distributed in the sky. Using
the 250-, 350-, 500- and 850-$\mu$m flux densities, we estimate the photometric
redshifts of individual SCUBA-2 sources by fitting spectral energy distribution
(SED) templates with an MCMC method. The photometric redshift distribution,
peaking at $2<z<3$, is consistent with that of known $z>2$ protoclusters and
the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD). We find that the
850-$\mu$m sources in our candidate protoclusters have infrared luminosities of
$L_{\mathrm{IR}}\gtrsim$10$^{12}L_{\odot}$ and star-formation rates of
SFR=(500-1,500)$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. By comparing with results in the
literature considering only Herschel photometry, we conclude that our 13
candidate protoclusters can be categorised into four groups: six of them being
high-redshift starbursting protoclusters, one being a lower-redshift
cluster/protocluster, three being protoclusters that contain lensed DSFG(s) or
are rich in 850-$\mu$m sources, and three regions without significant Herschel

are found to be comparable or higher than those of known protoclusters,
suggesting our sample contains some of the most extreme protocluster

key to efficient algorithms. For distance-related graph problems, it is often
crucial that such a decomposition results in clusters of small diameter, while
the probability that an edge is cut by the decomposition scales linearly with
the length of the edge. There is a large body of literature on low diameter
graph decomposition with small edge cutting probabilities, with all existing
techniques heavily building on single source shortest paths (SSSP)
computations. Unfortunately, in many theoretical models for large-scale
computations, the SSSP task constitutes a complexity bottleneck. Therefore, it
is desirable to replace exact SSSP computations with approximate ones. However
this imposes a fundamental challenge since the existing constructions of such
decompositions inherently rely on the subtractive form of the triangle
inequality. The current paper overcomes this obstacle by developing a technique
termed blurry ball growing. By combining this technique with a clever
algorithmic idea of Miller et al. (SPAA 13), we obtain a construction of low
diameter decompositions with small edge cutting probabilities which replaces
exact SSSP computations by (a small number of) approximate ones. The utility of
our approach is showcased by deriving efficient algorithms that work in the
Congest, PRAM, and semi-streaming models of computation. As an application, we
obtain metric tree embedding algorithms in the vein of Bartal (FOCS 96) whose
computational complexities in these models are optimal up to polylogarithmic
factors. Our embeddings have the additional useful property that the tree can
be mapped back to the original graph such that each edge is ""used"" only O(log
n) times, which is of interest for capacitated problems and simulating Congest
algorithms on the tree into which the graph is embedded.

natural question to ask is: Which neural codes can arise as intersection
patterns of convex sets? While past research has established several criteria,
complete conditions for convexity are not yet known for codes with more than
four neurons. We classify all neural codes with five neurons as

k-space completion method, based on a uniquely designed neural network that
reconstructs the full k-space from an undersampled k-space, exploiting the
redundancy among the multiple channels in the receive coil in a parallel
imaging acquisition. To achieve this, contrary to common convolutional network
approaches, the proposed network has a decreasing number of feature maps of
constant size. In contrast to conventional parallel imaging methods such as
GRAPPA that estimate the prediction kernel from the fully sampled
autocalibration signals in a linear way, our method is able to learn nonlinear
relations between sampled and unsampled positions in k-space. The proposed
method was compared to the start-of-the-art ESPIRiT and RAKI methods in terms
of noise amplification and visual image quality in both phantom and in-vivo
experiments. The experiments indicate that APIR-Net provides a promising
alternative to the conventional parallel imaging methods, and results in
improved image quality especially for low SNR acquisitions.

Advances in Meteorology, 2019",,"10.1155/2019/5695481",,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The northeastern coast of the U.S. is projected to expand its offshore wind
capacity from the existing 30 MW to over 22 GW in the next decade. Yet, only a
few wind measurements are available in the region and none at hub height, thus
extrapolations are needed to estimate wind speed as a function of height. A
common method is the log-law, which is based on surface roughness length (z0).
No reliable estimates of z0 for the region have been presented in the
literature. Here, we fill this knowledge gap using two field campaigns that
were conducted in the Nantucket Sound at the Cape Wind (CW) platform. We tested
three different methods to calculate z0: 1) analytical, dependent on friction
velocity u* and a stability function psi; 2) the Charnock relationship between
z0 and u*; and 3) a statistical method based on wind speed observed at the
three levels. The first two methods are physical, whereas the statistical
method is purely mathematical. Comparing mean and median of z0, we find that
the median is a more robust statistics. In general, the median z0 exhibits
little seasonal variability and a weak dependency on atmospheric stability,
which was predominantly unstable (54-67%). The statistical method, despite
delivering unrealistic z0 values at times, gives the best estimates of 60-m
winds. The unrealistic z0 values are caused by non-monotonic wind speed
profiles, occurring about 41% of the time, and should not be rejected because
they produce realistic fits. In summary, if wind speed data from multiple
levels are available, the statistical method is recommended. If multi-level
wind speeds are not available but advanced sonic anemometry is available at one
level, the analytical method is recommended over the Charnock's. If a constant
value of z0 is sought after to characterize the region, we recommend the median
from the statistical method, i.e., 6.09*10^(-3) m.

ASR systems. One important challenge of training an NNLM is to leverage between
scaling the learning process and handling big data. Conventional approaches
such as block momentum provides a blockwise model update filtering (BMUF)
process and achieves almost linear speedups with no performance degradation for
speech recognition. However, it needs to calculate the model average from all
computing nodes (e.g., GPUs) and when the number of computing nodes is large,
the learning suffers from the severe communication latency. As a consequence,
BMUF is not suitable under restricted network conditions. In this paper, we
present a decentralized BMUF process, in which the model is split into
different components, each of which is updated by communicating to some
randomly chosen neighbor nodes with the same component, followed by a BMUF-like
process. We apply this method to several LSTM language modeling tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves consistently better
performance than conventional BMUF. In particular, we obtain a lower perplexity
than the single-GPU baseline on the wiki-text-103 benchmark using 4 GPUs. In
addition, no performance degradation is observed when scaling to 8 and 16 GPUs.

find optimal sleep policy in terms of a trade-off between saved power
consumption versus additional incurred delay for user traffic which has to wait
for the network components to be woken-up and serve it. Eventually, for the
system not to oscillate between sleep levels, we add a switching component in
the cost function and show its impact on the energy reduction versus delay

spin-orbit torque (SOT) has attracted immense interest in the past decade.
Despite vast progress, the existing quantification methods of SOT still have
their respective restrictions on the magnetic anisotropy, the entanglement
between SOT effective fields, and the artifacts from the thermal gradient and
the planar Hall effect, etc. Thus, accurately characterizing SOT across diverse
samples remains as a critical need. In this work, with the aim of removing the
afore-mentioned restrictions, thus enabling the universal SOT quantification,
we report the characterization of the sign and amplitude of SOT by angular
measurements. We first validate the applicability of our angular
characterization in a perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co-Ni heterostructure by
showing excellent agreements to the results of conventional quantification
methods. Remarkably, the thermoelectric effects, i.e., the anomalous Nernst
effect (ANE) arising from the temperature gradient can be self-consistently
disentangled and quantified from the field dependence of the angular
characterization. The superiority of this angular characterization has been
further demonstrated in a Cu/CoTb/Cu sample with large ANE but negligible SOT,
and in a Pt/Co-Ni sample with weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), for
which the conventional quantification methods are not applicable and even yield
fatal error. By providing a comprehensive and versatile way to characterize SOT
and thermoelectric effects in diverse heterostructures, our results pave the
important foundation for the spin-orbitronic study as well as the
interdisciplinary research of thermal spintronic.

flavor, and baryon number directions, compatible with the faithful action of
the global symmetry of a given theory. We call the obstruction to gauging
symmetries revealed by such backgrounds the baryon-color-flavor (BCF) 't Hooft
anomaly. We apply the BCF anomaly to vector-like theories, with fermions in
higher-dimensional representations of arbitrary N-ality, and derive non-trivial
constraints on their IR dynamics. In particular, this class of theories enjoys
an independent discrete chiral symmetry and one may ask about the fate of this
symmetry in the background of BCF fluxes. We show that, under certain
conditions, an anomaly between the chiral symmetry and the BCF background rules
out massless composite fermions as the sole player in the IR: either the
composites do not form or additional contributions to the matching of the BCF
anomaly are required. We can also give a flavor-symmetric mass to the fermions,
smaller than or of order the strong scale of the theory, and examine the
$\theta$-angle periodicity of the theory in the BCF background. Interestingly,
we find that the conditions that rule out the composites are the exact same
conditions that lead to an anomaly of the $\theta$ periodicity: the massive
theory will experience a phase transition as we vary $\theta$ from $0$ to
$2\pi$.

Graves property (also known as the strong evolution property) if and only if
the foliation comes from a Liouville net. A similar result of Blaschke says
that a pair of orthogonal foliations has the Ivory property if and only if they
form a Liouville net.
  Let us say that a geodesically convex curve on a Riemannian surface has the
Poritsky property if it can be parametrized in such a way that all of its
string diffeomorphisms are shifts with respect to this parameter. In 1950,
Poritsky has shown that the only closed plane curves with this property are
ellipses.
  In the present article we show that a curve on a Riemannian surface has the
Poritsky property if and only if it is a coordinate curve of a Liouville net.
We also recall Blaschke's derivation of the Liouville property from the Ivory
property and his proof of Weihnacht's theorem: the only Liouville nets in the
plane are nets of confocal conics and their degenerations.
  This suggests the following generalization of Birkhoff's conjecture: If an
interior neighborhood of a closed geodesically convex curve on a Riemannian
surface is foliated by billiard caustics, then the metric in the neighborhood
is Liouville, and the curve is one of the coordinate lines.

topological quantum computation utilizing the predicted Majorana normal fluid

However, the long-sought 2D and 3D chiral superconductors with edge and surface
Majorana normal fluid are yet to be conclusively found. Here we report evidence
for a chiral spin-triplet pairing state of UTe$_2$ with significant surface
normal fluid response. The microwave surface impedance of the UTe$_2$ crystal
was measured and converted to complex conductivity, which is sensitive to both
normal and superfluid responses. The anomalous residual normal fluid
conductivity in the zero temperature limit supports the presence of a
significant normal fluid response. The superfluid conductivity follows the low
temperature behavior predicted for the axial spin-triplet state, which is
further narrowed down to the chiral spin-triplet state with evidence of broken
time-reversal symmetry. The temperature dependence of the superfluid
conductivity also reveals a low bulk impurity scattering rate and low
frequency-to-energy-gap ratio, implying that the observed normal fluid response
does not have a trivial origin. Our findings suggest that UTe$_2$ can be a new

with adversarial examples, most of these models still fail to defend against
the generalized types of noise. Motivated by the fact that hidden layers play a
highly important role in maintaining a robust model, this paper proposes a
simple yet powerful training algorithm, named \emph{Adversarial Noise
Propagation} (ANP), which injects noise into the hidden layers in a layer-wise
manner. ANP can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the nature of the
backward-forward training style. Through thorough investigations, we determine
that different hidden layers make different contributions to model robustness
and clean accuracy, while shallow layers are comparatively more critical than
deep layers. Moreover, our framework can be easily combined with other
adversarial training methods to further improve model robustness by exploiting
the potential of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10-P, and ImageNet demonstrate that ANP enables the strong
robustness for deep models against both adversarial and corrupted ones, and
also significantly outperforms various adversarial defense methods.

to detecting malicious logins to novel systems indicative of lateral movement
is presented, in which a user's historical login activity is used to build a
model of putative ""normal"" behavior. This historical login activity is
represented as a collection of daily login graphs, which encode authentications
among accessed systems. Each system, or graph vertex, is described by a set of
graph centrality measures that characterize it and the local topology of its
login graph. The unsupervised technique of non-negative matrix factorization is
then applied to this set of features to assign each vertex to a role that
summarizes how the system participates in logins. The reconstruction error
quantifying how well each vertex fits into its role is then computed, and the
statistics of this error can be used to identify outlier vertices that
correspond to systems involved in unusual logins. We test this technique with a
small cohort of privileged accounts using real login data from an operational
enterprise network. The ability of the method to identify malicious logins
among normal activity is tested with simulated graphs of login activity

study two recent notions, $C^{\mathrm exp}$-class distributions from [11] and
WF-holonomicity from [1], and we show that any distribution of $C^{\mathrm
exp}$-class is WF-holonomic. Thus we answer a question from [1] by providing a
framework of WF-holonomic distributions for non-archimedean local fields which
is stable under taking Fourier transforms and which contains many natural
distributions, in particular, the distributions studied in [1]. We further show
that one can regularize distributions without leaving the $C^{\mathrm
exp}$-class. Finally, we show a close link between zero loci and smooth loci
for functions and distributions of $C^{\mathrm exp}$-class, by proving a
converse to a result of [11]. A key ingredient is a new resolution result for
subanalytic functions (by alterations), based on embedded resolution for
analytic functions and model theory.

self-supervision from binocular-stereo data to circumvent the need for
high-quality laser scans or other ground-truth data. The disadvantage, however,
is that the photometric reprojection losses used with self-supervised learning
typically have multiple local minima. These plausible-looking alternatives to
ground truth can restrict what a regression network learns, causing it to
predict depth maps of limited quality. As one prominent example, depth
discontinuities around thin structures are often incorrectly estimated by
current state-of-the-art methods.
  Here, we study the problem of ambiguous reprojections in depth prediction
from stereo-based self-supervision, and introduce Depth Hints to alleviate
their effects. Depth Hints are complementary depth suggestions obtained from
simple off-the-shelf stereo algorithms. These hints enhance an existing
photometric loss function, and are used to guide a network to learn better
weights. They require no additional data, and are assumed to be right only
sometimes. We show that using our Depth Hints gives a substantial boost when
training several leading self-supervised-from-stereo models, not just our own.
Further, combined with other good practices, we produce state-of-the-art depth
predictions on the KITTI benchmark.

In order to work with wide-baseline light fields, we introduce the idea of
EPI-Shift: To virtually shift the light field stack which enables to retain a
small receptive field, independent of the disparity range. In this way, our
approach ""learns to think outside the box of the receptive field"". Our network
performs joint classification of integer disparities and regression of
disparity-offsets. A U-Net component provides excellent long-range smoothing.
EPI-Shift considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based

model, namely Adaptive Attention Time (AAT), to align the source and the target

attention steps to take to output a caption word at each decoding step. With
AAT, an image region can be mapped to an arbitrary number of caption words
while a caption word can also attend to an arbitrary number of image regions.
AAT is deterministic and differentiable, and doesn't introduce any noise to the

advanced mathematical techniques such as formal methods to address this
challenge. In fact, the initial results of such efforts are promising. Along
these lines, we propose the use of quantifier elimination (QE) - a formal
method technique, as a complimentary technique to the state-of-the-art static
analysis and verification procedures. Using an airborne collision avoidance DNN
as a case example, we illustrate the use of QE to formulate the precise range
forward propagation through a network as well as analyze its robustness. We
discuss the initial results of this ongoing work and explore the future
possibilities of extending this approach and/or integrating it with other
approaches to perform advanced safety assurance of DNNs.

learning and validation using an external knowledge base are employed to
incorporate the engagement annotated data and to boost the model's accuracy on
a sequence labeling task. Our results show that learning from data
automatically labeled by user engagement signals achieves significant accuracy

built using minimalistic mathematical assumptions, we specialize in two classes
of families of distributions with different statistical flavors: exponential
dispersion and proper dispersion models. The construction of dispersion models
involves the solution of integral equations that are, in general, untractable.
These difficulties disappear when a more mathematical structure is assumed: it
reduces to the calculation of a moment generating function or of a
Riemann-Stieltjes integral for the exponential dispersion and the proper
dispersion models, respectively. A new technique for constructing dispersion
models based on characteristic functions is introduced turning the integral
equations above into a tractable convolution equation and yielding examples of
dispersion models that are neither proper dispersion nor exponential dispersion
models. A corollary is that the cardinality of regular and non-regular
dispersion models are both large.
  Some selected applications are discussed including exponential families
non-linear models (for which generalized linear models are particular cases)
and several models for clustered and dependent data based on a latent Levy
process.

maintaining any additional information present in the image (e.g. smile,
hair-style, brightness). Our trained model is not provided the information that
it is concealing, and does not try learning it either. Namely, we created a
variational autoencoder (VAE) model that is trained on a dataset including
labels of the information one would like to conceal (e.g. gender, ethnicity,
age). These labels are directly added to the VAE's sampled latent vector. Due
to the limited number of neurons in the latent vector and its appended noise,
the VAE avoids learning any relation between the given images and the given
labels, as those are given directly. Therefore, the encoded image lacks any of
the information one wishes to conceal. The encoding may be decoded back into an
image according to any provided properties (e.g. a 40 year old woman).
  The proposed architecture can be used as a mean for privacy preserving and
can serve as an input to systems, which will become unbiased and not suffer
from prejudice. We believe that privacy and discrimination are two of the most
important aspects in which the community should try and develop methods to
prevent misuse of technological advances.

a great challenge in the design and analysis for real-time systems. With
scalability and flexibility in mind, the existing link switching protocols
usually consider each single link to be scheduled independently, e.g., the
worm-hole switching protocol. The flexibility of such link-based arbitrations
allows each packet to be distributed over multiple routers but also increases
the number of possible link states (the number of flits in a buffer) that have
to be considered in the worst-case timing analysis.
  For achieving timing predictability, we propose less flexible switching
protocols, called \emph{\Simultaneous Progressing Switching Protocols}
(SP$^2$), in which the links used by a flow \emph{either} all simultaneously
transmit one flit (if it exists) of this flow \emph{or} none of them transmits
any flit of this flow. Such an \emph{all-or-nothing} property of the SP$^2$

deadlock avoidance instead of timing predictability. We demonstrate the

sources with an energy density close to that in gamma rays and cosmic rays. A
multimessenger campaign triggered by the coincident observation of a gamma-ray
flare and a 290-TeV IceCube neutrino pinpointed the cosmic-ray accelerator TXS
0506+056. Subsequently, the IceCube archival data revealed a 3-month burst of
13 cosmic neutrinos in 2014-15 that dominates the neutrino flux of the source
over the 9.5 years of observations. The original identification of the source
as a blazar was puzzling because it requires a major accretion event onto the
rotating supermassive black hole to accommodate the neutrino burst. Subsequent
high-resolution radio images of the source with the VLBA brought to light a
merger of two galaxies, revealed by the interaction of two jets entangled in
the source. Recently, the blazar PKS 1502+106 was found in the direction of a
300-TeV neutrino alert, IC-190730. OVRA radio observations at 15 GHz indicate
that the neutrino also coincides with the highest flux density of a flare that
started five years ago. This matches the similar long-term outburst seen from
TXS 0506+056 and may indicate merger activity. Also, the dominant hotspot in
the 10-year IceCube neutrino sky map, NGC 1068 (Messier 77), is a Seyfert
galaxy undergoing a major accretion event onto the black hole. A few-percent
fraction of such special sources, now labeled as gamma-ray blazars, is
sufficient to accommodate the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux observed by IceCube.
While rapid progress seems likely, the observations also convincingly make the
case for the construction of more and larger neutrino telescopes with better
angular resolution.

$in~vitro$ measurements up to several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the rates
increase if the DNA is coiled rather than straight. Here we model how this
works $in~vivo$ in mammalian cells. We use chromatin-chromatin contact data
from state-of-the-art Hi-C experiments to map the protein target-search onto a

is proportional to measured contact probabilities. We then put forward a master
equation for the density of searching protein that allows us to calculate the
association rates across the genome analytically. For segments where the rates
are high, we find that they are enriched with active genes and have high RNA

show that the photocurrent in the Ge bottom cell is barely enough to achieve
current matching with the upper subcells, but the overall performance is poor

models for German syllable recognition on the Verbmobil corpus. The results
show that explicitly modeling prior knowledge is still valuable in building
recognition systems. With a strong language model (LM) based on syllables, the
structured approach significantly outperforms the end-to-end model. The best
word error rate (WER) regarding syllables was achieved using kaldi with a
4-gram LM, modeling all syllables observed in the training set. It achieved
10.0% WER w.r.t. the syllables, compared to the end-to-end approach where the
best WER was 27.53%. The work presented here has implications for building
future recognition systems that operate independent of a large vocabulary, as
typically used in a tasks such as recognition of syllabic or agglutinative
languages, out-of-vocabulary techniques, keyword search indexing and medical
speech processing.

information overload problem in recent decades. Traditional recommender

these issues, a great number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed to
leverage side information of users or items (e.g., social network and item
category), demonstrating a high degree of effectiveness in improving
recommendation performance. This Research Commentary aims to provide a
comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on recommender
systems with side information. Specifically, we provide an overview of
state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with side information from two
orthogonal perspectives. One involves the different methodologies of
recommendation: the memory-based methods, latent factor, representation
learning, and deep learning models. The others cover different representations
of side information, including structural data (flat, network, and hierarchical
features, and knowledge graphs); and non-structural data (text, image and video
features). Finally, we discuss challenges and provide new potential directions
in recommendation, along with the conclusion of this survey.

use spatial, temporal and motion information to extract the desired regions

features such as optical flow, divergence and intensity values. These features
extracted from the images are used to segment the pixels into different classes
in an unsupervised way. A comparative analysis is done by using multiple
clustering algorithms for segmentation. Here the Markov Random Field performs
more accurately than other segmentation algorithms since it characterizes the
spatial interactions of pixels using a finite number of parameters. It builds a
probabilistic image model that selects the most likely labeling using the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This unsupervised approach is tested on
various images and achieves a frame-wise fire detection rate of 95.39%. Hence
this method can be used for early detection of fire in real-time and it can be
incorporated into an indoor or outdoor surveillance system.

be used for both the pinhole camera and the fish-eye camera. Different from
existing methods, relative positions of 3D points rather than absolute
coordinates in the world coordinate system are employed in our method, and it
has a unique solution. The application scope of POSIT (Pose from Orthography
and Scaling with Iteration) algorithm is generalized to fish-eye cameras by
combining with the radially symmetric projection model. The image point
relationship between the pinhole camera and the fish-eye camera is derived
based on their projection model. The general pose expression which fits for
different cameras can be acquired by four noncoplanar object points and their
corresponding image points. Accurate estimation results are calculated
iteratively. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that the pose
estimation results of our method are more stable and accurate than
state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at

human-robot teaming, the emotion aspect of human is ignored. Nevertheless, the
influence of emotion, in some cases, is not only undeniable but beneficial.
This work studies the human-like characteristics brought by regret emotion in
one-human-multi-robot teaming for the application of domain search. In such
application, the task management load is outsourced to the robots to reduce the
human's workload, freeing the human to do more important work. The regret
decision model is first used by each robot for deciding whether to request
human service, then is extended for optimally queuing the requests from
multiple robots. For the movement of the robots in the domain search, we
designed a path planning algorithm based on dynamic programming for each robot.
The simulation shows that the human-like characteristics, namely, risk-seeking
and risk-aversion, indeed bring some appealing effects for balancing the
workload and performance in the human-multi-robot team.

method is based on time-series techniques that have been adapted to be

allows for the use of multiple variables in detecting different lithological
layers. Additionally, it reconstructs the phase space of a single drill-hole or

The computationally cheap method shows efficiency and accuracy in detecting
boundaries between lithological layers, which we demonstrate using examples

chemicals and transportation fuels. These oxygenated molecules have adequate
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms that can be used for developing new
value-added molecules (chemicals or transportation fuels). One motivation for
our study stems from the fact that a liquid phase upgrading using mineral acid
is a cost-effective chemical transformation. In this chemical upgrading
process, adding a proton (positively charged atomic hydrogen) to an oxygen atom
is a central step. The protonation energies of oxygen atoms in a molecule
determine the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction and likely chemical
reaction pathway. A quantum chemical model based on coupled cluster theory is
used to compute accurate thermochemical properties such as the protonation
energies of oxygen atoms and the feasibility of protonation-based chemical
transformations. However, this method is too computationally expensive to
explore a large space of chemical transformations. We develop a graph neural
network approach for predicting protonation energies of oxygen atoms of
hundreds of bioxygenate molecules to predict the feasibility of aqueous acidic
reactions. Our approach relies on an iterative local nonlinear embedding that
gradually leads to global influence of distant atoms and a output layer that
predicts the protonation energy. Our approach is geared to site-specific
predictions for individual oxygen atoms of a molecule in comparison with
commonly used graph convolutional networks that focus on a singular molecular
property prediction. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in learning
the location and magnitudes of protonation energies of oxygenated molecules.
