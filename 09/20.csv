spaced superconducting indium leads on a top of magnetic Weyl semimetal
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. For the disordered magnetic state of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
crystal, we only observe the Andreev reflection in the proximity of each of the
leads, which is indicative of highly transparent In-Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
interfaces. If the sample is homogeneously magnetized, it demonstrates
well-developed anomalous Hall effect state. In this regime we find the
Josephson current that takes place even for 5~$\mu$m long junctions and shows
the unusual magnetic field and temperature dependencies. As a possible reason
for the results obtained, we discuss the contribution to the proximity-induced
spin-triplet Josephson current from the topologically protected Fermi-arc
states on the surface of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$.

  Policy Design","Published as a conference paper at ICNP 2019",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In distributed software-defined networks (SDN), multiple physical SDN
controllers, each managing a network domain, are implemented to balance
centralised control, scalability, and reliability requirements. In such
networking paradigms, controllers synchronize with each other, in attempts to
maintain a logically centralised network view. Despite the presence of various
design proposals for distributed SDN controller architectures, most existing
works only aim at eliminating anomalies arising from the inconsistencies in
different controllers' network views. However, the performance aspect of
controller synchronization designs with respect to given SDN applications are
generally missing. To fill this gap, we formulate the controller
synchronization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and apply
reinforcement learning techniques combined with deep neural networks (DNNs) to
train a smart, scalable, and fine-grained controller synchronization policy,
called the Multi-Armed Cooperative Synchronization (MACS), whose goal is to
maximise the performance enhancements brought by controller synchronizations.
Evaluation results confirm the DNN's exceptional ability in abstracting latent
patterns in the distributed SDN environment, rendering significant superiority
to MACS-based synchronization policy, which are 56% and 30% performance
improvements over ONOS and greedy SDN controller synchronization heuristics.

a region in the velocity space where the blade's lift differs significantly
from regular regions. This may lead to instability and therefore this region is
avoided, typically by increasing the horizontal speed. This paper researches
this phenomenon in the context of small scale quadcopters. The region
corresponding to the VRS is identified by combining first principles modeling
and wind tunnel experiments. Moreover, we propose that the so called WBS or
autorotation region should also be avoided for quadcopters, which is not
necessarily the case for helicopters. A model is proposed for the velocity
constraints that the quadcopter must meet to avoid these regions. Then, the
problem of designing optimal time descend trajectories that avoid the VRS and
WBS regions is tackled. Finally, the optimal trajectories are implemented on a
quadcopter. The flight tests show that by following the designed trajectories,
the quadcopter is able to descend considerably faster than purely vertical
trajectories that also avoid the VRS and WBS.

processes via modified local density of electromagnetic states. In typical
scenarios, where nanosecond-scale fluorescent processes are involved,
mechanical conformational changes of the environment during the interaction
processes can be safely neglected. However, slow decaying phosphorescent
complexes (e.g. lanthanides) can efficiently sense micro- and millisecond scale
motion via near-field interactions. As the result, lifetime statistics can
inherit information about nano-scale mechanical motion. Here we study
light-matter interaction dynamics of phosphorescent dyes, diffusing in a
proximity of a plasmonic nanoantenna. The interplay between the time-varying
Purcell enhancement and stochastic motion of molecules is considered via a
modified diffusion equation, and collective decay phenomena is analysed. Fluid
properties, such as local temperature and diffusion coefficient are mapped on
phosphorescent lifetime distribution extracted with the help of inverse Laplace
transform. We present rather simple photonic platform enabling contactless
all-optical thermometry and diffusion measurement and paving a way for a
plethora of possible applications. Among them, the proposed analysis can be
used for detailed studies of nanofluidic processes in lab-on-a-chip devices,

at $z\sim5.7$ is associated with an underdense region at the tail end of cosmic
reionization. We carried out a survey of Lyman-break Galaxies (LBGs) using
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam in the field of the $z=5.98$ quasar J0148+0600, whose
spectrum presents an unusually long ($\sim160 \mathrm{cMpc}$) and opaque ($\tau
\gtrsim7$) Ly$\alpha$ trough at $5.5\le z\le 5.9$. LBG candidates were selected
to lie within the redshift range of the trough, and the projected number
densities were measured within 90~cMpc of the quasar sightline. The region
within $8'$ (or $\approx 19~\mathrm{cMpc}$) of the quasar position is the most
underdense of the whole field. The significance of the presence of the void is
estimated to be $99\%$. This is consistent with the significant deficit of
Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=5.72$ reported by Becker et al. and suggests
that the paucity of LAEs is not purely due to the removal of the Ly$\alpha$
emission by the high opacity but reflects a real coherent underdensity of
galaxies across the entire redshift range of the trough. These observations are
consistent with scenarios in which large optical depth fluctuations arise due
to fluctuations in the galaxy-dominant UV background or due to residual neutral
islands that are expected from reionization that is completed at redshifts as
low as $z\lesssim5.5$.

dark matter halos, limited to a mass in stars of log Mstars / Msun < 11.8. Most
giant elliptical galaxies also obey this fundamental limit, which corresponds
to a critical dark halo mass of log Mhalo / Msun = 12.7. Once a halo reaches
this mass, its gas can no longer cool and collapse in a dynamical time. Super
spirals survive today in halos as massive as log Mhalo / Msun = 13.6,
continuing to form stars from the cold baryons they captured before their halos

Number of Shots (iCANS). This adaptive optimizer frugally selects the number of
measurements (i.e., number of shots) both for a given iteration and for a given
partial derivative in a stochastic gradient descent. We numerically simulate
the performance of iCANS for the variational quantum eigensolver and for
variational quantum compiling, with and without noise. In all cases, and
especially in the noisy case, iCANS tends to out-perform state-of-the-art
optimizers for VHQCAs. We therefore believe this adaptive optimizer will be
useful for realistic VHQCA implementations, where the number of measurements is
limited.

time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the proposed approach, each
agent periodically computes its local reachable set and exchanges this
reachable set with the other agents with the goal of verifying the system
safety. Our method, implemented in Java, takes advantages of the timing
information and the reachable set information that are available in the
exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the whole system in a
decentralized manner. Any particular agent can also perform local safety
verification tasks based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages it
receives. We applied the proposed method to verify, in real-time, the safety
properties of a group of quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.

energy density functionals. This allows for modeling the thermal index across
the full range of densities and temperatures that may be probed in simulations

inhomogeneous mixed phase. For uniform matter we compare the results to
analytical expressions for $\Gamma_{\mathrm{th}}$ based on Fermi liquid theory.
The correlation between the thermal index and the effective masses at nuclear
saturation density is studied systematically through Bayesian modeling of the
nuclear equation of state. We then study the behavior of $\Gamma_{\mathrm{th}}$
in both relativistic and non-relativistic mean field models used in the
astrophysical simulation community to complement those based on chiral

records collected over 3 years. We first built a monthly aggregated temporal
network describing the baboon's co-presence in the cognitive testing booths. We
then used a null model, considering the heterogeneity in the baboons' activity,
to define both positive (association) and negative (avoidance) monthly
networks. We tested social balance theory by combining these positive and
negative social networks. The results showed that the networks were
structurally balanced and that newly created edges also tended to preserve
social balance. We investigated several network metrics to gain insights into
the individual level and group level social networks long-term temporal
evolution. A measure of similarity between successive monthly networks was able
to pinpoint periods of stability and instability and to show how some baboons'
ego-networks remained stable while others changed radically. Our study confirms
the prediction of social balance theory but also shows that large fluctuations
in the numbers of triads may limit its applicability to study the dynamic
evolution of animal social networks. In contrast, the use of the similarity
measure proved to be very versatile and sensitive in detecting relationships'

bringing intelligent mechanisms for handling network resources within the

reconfiguring the computing-plus-communication resources within the virtualized

minimize the overall energy consumption, with a guarantee of Quality of Service

pigments suspended in an aqueous liquid are deposited over a substrate,
typically an absorbing material such as paper. The physical processes which
lead to pattern formation have not been studied in any depth, in spite of being
closely related to flows in other contexts. Identifying and understanding these
processes is of imperative importance to restore and preserve watercolor
paintings. Here, we report an experimental study of the effect of the pigment
concentration and paper humidity on the pattern formation derived from
evaporation of droplets of watercolor paintings. Optical analysis reveals the
formation of color gradients, stratifications, flat regions, borders, dendritic
shapes, and radial tips. We found that droplet evaporation on dry paper forms
ring-shaped stains which resemble to the \emph{coffee-stain effect} regardless
of the nature of the pigment. The mean pixel intensity of such deposits follows
an exponential function that saturates at high concentration, while the
thickness of the coffee ring increase for watercolor inks containing colloidal
particles and does not change for non-colloidal . Our experiments reveal that
water distribution on the paper surface, and not the volumetric absorption of
water on the paper, determine the structural characteristics of watercolor
stains. We show evidence that the cornerstone in the creation of complex
patterns in watercolor paintings is driven by the coffee ring effect and
imbibition processes. Our findings aim to serve as framework for further
investigations of the complex processes involved in this ancient art form and
could guide restoration processes needed to preserve the heritage value of

Inference difficulties for simple linear SSMs are well known, particularly in
relation to simultaneous estimation of process and observation variances.
Several remedies to overcome estimation problems have been studied for
relatively simple SSMs, but whether these challenges and proposed remedies
apply for nonlinear stage-structured SSMs, an important class of ecological
models, is less well understood. Here we identify improvements for inference
about nonlinear stage-structured SSMs fit with biased sequential life stage
data. Theoretical analyses indicate parameter identifiability requires
covariates in the state processes. Simulation studies show that plugging in
externally estimated observation variances, as opposed to jointly estimating
them with other parameters, reduces bias and standard error of estimates. In
contrast to previous results for simple linear SSMs, strong confounding between
jointly estimated process and observation variance parameters was not found in
the models explored here. However, when observation variance was also estimated
in the motivating case study, the resulting process variance estimates were
implausibly low (near-zero). As SSMs are used in increasingly complex ways,
understanding when inference can be expected to be successful, and what aids
it, becomes more important. Our study illustrates (i) the need for relevant
process covariates and (ii) the benefits of using externally estimated

this requirement through its highly-parallelized nature, significant
performance improvements and new features. An automatic differential cutoff
extrapolation is introduced to assess the cutoff dependence of all results,
thus ensuring their reliability and potentially improving fixed-cutoff results
by an order of magnitude. The efficient differential study of PDF uncertainties
and PDF set differences at NNLO, for multiple PDF sets simultaneously, is
achieved by exploiting correlations. We use these improvements to study
uncertainties and PDF sensitivity at NNLO, using 371 PDF set members. The work
described here permits NNLO studies that were previously prohibitively
expensive, and lays the groundwork necessary for a future implementation of
NNLO calculations with a jet at Born level in MCFM.

Density measurements show that the hot gas kernel initially cools fast by

during the fast regime range from being 2 to 10 times those in the slower

the CFD of an SCFT to its weakly coupled gauge theory or quiver descriptions
and demonstrate that the CFD as recovered from the gauge theory approach is
consistent with that as determined by geometry. To each quiver description we
also associate a graph, and the embedding of this graph into the CFD that is
associated to an SCFT provides a systematic way to enumerate all possible
consistent weakly coupled gauge theory descriptions of this SCFT. Furthermore,
different embeddings of gauge theory graphs into a fixed CFD can give rise to
new UV-dualities for which we provide evidence through an analysis of the
prepotential, and which, for some examples, we substantiate by constructing the
M-theory geometry in which the dual quiver descriptions are manifest.

times fainter than their star and separated by a fraction of arcsecond. Current
instruments like SPHERE/VLT or GPI/Gemini detect young and massive planets
because they are limited by non-common path aberrations (NCPA) that are not

instruments capable of minimizing the NCPA is needed. One solution is the
self-coherent camera (SCC) focal plane wavefront sensor, whose performance was
demonstrated in laboratory attenuating the starlight by factors up to several
1e8 in space-like conditions at angular separations down to 2L/D. In this
paper, we demonstrate the SCC on the sky for the first time. We installed an
SCC on the stellar double coronagraph (SDC) instrument at the Hale telescope.
We used an internal source to minimize the NCPA that limited the vortex
coronagraph performance. We then compared to the standard procedure used at
Palomar. On internal source, we demonstrated that the SCC improves the
coronagraphic detection limit by a factor between 4 and 20 between 1.5 and
5L/D. Using this SCC calibration, the on-sky contrast is improved by a factor
of 5 between 2 and 4L/D. These results prove the ability of the SCC to be
implemented in an existing instrument. This paper highlights two interests of
the self-coherent camera. First, the SCC can minimize the speckle intensity in
the field of view especially the ones that are very close to the star where
many exoplanets are to be discovered. Then, the SCC has a 100% efficiency with
science time as each image can be used for both science and NCPA minimization.

developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning. An especially
successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method
that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a
meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks.
Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the
effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid
learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature
reuse, with the meta initialization already containing high quality features?
We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent
representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads
to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we
remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of a MAML-trained
network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image
classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We
further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network,
showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the
quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network
(the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs
feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.

architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust
emission, but can place an upper limit of 23$\mu$Jy if the belt is smaller than
4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to
low dust masses of $\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2}$ $M_\oplus$, which are expected after 8
Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a $>20$ $M_\oplus$
belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical
instability. This $20$ $M_\oplus$ mass upper limit is comparable to the
combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the
available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A
similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a
belt born with a mass $\gtrsim1$ $M_\oplus$ in 100 km-sized planetesimals could
explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future
characterisations of debris discs around low mass stars should focus on nearby
and young systems if possible.

of the Standard Model (SM) is an ever-growing mystery. It is possible that the
existence of new `dark sector' forces, yet undiscovered, are the key to solving
this fundamental problem, and one might hope that in the future such forces
might even be `unified' with the ones we already know in some UV-complete
framework. In this paper, following a bottom-up approach, we attempt to take
the first steps in the construction of such a framework. The much-discussed
possibility of the kinetic mixing (KM) of the `dark photon' with the
hypercharge gauge boson of the SM via loops of portal matter (PM) fields,
charged in both sectors, offers an attractive starting point for these efforts.
Given the anticipated finite strength of the KM in a UV-complete theory, the
absence of anomalies, and the lifetime constraints on the PM fields arising
from CMB and nucleosynthesis constraints, PM must behave as vector-like copies
of the known SM fermion fields, such as those which appear naturally in
$E_6$-type models. Within such a setup, the SM and their corresponding partner
PM fields would be related by a new $SU(2)_I$ gauge symmetry. With this
observation as a springboard, we construct a generalization of these ideas
where $SU(2)_I$ is augmented by an additional $U(1)_{I_Y}$ factor so that the
light dark photon is the result of a symmetry breaking analogous to the SM,
\ie, $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{I_Y}\to U(1)_D$, but with $U(1)_D$ now also broken at
the $\lesssim$ GeV scale. While SM fields are $U(1)_D$ singlets, as in the
conventional dark photon approach, they transform nontrivially under the full
$SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{I_Y}$ gauge group. This approach leads to numerous
interesting signatures, both at low energies and at colliders, and can be
viewed as an initial step in the construction of a more UV-complete framework.

whose origin is still under debate. We examine the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe]

is a generic consequence of a gas-rich merger at some time in the Galaxy's
evolution. The high-$\alpha$ sequence evolves first in the early galaxies,
extending to high metallicities, while it is the low-$\alpha$ sequence that is
formed after the gas-rich merger. The merger brings in fresh metal-poor gas
diluting the interstellar medium's metallicity while keeping the [$\alpha$/Fe]
abundance almost unchanged. The kinematic, structural and spatial properties of
the bimodal $\alpha$-sequence in our simulations reproduces that of
observations. In all simulations, the high-$\alpha$ disk is old, radially
concentrated towards the galaxy's center and shows large scale heights. In
contrast, the low-$\alpha$ disk is younger, more radially extended and
concentrated to the disk mid-plane. Our results show that the abundance plane
is well described by these two populations that have been distributed radially
across the disk by migration: at present-day in the solar neighbourhood,
low-$\alpha$ stars originate from both the inner and outer disk while most of
the high-$\alpha$ stars have migrated from the inner disk. We show that age
dating the stars in the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] plane can constrain the time of
the low-$\alpha$ sequence forming merger and conclude that $\alpha$-bimodality

present the enrichment history of Sr by a series of the $N$-body/smoothed
particle hydrodynamics simulations of a dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of 3

the metallicity ranges [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ $-$3 and [Fe/H] $\gtrsim$ $-$1,
respectively. It appears insufficient, however, to explain the overall
observational trends of Sr by considering only these sites. We find that the
models including electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) and rotating massive stars
(RMSs), in addition to NSMs and AGBs, reasonably reproduce the enrichment
histories of Sr in dwarf galaxies. The contributions of both ECSNe and NSMs
make scatters of $\approx$ 0.2 dex in [Sr/Fe], [Sr/Ba], and [Sr/Zn] as can be
seen for observed stars in the metallicity range [Fe/H] $<$ $-2$. We also find
that the mass range of ECSN progenitors should be substantially smaller than
$1\, M_\odot$ (e.g., 0.1-$0.2\, M_\odot$) to avoid over-prediction of [Sr/Ba]

achieve optimal performance while avoiding spectral overlap between neighboring

ophthalmology. This problem faces several challenges including low contrast,
variable vessel size and thickness, and presence of interfering pathology such
as micro-aneurysms and hemorrhages. Early approaches addressing this problem
employed hand-crafted filters to capture vessel structures, accompanied by
morphological post-processing. More recently, deep learning techniques have
been employed with significantly enhanced segmentation accuracy. We propose a
novel domain enriched deep network that consists of two components: 1) a
representation network that learns geometric features specific to retinal
images, and 2) a custom designed computationally efficient residual task
network that utilizes the features obtained from the representation layer to
perform pixel-level segmentation. The representation and task networks are {\em
jointly learned} for any given training set. To obtain physically meaningful
and practically effective representation filters, we propose two new
constraints that are inspired by expected prior structure on these filters: 1)
orientation constraint that promotes geometric diversity of curvilinear
features, and 2) a data adaptive noise regularizer that penalizes false
positives. Multi-scale extensions are developed to enable accurate detection of
thin vessels. Experiments performed on three challenging benchmark databases
under a variety of training scenarios show that the proposed prior guided deep
network outperforms state of the art alternatives as measured by common
evaluation metrics, while being more economical in network size and inference
time.

samples that are acquired in different domains, e.g., image, text, and audio.
Classic multiview analysis, e.g., canonical correlation analysis (CCA), tackles
this problem via matching the linearly transformed views in a certain latent
domain. More recently, powerful nonlinear learning tools such as kernel methods
and neural networks are utilized for enhancing the classic CCA. However, unlike
linear CCA whose theoretical aspects are clearly understood, nonlinear CCA
approaches are largely intuition-driven. In particular, it is unclear under
what conditions the shared latent components across the views can be
identified---while identifiability plays an essential role in many
applications. In this work, we revisit nonlinear multiview analysis and address
both the theoretical and computational aspects. Our work leverages a useful
nonlinear model, namely, the post-nonlinear model, from the nonlinear mixture
separation literature. Combining with multiview data, we take a nonlinear
multiview mixture learning viewpoint, which is a natural extension of the
classic generative models for linear CCA. From there, we derive a learning
criterion. We show that minimizing this criterion leads to identification of
the latent shared components up to certain ambiguities, under reasonable
conditions. Our derivation and formulation also offer new insights and
interpretations to existing deep neural network-based CCA formulations. On the
computation side, we propose an effective algorithm with simple and scalable
update rules. A series of simulations and real-data experiments corroborate our
theoretical analysis.

and magnetized turbulence are inseparable. It was not only shown that
reconnection is responsible for violating the frozen-in condition in

itself. The actual mechanism responsible for this driving is still unknown.
Processes such tearing mode or Kelvin-Helmholtz, among other plasma
instabilities, could generate turbulence from irregular current sheets. We
address the nature of driving mechanism for this process and consider a
relative role of tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities for the process of
turbulence generation. In particular, we analyze the conditions for development
of these two instabilities within three-dimensional reconnection regions. We
show that both instabilities can excite turbulence fluctuations in reconnection
regions. However, tearing mode has relatively slow growth rate, and at later
times it becomes partially suppressed by transverse to the current sheet
component of magnetic field, generated during the growth of turbulent
fluctuations. On the contrary, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability establishes
quickly in the outflow region, and at later times it dominates the turbulence
generation comparing to the contribution from tearing mode. Our results
demonstrate that the tearing instability is subdominant compared to the the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in terms of generation of turbulence in the 3D
reconnection layers and therefore the self-driven reconnection is turbulent
reconnection with tearing instability being important only at the initial stage
of the reconnection.

Compressive sensing (CS) channel estimation techniques usually adopt the

This may not be the best choice when considering non-uniform arrays, antenna
gain/phase errors, mutual coupling effects, etc. We propose two dictionary
learning (DL) algorithms to learn the best sparsifying dictionaries for channel
matrices from observations obtained with hybrid frequency-selective mmWave
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. First, we optimize the combined
dictionary, i.e., the Kronecker product of transmit and receive dictionaries,
as it is used in practice to sparsify the channel matrix. Second, considering
the different array structures at the transmitter and receiver, we exploit
separable DL to find the best transmit and receive dictionaries. Once the
channel is expressed in terms of the optimized dictionaries, various CS-based
sparse recovery techniques can be applied for low overhead channel estimation.
The proposed DL algorithms perform well under low SNR conditions inherent to
any mmWave communication systems before the precoders/combiners can be
optimized. The effectiveness of the proposed DL algorithms has been
corroborated via numerical simulations with different system configurations,

block coordinate descent (HiBCD) scheme wherein one coordinate is updated via
the fast proximal gradient (FPG) method, while another via the Frank-Wolfe (FW)

converge, by numerical experience, while the FW-type methods can offer lower
per-iteration complexity in certain cases; and we wish to take the best of

proof treats HiBCD as an optimization framework for a class of multi-block
structured optimization problems, and our stationarity claim is applicable not
only to CoSMF but also to many other problems. Previous optimization research
showed the same stationarity result for inexact block coordinate descent with

electronic structure calculations of an oxygen vacancy in ZnO supercell from ab

magnitude are well aligned with the assumption that electron heat conduction
dominates the SOL heat transport, simulations with drifts predict that the

electron heat conduction in both attached and detached conditions. Since
poloidal $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow propagates across magnetic field
lines, poloidal transport with shallow magnetic pitch angles can reach values
that are of the same order as would be provided by sonic flows parallel to the
field lines. These flows can lead to strongly convection dominated divertor
heat transport, increasing the poloidal volume of radiative power front,
consistent with previous measurements at DIII-D. Due to these convective flows,
the Lengyel integral approach, assuming zero convective fraction, is expected
to provide a pessimistic estimate for radiative capability of impurities in the

underestimates the radiated power by a factor of 6, indicating that for

a suppression at higher energies. The experimental data suggest that above the
ankle the UHECRs flux is dominated by an extragalactic component of
astrophysical origin. However, a minority component of exotic origin that

fall into three general categories: (1) preserving Gemini's current facilities
and strengths; (2) developing instrumentation and software systems, including
data pipelines, to enable new scientific capabilities that build on those
strengths; (3) strategizing how visiting instruments can deliver additional
valuable capabilities. We provide a high-level timeline (schematically
illustrated in one figure) for the main developments discussed in this SSP. The
schedule is ambitious, but in light of the recent Gemini in the Era of
Multi-Messenger Astronomy (GEMMA) award from the NSF, the plan becomes
achievable. Lists of milestones are given for gauging progress. As these
milestones are reached and new instruments become available, some current
instruments will need to be retired; we make recommendations in this regard.

resilient to disorder, irrespective of manufacturing precision or unpredictable

to overcome this dimensionality limitations by offering topological protection
over an extended range of dimensionalities. Here we demonstrate 2D photonic

evolutionary feature on the red giant branch known as the bump. Also at the
bump, shear instability in the star leads to magnetic fields that occur
preferentially on small length scales. Pneuman (1983) has suggested that the
emergence of small scale flux tubes in the Sun can give rise to enhanced
acceleration of the solar wind as a result of plasmoid acceleration (the melon
seed mechanism). In this paper, we examine the Pneuman formalism to determine
if it may shed some light on the process that drives mass loss from stars above
the bump. Because we do not currently have detailed information for some of the
relevant physical parameters, we are not yet able to derive a detailed model.
Instead, our goal in this paper is to explore a proof of concept. Using
parameters that are known to be plausible in cool giants, we find that the
total mass loss rate from such stars can be replicated. Moreover, we find that
the radial profile of the wind speed in such stars can be steep or shallow
depending on the fraction of the mass loss which is contained in the plasmoids.
This is consistent with empirical data which indicate that the velocity
profiles of winds from cool giants range from shallow to steep.

which base upon diagonal line structures in the recurrence plot (RP). Due to
the finite size of an RP, these lines can be cut by the borders of the RP and,
thus, bias the length distribution of diagonal lines and, consequently, the
line based RQA measures. In this letter we investigate the impact of the
mentioned border effects and of the thickening of diagonal lines in an RP
(caused by tangential motion) on the estimation of the diagonal line length
distribution, quantified by its entropy. Although a relation to the Lyapunov
spectrum is theoretically expected, the mentioned entropy yields contradictory
results in many studies. Here we summarize correction schemes for both, the
border effects and the tangential motion and systematically compare them to
methods from the literature. We show that these corrections lead to the
expected behavior of the diagonal line length entropy, in particular meaning
zero values in case of a regular motion and positive values for chaotic motion.
Moreover, we test these methods under noisy conditions, in order to supply

by a qubit with long control pulses was shown to be trap-free. Ultrafast
femtosecond and attosecond control becomes now widely applicable that motivates
the necessity for the analysis of traps on the ultrafast time scale. We do such
analysis for a qubit and show that ultrafast state transfer in a qubit remains
trap-free for a wide range of the initial and final states of the qubit. We
prove that for this range the probability of transition between the initial and
the final states has a saddle but has no traps.

from the lack of interpretation of the projection dimensions. Therefore, it is
often difficult to explain the physical meaning behind the embedding
dimensions. In this research, we propose the interpretable kernel DR algorithm
(I-KDR) as a new algorithm which maps the data from the feature space to a
lower dimensional space where the classes are more condensed with less
overlapping. Besides, the algorithm creates the dimensions upon local
contributions of the data samples, which makes it easier to interpret them by
class labels. Additionally, we efficiently fuse the DR with feature selection
task to select the most relevant features of the original space to the
discriminative objective. Based on the empirical evidence, I-KDR provides
better interpretations for embedding dimensions as well as higher
discriminative performance in the embedded space compared to the
state-of-the-art and popular DR algorithms.

to detect the Doppler shifting signal from the orbiting planet. In this paper
we demonstrate that, compared to cross-correlation methods currently used, the
technique of Doppler tomography has improved sensitivity in detecting the
subtle signatures expected from exoplanet atmospheres. This is partly due to
the use of a regularizing statistic, which acts to suppress noise, coupled to
the fact that all the data is fit simultaneously. In addition, we show that the
technique can also effectively suppress contanimating spectral features that
may arise due to overlapping lines, repeating line patterns, or the use of
incorrect linelists. These issues can confuse conventional cross-correlation
approaches, primarily due to aliasing issues inherent in such techniques,
whereas Doppler tomography is less susceptible to such effects. In particular,
Doppler tomography shows exceptional promise for simultaneously detecting
multiple line species (e.g. isotopologues), even when there are high contrasts
between such species -- and far outperforms current CCF analyses in this
respect. Finally, we demonstrate that Doppler tomography is capable of
recovering molecular signals from exoplanets using real data, by confirming the
strong detection of CO in the atmosphere of Tau Boo b. We recover a signal with

maps in e-e+p plasmas with various positron-to-proton ratios using synchrotron
emission models scaling the partial pressure of electrons and positrons
emitting at the observed frequency to the magnetic pressure, taking into
account Faraday rotation and conversion. The lepton-dominated models produce
bilaterally asymmetric radio intensity profiles with strong linear polarization
and Stokes Q and U maps that are bilaterally asymmetric (but strongly up-down
correlated) and antisymmetric (and sometimes up-down anticorrelated),

and polarization maps. Circular polarization provides the cleanest
observational tool for distinguishing the plasmas, as it increases outward from
the jet core and central axis for highly ionic plasma, and is suppressed for
pair dominated plasma. We find a measurable degree of circular polarization V/I

predicts that the intensity-normalized autocorrelation functions of Q and U

(IRFNs). Such models are intended to describe parts, or the entirety, of a
highly heterogeneous network of banks and their interconnections, in the global
financial system. Both the balance sheets and the stylized crisis behaviour of
banks are ingredients of the network model. A systemic crisis is pictured as
triggered by a shock to banks' balance sheets, which then leads to the
propagation of damaging shocks and the potential for amplification of the
crisis, ending with the system in a cascade equilibrium. Under some conditions
the model has ``locally tree-like independence (LTI)'', where a general
percolation theoretic argument leads to an analytic fixed point equation
describing the cascade equilibrium when the number of banks $N$ in the system
is taken to infinity. This paper focusses on mathematical properties of the
framework in the context of Eisenberg-Noe solvency cascades generalized to
account for fractional bankruptcy charges. New results including a definition
and proof of the ``LTI property'' of the Eisenberg-Noe solvency cascade
mechanism lead to explicit $N=\infty$ fixed point equations that arise under
very general model specifications. The essential formulas are shown to be
implementable via well-defined approximation schemes, but numerical exploration
of some of the wide range of potential applications of the method is left for
future work.

which grows exponentially with the introduction of new modalities. Learning
representations in such a scenario is inherently complex due to the presence of
multiple heterogeneous information channels. These channels can encode both (a)
inter-relations between the items of different modalities and (b)
intra-relations between the items of the same modality. Encoding multimedia
items into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space such that both types of
relations are captured and preserved is extremely challenging, especially if
the goal is a unified end-to-end learning framework. The two key challenges
that need to be addressed are: 1) the framework must be able to merge complex
intra and inter relations without losing any valuable information and 2) the
learning model should be invariant to the addition of new and potentially very
different modalities. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework which can
scale to data streams from many modalities. To that end we introduce a
hypergraph-based model for data representation and deploy Graph Convolutional
Networks to fuse relational information within and across modalities. Our
approach provides an efficient solution for distributing otherwise extremely
computationally expensive or even unfeasible training processes across
multiple-GPUs, without any sacrifices in accuracy. Moreover, adding new
modalities to our model requires only an additional GPU unit keeping the
computational time unchanged, which brings representation learning to truly
multimodal datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in the

space. As a result of the uncertainty principle, it is not possible to control
the initial conditions of particle emission in such a way that the particle
will definitely pass through two precisely defined positions along its path,
even if it is possible to line up the two positions with the emitter. However,
there is also an upside to the quantum mechanical laws of motion: constructive
quantum interferences can actually raise probabilities to values higher than
those permitted by classical causality. Here, it is shown that conventional
interferometric methods can be used to prepare photons in a quantum state in
which a non-vanishing fraction of particles will hit both of two possible
targets, even though the direct line-of-sight connecting the two targets is
blocked at the source. The demonstration of the effect is complicated by the
uncertainty principle because the physical detection of a particle at one
target disturbs the motion of the particle, making it impossible to determine
whether the initial state of motion would have allowed the particle to hit the
other target or not. It is nonetheless possible to determine the minimal
fraction of ""magic bullet"" particles that must have hit both targets by showing
that the number of particles hitting target A is larger than the number of
particles missing target B. Quantum interference effects can thus be used to
optimize the path of particles in free space beyond the classical limit of

use of the denoiser model is one of a well-known solution to reduce the

trend of adversarial perturbations through the CNN architectures. To analyze
the propagated perturbation, we measured normalized Euclidean Distance and
cosine distance in each CNN layer between the feature map of the perturbed
image passed through denoiser and the non-perturbed original image. We used
five well-known CNN based classifiers and three gradient-based adversarial
attacks. From the experimental results, we observed that in most cases,
Euclidean Distance explosively increases in the final fully connected layer
while cosine distance fluctuated and disappeared at the last layer. This means
that the use of denoiser can decrease the amount of noise. However, it failed
to defense accuracy degradation.

that $L^p$ distances (with $p\geq 1$) between these distribution

well-behaved to detect differences between distributions as they metrize the

Specifically, we derive a finite dimensional approximation of the metric given

analytic functions evaluated at spatial locations or frequencies (i.e,
features). The features can be chosen to maximize the differences of the
distributions and give interpretable indications of how they differs. Using an
$\ell_1$ norm gives better detection because differences between
representatives are dense as we use analytic kernels (non-zero almost
everywhere). The tests are consistent, while much faster than state-of-the-art

Graph convolution networks (GCN) is devised for interaction modeling. We
introduce three novel concepts into GCN. First, we decompose egocentric
interactions into ego-thing and ego-stuff interaction, modeled by two GCNs. In
both GCNs, ego nodes are introduced to encode the interaction between thing
objects (e.g., car and pedestrian), and interaction between stuff objects
(e.g., lane marking and traffic light). Second, objects' 3D locations are
explicitly incorporated into GCN to better model egocentric interactions.
Third, to implement ego-stuff interaction in GCN, we propose a MaskAlign
operation to extract features for irregular objects.
  We validate the proposed framework on tactical driver behavior recognition.
Extensive experiments are conducted using Honda Research Institute Driving
Dataset, the largest dataset with diverse tactical driver behavior annotations.
Our framework demonstrates substantial performance boost over baselines on the
two experimental settings by 3.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Furthermore, we
visualize the learned affinity matrices, which encode ego-thing and ego-stuff
interactions, to showcase the proposed framework can capture interactions
effectively.

echo is combined with CFD, i.e., an echo-CFD framework, to study ventricular

standard cross-sections is extended by 1) reconstructing valves (aortic and
mitral valves) from 2D-echo images and the superior wall; 2) optimizing the
location and orientation of the surfaces to incorporate the physiological

3) incorporating several smoothing algorithms to remove the nonphysical

ring vortex formation/propagation as well as the flow circulation. In addition,
the abnormal shape of unhealthy LV can drastically change the flow field during

conjectured to be dual to the thermalization of a weakly interacting CFT on the
boundary for low $N$ which, for $N\to\infty$, becomes strongly coupled. We
search for this thermalization effect by utilizing the D1D5 CFT to compute
effective string interactions for $N=2$. This is done by turning on a marginal
deformation of the theory which twists together or untwists effective strings.
For a system to thermalize, the initial state, which is far from thermal, must
redistribute it's energy via interactions until a thermal state is achieved. In
our case, we consider excited states of the effective strings. We compute
splitting amplitudes for 1) one excitation going to three excitations and 2)
two excitations going to four excitations using two insertions of the
deformation. Scenario 1) corresponds to a single particle moving in AdS.
Scenario 2) corresponds to two particles moving and colliding in AdS. We find
that the `1 to 3' amplitude has terms which oscillate with time, $t$, where $t$
is the duration of the two deformations. We find that the `2 to 4' amplitude
has similar oscillatory terms as well as secular terms which grow like $t^2$.
For this case the growth implies that for large $t$ the excitations in the
initial state, which carry a given energy, prefer to redistribute themselves
amongst lower energy modes in the final state. This is a key feature of
thermalization. Albeit in a simplified setting, we therefore argue that we have
identified the thermalization vertex in the D1D5 CFT, which after repeated
applications, should lead to thermalization. This ultimately maps to two
particles colliding and forming a black hole in AdS, which in our case, is a
fuzzball.

can guarantee high throughput in peak hours. TED can quickly compute a group of
maximum number of edge-disjoint paths for each ingress-egress switch pair. We
design two methods to select paths under the flow entry limit. We then input
the selected paths to our TE to minimize the maximum link utilization. In case
of large traffic matrix making the maximum link utilization larger than 1, we
input the utilization and the traffic matrix to the optimization of maximizing
overall throughput under a new constrain. Thus we obtain a realistic traffic
matrix, which has the maximum overall throughput and guarantees no traffic
starvation for each switch pair. Experiments show that TED has much better

doping in PEDOT:PSS films were investigated. During secondary doping with
ethylene glycol near the critical dopant concentration, non-crystalized PEDOT
molecules uncoupled from PSS chains and then underwent nano-crystallization.
These structural changes might be the key driving force for conductivity
enhancement via secondary doping.

construct the input tensor data of CNN, with the dynamic frequency features of
the power system after the disturbance as the output. The operation data of the
power system such as generators unbalanced power has spatial distribution
characteristics. The electrical distance is presented to describe the spatial
correlation of power system nodes, and the t-SNE dimensionality reduction
algorithm is used to map the high-dimensional distance information of nodes to
the 2-D plane, thereby constructing the CNN input tensor to reflect spatial
distribution of nodes operation data on 2-D plane. The CNN with deep network
structure and local connectivity characteristics is adopted and the network

to negligible effects of freezing point depression and pressure. On the other
hand, if nano-fluidic salt trapping happens, subsequent ice formation is
suppressed due to the high concentration of ions in the electrolyte. In this
case, our theory predicts that freezing starts at a significantly lower
temperature compared to pure water. In 1D, as the temperature goes even lower,
ice continuously grows, until the salt concentration reaches saturation, all
ions precipitate to form salt crystals, and freezing completes. Enormous
pressure can be generated if initial salt concentration is high before salt
entrapment. We show modifications to the classical nucleation theory, due to
the trapped salt ions. Interestingly, although the freezing process is
enormously changed by trapped salts, our analysis shows that the Gibbs-Thompson
equation on confined melting point shift is not affected by the presence of the

the required transmit power can be further reduced by re-designing the
`destructive region' of the constellations for symbol-level precoding and
re-formulating the power minimization problem. We further study the SINR
balancing problems with the derived `complete destructive region' with full,

problem becomes non-convex with statistical or no Eve's CSI. On the other hand,
in the presence of a smart eavesdropper using maximal likelihood (ML)
detection, the security cannot be guaranteed with all the existing approaches.
To this end, we further propose a random jamming scheme (RJS) and a random
precoding scheme (RPS), respectively. To solve the introduced convex/non-convex
problems in an efficient manner, we propose an iterative algorithm for the
convex ones based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and deal with the

all proposed schemes outperform the existing works in secrecy performance, and
that the proposed algorithm improves the computation efficiency significantly.

100 Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes in the northern and southern
hemispheres, it was designed to reach unprecedented sensitivity and energy
resolution. Understanding and correcting for systematic biases on the absolute
energy scale and instrument response functions will be a crucial issue for the
performance of CTA. The LUPM group and the Spanish/Italian/Slovenian
collaboration are currently building two Raman LIDAR prototypes for the online
atmospheric calibration along the line of sight of the CTA. Requirements for
such a solution include the ability to characterize aerosol extinction at two
wavelengths to distances of 30 km with an accuracy better than 5%, within time
scales of about a minute, steering capabilities and close interaction with the
CTA array control and data acquisition system as well as other auxiliary
instruments. Our Raman LIDARs have design features that make them different
from those used in atmospheric science and are characterized by large
collecting mirrors (2.5 m2), liquid light guides that collect the light at the
focal plane and transport it to the readout system, reduced acquisition time
and highly precise Raman spectrometers. The Raman LIDARs will participate in a
cross calibration and characterization campaign of the atmosphere at the CTA
North site at La Palma, together with other site characterization instruments.
After a one year test period there, an in depth evaluation of the solutions
adopted by the two projects will lead to a final Raman LIDAR design proposal
for both CTA sites.

an unsupervised 3D-zoom learning problem where images with an arbitrary zoom

convenient, as it is a challenging task to obtain a 3D-zoom dataset of natural

restricted to the Z-axis. In addition, the objects in the scenes should not
move when being captured, which hinders the construction of a large dataset of

a fully convolutional network architecture that models depth-image-based

for estimating the intermediate disparity; and (iii) incorporating a

our method outperforms previous novel view synthesis research in terms of

terms like `stateful', `stateless', `shared nothing', etc, and describe `fact
based' or `functional' descriptions of causal evolution to describe computer
processes, especially in cloud computing. The concepts are used ambiguously and
sometimes in contradictory ways, which has led to many imprecise beliefs about
their implications. This paper outlines the simple view of state and causation
in Promise Theory, which accounts for the scaling of processes and the
relativity of different observers in a natural way. It's shown that the
concepts of statefulness or statelessness are artifacts of observational scale
and causal bias towards functional evaluation. If we include feedback loops,
recursion, and process convergence, which appear acausal to external observers,
the arguments about (im)mutable state need to be modified in a scale-dependent
way. In most cases the intended focus of such remarks is not terms like
`statelessness' but process predictability. A simple principle may be
substituted in most cases as a guide to system design: the principle the
separation of dynamic scales.
  Understanding data reliance and the ability to keep stable promises is of
crucial importance to the consistency of data pipelines, and distributed
client-server interactions, albeit in different ways. With increasingly data
intensive processes over widely separated distributed deployments, e.g. in the
Internet of Things and AI applications, the effects of instability need a more
careful treatment.

show that regions of the sample with F-CDW correlations suppress

implies that an inhomogeneous superconducting state exists, in which some
regions show a weak or fragile form of superconductivity. By comparison of
F-CDW and AF-CDW correlation lengths, it is furthermore concluded that F-CDW

the dispersion of a narrow quasiparticle-hole channel is suppressed in favor of
broad and only weakly momentum dependent features, covering large spectral
ranges. Our analysis is based on complementary calculations in the
low-temperature homogeneous gauge and a mean-field treatment of thermal gauge
fluctuations, valid at intermediate and high temperatures.

  and Message Passing",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weighted model integration (WMI) is a very appealing framework for
probabilistic inference: it allows to express the complex dependencies of
real-world hybrid scenarios where variables are heterogeneous in nature (both
continuous and discrete) via the language of Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT); as well as computing probabilistic queries with arbitrarily complex
logical constraints. Recent work has shown WMI inference to be reducible to a
model integration (MI) problem, under some assumptions, thus effectively
allowing hybrid probabilistic reasoning by volume computations. In this paper,
we introduce a novel formulation of MI via a message passing scheme that allows
to efficiently compute the marginal densities and statistical moments of all
the variables in linear time. As such, we are able to amortize inference for
arbitrarily rich MI queries when they conform to the problem structure, here
represented as the primal graph associated to the SMT formula. Furthermore, we
theoretically trace the tractability boundaries of exact MI. Indeed, we prove
that in terms of the structural requirements on the primal graph that make our
MI algorithm tractable - bounding its diameter and treewidth - the bounds are
not only sufficient, but necessary for tractable inference via MI.

intuitively appealing it exhibits shortcomings not addressed in the current
literature. First, a counterfactual example generated by the state-of-the-art
systems is not necessarily representative of the underlying data distribution,
and may therefore prescribe unachievable goals(e.g., an unsuccessful life
insurance applicant with severe disability may be advised to do more sports).
Secondly, the counterfactuals may not be based on a ""feasible path"" between the
current state of the subject and the suggested one, making actionable recourse
infeasible (e.g., low-skilled unsuccessful mortgage applicants may be told to
double their salary, which may be hard without first increasing their skill
level). These two shortcomings may render counterfactual explanations
impractical and sometimes outright offensive. To address these two major flaws,
first of all, we propose a new line of Counterfactual Explanations research
aimed at providing actionable and feasible paths to transform a selected
instance into one that meets a certain goal. Secondly, we propose FACE: an
algorithmically sound way of uncovering these ""feasible paths"" based on the
shortest path distances defined via density-weighted metrics. Our approach
generates counterfactuals that are coherent with the underlying data
distribution and supported by the ""feasible paths"" of change, which are
achievable and can be tailored to the problem at hand.

freedom of the system during time evolution, known as scrambling. This process
is conveniently characterized by the out-of-time-order commutators (OTOC),
whose time dependence reveals salient aspects of the system's dynamics. Here we
study the spatially local spin correlation function i.e., the expectation value
of spin commutator and the corresponding OTOC of Dirac--Weyl systems in one,
two, and three spatial dimensions. The OTOC can be written as the square of the
expectation value of the commutator and the variance of the commutator. In
principle, the problem features two energy scales, the chemical potential, and
the high energy cutoff. We find that only the latter is dominant, therefore the
time evolution is separated into only two different regions. The spin
correlation function grows linearly with time initially and decays as $t^{-2}$
for late times. The OTOC reveals a universal $t^2$ initial growth from both the
commutator and the variance while its late time decay, $t^{-2}$ originates from
the variance of the commutator. This late time decay is identified as a
characteristic signature or Dirac-Weyl fermions. These features remain present
also at finite temperatures. Our results indicate that Dirac--Weyl systems are
slow information scramblers and are essential when additional channels for
scrambling, i.e., interaction or disorder are analyzed.

bottlenecks for training DNN models on large datasets. Identifying smaller
representative data samples with strategies like active learning can help
mitigate such bottlenecks. Previous works on active learning in NLP identify
the problem of sampling bias in the samples acquired by uncertainty-based
querying and develop costly approaches to address it. Using a large empirical
study, we demonstrate that active set selection using the posterior entropy of
deep models like FastText.zip (FTZ) is robust to sampling biases and to various
algorithmic choices (query size and strategies) unlike that suggested by
traditional literature. We also show that FTZ based query strategy produces
sample sets similar to those from more sophisticated approaches (e.g ensemble
networks). Finally, we show the effectiveness of the selected samples by
creating tiny high-quality datasets, and utilizing them for fast and cheap
training of large models. Based on the above, we propose a simple baseline for
deep active text classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art. We

properties are essential for creating a global picture of structure and
dynamical evolution of the main belt. The number of shape and spin models can
be increased not only when new data are available, but also by combining
independent data sets and inverting them together. Our aim was to derive new
asteroid models by processing readily available photometry. We used asteroid
photometry compiled in the Lowell Observatory photometry database with
photometry from the Gaia Data Release 2. Both data sources are available for
about 5400 asteroids. In the framework of the Asteroids@home distributed
computing project, we applied the light curve inversion method to each asteroid
to find its convex shape model and spin state that fits the observed
photometry. Due to the limited number of Gaia DR2 data points and poor
photometric accuracy of Lowell data, we were able to derive unique models for
only ~1100 asteroids. Nevertheless, 762 of these are new models that
significantly enlarge the current database of about 1600 asteroid models. Our
results demonstrate the importance of a combined approach to inversion of
asteroid photometry. While our models in general agree with those obtained by
separate inversion of Lowell and Gaia data, the combined inversion is more
robust, model parameters are more constrained, and unique models can be
reconstructed in many cases when individual data sets alone are not sufficient.

result, the emission rate of an excited atom gets enhanced significantly along
with a shift in the emission spectrum due to the change in the quantum

driven by the interactions between distinct entities. They have shown
particular promise as a means of modelling crowds of people in streets, public
transport terminals, stadiums, etc. However, the methodology faces a
fundamental difficulty: there are no established mechanisms for dynamically
incorporating real-time data into models. This limits simulations that are
inherently dynamic, such as pedestrian movements, to scenario testing of, for
example, the potential impacts of new architectural configurations on
movements. This paper begins to address this fundamental gap by demonstrating
how a particle filter could be used to incorporate real data into an
agent-based model of pedestrian movements at run time. The experiments show
that it is indeed possible to use a particle filter to perform online (real
time) model optimisation. However, as the number of agents increases, the
number of individual particles (and hence the computational complexity)
required increases exponentially. By laying the groundwork for the real-time
simulation of crowd movements, this paper has implications for the management
of complex environments (both nationally and internationally) such as

promising approach for fabrication of efficient nanophotonic applications. A

observed experimentally in the GaN planar hexagonal microcavities grown by a

cathodoluminescence spectra measured in-situ scanning electron microscope show
two or three emission peaks split by 100 meV or 160 meV for the resonators

compared with numerical calculations of the cavity mode energies, their

number of isolated cavity modes with a large Purcell factor. Such modes can
efficiently interact with the bulk exciton in GaN. The results are also
analyzed by diagonalization of Hamiltanion describing the system of interacting

and provide a simple and feasible way to break through the diffraction limit of
optical imaging system. However, due to the lack of effective theory and
formula system, the resolution limit, magnification and optimal imaging
position of the microsphere microsystem cannot be determined, which hinders its
application. In this paper, the microscopic theory of dielectric microspheres
is studied systematically, and the ray optics is extended to the imaging of
dielectric microspheres, so as to establish a formula system containing
important optical parameters such as resolution, magnification and imaging
position, which provides a solid theoretical basis for further optimization of
the nano-microscopic properties of dielectric microspheres. Compared with
simulation and experiment, the correctness of the formula system is ensured.
The formula shows that the mismatch between refractive index and ambient
refractive index limits the resolution of microspheres, and it is an effective
method to further improve the resolution to find the optimal refractive index
ratio. In addition, the larger refractive index of the medium microsphere and
the refractive index of the environment are conducive to the enhancement of the
imaging magnification, but the working distance of the microscope objective
must be taken into account in the experiment to obtain the ideal imaging
position. The theoretical system proposed in this paper effectively explains
the optical principle of dielectric microsphere imaging, gives optimized
optical parameters, and has been applied in experiments, which is of great
value for the practical application of dielectric microsphere nanometer
microscopy.

~10,000) spectroscopic observations with 2-m Nayuta telescope at Nishi-Harima
Astronomical Observatory. Spectra were obtained in 18 nights between November
2015 and March 2016. Several absorption lines such as Ca I and Li, and the H
alpha emission line were confirmed in the spectra. The Ic-band magnitudes of
V409 Tau changed by approximately 1 magnitude during the observation epoch. The
equivalent widths of the five absorption lines are roughly constant despite
changes in the Ic-band magnitudes. We conclude that the light variation of the
star is caused by the obscuration of light from the central star with a
distorted circumstellar disk, based on the relationship between the equivalent
widths of the absorption lines and the Ic-band magnitudes. The blue component
of the H alpha emission line was dominant during the observation epoch, and an
inverse P Cygni profile was observed in eight of the spectra. The time-variable

and their composition. We highlight errors in naively using horizontal-flipping
as a form of data augmentation in video. Next, we validate the realism of
time-reversed videos through a human perception study where people exhibit
equal preference for forward and time-reversed videos. Finally, we test our
approach on two datasets, Jester and Something-Something, evaluating the three
video transforms for zero-shot learning and data augmentation. Our results show
that gestures such as zooming in can be learnt from zooming out in a zero-shot

something out of something from burying something in something.

solar corona. Some of the most energetic occur on the periphery of active
regions where the magnetic field is strongly inclined. These jets exhibit a
non-radial propagation in the low corona as they follow the inclined field, and
often have a broad, helical shape. We present a three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of such an active-region-periphery helical jet.
We consider an initially potential field with a bipolar flux distribution
embedded in a highly inclined magnetic field, representative of the field
nearby an active region. The flux of the minority polarity sits below a
bald-patch separatrix initially. Surface motions are used to inject free energy
into the closed field beneath the separatrix, forming a sigmoidal flux rope
which eventually erupts producing a helical jet. We find that a null point
replaces the bald patch early in the evolution and that the eruption results
from a combination of magnetic breakout and an ideal kinking of the erupting
flux rope. We discuss how the two mechanisms are coupled, and compare our
results with previous simulations of coronal-hole jets. This comparison
supports the hypothesis that the generic mechanism for all coronal jets is a
coupling between breakout reconnection and an ideal instability. We further
show that our results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with
observations of active-region periphery jets.

magnet in which ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions compete on
anisotropic kagome lattices. A recent density functional theory calculation has
provided a magnetic model based on coupled trimers, which is consistent with a
broad 1/3-magnetization plateau observed experimentally. Here we study the
effects of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions in volborthite. We derive an
effective model in which pseudospin-1/2 moments emerging on trimers form a
network of an anisotropic triangular lattice. Using the effective model, we
show that for a magnetic field perpendicular to the kagome layer, magnon
excitations from the 1/3-plateau feel a Berry curvature due to the DM
interactions, giving rise to a thermal Hall effect. Our magnon Bose gas theory
can explain qualitative features of the magnetization and the thermal Hall
conductivity measured experimentally. A further quantitative comparison with
experiment poses constraints on the coupling constants in the effective model,
promoting a quasi-one-dimensional picture. Based on this picture, we analyze
low-temperature magnetic phase diagrams using effective field theory, and point
out their crucial dependence on the field direction.

densities in defining, detecting, and quantifying the non-classicality of field
states in quantum optics. The distance between a given pure state and the set
of all pure classical states is called here a geometric degree of
non-classicality. As such, we investigate non-classicality of a pure
single-mode state of the radiation field by using the coherent states as a
reference set of pure classical states. It turns out that any such distance is
expressed in terms of the maximal value of the Husimi $Q$ function. As an
insightful application we consider the de-Gaussification process produced when
preparing a quantum state by adding $p$ photons to a pure Gaussian one. For a
coherent-state input, we get an analytic degree of non-classicality which
compares interestingly with the previously evaluated entanglement potential.
Then we show that addition of a single photon to a squeezed vacuum state causes
a considerable enhancement of non-classicality, especially at weak and moderate
squeezing of the original state. By contrast, addition of further photons is
less effective.

geodesic motion, we relate scattering data to boundary entanglement of the CFT
vacuum. The basic idea is to use a family of plane waves parametrized by
coordinates of the space of geodesics i.e. kinematic space. This idea enables a
simple calculation of the Berry curvature living on kinematic space. As a
result we recover the Crofton form with a coefficient depending on the
scattering energy. In arriving at these results the space of horocycles is
used. We show that this new space used in concert with kinematic space
incorporates naturally the gauge degrees of freedom responsible for an analogue
of Berry's Phase. Horocycles also give a new geometric look to the strong
subadditivity relation in terms of lambda lengths giving rise to shear
coordinates of geodesic quadrangles. A generalization for geodesic polygons
then reveals an interesting connection with $A_{n}$ cluster algebras. Here the
cluster variables are the lambda lengths related to the regularized entropies
of the boundary via the Ryu-Takayanagi relation. An elaboration of this idea
indicates that cluster algebras might provide a natural algebraic means for
encoding the gauge invariant entanglement patterns of certain boundary
entangled states in the geometry of bulk geodesics. Finally using the language
of integral geometry we show how certain propagators connected to the bulk,
boundary and kinematic spaces are related to data of elementary scattering
problems. We also present some hints how these ideas might be generalized for
more general holographic scenarios.

is adopted to handle the nonconvexities of the original problem. Specifically,
a convenient change of variables and a constraint relaxation are performed,
while a successive linearization of the equations of motion is employed to
handle the nonlinear dynamics. A filtering technique concerning the recursive

For such purpose, a quantitative understanding of the density, charge state,
and kinetic energy of plasma constituents is needed at the location where they
contribute to materials processes. Here we study laser-induced plasmas over
expansion distances of several centimeters from the ablation target, which is
the relevant length scale for materials growth and modification. The study is
enabled by a fast implementation of a laser ablation/plasma expansion model
using an adaptive Cartesian mesh solver. Simulation outcomes for KrF excimer
laser ablation of Cu are compared with Langmuir probe and optical emission
spectroscopy measurements. Simulation predictions for the plasma-shielding
threshold, the ionization state of species in the plasma, and the kinetic
energy of ions, are in good correspondence with experimental data. For laser
fluences of 1-4 J/cm$^2$, the plume is dominated by Cu$^0$, with small
concentrations of Cu$^{+}$ and electrons at the expansion front. Higher laser
fluences (e.g., 7 J/cm$^2$) lead to a Cu$^{+}$-rich plasma, with a fully
ionized leading edge where Cu$^{2+}$ is the dominant species. In both regimes,
simulations indicate the presence of a low-density, high-temperature plasma
expansion front with a high degree of ionization that may play a significant
role in doping, annealing, and kinetically-driven phase transformations in 2D

the evolution of the skyrmion phase with the curvature is controlled by the
competition between two characteristic lengths, namely the curvature radius,
$R$ (geometrical length) and the skyrmion radius, $R_{sk}$ (physical length).
In narrow nanotubes ($R<R_{sk}$) the skyrmion phase evolves to a stripe phase,
while in wide nanotubes ($R>R_{sk}$) a mixed skyrmion-stripe phase emerges.
Most interestingly, the mixed phase is characterized by spatially separated
skyrmions from stripes owing to the direction of the applied field relative to
the surface normal. In the stability regime ($R \gtrsim R_{sk}$) skyrmions
remain circular and preserve their size as a consequence of their topological
protection. Zero-field skyrmions are shown to be stable on curved nanoelements

planet-disk interaction, testing numerical results against observations has
been limited so far. With the two directly imaged protoplanets embedded in its
circumstellar disk, PDS 70 offers an ideal testbed for planet-disk interaction
studies. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the
observed features can be well explained with the two planets in formation,
providing strong evidence that previously proposed theories of planet-disk
interaction are in action, including resonant migration, particle trapping,
size segregation, and filtration. Our simulations suggest that the two planets
are likely in 2:1 mean motion resonance and can remain dynamically stable over
million-year timescales. The growth of the planets at $10^{-8}-10^{-7}~M_{\rm
Jup}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, rates comparable to the estimates from H$\alpha$
observations, does not destabilize the resonant configuration. Large grains are
filtered at the gap edge and only small, (sub-)$\mu$m grains can flow to the
circumplanetary disks and the inner circumstellar disk. With the sub-millimeter
continuum ring observed outward of the two directly imaged planets, PDS 70
provides the first observational evidence of particle filtration by gap-opening
planets. The observed sub-millimeter continuum emission at the vicinity of the
planets can be reproduced when (sub-)$\mu$m grains survive over multiple
circumplanetary disk gas viscous timescales and accumulate therein. One such
possibility is if (sub-)$\mu$m grains grow in size and remain trapped in
pressure bumps, similar to what we find happening in circumstellar disks. We
discuss potential implications to planet formation in the solar system and
mature extrasolar planetary systems.

thermodynamic framework, to account consistently for the fluctuations of small
systems due to their interactions with the surrounding environment, is still
underway. Here we discuss how, in a small system, the interaction energy with
the environment may be described through a conjugate pair of intensive and
extensive variables, giving rise to a Gibbs thermodynamics with an additional
thermodynamic degree of freedom. The relevant thermodynamic potentials help
describe the equilibrium conditions and the material properties that measure
the susceptibility of the system to the interaction with the environment. The
resulting generalized ensembles, which describe the non-negligible, small
system fluctuations, are shown to be equivalent. Away from the average
thermodynamic state, the availability describes the distance between system and
the environment, in terms of the maximum work extractable from the fluctuation,
and a proper definition of entropy extends the thermodynamics to the generic
fluctuating state. From the latter state, entropic forces arise to restore the
average thermodynamic state. Our framework unifies and extends the ensemble
thermodynamics by Hill and the recent advances in statistical mechanics under
strong coupling and reduces to classical macroscopic thermodynamics when the
system is large. The particular case of a small ideal gas system is discussed
in detail and the example of a single particle immersed in a bath is revisited
in the light of the new formalism.

proposed hardware-assisted solutions to face issues coming from virtualization,

lack of approaches to address drawbacks. In this position paper, we propose the
usage of Intel's CPU security extension, namely SGX, to enable the adoption of

$\nu_{\rm min0}$ and $\nu_{\rm min1}$ are very close to each other. For 38
stars, the difference between these masses is less than 0.024 ${\rm M}_\odot$.
The radii of these stars from $\nu_{\rm min0}$ and $\nu_{\rm min1}$ are even
closer, with differences of less than 0.007 ${\rm R}_\odot$. These stars may be
the most well known solar-like oscillating stars and deserve to be studied in
detail. The asteroseismic expressions we derive for mass and radius show slight
dependence on metallicity. We therefore develop a new method for computing
initial metallicity from this surface metallicity by taking into account the
effect of microscopic diffusion. The time dependence of initial metallicity
shows some very interesting features that may be important for our
understanding of chemical enrichment of Galactic Disc. According to our
findings, every epoch of the disc has its own lowest and highest values for

stochastic differential equation. In comparison to previously proposed
stochastic models, the obtained process is infinitely differentiable at a given
finite Reynolds number, and its second-order statistical properties converge to
those of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite Reynolds number limit.
In this limit, it exhibits furthermore intermittent scaling properties, as they
can be quantified using higher-order statistics. To achieve this, we begin with
generalizing the two-layered embedded stochastic process of Sawford (1991) by
considering an infinite number of layers. We then study, both theoretically and
numerically, the convergence towards a smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable)
Gaussian process. To include intermittent corrections, we follow similar
considerations as for the multifractal random walk of Bacry et al. (2001). We
derive in an exact manner the statistical properties of this process, and
compare them to those estimated from Lagrangian trajectories extracted from
numerically simulated turbulent flows. Key predictions of the multifractal
formalism regarding acceleration correlation function and high-order structure
functions are also derived. Through these predictions, we understand
phenomenologically peculiar behaviours of the fluctuations in the dissipative
range, that are not reproduced by our stochastic process. The proposed
theoretical method regarding the modelling of infinitely differentiability
opens the route to the full stochastic modelling of velocity, including the
peculiar action of viscosity on the very fine scales.

shining brightly across the entire electromagnetic spectrum up to very
high-energy gamma rays. It is known from radio to gamma-ray observations that
the nebula is powered by a pulsar, which converts most of its rotational energy
losses into a highly relativistic outflow. This outflow powers a pulsar wind
nebula (PWN), a region of up to 10~light-years across, filled with relativistic
electrons and positrons. These particles emit synchrotron photons in the
ambient magnetic field and produce very high-energy gamma rays by Compton
up-scattering of ambient low-energy photons. While the synchrotron morphology
of the nebula is well established, it was up to now not known in which region
the very high-energy gamma rays are emitted. Here we report that the Crab
nebula has an angular extension at gamma-ray energies of 52 arcseconds
(assuming a Gaussian source width), significantly larger than at X-ray
energies. This result closes a gap in the multi-wavelength coverage of the
nebula, revealing the emission region of the highest energy gamma rays. These
gamma rays are a new probe of a previously inaccessible electron and positron
energy range. We find that simulations of the electromagnetic emission
reproduce our new measurement, providing a non-trivial test of our
understanding of particle acceleration in the Crab nebula.

increasing interest due to the challenges involved in designing optimal
artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these algorithms have been shown to
possess the potential to outperform the best human crafted architectures, a
less common use of them is as a tool for analysis of ANN structural components
and connectivity structures. In this work, we focus on this particular use-case
to develop a rigorous examination and comparison framework for analyzing
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) applied to time series prediction using the
novel neuro-evolutionary process known as Evolutionary eXploration of
Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM). Specifically, we use our EXAMM-based analysis
to investigate the capabilities of recurrent memory cells and the
generalization ability afforded by various complex recurrent connectivity
patterns that span one or more steps in time, i.e., deep recurrent connections.
EXAMM, in this study, was used to train over 10.56 million RNNs in 5,280
repeated experiments with varying components. While many modern, often
hand-crafted RNNs rely on complex memory cells (which have internal recurrent
connections that only span a single time step) operating under the assumption
that these sufficiently latch information and handle long term dependencies,
our results show that networks evolved with deep recurrent connections perform
significantly better than those without. More importantly, in some cases, the
best performing RNNs consisted of only simple neurons and deep time skip
connections, without any memory cells. These results strongly suggest that
utilizing deep time skip connections in RNNs for time series data prediction
not only deserves further, dedicated study, but also demonstrate the potential
of neuro-evolution as a means to better study, understand, and train effective

also impossible to probe, in a model independent approach, any new physics that
leads to an enhancement of decoherence during the neutrino evolution, an effect
that is present for instance in Open Quantum System formalism. However, such
mechanism can also induce changes between mass eigenstates if an energy
interchange between the neutrino subsystem and the reservoir is not explicitly

in an Open Quantum System are calculated, and limits are stablished for these
kind of transitions. We present our results in a pedagogical way, pointing out
how far the analysis can go without any assumption on the neutrino conversion

application. To apply appropriate RDW methods and manipulation, the RDW
controllers are predominantly used. There are three types of RDW controllers:
direct scripted controller, generalized controller, and predictive controller.
The scripted controller type pre-scripts the mapping between the real and
virtual environments. The generalized controller type employs the RDW method
and manipulation quantities according to a certain procedure depending on the
user's position in relation to the real space. This approach has the potential
to be reused in any environment; however, it is not fully optimized. The
predictive controller type predicts the user's future path using the user's
behavior and manages RDW techniques. This approach is highly anticipated to be
very effective and versatile; however, it has not been sufficiently developed.
This paper proposes a novel RDW controller using reinforcement learning (RL)
with advanced plannability/versatility. Our simulation experiments indicate
that the proposed method can reduce the number of reset manipulations, which is
one of the indicators of the effectiveness of the RDW controller, compared to
the generalized controller under real environments with many obstacles.
Meanwhile, the experimental results also showed that the gain output by the
proposed method oscillates. The results of a user study conducted showed that
the proposed RDW controller can reduce the number of resets compared to the
conventional generalized controller. Furthermore, no adverse effects such as
cybersickness associated with the oscillation of the output gain were evinced.
The simulation and user studies demonstrate that the proposed RDW controller
with RL outperforms the existing generalized controllers and can be applied to
users.

to fat power-law tails in the resistance distribution. Studying many-particle

compatible with the data, a simple additivity argument suggests a Gaussian

energetic condition and Goldstein and Salganik (1974)'s principle of local
symmetry. The difference between the two papers was that in the more recent
one, the local value of the critical energy-release-rate was no longer
considered as a constant, but heuristically allowed to depend upon the ratio of
the local mode III to mode I stress intensity factors. This led to a much
improved, qualitatively acceptable agreement of theory and experiments, for the
""threshold'' value of the ratio of the unperturbed mode III to mode I stress
intensity factors, above which coplanar propagation becomes unstable. In this
paper, the analysis is extended to the case where a small additional mode II
loading component is present in the initially planar configuration of the
crack, generating a small, general kink of this crack from the moment it is
applied. The main new effect resulting from presence of such a loading
component is that the instability modes present above the threshold must drift
along the crack front during its propagation. This prediction may be useful for
future theoretical interpretations of a number of experiments where such a
drifting motion was indeed observed.

which each subsidiary runs a product line and is exposed to some external

may increase the default probabilities of all surviving subsidiaries. The total
dividend problem for the insurance group is investigated and we find that the
optimal dividend strategy is still of the barrier type. Furthermore, we show
that the optimal barrier of each subsidiary is modulated by the default state.
That is, how many and which subsidiaries have defaulted will determine the
dividend threshold of each surviving subsidiary. These conclusions are based on
the analysis of the associated recursive system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
variational inequalities (HJBVIs). The existence of the classical solution is
established and the verification theorem is proved. In the case of two
subsidiaries, the value function and optimal barriers are given in analytical
forms, allowing us to conclude that the optimal barrier of one subsidiary
decreases if the other subsidiary defaults.

at least maintain an occupancy map of the environment for navigation, an

that some rigid objects are covered by the towels. If no covered objects are

Weighted MRI (DWI) are the first step in designing computer-aided detection
algorithms for prostate cancer. However, variations in MRI acquisition
parameters and scanner manufacturing result in different appearances of
prostate tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have
shown to be successful in various medical image analysis tasks including
segmentation are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging parameters.
This sensitivity leads to poor segmentation performance of CNNs trained on a
source cohort and tested on a target cohort from a different scanner and hence,
it limits the applicability of CNNs for cross-cohort training and testing.
Contouring prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWI images are
time-consuming and expensive. Thus, it is important to enable CNNs pretrained
on images of source domain, to segment images of target domain with minimum
requirement for manual segmentation of images from the target domain. In this
work, we propose a transfer learning method based on a modified U-net

accuracy. Our results show that with a fine-tuning data as few as 30 patients
from the target domain, the proposed transfer learning-based algorithm can
reach dice score coefficient of 0.80 for both prostate whole gland and
transition zone segmentation. Using a fine-tuning data of 115 patients from the
target domain, dice score coefficient of 0.85 and 0.84 are achieved for
segmentation of whole gland and transition zone, respectively, in the target

from the area of business process management. Through the focus on processes,
they create process models that require management, including support for

on structural properties of models rather than on exploiting behavioral
properties capturing aspects of model execution. While the latter is more
challenging, it is also more effective, especially when models are used for
auditing or process automation. The focus of this paper is to overcome the
challenges associated with behavioral querying of process models in order to
unlock its benefits. The first challenge concerns determining decidability of
the building blocks of the query language, which are the possible behavioral
relations between process tasks. The second challenge concerns achieving
acceptable performance of query evaluation. The evaluation of a query may
require expensive checks in all process models, of which there may be
thousands. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a special-purpose
programming language, namely Process Query Language (PQL) for behavioral
querying of process model collections. The language relies on a set of
behavioral predicates between process tasks, whose usefulness has been
empirically evaluated with a pool of process model stakeholders. This study
resulted in a selection of the predicates to be implemented in PQL, whose
decidability has also been formally proven. The computational performance of
the language has been extensively evaluated through a set of experiments
against two large process model collections.

parameters describing the shape of the fertility curve are projected foward
using time series methods. The model is estimated within a Bayesian framework,
allowing predictive distributions of future fertility rates to be produced that
naturally incorporate both time series and parametric uncertainty. A number of
choices are possible for the precise form of the functions used in the
two-component mixtures. The performance of several model variants is tested on
data from four countries; England and Wales, the USA, Sweden and France. The
former two countries exhibit multi-modality in their fertility rate curves as a
function of age, while the latter two are largely uni-modal. The models are
estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the `stan` software package on data
covering the period up to 2006, with the period 2007-2016 held back for
assessment purposes. Forecasting performance is found to be comparable to other

thermodynamic singularity, we identify these transitions with inflection points
of the approximate order parameters: normalized light-quark condensate and
renormalized Polyakov loop, respectively. We show that the quadratic curvature
of the chiral transition temperature in the ``temperature--chemical potential''
plane depends rather weakly on the strength of the background magnetic field.
At weak magnetic fields, the thermal width of the chiral crossover gets
narrower as the density of the baryon matter increases, possibly indicating a
proximity to a real thermodynamic phase transition. Remarkably, the curvature
of the chiral thermal width flips its sign at $eB_{\mathrm{fl}} \simeq
0.6\,\mathrm{GeV}^2$, so that above the flipping point $B > B_{\mathrm{fl}}$,
the chiral width gets wider as the baryon density increases. Approximately at
the same strength of magnetic field, the chiral and deconfining crossovers
merge together at $T \approx 140\,\mathrm{MeV}$. The phase diagram in the
parameter space ``temperature-chemical potential-magnetic field'' is outlined,

tractable approximation to the polarization function and study its behavior for
different twist angles. We find that the polarization has three different
momentum regimes. For small momenta, the polarization is quadratic, leading to
a linear dielectric function expected for a two-dimensional dielectric
material. For large momenta, the polarization becomes independent of the twist
angle and approaches that of uncoupled graphene layers. In the intermediate
momentum regime, the dependence on the twist-angle is strong. Close to the
largest magic angle the dielectric function peaks at a momentum of $~1/(4 \:
nm)$ attaining values of 25, meaning very strong screening at intermediate
distances. We also calculate the effective screened Coulomb interaction in real
space and give estimates for the on-site and extended interaction terms for the
recently developed hexagonal-lattice model. For free-standing TBG the effective
interaction decays slower than $1/r$ at intermediate distances $r$, while it
remains essentially unscreened at large enough $r$.

However, wearable technology remains ill-suited for applications which require
monitoring and interpretation of complex motor behaviors (e.g. involving
interactions with the environment). Recent advances in computer vision and deep
learning have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from video
recordings. In this paper, we present a hierarchical vision-based behavior
phenotyping method for classification of basic human actions in video
recordings performed using a single RGB camera. Our method addresses challenges
associated with tracking multiple human actors and classification of actions in
videos recorded in changing environments with different fields of view. We
implement a cascaded pose tracker that uses temporal relationships between
detections for short-term tracking and appearance-based tracklet fusion for
long-term tracking. Furthermore, for action classification, we use pose
evolution maps derived from the cascaded pose tracker as low-dimensional and
interpretable representations of the movement sequences for training a
convolutional neural network. The cascaded pose tracker achieves an average
accuracy of 88\% in tracking the target human actor in our video recordings,
and overall system achieves average test accuracy of 84\% for target-specific
action classification in untrimmed video recordings.

where programs should not perform memory accesses that depend on secrets. In
some cases this policy can be safely relaxed if one can prove that the program

propose a novel approach for verifying constant-time programming based on a new
information flow property, called output-sensitive noninterference.
Noninterference states that a public observer cannot learn anything about the
private data. Since real systems need to intentionally declassify some
information, this property is too strong in practice. In order to take into
account public outputs we proceed as follows: instead of using complex explicit
declassification policies, we partition variables in three sets: input, output
and leakage variables. Then, we propose a typing system to statically check
that leakage variables do not leak more information about the secret inputs
than the public normal output. The novelty of our approach is that we track the
dependence of leakage variables with respect not only to the initial values of
input variables (as in classical approaches for noninterference), but taking
also into account the final values of output variables. We adapted this
approach to LLVM IR and we developed a prototype to verify LLVM
implementations.

their smooth loss landscape and accurate gradient information. Nonetheless,
these architectures may not necessarily lead to better generalization
performance compared with other candidate architectures in the same search

self-propulsion direction of the Janus particles they contain. Here we explore
a simple effective model of colloidal mixtures which allows reproducing most
aspects seen in experiments, including the morphology and the velocity-reversal

attractions of the passive particles to the active colloids' caps, taking place
even at close contact and pushing the active particles backwards. When the
phoretic interactions are repulsive, in turn, they cause dynamical aggregation
of passive colloids in the chemical density minima produced by the active
particles, as recently seen in experiments; in other parameter regimes they
induce travelling fronts of active particles pursued by passive ones coexisting
with an active gas.

contraction metric is a Riemannian metric with respect to which the distance
between adjacent solutions decreases as time increases. The Riemannian metric
can be expressed by a matrix-valued function on the phase space.
  The determination of a contraction metric can be achieved by approximately
solving a matrix-valued partial differential equation by mesh-free collocation
using Radial Basis Functions (RBF). However, so far no rigorous verification
that the computed metric is indeed a contraction metric has been provided.
  In this paper, we combine the RBF method to compute a contraction metric with
the CPA method to rigorously verify it. In particular, the computed contraction
metric is interpolated by a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) metric at the
vertices of a fixed triangulation, and by checking finitely many inequalities,
we can verify that the interpolation is a contraction metric. Moreover, we show
that, using sufficiently dense collocation points and a sufficiently fine
triangulation, we always succeed with the construction and verification. We
apply the method to two examples.

(FEF), $\gamma_a$, by constructing a method which consists in minimizing an
error function defined as to measure the deviation of the potential at the
boundary, yielding approximate axial multipole coefficients of a general
axial-symmetric conducting emitter shape, on which the apex FEF can be
calculated by summing its respective Legendre series. Such method is
analytically applied for a conducting hemisphere on a flat plate, confirming
the known result of $\gamma_a = 3$. Also, it is applied on a hemi-ellipsoid on
a plate where the values of the apex FEF are compared with the ones extracted
from the analytical expression. Then, the method is applied for the hemisphere
on a cylindrical post (HCP) model. In this case, to analytically estimate the
apex FEF from first principles is a problem of considerable complexity. Despite
the slow convergence of the apex FEF, useful analytical conclusions are drawn
and explored, such as, it is confirmed that all even multipole contributions of
the HCP model are zero, which in turn leads to restrictions on the charge
density distribution: it will be shown the surface charge density must be an
odd function with respect to height in an equivalent system. Also, expressions
found for the apex FEF depend explicitly on the aspect ratio, that is, the
ratio of height by base radius. Using the dominant multipole contribution, the
dipole, at sufficient large distances, it is shown that, for two interacting
emitters, as their separation distance increases, the fractional change in apex
FEF, $\delta$, decreases following a power law with exponent $-3$. The result
is extended for conducting emitters having an arbitrary axially-symmetric
shape, where it is also shown $\delta$ has a pre-factor depending on geometry,
confirming the tendency observed in recent analytical and numerical results.

technology and machine intelligence, the velocity of today's information leads
to high market efficiency. Sound financial theories demonstrate that in an
efficient marketplace all information available today, including expectations
on future events, are represented in today prices whereas future price trend is
driven by the uncertainty. This jeopardizes the efforts put in designing
prediction models. To deal with the unpredictability of financial systems,
today's portfolio management is largely based on the Markowitz framework which
puts more emphasis in the analysis of the market uncertainty and less in the
price prediction. The limitation of the Markowitz framework stands in taking
very strong ideal assumptions about future returns probability distribution.
  To address this situation we propose PAGAN, a pioneering methodology based on
deep generative models. The goal is modeling the market uncertainty that
ultimately is the main factor driving future trends. The generative model
learns the joint probability distribution of price trends for a set of
financial assets to match the probability distribution of the real market. Once
the model is trained, a portfolio is optimized by deciding the best
diversification to minimize the risk and maximize the expected returns observed
over the execution of several simulations. Applying the model for analyzing
possible futures, is as simple as executing a Monte Carlo simulation, a
technique very familiar to finance experts. The experimental results on

relation graph. SemSentSum achieves competitive results on two types of
summary, consisting of 665 bytes and 100 words. Unlike other state-of-the-art
models, neither hand-crafted features nor additional annotated data are
necessary, and the method is easily adaptable for other tasks. To our

multi-document summarization.

distribution of aerosols. Specifically the often neglected mass of small ions
influences the aerosol growth rate, which may be important for terrestrial
cloud formation. To this end, we develop a numerical model to calculate the
growth of a species of aerosols in the presence of charge, which explicitly
includes terms for ion-condensation. It is shown that a positive contribution
to aerosol growth rate is obtained by increasing the ion-pair concentration
through this effect, consistent with recent experimental findings. The
ion-condensation effect is then compared to aerosol growth from charged aerosol
coagulation, which is seen to be independent of ion-pair concentration. The

have been developed. These tools allow data analysts to represent
multidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant
information as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures
simultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many
criteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based
on the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently
used to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate
mapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators
tend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be
supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps. In
this paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for `Map Interpretation
using Neighbourhood Graphs'. It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of
map quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is
done by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the
data space and in the embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and
unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By this mean,
analysts may determine whether proximity (or remoteness) of points on the map
faithfully represents similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within
the meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach to two
pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and
trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the community, which
will allow an easy handling by users.

from season to season and for different teams. It is evident that a method
capable of forecasting and analyzing the future of these players on-field
antics shall assist the management to a great extent. In a simulated
environment like the Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over the
world participate and manage the players catalogue for the entire season. Due
to the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for the
formulation of a dream team. This study aims to tackle this problem by using a
hybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequent
maximization of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). Given the player
points for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for the
current season by modeling differently for ARIMA and RNN, and then creating an
ensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques were
deployed to enhance the efficacy of the prepared model. Constraints on the type
of players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with the
total budget were effectively optimized using LPP approach. The validation of
the proposed team was done with the performance in upcoming season, where the
players outperform as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility of
the solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended to English

every financial institution. Financial institutions are the front line in the
war against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and
technology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial
misconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate
between malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations
tend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate
time-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this
domain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the
effectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key
challenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they
address financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms.
Where financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their
own firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across
institutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work
relentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across
institutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private
partnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements,
thereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In
this paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across
institutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to
build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning
and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrated that our federated model
outperforms local model by 20% with the UK FCA TechSprint data set. This new
platform opens up a door to efficiently detecting global money laundering
activity.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key challenges arising when compilers vectorize loops for today's
SIMD-compatible architectures is to decide if vectorization or interleaving is
beneficial. Then, the compiler has to determine how many instructions to pack
together and how many loop iterations to interleave. Compilers are designed
today to use fixed-cost models that are based on heuristics to make
vectorization decisions on loops. However, these models are unable to capture
the data dependency, the computation graph, or the organization of
instructions. Alternatively, software engineers often hand-write the
vectorization factors of every loop. This, however, places a huge burden on
them, since it requires prior experience and significantly increases the
development time. In this work, we explore a novel approach for handling loop
vectorization and propose an end-to-end solution using deep reinforcement
learning (RL). We conjecture that deep RL can capture different instructions,
dependencies, and data structures to enable learning a sophisticated model that
can better predict the actual performance cost and determine the optimal
vectorization factors. We develop an end-to-end framework, from code to
vectorization, that integrates deep RL in the LLVM compiler. Our proposed
framework takes benchmark codes as input and extracts the loop codes. These
loop codes are then fed to a loop embedding generator that learns an embedding
for these loops. Finally, the learned embeddings are used as input to a Deep RL
agent, which determines the vectorization factors for all the loops. We further
extend our framework to support multiple supervised learning methods. We
evaluate our approaches against the currently used LLVM vectorizer and loop
polyhedral optimization techniques. Our experiments show 1.29X-4.73X
performance speedup compared to baseline and only 3% worse than the brute-force
search on a wide range of benchmarks.

Multimodal In-cabin Experience), the in-cabin agent responsible for handling
certain multimodal passenger-vehicle interactions. When the passengers give
instructions to AMIE, the agent should parse such commands properly considering
available three modalities (language/text, audio, video) and trigger the
appropriate functionality of the AV system. We had collected a multimodal
in-cabin dataset with multi-turn dialogues between the passengers and AMIE
using a Wizard-of-Oz scheme via realistic scavenger hunt game. In our previous

utterance-level intents (set destination, change route, go faster, go slower,
stop, park, pull over, drop off, open door, and others) along with intent
keywords and relevant slots (location, position/direction, object,
gesture/gaze, time-guidance, person) associated with the action to be performed

multimodal understanding of in-cabin utterances by incorporating

passenger gestures and gaze from in-cabin video stream, referred objects
