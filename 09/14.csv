the Standard Model. As such, searches for evidence of DM particles are being
carried out using a wide range of techniques, such as direct searches for DM
particles, searches for DM produced with colliders, and indirect searches for
the Standard Model annihilation products of DM. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect Dark Matter searches due to their
relatively high DM content and negligible expected astrophysical background. A
collaboration was formed to maximise the sensitivity of DM searches towards
dSphs by combining for the first time dSph data from three imaging air
Cherenkov telescope (IACT) arrays: HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS; the Fermi-LAT
satellite, and the water Cherenkov detector HAWC. Due to the diverse nature of
the instruments involved, each experiment will analyse their individual
datasets from multiple targets and then the results will be combined at the
likelihood level. For consistency of the likelihoods across the five
experiments, a common approach is used to treat the astrophysical factor
(J-Factor) for each target and an agreed set of annihilation channels are
considered. We also agree on a common statistical approach and treatment of
instrumental systematic uncertainties. The results are presented in terms of
constraints on the velocity-weighted cross section for DM self-annihilation as
a function of the DM particle mass.

machine learning tasks within a wide range of domains, including vision, NLP,

advantage of DNNs over shallow counterparts remains questionable. In
particular, there is no sufficient evidence that deep learning machinery allows
constructing methods that outperform gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT),
which are often the top choice for tabular problems. In this paper, we
introduce Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), a new deep learning
architecture, designed to work with any tabular data. In a nutshell, the
proposed NODE architecture generalizes ensembles of oblivious decision trees,
but benefits from both end-to-end gradient-based optimization and the power of
multi-layer hierarchical representation learning. With an extensive
experimental comparison to the leading GBDT packages on a large number of
tabular datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed NODE
architecture, which outperforms the competitors on most of the tasks. We
open-source the PyTorch implementation of NODE and believe that it will become
a universal framework for machine learning on tabular data.

the propagation of nerve signals capillary waves of water-based electrolytes in
elastic tubular systems are considered as an essential ingredient. Their
propagation velocities, controlled by the elastic properties and geometry of
the neuron membrane as well as the density of the confined electrolyte, are
shown to very well match observed nerve conduction velocities. As the capillary
wave packets experience little damping and exhibit non-linear behavior they can
propagate a soliton excitation. The orientation of water dipoles by the high
electric fields up to about 10 million V/m in the about 1 nm thin layer
adjacent to the elastic neuron membrane causes radial forces that modulate the
diameter of the nerve cell with a change of the voltage bias across the cell
membrane, caused, e. g., by local injection of ions. Acting like an
electrically driven peristaltic pump the cell body thus can launch capillary
waves into the axon which also transport neutral dipole current pulses
modulated the varying voltage bias. At the synaptic end of the axon these
dipole current pulses can cause voltage changes and initiate chemical
signaling. In contrast to the traditional Hodgkin-Huxley model of nerve
conduction the proposed mechanisms avoids charge currents and thus exhibits low
dissipation. Specific features that could further influence and verify the
proposed alternative mechanisms of nerve conduction are discussed.

prove that if the limit set of a GDMS is not porous then it is not porous

holes of relative size at every scale in a prescribed direction.
  We then narrow our focus to systems associated to complex continued fractions
with arbitrary alphabet and we provide a novel characterization of porosity for
their limit sets. Moreover, we introduce the notions of upper density and upper
box dimension for subsets of Gaussian integers and we explore their connections
to porosity. As applications we show that limit sets of complex continued

for Julia sets of meromorphic functions. We show that if the Julia set of a
tame meromorphic function is not the whole complex plane then it is porous at a
dense set of its points and it is almost everywhere mean porous with respect to
natural ergodic measures. On the other hand, if the Julia set is not porous

amphiphiles) is developed based on an earlier single-site model of (monopolar)
amphiphiles [S. Dey, J. Saha, Phys. Rev. E 95, 023315 (2017)]. The model
incorporates aqueous environment (both hydrophobic effect and hydration force)
in its anisotropic site-site interactions, thus obviating the need to simulate
solvent particles explicitly. This economy of sites and the absence of explicit
solvent particles enable molecular dynamics simulations of bolaamphiphiles to
achieve mesoscopic length and time-scales unattainable by any bead-spring model
or explicit solvent computations. The model applies to generic bolas only,
since the gain in scale can only be obtained by sacrificing the resolution of
detailed molecular structure. Thanks to dual-sites, however, (as opposed to a
single-site model) our model can incorporate the essential flexibility of bolas
that leads to their U-conformers. The model bolas show successful self-assembly
into experimentally observed nano-structures like micelles, rods, lamellae etc.
and retain fluidity in very stable monolayers. Presence of membrane-spanning
model bolas in bilayers of model monopolar amphiphiles increases the stability
and impermeability of the lamellar phase. Model bolas are also seen to be less
diffusive and to produce thicker layers compared to their monopolar
counterparts. Rigid model bolas, though achiral themselves, show self-assembly
into helical rods. As all these observations agree with the well-known key
characteristics of archaeal lipids and synthetic bolaamphiphiles, our model
promises to be effective for studies of bolas in context of biomimetics,
drug-delivery and low molecular weight hydrogelators. To the best of our
knowledge, no other single or dual-site, solvent-free model for bolas has been

$XX$ interactions in quantum annealing. Such interactions allow the
time-dependent Hamiltonian to be non-stoquastic, and the instantaneous ground
state can have negative amplitudes in the computational basis. Our construction
relies on how the degeneracy of the Ising Hamiltonian's ground states is broken
away from the end point of the anneal: above a certain value of the
antiferromagnetic $XX$ interaction strength, the perturbative ground state at
the end of the anneal changes from a symmetric to an antisymmetric state. This
change is associated with a suppression of one of the Ising ground states,
which can then be detected using solely computational basis measurements. We
show that a semiclassical approximation of the annealing protocol fails to
reproduce this feature, making it a candidate `quantum signature' of the
evolution.

distinguished: boundary asymptotics where parameters of the correlation
function can touch the boundary of the limiting eigenvalue support and bulk
asymptotics where they are strictly inside the support. For the complex Ginibre
ensemble this involves Painlev\'e IV at the boundary as $N \to \infty$. Our
approach, together with the results in \cite{HW17} suggests that this should
arise in a much broader class of planar models. For the bulk asymptotics, one
of our results can be interpreted as the merging of two `planar Fisher-Hartwig
singularities' where Painlev\'e V arises in the asymptotics. We also discuss
the correspondence of our results with a normal matrix model with $d$-fold
rotational symmetries known as the \textit{lemniscate ensemble}, recently
studied in \cite{BGM, BGG18}. Our approach is flexible enough to apply to
non-Gaussian models such as the truncated unitary ensemble or induced Ginibre

Scaling near the boundary leads to Painlev\'e V, in contrast to the Ginibre

polymer chains in a fluid containing a solute which has a concentration
gradient, and examine the variation of the induced diffusiophoretic velocity of
the polymer chains as the interaction between the monomer and the solute is
varied. We find that there is a non-monotonic relation between the
diffusiophoretic mobility and the strength of the monomer-solute interaction.
In addition we find a weak dependence of the mobility on the length of the
polymer chain, which shows clear difference from the diffusiophoresis of a
solid particle. Interestingly, the hydrodynamic flow through the polymer is
much less screened than for pressure driven flows.

paper, we first propose two semantics-enhanced rewards obtained from downstream
question paraphrasing and question answering tasks to regularize the QG model
to generate semantically valid questions. Second, since the traditional
evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) often fall short in evaluating the quality of
generated questions, we propose a QA-based evaluation method which measures the
QG model's ability to mimic human annotators in generating QA training data.
Experiments show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance
w.r.t. traditional metrics, and also performs best on our QA-based evaluation
metrics. Further, we investigate how to use our QG model to augment QA datasets
and enable semi-supervised QA. We propose two ways to generate synthetic QA
pairs: generate new questions from existing articles or collect QA pairs from
new articles. We also propose two empirically effective strategies, a data
filter and mixing mini-batch training, to properly use the QG-generated data

crucial role in stellar evolution. Among short-period (<1 day) binary
characteristics, age remains one of the most difficult to measure. In this
paper, we constrain the lifetime of short-period binaries through their
kinematics. With the kinematic information from Gaia Data Release 2 and light
curves from {\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (WISE), we investigate
the eclipsing binary fraction as a function of kinematics for a volume-limited
main-sequence sample. We find that the eclipsing binary fraction peaks at a
tangential velocity of $10^{1.3-1.6}$ km/s, and decreases towards both low and
high velocity end. This implies that thick disk and halo stars have eclipsing
binary fraction $\gtrsim 10$ times smaller than the thin-disk stars. This is
further supported by the dependence of eclipsing binary fraction on the
Galactic latitude. Using Galactic models, we show that our results are
inconsistent with any known dependence of binary fraction on metallicity.
Instead, our best-fit models suggest that the formation of these short-period
binaries is delayed by 0.6-3 Gyr, and the disappearing time is less than the
age of the thick disk. The delayed formation time of $\gtrsim0.6$ Gyr implies
that these short-period main-sequence binaries cannot be formed by pre-main
sequence interaction and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism alone, and suggests that
magnetic braking plays a key role in their formation. Because the main-sequence
lifetime of our sample is longer than 14 Gyr, if the disappearance of
short-period binaries in the old population is due to their finite lifetime,
our results imply that most ($\gtrsim90$%) short-period binaries in our sample
merge during their main-sequence stage.

213 km s$^{-1}$), but there are spatial variations that are qualitatively
similar in both lines and coincide with resolved UV components. This suggests
that the emission originates from two components with plausibly different HI
column densities. We place VR7 in the context of other galaxies at similar and
lower redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ halo scale length is similar at different
redshifts and velocity shifts with respect to the systemic are typically
smaller. Overall, we find little indications of a more neutral vicinity at
higher redshift. This means that the local ($\sim 10$ kpc) neutral gas
conditions that determine the observed Ly$\alpha$ properties in VR7 resemble
the conditions in post-re-ionisation galaxies.

between the density of dark matter averaged over ~Mpc scales, and the

function by learning the tracer bias between density fields and halo catalogues
using a neural bias model. The method is based on the Bayesian analysis of
simple, physically motivated, neural network-like architectures, which we
denote as neural physical engines, and neural density estimation. As a result,
we are able to sample the initial phases of the dark matter density field
whilst inferring the parameters describing the halo mass distribution function,
providing a fully Bayesian interpretation of both the initial dark matter
density distribution and the neural bias model. We successfully run an upgraded
BORG inference using our new likelihood and neural bias model with halo
catalogues derived from full N-body simulations. We notice orders of magnitude

BH-galaxy coevolution: compact galaxies might have large amounts of gas in
their centers due to their high mass-to-size ratios, and simulations predict
that high central gas density can boost BH accretion. However, it is not yet
clear if BH growth is fundamentally related to the compactness of the host
galaxy, due to observational degeneracies between compactness, stellar mass
($M_\bigstar$), and star formation rate (SFR). To break these degeneracies, we
carry out systematic partial-correlation studies to investigate the dependence
of sample-averaged BH accretion rate ($\rm \overline{BHAR}$) on the compactness
of host galaxies, represented by the surface-mass density, $\Sigma_\rm e$, or
the projected central surface-mass density within 1 kpc, $\Sigma_1$. We utilize
8842 galaxies with H < 24.5 in the five CANDELS fields at z = 0.5-3. We find
that $\rm \overline{BHAR}$ does not significantly depend on compactness when
controlling for SFR or $M_\bigstar$ among bulge-dominated galaxies and galaxies
that are not dominated by bulges, respectively. However, when testing is
confined to star-forming galaxies at z = 0.5-1.5, we find that the $\rm
\overline{BHAR}$-$\Sigma_1$ relation is not simply a secondary manifestation of
a primary $\rm \overline{BHAR}$-$M_\bigstar$ relation, which may indicate a
link between BH growth and the gas density within the central 1 kpc of

suggests an abundance of free-floating small bodies whose ejection into
galactic space cannot be explained by the current population of confirmed
exoplanets. Shortly after 'Oumuamua's discovery, observational results from the
DSHARP survey illustrated the near-ubiquity of ring/gap substructures within
protoplanetary disks, strongly suggesting the existence of a vast population of
as-yet undetected wide-separation planets that are capable of efficiently
ejecting debris from their environments. These planets have $a \gtrsim 5$ au
and masses of order Neptune's or larger, and they may accompany $\sim$50% of
newly formed stars (Zhang et al. 2018). We combine the DSHARP results with
statistical constraints from current time-domain surveys to quantify the
population of detectable icy planetesimals ejected by disk-embedded giant
planets through gravity assists. Assessment of the expected statistical
distribution of interstellar objects is critical to accurately plan for and
interpret future detections. We show that the number density of interstellar
objects implied by 'Oumuamua is consistent with 'Oumuamua itself having
originated as an icy planetesimal ejected from a DSHARP-type system via gravity
assists, with the caveat that 'Oumuamua's lack of observed outgassing remains
in strong tension with a cometary origin. Under this interpretation,
'Oumuamua's detection points towards a large number of long-period giant
planets in extrasolar systems, supporting the hypothesis that the observed gaps
in protoplanetary disks are carved by planets. In the case that 'Oumuamua is an
ejected cometary planetesimal, we conclude that LSST should detect up to a few
interstellar objects per year of 'Oumuamua's size or larger and over 100

identify geometric structure in data, and clusters in particular; their
spectral properties play a central role in a number of unsupervised and
semi-supervised learning algorithms. When suitably scaled, graph Laplacians
approach limiting continuum operators in the large data limit. Studying these
limiting operators, therefore, sheds light on learning algorithms. This paper
is devoted to the study of a parameterized family of divergence form elliptic
operators that arise as the large data limit of graph Laplacians. The link
between a three-parameter family of graph Laplacians and a three-parameter
family of differential operators is explained. The spectral properties of these
differential operators are analyzed in the situation where the data comprises
two nearly separated clusters, in a sense which is made precise. In particular,
we investigate how the spectral gap depends on the three parameters entering
the graph Laplacian, and on a parameter measuring the size of the perturbation
from the perfectly clustered case. Numerical results are presented which
exemplify and extend the analysis: the computations study situations in which
there are two nearly separated clusters, but which violate the assumptions used
in our theory; situations in which more than two clusters are present, also
going beyond our theory; and situations which demonstrate the relevance of our
studies of differential operators for the understanding of finite data problems
via the graph Laplacian. The findings provide insight into parameter choices
made in learning algorithms which are based on weighted adjacency matrices;
they also provide the basis for analysis of the consistency of various
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, in the large data limit.

dynamics, including correlations and currents, and provides information on
back-to-back nucleons observed in electron and neutrino scattering experiments.
We demonstrate that in the quasielastic regime and at moderate momentum
transfers both initial- and final-state correlations, and two-nucleon currents
are important for a quantitatively successful description of the inclusive
response and final state nucleons. Finally, the approach can be extended to
include relativistic---kinematical and dynamical---effects, at least
approximately in the two-nucleon sector, and to describe the response in the
resonance-excitation region.

neural field equation (NFE). The value $u(t,x)$ represents the membrane
potential at time $t$ of a typical neuron located in position $x$, embedded in
an infinite network of neurons. In the present paper, we complement this result
by studying the fluctuations of such a stochastic system around its mean-field
limit $u(t,x)$. Our first main result is a central limit theorem stating that
the spatial distribution associated with these fluctuations converges to the
unique solution of some stochastic differential equation driven by a Gaussian
noise. In our second main result, we show that the solutions of this stochastic
differential equation can be well approximated by a stochastic version of the
neural field equation satisfied by $u(t,x)$. To the best of our knowledge, this

hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) a few months after the explosion. The
delayed interaction suggests a detached CSM shell, unlike in a typical SN IIn
where the CSM is much closer and the interaction commences earlier
post-explosion; indicating a different mass loss history. We present near- to
mid-infrared observations of SN 2014C from 1-5 years after the explosion,

Spectroscopy shows that the interaction is still ongoing, with the
intermediate-width He I 1.083 $\mu$m emission present out to our latest epoch
1639 days post-explosion. The last Spitzer/IRAC photometry at 1920 days
post-explosion further confirms ongoing CSM interaction. The 1-10 $\mu$m
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be explained by a dust model with a
mixture of 69% carbonaceous and 31% silicate dust, pointing to a chemically
inhomogeneous CSM. The inference of silicate dust is the first among
interacting SNe. An SED model with purely carbonaceous CSM dust is possible,
but would require more than 0.22 $M_{\odot}$ of dust, which is an order of
magnitude larger than what observed in any other SNe, measured in the same way,
at this epoch. The light curve beyond 500 days is well fit by an interaction
model with a wind-driven CSM and a mass loss rate of $\sim 10^{-3} \,
M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$, which presents an additional CSM density component
exterior to the constant density shell reported previously in the literature.
SN 2014C could originate in a binary system, similar to RY Scuti, which would
explain the observed chemical and density profile inhomogeneity in the CSM.

Hamiltonians are amenable for quantum computing. Recent studies performed for
several benchmark systems using quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithms
demonstrated that these formulations can recover a significant portion of
ground-state dynamical correlation effects that stem from the electron
excitations outside of the active space. These results have also been confirmed
in studies of ground-state potential energy surfaces using quantum simulators.
In this letter, we study the effectiveness of the DUCC formalism in describing
excited states. We also emphasize the role of the QPE formalism and its
stochastic nature in discovering/identifying excited states or excited-state
processes in situations when the knowledge about the true configurational
structure of a sought after excited state is limited or postulated (due to the
specific physics driving excited-state processes of interest). In this context,
we can view the QPE algorithm as an engine for verifying various hypotheses for
excited-state processes and providing statistically meaningful results that
correspond to the electronic state(s) with the largest overlap with a
postulated configurational structure. We illustrate these ideas on examples of
strongly correlated molecular systems, characterized by small energy gaps and
high density of quasi-degenerate states around the Fermi level.

deflection angle exceeds 90 degrees. The coronal magnetic field configuration
is computed from daily synoptic maps of magnetic field from SOHO/MDI and
SDO/HMI using a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. By comparing the
ambient magnetic field configuration and the measured position angles (MPA) of
the CMEs, we conclude that the deflection of 80% of the CMEs (35 of 44) are
consistent with the ambient magnetic field configuration, agreeing with
previous studies. Of these 35, 71% are deflected toward the heliospheric
current sheet (HCS), and 29 degrees toward a pseudo-streamer (PS), the boundary
between the same-polarity magnetic field regions. This implies that the ambient
coronal magnetic field configuration plays an important and major role in the
deflection of CMEs, and that the HCS configuration is more important than PS.
If we exclude 13 CMEs having much higher uncertainty from the sample, the
agreement between the deflection of CMEs and the ambient field configuration
increases substantially, reaching 94% in the new sample of 31 CMEs.

find that the na\""ive algorithm based on an alternate evolution of the

Yet, we show that the time reversibility is recovered if the wavefunction and

achieved by using the Ehrenfest theorem together with the splitting method. The
proposed algorithm is conditionally stable, symmetric, time-reversible, and
conserves the norm of the wavefunction. The preservation of these geometric
properties is shown analytically and demonstrated numerically on a

obtain time-reversible integrators of an arbitrary even order. We observed
$10000$-fold speedup by using the tenth- instead of the second- order method to
obtain a solution with a time discretization error below $10^{-9}$. Moreover,
using the adaptive grid instead of the fixed grid resulted in a 64-fold
reduction in the required number of grid points in the harmonic system and made
it possible to simulate the He-H$_{2}$ scattering for six times longer, while
maintaining reasonable accuracy. Applicability of the algorithm to

posed new challenges for designing efficient algorithms that process
large-scale graphs. These challenges arise from two usual assumptions in
classical algorithm design, namely that graphs are static and that they fit

addition, we ran simple numerical simulations in order to validate our
measurements. We computed the average coefficient of restitution (COR) of
collisions and find values ranging from 0.55 for systems including a population
of fine grains to 0.94 for systems of denser particles. We also measured the
sticking threshold velocities and find values around 1 cm/s, consistent with
the current dust collision models based on independently collected experimental

simulation of particles in PPDs and planetary rings: (1) The average COR of
collisions between same-sized free-floating particles at low speeds (< 2 cm/s)
is not dependent on the collision velocity; (2) The simplified approach of
using a constant COR value will accurately reproduce the average behavior of a

influence of particle rotation becomes apparent on the collision behavior; (4)

primitives in graph algorithmics. In recent years, the study of paths in
temporal graphs, that is, graphs where the vertex set is fixed but the edge set
changes over time, gained more and more attention. A path is time-respecting,
or temporal, if it uses edges with non-decreasing time stamps. We investigate a
basic constraint for temporal paths, where the time spent at each vertex must
not exceed a given duration $\Delta$, referred to as $\Delta$-restless temporal
paths. This constraint arises naturally in the modeling of real-world processes
like packet routing in communication networks and infection transmission routes
of diseases where recovery confers lasting resistance. While finding temporal
paths without waiting time restrictions is known to be doable in polynomial
time, we show that the ""restless variant"" of this problem becomes
computationally hard even in very restrictive settings. For example, it is
W[1]-hard when parameterized by the distance to disjoint path of the underlying
graph, which implies W[1]-hardness for many other parameters like feedback
vertex number and pathwidth. A natural question is thus whether the problem
becomes tractable in some natural settings. We explore several natural
parameterizations, presenting FPT algorithms for three kinds of parameters: (1)
output-related parameters (here, the maximum length of the path), (2) classical
parameters applied to the underlying graph (e.g., feedback edge number), and
(3) a new parameter called timed feedback vertex number, which captures
finer-grained temporal features of the input temporal graph, and which may be
of interest beyond this work.

$\approx \! 0.5$ of nuclei within $\sim \! 1$ nm from the qubit, and for the NV
center initialized in a superposition of $m\! = \! 0$ and either $m\! =\! 1$ or

prepared in a superposition of $m\! = \! 1$ and $m\! =\! -1$ states, i.e. when
the qubit couples to the spin environment in a way analogous to that of
spin-$1/2$. For nuclear environment devoid of spins strongly coupled to the
qubit, the phase shift is well described within Gaussian approximation, which
provides an explanation for the dependence of the shift magnitude on the choice
of states on which the qubit is based, and makes it clear that its presence is
related to the linear response of the environment perturbed by an evolving
qubit. Consequently, its observation signifies the presence
environment-mediated self-interaction of the qubit, and hence, it invalidates
the notion that the nuclear environment acts as a source of external noise

choose a taxonomic level a priori before performing the analysis, whereas by
combining SuRF with these aggregated variables, we are able to identify the key
biomarkers at the appropriate taxonomic level, as suggested by the data. We

integration of multimodal data, often at different biological scales, that can
be applied to a variety of evidence structures, such as complex disease
analyses and epidemiological models. However, current methods are either slow
and expensive, or ineffective due to the inability to model the complex
relationships between data modes which differ in scale and format. We address
these issues by proposing a cross-modal deep learning architecture and
co-attention mechanism to accurately model the relationships between the
different data modes, while further reducing patient diagnosis time.
Differentiating Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients from healthy patients forms
the basis of the evaluation. The model outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art unimodal analysis by 2.35%, while also being 53% more
parameter efficient than the industry standard cross-modal model. Furthermore,
the evaluation of the attention coefficients allows for qualitative insights to
be obtained. Through the coupling with bioinformatics, a novel link between the
interferon-gamma-mediated pathway, DNA methylation and PD was identified. We
believe that our approach is general and could optimise the process of medical
evidence synthesis and decision making in an actionable way.

and correlate these with current-voltage characteristics and in-situ

are randomly distributed within the oxide film, consistent with a field-induced

distinct modes of electroforming in the same materials system and show that the

the directional scalar spin chiral order (DSSCO), as an exception: it breaks
time-reversal symmetry via chiral ordering of spins along a particular
direction, but is spin-rotation symmetric. In this work, we prove the existence
of this state via state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
analysis on a spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic
interactions and additional third-neighbor ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange.
Despite the large entanglement introduced by the third-neighbor coupling, we
are able to access system sizes up to $L=918$ sites. We find first order phase
transitions from the DSSCO into the famous Haldane phase as well as a
spin-quadrupolar phase where spin nematic correlations dominate. In the Haldane
phase, we propose and demonstrate a method for detecting the topological edge
states using DMRG that could be useful for other topological phases too.

combining Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Distributed Ledger or

to a nanoparticle for the various scenarios commonly encountered in levitated
optomechanics. While previous articles have the same form and dependencies, the
proportionality constants often differ in the literature. This paper resolves
these discrepancies. The rate at which energy is delivered to an optically
trapped particle's respective degrees of freedom depends on the radiation
pattern of scattered light as well as the direction of laser propagation. For a
traveling plane wave with linearly polarized light, in the Rayleigh regime this
leads the translational shot noise heating rate to be proportional to $1/10$ of
the total rate in the laser polarization direction, $7/10$ in the laser
propagation direction, and $2/10$ in the direction perpendicular to both.
Analytical expressions for the shot noise heating rate are provided in the
Rayleigh limit as well as numerical calculations for particles in the Mie
regime for silica and diamond. For completeness, numerical calculations of the
shot noise heating for silica Mie particles at the focus of a strongly focused
laser beam are calculated for varying numerical aperture and common laser
wavelengths. Both numerical calculations show that the Rayleigh expression
generally gives an overestimate of the shot noise heating especially for larger
radii, but is still a good approximation even for incident focal fields. The
exception to the relative decrease is when a Mie resonance is reached which was
found for diamond. Lastly, Rayleigh expressions for the rotational shot noise
heating for a symmetric top-like particle for linear, elliptically, and
unpolarized light are also provided.

seeking a proper balance between model complexity and predictive power. In this
paper, we propose the weighted-median mechanism as a new micro-foundation of
opinion dynamics, which, with minimal assumptions, fundamentally resolves the
inherent unrealistic feature of the weighted-averaging mechanism. Derived from
the cognitive dissonance theory in psychology, the weighted-median mechanism is
supported by online experiment data and broadens the applicability of opinion
dynamics models to multiple-choice issues with ordered discrete options.
Moreover, the weighted-median mechanism, despite being the simplest in form,
captures various non-trivial real-world features of opinion evolution, while
some widely-studied averaging-based models fail to.

to play an important role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays
(CRs) close to supernova remnants. Despite its importance, the exact mechanism
responsible for the saturation of the instability has not been determined, and
there is no first-principle prediction for the amplitude of the saturated
magnetic field. Using a survey of self-consistent kinetic hybrid simulations
(with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the saturation of the
non-resonant streaming instability as a function of the parameters of both the
thermal background plasma and the CR population. The strength of the saturated
magnetic field has important implications for both CR acceleration in supernova
remnants and CR diffusion in the Galaxy.

controversial debates with large consequences, the public opinion is often
trapped in a fifty-fifty stalemate, jeopardizing broadly accepted political
decisions. Emergent effects from millions of private discussions make it hard
to understand or influence this kind of opinion dynamics. Here we demonstrate
that repulsion from opinions favors fifty-fifty stalemates. We study a voter
model where agents can have two opinions or an undecided state in-between. In
pairwise discussions, undecided agents can be convinced or repelled from the
opinion expressed by another agent. If repulsion happens in at least one of
four cases, as in controversial debates, the frequencies of both opinions
equalize. Further we include transitions of decided agents to the undecided
state. If that happens often, the share of undecided agents becomes large, as
can be measured with the share of undecided answers in polls.

visualizing high-dimensional data, based on multiple pairwise distances between
the data points. Specifically, MPSE computes positions for the points in 3D and
provides different views into the data by means of 2D projections (planes) that
preserve each of the given distance matrices. We consider two versions of the
problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed
projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the
data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in
3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE
with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices
and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections
that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in
multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on
the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D
snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a
functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic
generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple
variable projections. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with
datasets of different sizes and using different number of projections, as well

excitation of the forming planets and planetesimals. The ensuing orbital
crossing can lead to large-scale collisional fragmentation, populating the
system with icy and rocky debris. In a gaseous nebula, such leftover solid
matter tends to spiral down towards the host star due to aerodynamic drag.
Along the way, the inward drifting debris can encounter planets and
gravitationally couple to them via mean-motion resonances, sapping them of
their orbital energy and causing them to migrate. Here, we develop a simple
theory for this migration mechanism, which we call ""Aero-Resonant Migration""
(ARM), in which small planetesimals ($10\,$m $\lesssim s \lesssim 10\,$km)
undergo orbital decay due to aerodynamic drag and resonantly shepherd planets
ahead of them. Using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical
experiments, we show that ARM is a robust migration mechanism, able to
significantly transport planets on timescales $\lesssim1$ Myr, and present

curve, with mass accretion rates spanning the range from $\dot{M} = 0.01
L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$ to $10 L_\mathrm{Edd}/c^2$. An analysis of temporal
variations of the numerically simulated disk reveals multiple robust, coherent
oscillations. Considering the local mass flux variability, we find an
oscillation occurring at the maximum radial epicyclic frequency, $3.5\times
10^{-3}\,t_\mathrm{g}^{-1}$, a possible signature of a trapped fundamental
${\it g}$-mode. Although present in each of our simulated models, the trapped
${\it g}$-mode feature is most prominent in the gas-pressure-dominated case.
The total pressure fluctuations in the disk suggest strong evidence for
standing-wave ${\it p}$-modes, some trapped in the inner disk close to the
ISCO, others present in the middle/outer parts of the disk. Knowing that the
trapped ${\it g}$-mode frequency and maximum radial epicyclic frequency differ
by only $0.01\%$ in the case of a non-rotating black hole, we simulated an
additional initially gas-pressure-dominated disk with a dimensionless black
hole spin parameter $a_* = 0.5$. The oscillation frequency in the spinning
black hole case confirms that this oscillation is indeed a trapped ${\it
g}$-mode. All the numerical models we report here also show a set of high
frequency oscillations at the vertical epicyclic and breathing mode
frequencies. The vertical oscillations show a 3:2 frequency ratio with
oscillations occurring approximately at the radial epicyclic frequency, which
could be of astrophysical importance in observed twin peak, high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations.

for a re-thinking of wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless
transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF
spectrum, radiation, and infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating
and energizing. This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards
such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical
energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed
using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data.
Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for
Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a
point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the
receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The
results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband
transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling.
Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT
modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the
performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the
ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning
modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design
for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is
to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms,
which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via
learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed,
which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly
superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design

these concerns for state-of-the-art flight control by investigating the use of
deep neural networks to bring essential elements of higher-level cognition for
constructing low level flight controllers.
  This thesis reports on the development and release of an open source, full
solution stack for building neuro-flight controllers. This stack consists of
the methodology for constructing a multicopter digital twin for synthesize the
flight controller unique to a specific aircraft, a tuning framework for
implementing training environments (GymFC), and a firmware for the world's
first neural network supported flight controller (Neuroflight). GymFC's novel
approach fuses together the digital twinning paradigm for flight control
training to provide seamless transfer to hardware. Additionally, this thesis
examines alternative reward system functions as well as changes to the software

is the PUF integration into our previously proposed Proof-of-Authentication
(PoAh) consensus algorithm and can be called ""Hardware-Assisted

existing and new consensus algorithms. PoP utilizes PUFs which are responsible
for generating a unique key that cannot be cloned and hence provide the highest
level of security. A PUF uses the nanoelectronic manufacturing variations that
are introduced during the fabrication of an integrated circuit to generate the
keys. Hence, once generated from a PUF module, the keys cannot be cloned or
generated from any other module. PUFchain uses a PUF and Hashing module which
performs the necessary cryptographic functions. Hence the mining process is
offloaded to the hardware module which reduces the processing times. PoP is
approximately 1,000X faster than the well-established Proof-of-Work (PoW) and
5X faster than Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh).

the skeletons. CIASA achieves this feat by satisfying multiple physical
constraints, and employing spatial skeleton realignments for the perturbed
skeletons along with regularization of the adversarial skeletons with
Generative networks. We also explore the possibility of semantically
imperceptible localized attacks with CIASA, and succeed in fooling the
state-of-the-art skeleton action recognition models with high confidence. CIASA
perturbations show high transferability for black-box attacks. We also show
that the perturbed skeleton sequences are able to induce adversarial behavior

with NTU and Kinetics datasets ascertains the effectiveness of CIASA for
graph-based skeleton action recognition and reveals the imminent threat to the
spatio-temporal deep learning tasks in general.

  Iteration","53 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To date, social network analysis has been largely focused on pairwise
interactions. The study of higher-order interactions, via a hypergraph network,
brings in new insights. We study community detection in a hypergraph network. A
popular approach is to project the hypergraph to a graph and then apply
community detection methods for graph networks, but we show that this approach
may cause unwanted information loss. We propose a new method for community
detection that operates directly on the hypergraph. At the heart of our method
is a regularized higher-order orthogonal iteration (reg-HOOI) algorithm that
computes an approximate low-rank decomposition of the network adjacency tensor.
Compared with existing tensor decomposition methods such as HOSVD and vanilla
HOOI, reg-HOOI yields better performance, especially when the hypergraph is
sparse. Given the output of tensor decomposition, we then generalize the
community detection method SCORE (Jin, 2015) from graph networks to hypergraph
networks. We call our new method Tensor-SCORE.
  In theory, we introduce a degree-corrected block model for hypergraphs
(hDCBM), and show that Tensor-SCORE yields consistent community detection for a
wide range of network sparsity and degree heterogeneity. As a byproduct, we
derive the rates of convergence on estimating the principal subspace by
reg-HOOI, with different initializations, including the two new initialization
methods we propose, a diagonal-removed HOSVD and a randomized graph projection.
  We apply our method to several real hypergraph networks which yields
encouraging results. It suggests that exploring higher-order interactions
provides additional information not seen in graph representations.

is not necessarily the likelihood. I use an accuracy argument to argue for
probabilism and I develop a new kind of argument to argue for two general
updating rules, both of which are reasonable in different contexts. One of the
updating rules has standard Bayesian updating, Bissiri et al's (2016) general
Bayesian updating, Douven's (2016) IBE-based updating, and Vassend's (2019a)
quasi-Bayesian updating as special cases. The other updating rule is novel.

conduct transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. Inspired by Bitcoin, other
cryptocurrencies were invented in recent years such as Ethereum, Dash, Zcash,
Monero, Grin, etc. Some of these focus on enhancing privacy for instance crypto
note or systems that apply the similar concept of encrypted notes used for
transactions to enhance privacy (e.g., Zcash, Monero). However, there are few
mechanisms to support the exchange of privacy-enhanced notes or assets on the
chain, and at the same time preserving the privacy of the exchange operations.
Existing approaches for fair exchanges of assets with privacy mostly rely on
off-chain/side-chain, escrow or centralized services. Thus, we propose a
solution that supports oblivious and privacy-protected fair exchange of crypto
notes or privacy enhanced crypto assets. The technology is demonstrated by
extending zero-knowledge based crypto notes. To address ""privacy"" and
""multi-currency"", we build a new zero-knowledge proving system and extend note
format with new property to represent various types of tokenized assets or
cryptocurrencies. By extending the payment protocol, exchange operations are
realized through privacy enhanced transactions (e.g., shielded transactions).
Based on the possible scenarios during the exchange operation, we add new
constraints and conditions to the zero-knowledge proving system used for
validating transactions publicly.

passing algorithm that has been used to provide optimal solutions of
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) -- a framework that is
designed to optimize constraints in cooperative multi-agent systems. The
traditional DCOP formulation does not consider those constraints that must be
satisfied (also known as hard constraints), rather it concentrates only on soft
constraints. However, the presence of both types of constraints are observed in
a number of applications, such as Distributed Radio Link Frequency Assignment
and Distributed Event Scheduling, etc. Although the combination of these types
of constraints is recently incorporated in DPOP to solve DCOPs, scalability
remains an issue for them as finding an optimal solution is NP-hard.
Additionally, in DPOP, the agents are arranged as a DFS pseudo-tree. Recently
it has been observed that the constructed pseudo-trees in this way often come
to be chain-like and greatly impair the algorithm's performance. To address
these issues, we develop an algorithm that speeds up the DPOP algorithm by
reducing the size of the messages exchanged and increasing parallelism in the

aspect is largely recognized by the community, we argue that it is often

largely due to the increase in model complexity, often including stochastic
dynamics, that is necessary to describe and characterize phenomena observed
using modern, high resolution, experimental techniques. Such models are rarely
analytically tractable, meaning that extremely large numbers of stochastic
simulations are required for parameter inference. In such cases, parameter
inference can be practically impossible. In this work, we present new
computational Bayesian techniques that accelerate inference for expensive
stochastic models by using computationally inexpensive approximations to inform
feasible regions in parameter space, and through learning transforms that
adjust the biased approximate inferences to closer represent the correct
inferences under the expensive stochastic model. Using topical examples from
ecology and cell biology, we demonstrate a speed improvement of an order of

Conventional GPCs however suffer from (i) poor scalability for big data due to

likelihoods. Hence, various scalable GPCs have been proposed through (i) the
sparse approximation built upon a small inducing set to reduce the time
complexity; and (ii) the approximate inference to derive analytical evidence
lower bound (ELBO). However, these scalable GPCs equipped with analytical ELBO
are limited to specific likelihoods or additional assumptions. In this work, we
present a unifying framework which accommodates scalable GPCs using various
likelihoods. Analogous to GP regression (GPR), we introduce additive noises to
augment the probability space for (i) the GPCs with step, (multinomial) probit
and logit likelihoods via the internal variables; and particularly, (ii) the
GPC using softmax likelihood via the noise variables themselves. This leads to
unified scalable GPCs with analytical ELBO by using variational inference.
Empirically, our GPCs showcase better results than state-of-the-art scalable

droplet (diameter ~100-300 micro-m) levitated in an electrodynamic (ED) balance
is reported. During the breakup process, a levitated charged droplet undergoes
evaporation leading to a reduction in droplet size and increase in the
corresponding surface charge density. As the surface charge density reaches to
a critical value, known as the Rayleigh limit, the droplet undergoes breakup by
forming a jet which further ejects highly charged progeny droplets. All the
successive events of the droplet breakup process such as drop deformation,
breakup, and relaxation of the drop back to spherical shape after ejection of
progeny droplets have been recorded using the high-speed camera at 1.3 hundred
thousand frames per second. The droplet is observed to eject 3-5 progeny
droplets from a jet indicating end pinching mode of breakup. The jet is then
observed to relax back after ejecting 31% of the total charge and ~3\% of the
total mass. A suitable theory is provided to supplement the experimental
observations, and a reasonable agreement is observed. Additionally, the theory
is extended for the prediction of total mass loss and the entire lifetime of a

functional theory, the ground state configurations single layers, bilayers, and
bulk systems was determined. This work finds that carbophenes have formation
energies per carbon atom similar to that of graphenylene. The similarity of
formation energies between graphenylene and carbophene suggests that when
trying to synthesize one, the other may also be synthesized. The formation
energies could explain why the first reported synthesis of graphenylene also
indicated that they may have synthesized 3-carbophene. Results contained in

remaining neutrino issues to be determined are the absolute neutrino mass (or
the smallest neutrino mass in the three-flavor scheme) and the nature of
neutrino masses, either of Dirac type or of Majorana type. Use of Raman
scattered photon was recently proposed as a promising tool for this purpose. In

result of data from CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS and have been widely used to study
stellar activity. They provide information integrated over the stellar disk,
hence many degeneracies between spots and plages or sizes and contrasts. Our
aim is to understand how to relate photometric variability to physical
parameters in order to help the interpretation of these observations. We
computed a large number of synthetic time series of brightness variations for
old MS stars within the F6-K4 range, using consistent modeling for radial
velocity, astrometry, and LogR'HK. We analyzed these time series to study the
effect of the star spectral type on brightness variability, the relationship
between brightness variability and LogR'HK, the interpretation of brightness
variability as a function of spot and plage properties, and the spot-dominated
or plage-dominated regimes. Within our range of activity levels, the brightness
variability increases toward low-mass stars, as suggested by Kepler results.
Brightness variability roughly correlates to LogR'HK level, but with a large
dispersion, caused by spot contrast and inclination. It is also directly
related to the number of structures, and we show that it cannot be interpreted
solely in terms of spot sizes. In the activity range of old main-sequence
stars, we can obtain both spot or plage dominated regimes, as in observation.
The same star can be observed in both regimes depending on inclination. Only
strong correlations between LogR'HK and brightness variability are significant.
Our realistic time series proves to be extremely useful when interpreting
observations and understanding their limitations, most notably in terms of
activity interpretation. Inclination is crucial and affects many properties,
such as amplitudes and the respective role of spots and plages.

results in color image processing problems. In this paper, we propose a novel
low-rank quaternion matrix completion algorithm to recover missing data of
color image. Motivated by two kinds of low-rank approximation approaches
(low-rank decomposition and nuclear norm minimization) in traditional
matrix-based methods, we combine the two approaches in our quaternion
matrix-based model. Furthermore, the nuclear norm of the quaternion matrix is
replaced by the sum of Frobenius norm of its two low-rank factor quaternion
matrices. Based on the relationship between quaternion matrix and its
equivalent complex matrix, the problem eventually is converted from quaternion
number field to complex number field. An alternating minimization method is
applied to solve the model. Simulation results on real world color image
recovery show the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm
over some state-of-the-art tensor-based ones.

When the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance

SR when the downscaling kernel (""SR-kernel"") is unknown. It was further shown
that the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches

recently. Consistency results of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol are often
expressed in a quantity $c$, which denotes the expected number of network
delays before some block is mined. With $\mu$ (resp., $\nu$) denoting the
fraction of computational power controlled by benign miners (resp., the
adversary), where $\mu + \nu = 1$, we prove for the first time that to ensure
the consistency property of Nakamoto's blockchain protocol in an asynchronous
network, it suffices to have $c$ to be just slightly greater than
$\frac{2\mu}{\ln (\mu/\nu)}$. Such a result is both neater and stronger than
existing ones. In the proof, we formulate novel Markov chains which
characterize the numbers of mined blocks in different rounds.

applications has motivated research on formal verification of Neural Network
(NN) models. In this context, verification involves proving or disproving that
an NN model satisfies certain input-output properties. Despite the reputation
of learned NN models as black boxes, and the theoretical hardness of proving
useful properties about them, researchers have been successful in verifying
some classes of models by exploiting their piecewise linear structure and
taking insights from formal methods such as Satisifiability Modulo Theory.
However, these methods are still far from scaling to realistic neural networks.
To facilitate progress on this crucial area, we exploit the Mixed Integer
Linear Programming (MIP) formulation of verification to propose a family of
algorithms based on Branch-and-Bound (BaB). We show that our family contains
previous verification methods as special cases. With the help of the BaB
framework, we make three key contributions. Firstly, we identify new methods
that combine the strengths of multiple existing approaches, accomplishing
significant performance improvements over previous state of the art. Secondly,
we introduce an effective branching strategy on ReLU non-linearities. This
branching strategy allows us to efficiently and successfully deal with high
input dimensional problems with convolutional network architecture, on which
previous methods fail frequently. Finally, we propose comprehensive test data
sets and benchmarks which includes a collection of previously released
testcases. We use the data sets to conduct a thorough experimental comparison
of existing and new algorithms and to provide an inclusive analysis of the
factors impacting the hardness of verification problems.

compactness of Sem-LS facilitates its use in large-scale applications, such as

different appearance from existing learning-based image representations such as

well-known datasets, KITTI and KAIST URBAN, as new benchmarks. Then, we propose
a learning-based Sem-LS detector (Sem-LSD) and devise new module as well as

have shown both the efficacy and efficiency of Sem-LSD. Finally, the

equation of state parameters. A problem arises when we compute the central
charge because the canonical conserved charge is needed to be calculated from
the Lagrangian. However, the exact Lagrangian of the quintessence is not
defined yet in the original derivation. Yet we solve this problem by the
assumption that there is only a contribution from gravitational field to the
central charge. Then we could find the entropy of this black hole after
calculating the temperature and using Cardy entropy formula. Another problem
comes out when the spin goes to zero to find the

solving a set of Helmholtz equations with wavenumbers dictated by the physical

method, the system of differential equations can be expressed in boundary

cycle at the Sun's equator and the start of a sunspot cycle at mid latitudes.
Observations indicate that the time difference between these events is very
short, less than a solar rotation, in the context of the sunspot cycle. As the

batteryless sensing and computing devices. Such devices operate only
intermittently, as energy is available, presenting a number of challenges for
software developers. Programmers face a complex design space requiring
reasoning about energy, memory consistency, and forward progress. This paper
introduces Alpaca, a low-overhead programming model for intermittent computing
on energy-harvesting devices. Alpaca programs are composed of a sequence of
user-defined tasks. The Alpaca runtime preserves execution progress at the
granularity of a task. The key insight in Alpaca is the privatization of data
shared between tasks. Updates of shared values in a task are privatized and
only committed to main memory on successful execution of the task, ensuring
that data remain consistent despite power failures. Alpaca provides a familiar
programming interface and a highly efficient runtime model. We also present an
alternate version of Alpaca, Alpaca-undo, that uses undo-logging and rollback
instead of privatization and commit. We implemented a prototype of both
versions of Alpaca as an extension to C with an LLVM compiler pass. We
evaluated Alpaca, and directly compared to three systems from prior work.
Alpacaconsistently improves performance compared to the previous systems, by up
to 23.8x, while also improving memory footprint in many cases, by up to 17.6x.

patient care (and data) is split along multitude of different facilities and
computer systems and enabling interoperability between these systems is hard.
The lack interoperability not only hinders continuity of care and burdens
providers, but also hinders effective application of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms. Thus, most current ML algorithms, designed to understand patient
care and facilitate clinical decision-support, are trained on limited datasets.
This approach is analogous to the Newtonian paradigm of Reductionism in which a
system is broken down into elementary components and a description of the whole
is formed by understanding those components individually. A key limitation of
the reductionist approach is that it ignores the component-component
interactions and dynamics within the system which are often of prime
significance in understanding the overall behaviour of complex adaptive systems
(CAS). Healthcare is a CAS.
  Though the application of ML on health data have shown incremental
improvements for clinical decision support, ML has a much a broader potential
to restructure care delivery as a whole and maximize care value. However, this
ML potential remains largely untapped: primarily due to functional limitations
of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and the inability to see the healthcare
system as a whole. This viewpoint (i) articulates the healthcare as a complex
system which has a biological and an organizational perspective, (ii) motivates
with examples, the need of a system's approach when addressing healthcare
challenges via ML and, (iii) emphasizes to unleash EHR functionality - while
duly respecting all ethical and legal concerns - to reap full benefits of ML.

leverage multiple deep neural network (DNN) models for sub-tasks such as object

the layers within and across the DNN models are highly heterogeneous in
operation and shape. Such layer heterogeneity is a challenge for a fixed
dataflow accelerator (FDA) that employs a fixed dataflow on a single
accelerator substrate since each layer prefers different dataflows (computation
order and parallelization) and tile sizes. Reconfigurable DNN accelerators
(RDAs) have been proposed to adapt their dataflows to diverse layers to address
the challenge. However, the dataflow flexibility in RDAs is enabled at the area
and energy costs of expensive hardware structures (switches, controller, etc.)
and per-layer reconfiguration.
  Alternatively, this work proposes a new class of accelerators, heterogeneous
dataflow accelerators (HDAs), which deploys multiple sub-accelerators each
supporting a different dataflow. HDAs enable coarser-grained dataflow
flexibility than RDAs with higher energy efficiency and lower area cost
comparable to FDAs. To exploit such benefits, hardware resource partitioning
across sub-accelerators and layer execution schedule need to be carefully
optimized. Therefore, we also present Herald, which co-optimizes hardware
partitioning and layer execution schedule. Using Herald on a suite of AR/VR and
MLPerf workloads, we identify a promising HDA architecture, Maelstrom, which
demonstrates 65.3% lower latency and 5.0% lower energy than the best FDAs and
22.0% lower energy at the cost of 20.7% higher latency than a state-of-the-art
RDA. The results suggest that HDA is an alternative class of Pareto-optimal
accelerators to RDA with strength in energy, which can be a better choice than
RDAs depending on the use cases.

set of subjectively distorted distributions instead of a fixed one. Such
assumption provides the additional flexibility to model human's risk
preferences, represented by a risk envelope, in safe-critical tasks. However,
like other learning from demonstration techniques, RS-IRL could also suffer
inefficient learning due to redundant demonstrations. Inspired by the concept
of active learning, this research derives a probabilistic disturbance sampling
scheme to enable an RS-IRL agent to query expert support that is likely to
expose unrevealed boundaries of the expert's risk envelope. Experimental
results confirm that our approach accelerates the convergence of RS-IRL
algorithms with lower variance while still guaranteeing unbiased convergence.

  Cauchy problem of the scalar conservation law with nonlinear viscosity","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1804.10841",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the global structure of solutions to the Cauchy
problem for the scalar viscous conservation law where the far field states are
prescribed. Especially, we deal with the case when the viscous/diffusive flux
$\sigma(v) \sim |\, v \,|^p$ is of non-Newtonian type (i.e., $p>0$), including
a pseudo-plastic case (i.e., $p<0$). When the corresponding Riemann problem for
the hyperbolic part admits a Riemann solution which consists of single
rarefaction wave, under a condition on nonlinearity of the viscosity, it has
been recently proved by Matsumura-Yoshida \cite{matsumura-yoshida'} that the
solution of the Cauchy problem tends toward the rarefaction wave as time goes
to infinity for the case $p>3/7$ without any smallness conditions. The new
ingredients we obtained are the extension to the stability results in
\cite{matsumura-yoshida'} to the case $p > 1/3$ (also without any smallness
conditions), and furthermore their precise time-decay estimates.

  We compare our EEG based speech enhancement results with traditional log
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) speech enhancement algorithm and our proposed
methods demonstrate significant improvement in speech enhancement quality
compared to the traditional method. Our overall results demonstrate that EEG

To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a spoken speech enhancement
is demonstrated using EEG features recorded in parallel with spoken speech.

new device, the superconducting differential double contour interferometer
(DDCI). The flux qubit and the superconducting quantum interference device
(DC-SQUID) are connected in the DDCI through the phase of the wave function
rather than through magnetic flux. The critical current of DC-SQUID should
change to the maximum value at the change of the flux qubit state thanks to
this phase coupling. A large jump in the critical current and voltage enables
to observe continuously the change in time the state of the flux qubit. This
observation can have fundamental importance for the investigation of the
superposition of macroscopic quantum states.

around neural modules, conceptual blocks of neural networks that take typed
inputs and produce typed outputs. Such modules typically represent data layers,
encoders, decoders, language models, loss functions, or methods of combining
activations. NeMo makes it easy to combine and re-use these building blocks
while providing a level of semantic correctness checking via its neural type
system. The toolkit comes with extendable collections of pre-built modules for
automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. Furthermore, NeMo
provides built-in support for distributed training and mixed precision on

while crossing intersections and propose a solution that takes form as a mobile
application. The application utilizes a deep learning convolutional neural
network model, LytNetV2, to output necessary information that the visually
impaired may lack when without human companions or guide-dogs. A prototype of
the application runs on iOS devices of versions 11 or above. It is designed for
comprehensiveness, concision, accuracy, and computational efficiency through
delivering the two most important pieces of information, pedestrian traffic
light color and direction, required to cross the road in real-time.
Furthermore, it is specifically aimed to support those facing financial burden
as the solution takes the form of a free mobile application. Through the
modification and utilization of key principles in MobileNetV3 such as depthwise
seperable convolutions and squeeze-excite layers, the deep neural network model
achieves a classification accuracy of 96% and average angle error of 6.15
degrees, while running at a frame rate of 16.34 frames per second.
Additionally, the model is trained as an image classifier, allowing for a
faster and more accurate model. The network is able to outperform other methods
such as object detection and non-deep learning algorithms in both accuracy and
thoroughness. The information is delivered through both auditory signals and
vibrations, and it has been tested on seven visually impaired and has received
above satisfactory responses.
