properties of goodness-of-fit, homogeneity and independence tests using
Gaussian kernels, arguably the most popular and successful among such tests.
Our results provide theoretical justifications for this common practice by
showing that tests using Gaussian kernel with an appropriately chosen scaling
parameter are minimax optimal against smooth alternatives in all three

diverging scaling parameter when using Gaussian kernels and suggests a
data-driven choice of the scaling parameter that yields tests optimal, up to an
iterated logarithmic factor, over a wide range of smooth alternatives.

investigated in a variety of chemical, physical, and biological systems. In the
standard approach in physical and chemical systems, the key properties that
make these systems mathematically tractable are that the noise appears linearly
in the dynamical equations, and it is assumed Gaussian and white. In biology,
the Gaussian approximation has been successful in specific systems, but the
relevant noise being usually non-Gaussian, non-white, and nonlinear poses
serious limitations to its general applicability. Here we revisit the
fundamental features of linear Gaussian noise, pinpoint its limitations, and
review recent new approaches based on nonlinear bounded noises, which highlight
novel mechanisms to account for transitions to bimodal behaviour. We do this by
considering a simple but fundamental gene expression model, the repressed gene,
which is characterized by linear and nonlinear dependencies on external
parameters. We then review a general methodology introduced recently, so-called
nonlinear noise filtering, which allows the investigation of linear, nonlinear,
Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. We also present a derivation of it, which
highlights its dynamical origin. Testing the methodology on the repressed gene
confirms that the emergence of noise-induced transitions appears to be strongly
dependent on the type of noise adopted, and on the degree of nonlinearity

accurately aligned to establish a reliable communication link in
millimeter-wave (mmwave) systems. Existing BA methods search the entire beam
space to identify the optimal transmit-receive beam pair, which incurs
significant BA latency on the order of seconds in the worst case. In this
paper, we develop a learning algorithm to reduce BA latency, namely
Hierarchical Beam Alignment (HBA) algorithm. We first formulate the BA problem
as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with the objective to maximize the
cumulative received signal strength within a certain period. The proposed
algorithm takes advantage of the correlation structure among beams such that
the information from nearby beams is extracted to identify the optimal beam,
instead of searching the entire beam space. Furthermore, the prior knowledge on
the channel fluctuation is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to further
accelerate the BA process. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed
algorithm is asymptotically optimal. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can identify the optimal beam with a high
probability and reduce the BA latency from hundreds of milliseconds to a few

Finding these equilibrium concepts in zero-sum games can be efficiently done

was explored using a rate-dependent dislocation-based crystal plasticity model.
Three different types of grain boundaries (GBs) were included in the model by
modifying the rate of dislocation accumulation near the GB in the Kocks-Mecking
law, leading to fully-opaque (dislocation blocking), fully-transparent and
partially-transparent GBs. In the latter, slip transmission is only allowed in
pairs of SS in neighbour grains that are suitably oriented for slip transfer
according to the Luster-Morris parameter. Modifications of the GB character led
to important changes in the deformation mechanisms at the GB. In general,
bicrystals with fully-opaque boundaries showed an increase in the dislocation
density near the GB, which was associated with an increase in the Von Mises
stress. In contrast, the dislocation pile-ups and the stress concentration were
less pronounced in the case of partially-transparent boundaries as the slip in
one grain can progress into the next grain with some degree of continuity. No
stress concentrations were found at these boundaries for fully-transparent
boundaries, and there was continuity of strain across the boundary, which is
not typical of most experimentally observed GBs. Simulations of ideal
bicrystals oriented for favorable slip transfer on the most highly favored slip
system in grains with high Schmid factors for slip transfer depends on the
number of active SS in operation in the neighborhood and that most boundaries
will lead to nearly opaque conditions while some boundaries will be
transparent. Finally, the model was applied to a particular experimentally
observed GB in which slip transfer was clearly operating indicating that the
model predicted a nearly transparent GB.

limiting to continuous high-order Bernstein finite element discretizations of
scalar hyperbolic problems. Using an array of adjustable diffusive fluxes, the
standard Galerkin approximation is transformed into a nonlinear high-resolution
scheme which has the compact sparsity pattern of the piecewise-linear or
multilinear subcell discretization. The representation of this scheme in terms
of invariant domain preserving states makes it possible to prove the validity
of local discrete maximum principles under CFL-like conditions. In contrast to
predictor-corrector approaches based on the flux-corrected transport
methodology, the proposed flux limiting strategy is monolithic; i.e., limited
antidiffusive terms are incorporated into the well-defined residual of a
nonlinear (semi-)discrete problem. A stabilized high-order Galerkin
discretization is recovered if no limiting is performed. In the limited
version, the compact stencil property prevents direct mass exchange between
nodes that are not nearest neighbors. A formal proof of sparsity is provided
for simplicial and box elements. The involved element contributions can be
calculated efficiently making use of matrix-free algorithms and precomputed
element matrices of the reference element. Numerical studies for $\mathbb{Q}_2$
discretizations of linear and nonlinear two-dimensional test problems

relevant optimization problem whose aim is to find a k-rooted minimum cost
forest that connects given customers to a number of supply vertices, in such a
way that a minimum required reliability on each path between a customer and a
supply vertex is satisfied and the cost is a minimum. The reliability of an
edge is the probability that no failure occurs on that edge, whereas the
reliability of a path is the product of the reliabilities of the edges in such

(DNNs), have shown significant promise in several areas. However, researchers
have recently demonstrated that ML algorithms, especially DNNs, are vulnerable
to adversarial examples (slightly perturbed samples that cause
misclassification). The existence of adversarial examples has hindered the
deployment of ML algorithms in safety-critical sectors, such as security.
Several defenses for adversarial examples exist in the literature. One of the
important classes of defenses are manifold-based defenses, where a sample is
``pulled back"" into the data manifold before classifying. These defenses rely
on the assumption that data lie in a manifold of a lower dimension than the
input space. These defenses use a generative model to approximate the input
distribution. In this paper, we investigate the following question: do the
generative models used in manifold-based defenses need to be topology-aware? We
suggest the answer is yes, and we provide theoretical and empirical evidence to
support our claim.

however can unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness.
Representing text at the level of bytes and using the 256 byte set as

however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. In this
paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE),

contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a
convolutional or recurrent layer. Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable
performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE. In the
multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages

analytical results for a number of pseudo-Boolean functions for unlimited

potential, the so-called Yukawa One Component Plasma (YOCP) is a good
approximation for a variety of physical systems. Such systems are completely
characterized by two parameters; the screening parameter, $\kappa$, and the
nominal coupling strength, $\Gamma$. It is well known that the collective
spectrum of the YOCP is governed by a longitudinal acoustic mode, both in the
weakly and strongly coupled regimes. In the long-wavelength limit the linear
term in the dispersion (\textit{i.e.} $\omega = s k$) defines the sound speed
$s$. We study the evolution of this latter quantity from the weak through the
strong coupling regimes by analyzing the Dynamic Structure Function
$S(k,\omega)$ in the low frequency domain. Depending on the values of $\Gamma$
and $\kappa$ and $w = s/v_{\textrm{th}}$, (\textit{i.e.} the ratio between the
phase velocity of the wave and thermal speed of the particles) we identify five
domains in the $(\kappa,\Gamma)$ parameter space in which the physical behavior
of the YOCP exhibits different features. The competing physical processes are
the collective Coulomb like vs. binary collision dominated behavior and the
individual particle motion vs. quasi-localization. Our principal tool of
investigation is Molecular Dynamics (MD) computer simulation from which we
obtain $S(k,\omega)$. Recent improvements in the simulation technique have
allowed us to obtain a large body of high quality data in the range $\Gamma =
\{0.1 - 10,000\}$ and $\kappa = \{0.5 -5\}$. The theoretical results based on
various models are compared in order to see which one provides the most cogent

several challenges. Cancer grading and localization of regions of interest
(ROIs) in these images normally relies on both image- and pixel-level labels,
the latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised object
localization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training
of deep learning models. Using only image-class annotations, these methods can
be trained to classify an image, and yield class activation maps (CAMs) for ROI
localization. This paper provides a review of state-of-art DL methods for WSOL.
We propose a taxonomy where these methods are divided into bottom-up and
top-down methods according to the information flow in models. Although the
latter have seen limited progress, recent bottom-up methods are currently
driving much progress with deep WSOL methods. Early works focused on designing
different spatial pooling functions. However, these methods reached limited
localization accuracy, and unveiled a major limitation -- the under-activation
of CAMs which leads to high false negative localization. Subsequent works aimed
to alleviate this issue and recover complete object. Representative methods
from our taxonomy are evaluated and compared in terms of classification and
localization accuracy on two challenging histology datasets. Overall, the
results indicate poor localization performance, particularly for generic
methods that were initially designed to process natural images. Methods
designed to address the challenges of histology data yielded good results.
However, all methods suffer from high false positive/negative localization.
Four key challenges are identified for the application of deep WSOL methods in
histology -- under/over activation of CAMs, sensitivity to thresholding, and
model selection.

applications owing to (i) establishing the solution method from the viewpoint
of computationally efficient explicit dynamics, (ii) proposing an element-level
thermal load computation to eliminate the need for assembling global thermal
stiffness, leading to (iii) an explicit formulation of nodal temperature
computation to eliminate the need for iterations anywhere in the algorithm,
(iv) pre-computing the constant matrices and simulation parameters to
facilitate online calculation, and (v) utilising computationally efficient
finite elements to efficiently obtain thermal responses in the spatial domain,
all of which lead to a significant reduction in computation time for fast
run-time simulation. The proposed fast explicit dynamics finite element
algorithm (FED-FEM) employs nonlinear thermal material properties, such as
temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, and
nonlinear thermal boundary conditions, such as heat convection and radiation,
to account for nonlinear characteristics of transient heat transfer.
Simulations and comparison analyses demonstrate that not only can the proposed
methodology handle isotropic, orthotropic, anisotropic and
temperature-dependent thermal properties but also satisfy the standard patch
tests and achieve good agreement with those of the commercial finite element
analysis packages for numerical accuracy, for 3-D heat conduction, convection,
radiation, and thermal gradient concentration problems. Furthermore, the
proposed FED-FEM algorithm is computationally efficient and only consumes a
small computation time, capable of achieving real-time computational
performance, leading to a novel methodology suitable for real-time simulation

tasks, such as identifying relations among objects or predicting objects for a

services, relief efforts, and evacuation activities. Thus, a timely and
reliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is critical for
decision-makers to quickly and effectively perform relief and recovery efforts.
Recently, social media has increasingly been used in disaster management for
obtaining a rapid, public-centric assessment of disaster impacts due to its
near real-time, social and informational characteristics. Although promising,
the employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is
still limited due to the inability of extracting accurate highway-related data
from social media. To overcome this limitation, a systematic approach is
proposed to identify highway-related data from social media for assessing
disaster impacts on highways, and a case study of Hurricane Harvey in Houston,
TX is employed for the demonstration. The approach is constructed through three
steps: (1) building data sources for social media and highways of interest in
Houston, respectively; (2) adapting the social media data to each highway
through a developed mapping algorithm; (3) assessing disaster impacts through
analyzing social media activities in terms of their intensity, geographic, and
topic distributions. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of
capturing the temporal patterns of disaster impacts on highways. Official news
and reports are employed to validate the assessed impacts.

in the range 5 - 60 K, while the ice is exposed to the interstellar radiation
field, inducing a photochemistry in the outer ice layers that produces
significant formation of complex organic molecules. A treatment for the

parts-of-speech) from representations (like ELMo), have achieved high accuracy
on a range of linguistic tasks. But does this mean that the representations
encode linguistic structure or just that the probe has learned the linguistic
task? In this paper, we propose control tasks, which associate word types with
random outputs, to complement linguistic tasks. By construction, these tasks
can only be learned by the probe itself. So a good probe, (one that reflects
the representation), should be selective, achieving high linguistic task
accuracy and low control task accuracy. The selectivity of a probe puts
linguistic task accuracy in context with the probe's capacity to memorize from
word types. We construct control tasks for English part-of-speech tagging and
dependency edge prediction, and show that popular probes on ELMo
representations are not selective. We also find that dropout, commonly used to
control probe complexity, is ineffective for improving selectivity of MLPs, but
that other forms of regularization are effective. Finally, we find that while
probes on the first layer of ELMo yield slightly better part-of-speech tagging
accuracy than the second, probes on the second layer are substantially more
selective, which raises the question of which layer better represents
parts-of-speech.

interacting active Brownian particles with a spherical shape in two spatial
dimensions. The theory is derived by a rigorous coarse-graining starting from
the Langevin equations that describe the trajectories of the individual
particles. For maximal accuracy and generality of the theory, it includes
configurational order parameters and derivatives up to infinite order. In
addition, we discuss possible approximations of the theory and present reduced
models that are easier to apply. We show that our theory contains popular
models such as Active Model B + as special cases and that it provides explicit
expressions for the coefficients occurring in these and other, often
phenomenological, models. As a further outcome, the theory yields an analytical
expression for the density-dependent mean swimming speed of the particles. To
demonstrate an application of the new theory, we analyze a simple reduced model
of the lowest nontrivial order in derivatives, which is able to predict the
onset of motility-induced phase separation of the particles. By a linear
stability analysis, an analytical expression for the spinodal corresponding to
motility-induced phase separation is obtained. This expression is evaluated for
the case of particles interacting repulsively by a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson
potential. The analytical predictions for the spinodal associated with these
particles are found to be in very good agreement with the results of Brownian
dynamics simulations that are based on the same Langevin equations as our
theory. Furthermore, the critical point predicted by our analytical results
agrees excellently with recent computational results from the literature.

capabilities and industrial know-how are key determinants of growth and

sometimes referred to as industry spaces, describe the complex structure of the
capability or skill overlap between industry pairs, measured here via
inter-industry labour flows. Existing models typically deploy a local or
'nearest neighbour' approach to capture the size of the labour pool available

recovering gradient-sparse signals from compressed measurements. Recent studies

with high probability when the number of measurements exceeds a certain
threshold; otherwise, it fails almost certainly. Obtaining a closed-form
expression that approximates this threshold is a major challenge in this field

lower-bound on this threshold in case of any random measurement matrix whose
null space is distributed uniformly with respect to the Haar measure. In
contrast to the conventional TV phase transition results that depend on the

that is isostructural with ice Ic. Surprisingly, the stacking-disorder free ice
Ic is formed from C$_2$ via an intermediate amorphous or nano-crystalline form

of recently discovered ice XVI from neon hydrate, or ice XVII from hydrogen

transition to ice Ih at 250 K; this thermal stability originates from the lack
of dislocations, which promote changes in the stacking sequence. This discovery
of ideal ice Ic will promote understanding of the role of stacking-disorder on
the physical properties of ice as a counter end-member of ice Ih.

many natural language understanding tasks, e.g., natural language inference and

comes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which
learns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great
significance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the
effectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to
distinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we
propose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which
includes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of
PSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the
sentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This
simple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To
further incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is
expanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but
nonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing
technique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the
performance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS

the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction in these lattice
structures, the magnetic ground states of both 0D and 1D-TKL in the presence of
two magnetic adatoms are evaluated. It is found that the 1D channels of TKL
show different electronic and magnetic behaviors due to different values of the
hopping integrals and spin-orbit couplings. Two important salient features of
these TKLs are the presence of flat bands in their band structure as well as
the emergence of the RKKY plateaus versus the Fermi energy. These RKKY plateaus
have not been reported before, to the best of our knowledge. The most
remarkable observation is the potential and Fermi energy variation of the width

configurations of the magnetic impurities can also dramatically change the
quality and quantity of the RKKY plateaus. We believe that our results provide

discrete time steps, every vertex $v$ that has at least $t_v$ active neighbors
becomes active as well. The set $S$ is contagious if eventually all $V$ becomes

  In the conservative special case of TSS, $t_v > \frac{1}{2}d_v$ for every $v
\in V$. In this special case, TSS can be approximated within a ratio of
$O(\Delta)$, where $\Delta = \max_{v \in V}[d_v]$. In this work we introduce a
more general class of TSS instances that we refer to as conservative on average
(CoA), that satisfy the condition $\sum_{v\in V} t_v > \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v \in

example, if $t_v \geq \frac{1}{2}d_v$ for every $v \in V$, we can find in
polynomial time a contagious set of size $\tilde{O}\left(\Delta \cdot OPT^2

provide several hardness of approximation results. For example, assuming the

environments. However, since the wheel odometer only provides 2D motion
estimates, it is extremely challenging to use that for performing accurate full

pose estimation either approximate sensor or motion models, at the cost of
accuracy reduction, or rely on other sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit

propose a novel method to utilize the wheel odometer for 6D pose estimation, by
modeling and utilizing motion manifold for ground robots. Our approach is
probabilistically formulated and only requires the wheel odometer and an

manifold based 6D integration with the wheel odometer measurements only, and
iii) re-parameterizes manifold equations periodically for error reduction. To
demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithmic
modules, we integrate that into a sliding-window pose estimator by using
measurements from the wheel odometer and a monocular camera. By conducting
extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that the proposed

that usually appears in its advanced stage. Freeze episodes are associated with
falls, injuries, and psychological consequences, negatively affecting the
patients' quality of life. For detecting FoG episodes automatically, a highly
accurate detection method is necessary. This paper presents an approach for
detecting FoG episodes utilizing a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) on
3D-accelerometer measurements. We investigate suitable features and feature
combinations extracted from the sensors' time series data. Specifically, for
detecting FoG episodes, we apply a deep RNN with Long Short-Term Memory cells.
In our experiments, we perform both user dependent and user independent
experiments, to detect freeze episodes. Our experimental results show that the
frequency domain features extracted from the trunk sensor are the most
informative feature group in the subject independent method, achieving an
average AUC score of 93%, Specificity of 90% and Sensitivity of 81%. Moreover,
frequency and statistical features of all the sensors are identified as the
best single input for the subject dependent method, achieving an average AUC
score of 97%, Specificity of 96% and Sensitivity of 87%. Overall, in a
comparison to state-of-the-art approaches from literature as baseline methods,
our proposed approach outperforms these significantly.

study the way in which the transition between the regimes $a+b=c$ and $a+b<c$
manifests in the thermodynamic limit.
  It is shown that the height function of the six-vertex model delocalizes with
logarithmic variance when $a+b=c$ while remaining localized when $a+b<c$. In
the latter regime, the extremal translation-invariant Gibbs states of the
height function are described. Qualitative differences between the two regimes
are further exhibited for the Gibbs states of the six-vertex model itself and
for the Gibbs states of its associated spin representation.
  Via a coupling, our results further allow to study the self-dual
Ashkin--Teller model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is proved that on the portion of the
self-dual curve~$\sinh 2J = e^{-2U}$ where $J<U$ each of the two Ising
configurations exhibits exponential decay of correlations while their product
is ferromagnetically ordered. This is in contrast to the case $J=U$ (the
critical 4-state Potts model) where it is known that there is power-law decay
for both Ising configurations and for their product.
  The proofs rely on the recently established order of the phase transition in
the random-cluster model, which relates to the six-vertex model via the
Baxter--Kelland--Wu coupling. Additional ingredients include the introduction
of a random-cluster model with modified weight for boundary clusters, analysis
of a spin (mixed Ashkin--Teller model) and bond representation (of the FK-Ising

way of first aligning the source and target domain distributions and then learn
a classifier on a labeled source domain to classify target domain. This
approach of an indirect way of addressing the real task of unlabeled target
domain classification has three main drawbacks. (i) The sub-task of obtaining a
perfect alignment of the domain in itself might be impossible due to large
domain shift (e.g., language domains). (ii) The use of multiple classifiers to
align the distributions unnecessarily increases the complexity of the neural
networks leading to over-fitting in many cases. (iii) Due to distribution
alignment, the domain-specific information is lost as the domains get morphed.
In this work, we propose a simple and direct approach that does not require
domain alignment. We jointly learn CTDR on both source and target distribution
for unsupervised domain adaptation task using contradistinguish loss for the
unlabeled target domain in conjunction with a supervised loss for labeled

The approach is applicable to a wide range of data from physical measurements

Gaussian under linear operators, in particular differentiation. Instead of
using a generic covariance function to represent data from an unknown field,
the space of possible covariance functions is restricted to allow only Gaussian
random fields that fulfil the homogeneous differential equation. The resulting
tailored kernel functions lead to more reliable regression compared to using a
generic kernel and makes some hyperparameters directly interpretable. For
differential equations representing laws of physics such a choice limits
realizations of random fields to physically possible solutions. Source terms

Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning methods, in this

predicting future poses under this formulation through a combination of
behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning. Our

prediction in both short-term predictions and long-term predictions, while also
enjoying huge advantage in training speed.

robotics. Most sampling-based planners use a global random sampling scheme to
guarantee probabilistic completeness. However, most schemes are often
inefficient as the samples drawn from the global proposal distribution, and do
not exploit relevant local structures. Local sampling-based motion planners, on
the other hand, take sequential decisions of random walks to samples valid
trajectories in configuration space. However, current approaches do not adapt
their strategies according to the success and failures of past samples.
  In this work, we introduce a local sampling-based motion planner with a
Bayesian learning scheme for modelling an adaptive sampling proposal
distribution. The proposal distribution is sequentially updated based on
previous samples, consequently shaping it according to local obstacles and
constraints in the configuration space. Thus, through learning from past
observed outcomes, we maximise the likelihood of sampling in regions that have
a higher probability to form trajectories within narrow passages. We provide
the formulation of a sample-efficient distribution, along with theoretical
foundation of sequentially updating this distribution. We demonstrate
experimentally that by using a Bayesian proposal distribution, a solution is
found faster, requiring fewer samples, and without any noticeable performance
overhead.

originally conceived for the numerical solution of the Maxwell and MHD
equations with divergence-type involutions, to the case of hyperbolic PDE
systems with curl-type involutions. The key idea here is to solve an augmented
PDE system, in which curl errors propagate away via a Maxwell-type evolution
system. The new approach is first presented on a simple model problem, in order
to explain the basic ideas. Subsequently, we apply it to a strongly hyperbolic
first order reduction of the CCZ4 formulation (FO-CCZ4) of the Einstein field
equations of general relativity, which is endowed with 11 curl constraints.
Several numerical examples, including the long-time evolution of a stable
neutron star in anti-Cowling approximation, are presented in order to show the
obtained improvements with respect to the standard formulation without special
treatment of the curl involution constraints. The main advantages of the
proposed GLM approach are its complete independence of the underlying numerical
scheme and grid topology and its easy implementation into existing computer
codes. However, this flexibility comes at the price of needing to add for each
curl involution one additional 3 vector plus another scalar in the augmented
system for homogeneous curl constraints, and even two additional scalars for
non-homogeneous curl involutions. For the FO-CCZ4 system with 11 homogeneous
curl involutions, this means that additional 44 evolution quantities need to be
added.

systems security with many applications, including exploit analysis, guided

fundamentally limited by the Boolean nature of taint labels, which provide no
information about the significance of detected dataflows and lead to false
positives/negatives on complex real world programs.
  We introduce proximal gradient analysis (PGA), a novel, theoretically
grounded approach that can track more accurate and fine-grained dataflow
information. PGA uses proximal gradients, a generalization of gradients for
non-differentiable functions, to precisely compose gradients over
non-differentiable operations in programs. Composing gradients over programs
eliminates many of the dataflow propagation errors that occur in DTA and
provides richer information about how each measured dataflow effects a program.
  We compare our prototype PGA implementation to three state of the art DTA
implementations on 7 real-world programs. Our results show that PGA can improve
the F1 accuracy of data flow tracking by up to 33% over taint tracking (20% on
average) without introducing any significant overhead (<5% on average). We
further demonstrate the effectiveness of PGA by discovering 22 bugs (20
confirmed by developers) and 2 side-channel leaks, and identifying exploitable
dataflows in 19 existing CVEs in the tested programs.

for the structural glass transition (SGT) theories. In these systems glassy
behavior is manifested as the density of the particles is increased. Thus, soft
colloidal particles with varying degree of softness capture diverse glass
forming properties, observed normally in molecular glasses. By performing
Brownian dynamics simulations for a binary mixture of micron-sized charged
colloidal suspensions, known to form Wigner glasses, we show that by tuning the
softness of the potential, achievable by changing the monovalent salt
concentration, there is a continuous transition between fragile to strong
behavior. Remarkably, this is found in a system where the well characterized
potential between the colloidal particles is isotropic. We also show that the
predictions of the random first order transition (RFOT) theory quantitatively
describes the universal features such as the growing correlation length,
$\xi\sim (\phi_K/\phi - 1)^{-\nu}$ with $\nu = 2/3$ where $\phi_K$, the
analogue of the Kauzmann temperature, depends on the salt concentration. As
anticipated by the RFOT predictions, we establish a causal relationship between
the growing correlation length and a steep increase in the relaxation time and
dynamic heterogeneity. The broad range of fragility observed in Wigner glasses
is used to draw analogies with molecular glasses. The large variations in the
fragility is found only when the temperature dependence of the viscosity is
examined for a large class of diverse glass forming materials. In sharp
contrast, this is vividly illustrated in a single system that can be
experimentally probed. Our work also shows that the RFOT predictions are
accurate in describing the dynamics over the entire density range, regardless

many modern data science algorithms, notably in inference and classification.
Because of the exponentials that these functions contain, the evaluation is
prone to overflow and underflow, especially in low precision arithmetic.
Software implementations commonly use alternative formulas that avoid overflow
and reduce the chance of harmful underflow, employing a shift or another
rewriting. Although mathematically equivalent, these variants behave
differently in floating-point arithmetic. We give rounding error analyses of
different evaluation algorithms and interpret the error bounds using condition
numbers for the functions. We conclude, based on the analysis and numerical
experiments, that the shifted formulas are of similar accuracy to the unshifted
ones and that the shifted softmax formula is typically more accurate than a
division-free variant.

  Diagnosis",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key step in medical diagnosis is giving the patient a universally
recognized label (e.g. Appendicitis) which essentially assigns the patient to a
class(es) of patients with similar body failures. However, two patients having
the same disease label(s) with high probability may still have differences in
their feature manifestation patterns implying differences in the required
treatments. Additionally, in many cases, the labels of the primary diagnoses
leave some findings unexplained. Medical diagnosis is only partially about
probability calculations for label X or Y. Diagnosis is not complete until the
patient overall situation is clinically understood to the level that enables
the best therapeutic decisions. Most machine learning models are data centric
models, and evidence so far suggest they can reach expert level performance in
the disease labeling phase. Nonetheless, like any other mathematical technique,
they have their limitations and applicability scope. Primarily, data centric
algorithms are knowledge blind and lack anatomy and physiology knowledge that
physicians leverage to achieve complete diagnosis. This article advocates to
complement them with intelligence to overcome their inherent limitations as
knowledge blind algorithms. Machines can learn many things from data, but data
is not the only source that machines can learn from. Historic patient data only
tells us what the possible manifestations of a certain body failure are.
Anatomy and physiology knowledge tell us how the body works and fails. Both are
needed for complete diagnosis. The proposed Double Deep Learning approach,
along with the initiative for Medical Wikipedia for Smart Machines, leads to AI
diagnostic support solutions for complete diagnosis beyond the limited data
only labeling solutions we see today. AI for medicine will forever be limited
until their intelligence also integrates anatomy and physiology.

the prediction. Furthermore, smooth predictions result in geometrical

which operation conditions change continuously and subsystems may come and go
at will, e.g. intelligent traffic management and multi-robot systems. To manage
these dynamics, these systems have to self-adapt their structures and behaviors
dynamically. While we have witnessed significant progress over the past decade
in the manner in which such systems are designed, persistent challenges remain.
In particular, dealing with distribution and decentralized control remains one
of the major challenges in self-adaptive systems. This report presents an
architecture style that supports software architects with designing
architectures for a family of decentralized self-adaptive systems. The
architecture style structures the software in a number of interacting
autonomous entities (agents) that cooperatively realize the system tasks.
Multi-agent systems derived from the architectural style realize flexibility
(agents adapt their behavior and interactions to variable operating conditions)
and openness (agents cope autonomously with other agents that enter and leave
the system). The architectural style consists of five related patterns that
distill domain-specific architectural knowledge derived from extensive
experiences with developing various multi-agent systems. The architectural
patterns are specified using pi-ADL, a formal architectural description
language supporting specification of dynamic architectures. This specification
provides architects with a rigorous description of the architecture elements of
the patterns, their interactions and behavior. We illustrate how we have
applied the architectural style with excerpts of two cases from our practice:
an experimental system for anticipatory traffic routing and an industrial
logistic system for automated transportation in warehouse environments.

update-time with high probability. Here, $n$ denotes the number of vertices and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph.
  The MIS problem in fully dynamic graphs has attracted significant attention
after a breakthrough result of Assadi, Onak, Schieber, and Solomon [STOC'18]
who presented an algorithm with $O(m^{3/4})$ update-time (and thus broke the
natural $\Omega(m)$ barrier) where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the

update-time remained polynomial. In particular, the fastest algorithm prior to
our work had $\widetilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{n}, m^{1/3}\})$ update-time [Assadi et
al. SODA'19].
  Our algorithm maintains the lexicographically first MIS over a random order
of the vertices. As a result, the same algorithm also maintains a
3-approximation of correlation clustering. We also show that a simpler variant
of our algorithm can be used to maintain a random-order lexicographically first
maximal matching in the same update-time.

seek to produce images with MRI-like appearance directly from clinical US
images. Our own clinical motivation is to seek a way to communicate US findings
to patients or clinical professionals unfamiliar with US, but in medical image
analysis such a capability is potentially useful, for instance, for US-MRI
registration or fusion. Our model is self-supervised and end-to-end trainable.
Specifically, based on an assumption that the US and MRI data share a similar
anatomical latent space, we first utilise an extractor to determine shared
latent features, which are then used for data synthesis. Since paired data was
unavailable for our study (and rare in practice), we propose to enforce the
distributions to be similar instead of employing pixel-wise constraints, by
adversarial learning in both the image domain and latent space. Furthermore, we
propose an adversarial structural constraint to regularise the anatomical
structures between the two modalities during the synthesis. A cross-modal
attention scheme is proposed to leverage non-local spatial correlations. The
feasibility of the approach to produce realistic looking MR images is
demonstrated quantitatively and with a qualitative evaluation compared to real

on a fraction of the elements in the computational domain. In this way,
quadrature determines only a subset of the entries in the final matrix. The
remaining matrix entries are computed by a simple B-spline interpolation
procedure. We present the modifications and extensions required for a reference

(SSE), the errors of which can lead to correlated timing residuals and
significantly contribute to the PTA noise budget. Most Solar-system studies
with PTAs assume the dominance of the term from the shift of the Solar-system
barycentre (SSB). However, it is unclear to which extent this approximation can
be valid, since the perturbations on the planetary orbits may become important
as data precision keeps increasing. To better understand the effects of SSE
uncertainties on pulsar timing, we develop the LINIMOSS dynamical model of the
Solar system, based on the SSE of Guangyu Li. Using the same input parameters
as DE435, the calculated planetary positions by LINIMOSS are compatible with
DE435 at centimetre level over a 20-year timespan, which is sufficiently
precise for pulsar-timing applications. We utilize LINIMOSS to investigate the
effects of SSE errors on pulsar timing in a fully dynamical way, by perturbing
one SSE parameter per trial and examining the induced timing residuals. For the
outer planets, the timing residuals are dominated by the SSB shift, as assumed
in previous work. For the inner planets, the variations in the orbit of the
Earth are more prominent, making previously adopted assumptions insufficient.
The power spectra of the timing residuals have complex structures, which may
introduce false signals in the search of gravitational waves. We also study how
to infer the SSE parameters using PTAs, and calculate the accuracy of parameter
estimation.

Estimation of population values from the sample data has been probematical,

people in the sample with unequal probabilities, and these inclusion
probabilities have to be estimated accurately to avoid large biases in survey
estimates. A new approach to estimation is introduced here, based on resampling
the sample network many times using a design that adheres to main features of
the design used in the field. These features include network link tracing,
branching, and without-replacement sampling. The frequency that a person is
included in the resamples is used to estimate the inclusion probability for
each person in the original sample, and these estimates of inclusion
probabilities are used in an unequal-probability estimator. In simulations
using a population of drug users, sex workers, and their partners for which the
actual values of population characteristics are known, the design-adherent
estimation approach increases the accuracy of estimates of population

to selection bias, and the data are thus missing-not-at-random. Developing a
method to facilitate the learning of a recommender with biased feedback is one
of the most challenging problems, as it is widely known that naive approaches
under selection bias often lead to suboptimal results. A well-established
solution for the problem is using propensity scoring techniques. The propensity
score is the probability of each data being observed, and unbiased performance
estimation is possible by weighting each data by the inverse of its propensity.
However, the performance of the propensity-based unbiased estimation approach
is often affected by choice of the propensity estimation model or the high
variance problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic
meta-learning method inspired by the asymmetric tri-training framework for
unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method utilizes two predictors to
generate data with reliable pseudo-ratings and another predictor to make the
final predictions. In a theoretical analysis, a propensity-independent upper
bound of the true performance metric is derived, and it is demonstrated that
the proposed method can minimize this bound. We conduct comprehensive
experiments using public real-world datasets. The results suggest that the
previous propensity-based methods are largely affected by the choice of
propensity models and the variance problem caused by the inverse propensity
weighting. Moreover, we show that the proposed meta-learning method is robust

  Community in a Heterogeneous Multilayer Network","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1903.02641",,,,"cs.SI cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multilayer networks or MLNs (also called multiplexes or network of networks)
are being used extensively for modeling and analysis of data sets with multiple
entity and feature types and associated relationships. Although the concept of
community is widely-used for aggregate analysis, a structure- and semantics
preserving definition for it is lacking for MLNs. Retention of original MLN
structure and entity relationships is important for detailed drill-down
analysis. In addition, efficient computation is also critical for large number
of analysis.
  In this paper, we introduce a structure-preserving community definition for
MLNs as well as a framework for its efficient computation using the decoupling
approach. The proposed decoupling approach combines communities from individual
layers to form a serial k-community for connected k layers in a MLN. We propose
a new algorithm for pairing communities across layers and introduce several
weight metrics for composing communities from two layers using participating
community characteristics. In addition to the definition, our proposed approach
has a number of desired characteristics. It: i) leverages extant single graph
community detection algorithms, ii) introduces several weight metrics that are
customized for the community concept, iii) is a new algorithm for pairing
communities using bipartite graphs, and iv) experimentally validates the
community computation and its efficiency on widely-used IMDb and DBLP data
sets.

O_{f} (x) = \{f^{n} (x), n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}\}$ of a generic
point. To do this, using pluripotential methods, we will construct a natural
invariant canonical probability measure of maximum entropy $ \mu_{f} $ such
that $ \lambda_{\max}^{-n}(f^{n})^{\star}\Theta \longrightarrow \mu_{f} $ for
each smooth probability measure $\Theta $ in $X$ with $ \lambda_{k} :=

main stochastic properties of $ \mu_{f}$ and show, if possible, that $ \mu_{f}$
is a measure of equilibrium, smooth, hyperbolic, ergodic, mixing, $\mathbb{K} $
-mixing, exponential-mixing, moderate and the only measure of maximum entropy,
absolutely continuous with respect to the LEBESGUE measure and to the HAUSDORFF

concept of Perfect and $\mathbb{K} $-Perfect Measure and indeed show that $
\mu_{f}$ is $\mathbb{K} $-Perfect.

incoming signals that might damage them. Typical RP schemes range from simple
fusing and PIN diodes, to superconducting circuits and plasma cells - each
having a variety of drawbacks ranging from unacceptable system downtime and
self-destruction to significant insertion losses and power consumption. Here,
we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a unique self-shielding
RP based on a coupled-resonator-microwave-waveguide (CRMW) with a topological
defect being inductively coupled to a diode. This RP utilizes a
charge-conjugation (C) symmetric resonant defect mode that is robust against
disorder and demonstrates high transmittance at low incident powers. When
incident power exceeds a critical value, a self-induced resonant trapping
effect occurs leading to a dramatic suppression of transmittance and a
simultaneous increase of the reflectance close to unity. The proposed RP device
is self-protected from overheating and electrical breakdown and can be utilized
in radars, reflection altimeters, and a broad range of communication systems.
