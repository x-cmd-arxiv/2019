brightness maps reveal similar patterns to previous DI and ZDI studies:
non-axisymmetric polar magnetic field structure, void of fields at
mid-latitudes, and a complex structure in the equatorial regions. There is a
weak but clear tendency of the polar structures to be linked with strong radial

related with the observed spottedness, but we find that they are partially

magnetoconvection models for rapidly rotating young Suns, this field topology

dynamo, where differential rotation does not play a major role (so called
alpha^2 Omega or alpha^2 dynamos), and axi- and non-axisymmetric modes are

cannot be increased via local operations and classical communication. It has
therefore been proposed that an increment of quantum entanglement between
probes that are interacting solely via a mediator implies non-classicality of
the mediator. Indeed, under certain assumptions regarding the initial state,
entanglement gain between the probes indicates quantum coherence in the
mediator. Going beyond such assumptions, there exist other initial states which
produce entanglement between the probes via only local interactions with a
classical mediator. In this process the initial entanglement between any probe
and the rest of the system ""flows through"" the classical mediator and gets
localised between the probes. Here we theoretically characterise maximal
entanglement gain via classical mediator and experimentally demonstrate, using
liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, the optimal growth of quantum correlations
between two nuclear spin qubits interacting through a mediator qubit in a
classical state. We additionally monitor, i.e., dephase, the mediator in order
to emphasise its classical character. Our results indicate the necessity of
verifying features of the initial state if entanglement gain between the probes
is used as a figure of merit for witnessing non-classical mediator. Such
methods were proposed to have exemplary applications in quantum optomechanics,
quantum biology and quantum gravity.

not increase emissions, how does this constraint affect energy storage
investment decisions? Two bi-level energy storage investment problems are
considered, representing 'philanthropic' (profitability-constrained) and
profit-maximizing storage investors (PhSI, PMSI). A MILP heuristic is developed
to obtain good candidate solutions to these inherently MINLP bi-level problems.
  A case study is conducted on a 30% renewable system, with sensitivity
analyses on the price of storage and the price of carbon emissions. Regardless
of the emissions-neutrality constraint, a PhSI installs significantly more
energy storage than a PMSI, increasing system flexibility. The effect of the
emissions-neutrality constraint in the absence of a carbon price is to reduce
the quantity of storage purchased and reduce annual system emissions (~3%),
with only minor increases in overall cost (~0.1%). In cases with a carbon
price, storage does not tend to increase emissions and the emissions constraint
does not tend to decrease storage investment. The emissions-neutrality
constraint is seen to deliver similar emissions reductions even in a system
with much higher renewable penetration (46%).

all galaxies quenched between 3 and 9 Gyr ago, independent of luminosity, with
a notable concentration $3-6$ Gyr ago. This is in contrast to the Milky Way
(MW) satellites, which are generally either faint with ancient quenching times
or luminous with recent ($<3$ Gyr) quenching times. We suggest that systematic
differences in the quenching times of M31 and MW satellites may be a reflection
of the varying accretion histories of M31 and the MW. This result implies that
the formation histories of low-mass satellites may not be broadly

population we identify two distinct groups based on their SFHs: one with
exponentially declining SFHs ($\tau \sim 2$ Gyr) and one with rising SFHs with
abrupt quenching. We speculate how these two groups could be related to
scenarios for a recent major merger involving M31. The Cycle 27 HST Treasury

different relations for the pressure components (radial and lateral), and

generated wormholes obey the necessary metric conditions, as manifested in
other studies in the literature. The respective energy conditions reveal the
physical nature of the wormhole models thus constructed. It is found, in
particular, that for each of those considered, the parameter space can be
divided into different regions, in which the exact wormhole solutions fulfill
the null~(NEC) and the weak energy conditions~(WEC), respectively, in terms of
the lateral pressure. Moreover, the dominant energy condition~(DEC) in terms of
both pressures is also valid, while $\rho + P_{r} + 2P_{l} = 0$. A similar
solution for the theory $P_{r} = \omega_{1} \rho + \omega_{2} \rho^{2}$ is

set, the concept of globalized robust framework comes into view. In this
article, we formulate a globalized robust counterpart for the discounted

optimization, a concept of globalized robust Markov perfect equilibrium is
introduced. The existence of such an equilibrium is shown for a discounted

equicontinuity are used to prove the existence result. To compute a globalized

  Sensing Faults","17 pages, 4 figures, accepted by ACC 2020",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feedback dynamic routing is a commonly used control strategy in
transportation systems. This class of control strategies relies on real-time
information about the traffic state in each link. However, such information may
not always be observable due to temporary sensing faults. In this article, we
consider dynamic routing over two parallel routes, where the sensing on each
link is subject to recurrent and random faults. The faults occur and clear
according to a finite-state Markov chain. When the sensing is faulty on a link,
the traffic state on that link appears to be zero to the controller. Building
on the theories of Markov processes and monotone dynamical systems, we derive
lower and upper bounds for the resilience score, i.e. the guaranteed throughput
of the network, in the face of sensing faults by establishing stability
conditions for the network. We use these results to study how a variety of key
parameters affect the resilience score of the network. The main conclusions
are: (i) Sensing faults can reduce throughput and destabilize a nominally
stable network; (ii) A higher failure rate does not necessarily reduce
throughput, and there may exist a worst rate that minimizes throughput; (iii)
Higher correlation between the failure probabilities of two links leads to
greater throughput; (iv) A large difference in capacity between two links can
result in a drop in throughput.

of boosted top particles when these decay semileptonically to electrons. Within
these jets, the electron shower overlaps with the shower initiated by the $b$
quark, which makes the identification of the electron hard. Even if an electron
inside a jet is identified, it is difficult to pinpoint whether the electron
rich jet is indeed due to top quark decay or not, since the invisible neutrino
carries away a nontrivial part of the energy-momentum of the original top
quark. Broadly speaking, the method proposed here has three key components. It
uses the distribution of energy in various parts of the detector to identify
whether the observed jet is consistent with a jet containing an energetic
electron. It uses the substructure of the jet to determine the momentum
associated with the electron. Finally, it constructs new variables that carry
tell-tale features of top quark decay kinematics using an extra ansatz that,
there exists a massless invisible four-momentum \emph{roughly} collimated to
the electron, which reconstructs a $W$ and a top when it is combined with the
electron and the full jet respectively. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
proposal using simulated data and show that our method not only reduces the
backgrounds from light flavor jets, $b$ jets from QCD, and hadronic top jets,
it can also tell apart jets rich in electrons but not due to top quark decays.

a coalgebra over the little $n$-disks operad. This structure induces
non-trivial cooperations on the rational homotopy groups of an $n$-fold

is a cooperation that forms an obstruction for an $n$-fold suspension to be an
$(n+1)$-fold suspension, i.e. if this cooperation is non-zero then the space is
not an $(n+1)$-fold suspension. We prove several results in equivariant
rational homotopy theory that play an essential role in our results. Namely, we
prove a version of the Sullivan conjecture for the Maurer-Cartan simplicial set
of certain $L_\infty$-algebras equipped with a finite group action, and we
provide rational models for fixed and homotopy fixed points of (mapping) spaces

metric, impulses of gamma radiation can arise that have several properties in
common with the observed gamma-ray bursts. This happens when the bang-time
function $t_B(r)$ has a gate-shaped hump around the origin of the QSS region.
The gamma rays arise along two preferred directions of the QSS geometry
(coincident with dipole extrema when axially symmetric, otherwise unrelated).
In these directions, the rays of the relic radiation are blueshifted rather
than redshifted. The blueshift is generated in a thin region between the Big
Bang (BB) and the extremum-redshift hypersurface (ERH). But the Szekeres models
can describe the real Universe only forward in time from the last-scattering
hypersurface (LSH) because the matter in them has zero pressure. The ERH is
tangent to the BB at the origin, so in a neighbourhood thereof the ERH lies
earlier than the LSH and no blueshift is generated in the physical region. The
question thus arose whether the BB and ERH can be ``unglued'' if the QSS region
has no origin, but the areal radius function $\Phi$ has a local maximum or
minimum somewhere. In the present paper it is demonstrated that this is indeed
the case. If the hump in $t_B(r)$ is centered around the minimum of $\Phi$,
then the BB and ERH in general do not coincide there and a stronger blueshift
is generated on rays passing nearby. It follows that a lower and narrower hump
on the BB set can generate sufficient blueshift to move the initial frequencies
of the relic radiation to the gamma range. These facts are demonstrated by
numerical calculations in an explicit example of a QSS region.

Criticality generates events, with an inter-event time interval distribution

introduce and that is defined by a list of equalities and inequalities on the

the set of points where the jet of the Kostlan polynomials belongs to a

functions or the set of critical points fall under this definition.

configurations are rare. Our results extend earlier results from Diatta and
Lerario who considered the special case of the zero set of a single polynomial.

differ solely in what context the prediction conditions on. This is controlled
by utilizing specific self-attention masks for the shared transformer network.

this universal architectural feature of natural languages. Why have human
languages evolved to exhibit this division of labor between content and

This paper takes steps towards answering these questions by showing how the
distinction can emerge through reinforcement learning in agents playing a

the fine-structure energy levels of neutral carbon to constrain the physical

expressions for the surface density at which atomic to molecular conversion

EMD, which is the minimum total Euclidean distance of any matching of size

The problems of computing EMD and asymmetric EMD are well-studied and have many
applications in computer science, some of which also ask for the EMD-optimal
matching itself. Unfortunately, all known algorithms require at least quadratic
time to compute EMD exactly. Approximation algorithms with nearly linear time
complexity in $n$ are known (even for finding approximately optimal matchings),
but suffer from exponential dependence on the dimension.
  In this paper we show that significant improvements in exact and approximate
algorithms for EMD would contradict conjectures in fine-grained complexity. In
particular, we prove the following results:
  (1) Under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture, there is some $c>0$ such that
EMD in $\Omega(c^{\log^* n})$ dimensions cannot be computed in truly
subquadratic time.
  (2) Under the Hitting Set Conjecture, for every $\delta>0$, no truly
subquadratic time algorithm can find a $(1 + 1/n^\delta)$-approximate EMD
matching in $\omega(\log n)$ dimensions.

multirotor vehicles, including the need to accurately localize the platform,
fast trajectory planning, and precise/robust control. Previous works studied
this problem but most lack explicit consideration of the wind disturbance,
which typically leads to slow descents onto the platform. This work presents a
fully autonomous vision-based system that addresses these limitations by
tightly coupling the localization, planning, and control, thereby enabling fast
and accurate landing on a moving platform. The platform's position,
orientation, and velocity are estimated by an extended Kalman filter using
simulated GPS measurements when the quadrotor-platform distance is large, and
by a visual fiducial system when the platform is nearby. The landing trajectory
is computed online using receding horizon control and is followed by a boundary
layer sliding controller that provides tracking performance guarantees in the
presence of unknown, but bounded, disturbances. To improve the performance, the
characteristics of the turbulent conditions are accounted for in the
controller. The landing trajectory is fast, direct, and does not require
hovering over the platform, as is typical of most state-of-the-art approaches.
Simulations and hardware experiments are presented to validate the robustness
of the approach.

opportunity of cache hit which enhances the cache utility as well as the
effectiveness of NOMA. Importantly, this comes without requiring users'

and, concurrently, ensure the fairness among users, the probability that all
users can decode the desired signals is maximized. In NOMA, a combination of
multiple messages are sent to users, and the defined objective is approached by
finding an appropriate power allocation for message signals. To address the
power allocation problem, two novel methods are proposed. The first one is a
divide-and-conquer-based method for which closed-form expressions for the
optimal resource allocation policy are derived, making this method simple and
flexible to the system context. The second one is based on the deep

have implications for small-scale challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and

background (CMB) experiments and large-scale structure surveys, and will be
probed with much greater sensitivity by future efforts. It is challenging to
compute observables in ULA scenarios with sufficient speed and accuracy for
cosmological data analysis because the ULA field oscillates rapidly. In past
work, an effective fluid approximation has been used to make these computations
feasible. Here this approximation is tested against an exact solution of the
ULA equations, comparing the induced error of CMB observables with the
sensitivity of current and future experiments. In the most constrained mass
range for a ULA dark matter component ($10^{-27}~{\rm eV}\leq m_{\rm ax}\leq

ionizing luminosities of $L_{\rm{\nu_{\rm{LL}}}}=10^{31.1-32.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$
Hz$^{-1}$. We found that 14 out of 16 QSOs are associated with Ly$\alpha$
nebulae with projected linear-sizes larger than 50 physical kpc (pkpc). Among
them, four nebulae have enormous Ly$\alpha$ emission with the Ly$\alpha$
surface brightness $SB_{\rm{Ly\alpha}} >10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
arcsec$^{-2}$ on the $>100$ kpc scale, extending beyond the field of view of
KCWI. Our KCWI observations reveal that most $z\approx2$ QSO nebulae have a
more irregular morphology compared to those at $z\gtrsim3$. In turn, we measure
that the circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) at $z\approx2$ is 0.4 dex
fainter than the redshift-corrected, median SB at $z\gtrsim 3$. The Ly$\alpha$
SB profile (SB$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$) of QSOs at $z\approx 2$ can be described by a
power law of SB$_{\rm{Ly\alpha},z\approx2.3}=
3.7\times10^{-17}\times(r/40)^{-1.8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$,
with the slope similar to that at $z\gtrsim3$. The observed lower
redshift-corrected, circularly-averaged SB may be mainly due to the lower
covering factor of cool gas clouds in massive halos at $z\approx2$.

assumptions, we put preliminary constraints on the projected dust surface

we also explore AGN IR variability at 10--24 $\mu m$ over a 5-year time-scale.
Except for blazars and flat-spectrum radio sources, the majority of AGNs have
typical variation amplitudes at 24 $\mu m$ no more than 10% of that in the W1

scale and leave an imprint on large-scale structure. Measuring this imprint
allows us to constrain the sum of neutrino masses, $M_\nu$, a key parameter in
particle physics beyond the Standard Model. However, degeneracies among
cosmological parameters, especially between $M_\nu$ and $\sigma_8$, limit the
constraining power of standard two-point clustering statistics. In this work,
we investigate whether we can break these degeneracies and constrain $\smnu$
with the next higher-order correlation function --- the bispectrum. We first
examine the redshift-space halo bispectrum of $800$ $N$-body simulations from
the HADES suite and demonstrate that the bispectrum helps break the
$M_\nu$--$\sigma_8$ degeneracy. Then using 22,000 $N$-body simulations of the
Quijote suite, we quantify for the first time the full information content of
the redshift-space halo bispectrum down to nonlinear scales using a Fisher
matrix forecast of $\{\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_\nu\}$.
For $k_{\rm max}{=}0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the bispectrum provides $\Omega_m$,
$\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sigma_8$ constraints 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6
times tighter than the power spectrum. For $M_\nu$, the bispectrum improves the
1$\sigma$ constraint from 0.2968 to 0.0572 eV --- over 5 times tighter than the
power spectrum. Even with priors from {\em Planck}, the bispectrum improves
$M_\nu$ constraints by a factor of 1.8. Although we reserve marginalizing over
a more complete set of bias parameters to the next paper of the series, these
constraints are derived for a $(1~h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ box, a substantially
smaller volume than upcoming surveys. Thus, our results demonstrate that the
bispectrum offers significant improvements over the power spectrum, especially
for constraining $M_\nu$.

faithfully captured by a quasiprobability distribution. Its negativities, being
associated with proofs of contextuality, are proxys of non-classicality. We
discuss the thermodynamic interpretation of negative probabilities, and provide
heat flow inequalities that can only be violated in their presence. Remarkably,
testing these fully quantum inequalities, at arbitrary dimension, is not more
difficult than testing traditional fluctuation theorems. We test these results

has spread to many fields in the recent years including control theory.
However, the success of such algorithms has been dependent on availability of
large datasets. Moreover, due to their black box nature, it is challenging to

failure is very costly. In this paper, we develop two related novel supervised

the presence of noise. Our algorithms output a bang-bang (binary) control input
by taking in feedback of the state of the dynamical system. The algorithms
learn this control input by maximizing a reward function in both short and long
time horizons. We demonstrate the versatility of our algorithms by applying
them to a diverse range of applications including: switching between bistable
states, changing the phase of an oscillator, desynchronizing a population of
synchronized coupled oscillators, and stabilizing an unstable fixed point. For
most of these applications we are able to reason why our algorithms work by

fluorescence microscopy. The dynamics of a (haematite) photocalytic material
immersed in (hydrogen peroxide) fuel under various illumination patterns is
first described and quantitatively rationalized by a model of diffusiophoresis,
the migration of a colloidal particle in a concentration gradient. It is
further exploited to design phototactic microswimmers, that direct towards the
high intensity of light, as a result of the the torque exerted by the haematite
in a light gradient on a microswimmer. We finally demonstrate the assembly of
self-spinning microgears from colloidal microswimmers by controlling
dissipative diffusiophoretic interactions, that we characterize using HILO and
quantitatively compare to analytical and numerical predictions. Because the
approach described hereby is generic, this works paves the way for the rational

deep learning. When training a deep generative model, the observed data are
often associated with certain categorical labels, and, in parallel with
learning to regenerate data and simulate new data, learning an interpretable
representation of each class of data is also a process of acquiring knowledge.
Here, we present a novel generative model, referred to as the Supervised Vector
Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (S-VQ-VAE), which combines the power of
supervised and unsupervised learning to obtain a unique, interpretable global
representation for each class of data. Compared with conventional generative
models, our model has three key advantages: first, it is an integrative model
that can simultaneously learn a feature representation for individual data
point and a global representation for each class of data; second, the learning
of global representations with embedding codes is guided by supervised
information, which clearly defines the interpretation of each code; and third,
the global representations capture crucial characteristics of different
classes, which reveal similarity and differences of statistical structures
underlying different groups of data. We evaluated the utility of S-VQ-VAE on a
machine learning benchmark dataset, the MNIST dataset, and on gene expression
data from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS).
We proved that S-VQ-VAE was able to learn the global genetic characteristics of
samples perturbed by the same class of perturbagen (PCL), and further revealed
the mechanism correlations between PCLs. Such knowledge is crucial for
promoting new drug development for complex diseases like cancer.

commonly adopted solution to overcome this challenge is to approximate the
full-order model (anchor) with a simplified, reduced-order model (template),
while performing control synthesis. Unfortunately it is challenging to make
formal guarantees about the safety of an anchor model using a controller
designed in an online fashion using a template model. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a method to generate safety-preserving controllers for
anchor models by performing reachability analysis on template models while
bounding the modeling error. This paper describes how this reachable set can be
incorporated into a Model Predictive Control framework to select controllers
that result in safe walking on the anchor model in an online fashion. The
method is illustrated on a 5-link RABBIT model, and is shown to allow the robot
to walk safely while utilizing controllers designed in an online fashion.

deviation of Se atom or whole layer of selenium atoms on a small angle up to 10
degrees from initial positions is also rather low, 0.32 and 0.19 eV/Se,
respectively. The changes in band structure of VSe2 caused by these motions of
Se atoms should be taken into account for analysis of the experimental data.
Simulations of the strain effects suggest that the experimentally observed T
phase of VSe2 monolayer is the ground state due a substrate-induced strain.
Calculations of the difference in total energies of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic configurations evidence that the ferromagnetic configuration
is the ground state of the system for all stable and intermediate atomic
structures. Calculated phonon dispersions suggest visible influence of magnetic
configurations on vibrational properties.

(PEA). The molecules studied were $H_2$ with and without spin, as well as
$He_2$ without spin. Hamiltonians were created under the LCAO basis, and
reconstructed using the Jordan-Winger transform in order to create a linear
combination of Pauli spin operators. The lengths of each molecular Hamiltonian
greatly increased from the $H_2$ without spin, to $He_2$. This resulted in a
reduced ability to simulate the Hamiltonians under ideal conditions. Thus, only
low orders of l = 1 and l = 2 were used when expanding the Hamiltonian in
accordance to the LCU method of simulation. The resulting Hamiltonians were
measured using PEA, and plotted against function of $\frac{2\pi(K)}{N}$ and the
probability distribution of each register. The resolution of the graph was
dependent on the amount of registers, N, being used. However, the reduction of
order hardly changed the image of the $H_2$ graphs. Qualitative comparisons

maximize the performance of ab initio non-adiabatic dynamics methods. Our
approach is based upon consideration of the overlap matrix ($\mathbf{U}$)
between basis functions at successive points in time and selecting the phases
so as to minimize the matrix norm of $\log(\mathbf{U})$. In so doing, one can
extend the concept of parallel transport to cases with sharp curve crossings.
We demonstrate that this algorithm performs well under extreme situations where
dozens of states cross each other either through trivial crossings (where there
is zero effective diabatic coupling), or through nontrivial crossings (when
there is a nonzero diabatic coupling), or through a combination of both. In all
cases, we compute the time-derivative coupling matrix elements (or equivalently
non-adiabatic derivative coupling matrix elements) that are as smooth as
possible. Our results should be of interest to all who are interested in either
non-adiabatic dynamics, or more generally, parallel transport in large systems.

obtained accepting all Boolean signals that satisfy a metric interval temporal

characterizing all real-valued signals that satisfy this specification. Using

transform the fractional objective function to the subtractive form. Then, by
employing Dinkelbach method, we propose an iterative algorithm in which an

approximation, we make the inner problem convex. Also, by introducing a penalty
function to handle integer sub-carrier assignment variables, we propose an
iterative algorithm for addressing the inner problem. We show that our proposed
algorithm converges to the locally optimal solution which is also demonstrated

to attacks in which the input image is perturbed by relatively small amounts of
noise so that the CNN is no longer able to perform a segmentation of the

to attack CNN-based models as well as how to defend models against attacks have
become a popular topic as this also provides insights into the performance and
generalization abilities of CNNs. However, most of the existing work assumes
unrealistic attack models, i.e. the resulting attacks were specified in
advance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating adversarial
examples to attack CNN-based segmentation models for medical images. Our
approach has three key features: 1) The generated adversarial examples exhibit
anatomical variations (in form of deformations) as well as appearance
perturbations; 2) The adversarial examples attack segmentation models so that
the Dice scores decrease by a pre-specified amount; 3) The attack is not
required to be specified beforehand. We have evaluated our approach on
CNN-based approaches for the multi-organ segmentation problem in 2D CT images.
We show that the proposed approach can be used to attack different CNN-based
segmentation models.

applied in many engineering fields. To accelerate the design process of infill
graded microstructures, a novel asymptotic homogenisation topology optimisation
method was proposed by Zhu et al.(2019), aiming for 1) significantly enriching
the pool of representable graded microstructures; 2) deriving an homogenised
formulation for stress analysis in consistency with fine-scale results. But the
work is severely confined from being widely applied, mainly due to the
following two reasons. Firstly, to circumvent the macroscopically pointwise
computation for solving various microscopic cell problems, linearisation had to
be adopted for its numerical implementation, and this significantly reduces the
design freedom. Secondly, lacking of sensitive analysis, genetic algorithm was
chosen for optimisation, inevitably decreasing the computational efficiency. To
address these bottleneck challenging issues, a zoning scheme empowered by
computational parallelism is introduced, and the sensitivity analysis
associated with the new asymptotic framework is conducted. Through comparisons
with fine-scale simulation results, the proposed algorithm is shown to be an
effective tool for evaluating the mechanical behaviour of graded
microstructures. As an optimisation tool, the mapping function takes a concise
and explicit form. But its parameterisation still needs further investigation,
so as to improve the solution optimality of the present approach, especially in
comparison with another recently proposed method by Groen et al (2018). The
high computational efficiency shown by the proposed scheme is also demonstrated
with optimisation results for three-dimensional graded microstructures, which
are not frequently discussed in literature, possibly because of the high
computational cost generated.

uncertainty about the true probability distribution of random variables of
interest. This makes them a key element in data-driven robust optimization by
exploiting high-confidence guarantees to hedge against uncertainty. This paper
explores the construction of Wasserstein ambiguity sets in dynamic scenarios
where data is collected progressively and may only reveal partial information
about the unknown random variable. For random variables evolving according to
known dynamics, we leverage assimilated samples to make inferences about their
unknown distribution at the end of the sampling horizon. Under exact knowledge
of the flow map, we provide sufficient conditions that relate the growth of the
trajectories with the sampling rate to establish a reduction of the ambiguity
set size as the horizon increases. Further, we characterize the exploitable
sample history that results in a guaranteed reduction of ambiguity sets under
errors in the computation of the flow and when the dynamics is subject to
bounded unknown disturbances. Our treatment deals with both full- and
partial-state measurements and, in the latter case, exploits the sampled-data
observability properties of linear time-varying systems under irregular
sampling. Simulations on a UAV detection application show the superior

Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks (DCRNNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, however,
applying DCRNNs for large highway networks still remains elusive because of
computational and memory bottlenecks. We present an approach for implementing a
DCRNN for a large highway network that overcomes these limitations. Our
approach uses a graph-partitioning method to decompose a large highway network
into smaller networks and trains them independently. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN approach to model the traffic on
a large California highway network with 11,160 sensor locations. We develop an
overlapping nodes approach for the graph-partitioning-based DCRNN to include
sensor locations from partitions that are geographically close to a given
partition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DCRNN model can be used to
forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and that the forecasted values
preserve fundamental traffic flow dynamics. Our approach to developing DCRNN
models that represent large highway networks can be a potential core capability
in advanced highway traffic monitoring systems, where a trained DCRNN model
forecasting traffic at all sensor locations can be used to adjust traffic
management strategies proactively based on anticipated future conditions.

influence of malicious attacks, which is relevant to a variety of engineering
system including transportation, manufacturing, and communications. We consider
a homogeneous Poisson arrival process of jobs and two parallel exponential
servers with symmetric service rates. A system operator route incoming jobs to
the shorter queue; if the queues are equal, the job is routed randomly. A
malicious attacker is able to intercept the operator's routing instruction and
overwrite it with a randomly generated one. The operator is able to defend
individual jobs to ensure correct routing. Both attacking and defending induce
technological costs. The attacker's (resp. operator's) decision is the
probability of attacking (resp. defending) the routing of each job. We first
quantify the queuing cost for given strategy profiles by deriving a theoretical
upper bound for the cost. Then, we formulate a non-zero-sum attacker-defender
game, characterize the equilibria in multiple regimes, and quantify the
security risk. We find that the attacker's best strategy is either to attack
all jobs or not to attack, and the defender's strategy is strongly influenced
by the arrival rate of jobs. Finally, as a benchmark, we compare the security
risks of the feedback-controlled system to a corresponding open-loop system
with Bernoulli routing. We show that the shorter-queue policy has a higher

model parameters to the clients, and the clients send updating directions such
as gradients to the server. While data do not leave a client device, the
communicated gradients and parameters will leak a client's privacy. Attacks
that infer clients' privacy from gradients and parameters have been developed
by prior work. Simple defenses such as dropout and differential privacy either
fail to defend the attacks or seriously hurt test accuracy.
  We propose a practical defense which we call Double-Blind Collaborative
Learning (DBCL). The high-level idea is to apply random matrix sketching to the
parameters (aka weights) and re-generate random sketching after each iteration.
DBCL prevents clients from conducting gradient-based privacy inferences which
are the most effective attacks. DBCL works because from the attacker's
perspective, sketching is effectively random noise that outweighs the signal.
Notably, DBCL does not much increase computation and communication costs and
does not hurt test accuracy at all.

observations from the Clue app by BioWink of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million
natural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal
statistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length

engagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we
develop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing
us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We
uncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability
spectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit
statistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and
symptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics
are stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The
symptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with
timing data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle
variability from symptoms or as potential health indicators for conditions like
endometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal,

optimization (DRO) as a principled approach to data-driven decision making. In
this paper, we consider a distributionally robust two-stage stochastic
optimization problem with discrete scenario support. While much research effort
has been devoted to tractable reformulations for DRO problems, especially those
with continuous scenario support, few efficient numerical algorithms were
developed, and most of them can neither handle the non-smooth second-stage cost
function nor the large number of scenarios $K$ effectively. We fill the gap by
reformulating the DRO problem as a trilinear min-max-max saddle point problem
and developing novel algorithms that can achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$
iteration complexity which only mildly depends on $K$. The major computations
involved in each iteration of these algorithms can be conducted in parallel if
necessary. Besides, for solving an important class of DRO problems with the
Kantorovich ball ambiguity set, we propose a slight modification of our
algorithms to avoid the expensive computation of the probability vector
projection at the price of an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K})$ times more iterations.
Finally, preliminary numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
empirical advantages of the proposed algorithms.

fluctuated across the barriers separating local minima of the landscape
potential during inflation. We analyze how this process could have impacted the
evolution of the primordial curvature perturbations. If the typical distance
separating consecutive minima of the landscape potential and the height of the
potential barriers are smaller than the Hubble expansion rate parametrizing
inflation, the probability distribution function of isocurvature fields becomes
non-Gaussian due to the appearance of bumps and dips associated with the
structure of the potential. We show that this non-Gaussianity can be
transferred to the statistics of primordial curvature perturbations. The type
of non-Gaussian structure that emerges in the distribution of curvature
perturbations cannot be fully probed with the standard methods of polyspectra;
instead, the probability distribution function is needed.

isocurvature perturbation with a sinusoidal potential and a linear derivative
coupling between the isocurvature and curvature field. This result is
generalized to arbitrary potentials and briefly studied beyond first-order

process of optimizing the agent's reward while avoiding dangerous behaviors
given by a demonstrator. In this work we develop a framework of avoidance
learning by defining a suitable objective function for these problems which
involves the \emph{distance} of state occupancy distributions of the expert and
demonstrator policies. We use density estimates for state occupancy measures
and use the aforementioned distance as the reward bonus for avoiding the
demonstrator. We validate our theory with experiments using a wide range of
partially observable environments. Experimental results show that we are able
to improve sample efficiency during training compared to state of the art
policy optimization and safety methods.

developed a dataset of 30 horses that allowed for both ""within-domain"" and

Universe. Improving distance measurements of SNe Ia is one technique to better
constrain the acceleration of expansion and determine its physical nature. This
document develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called
the SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral
description of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance
measurements. This model is constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and
spectrophotometric data from The Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a
first step, a PCA-like method is used on spectral features measured at maximum
light, which allows us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the
intrinsic properties are used to extract the average extinction curve. Third,
an interpolation using Gaussian Processes facilitates using data taken at
different epochs during the lifetime of a SN Ia and then projecting the data on
a fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps are combined to build the SED model
as a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model. The main
advancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to
characterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia
ejecta velocity, the second is correlated with their calcium lines. The
addition of these parameters, as well as the high quality the Nearby Supernova
Factory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the
spectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade. The performance of this
model makes it an excellent SED model for experiments like ZTF, LSST or WFIRST.

QUEnching and STar formation (ALMaQUEST) survey, we show that for star forming
spaxels in the main sequence galaxies, the three local quantities,
star-formation rate surface density (\sigsfr), stellar mass surface density
(\sigsm), and the \h2~mass surface density (\sigh2), are strongly correlated
with one another and form a 3D linear (in log) relation with dispersion. In
addition to the two well known scaling relations, the resolved SFMS (\sigsfr~
vs. \sigsm) and the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation (\sigsfr~ vs. \sigh2; SK
relation), there is a third scaling relation between \sigh2~ and \sigsm, which
we refer to as the `molecular gas main sequence' (MGMS). The latter indicates
that either the local gas mass traces the gravitational potential set by the
local stellar mass or both quantities follow the underlying total mass
distributions. The scatter of the resolved SFMS ($\sigma \sim 0.25$ dex) is the
largest compared to those of the SK and MGMS relations ($\sigma \sim$ 0.2 dex).
A Pearson correlation test also indicates that the SK and MGMS relations are
more strongly correlated than the resolved SFMS. Our result suggests a scenario
in which the resolved SFMS is the least physically fundamental and is the
consequence of the combination of the SK and the MGMS relations.

properties: low rate or high locality (polynomial in the length of the
message). In settings where the encoder/decoder have already exchanged
cryptographic keys and the channel is a probabilistic polynomial time (PPT)
algorithm, it is possible to circumvent these barriers and design LDCs with
constant rate and small locality. However, the assumption that the
encoder/decoder have exchanged cryptographic keys is often prohibitive. We thus
consider the problem of designing explicit and efficient LDCs in settings where
the channel is slightly more constrained than the encoder/decoder with respect
to some resource e.g., space or (sequential) time. Given an explicit function
$f$ that the channel cannot compute, we show how the encoder can transmit a
random secret key to the local decoder using $f(\cdot)$ and a random oracle
$H(\cdot)$. This allows bootstrap from the private key LDC construction of
Ostrovsky, Pandey and Sahai (ICALP, 2007), thereby answering an open question
posed by Guruswami and Smith (FOCS 2010) of whether such bootstrapping
techniques may apply to LDCs in weaker channel models than just PPT algorithms.
Specifically, in the random oracle model we show how to construct explicit
constant rate LDCs with locality of polylog in the security parameter against
various resource constrained channels.

solar abundances by a factor of ~3. Gas Giant envelopes are mainly enriched
through the dissolution of solids in the atmosphere, and this constant
enrichment factor is puzzling since several of the above elements are not
expected to have been in the solid phase in Jupiter's feeding zone; most
seriously, Ar and the main carrier of N, N2, only condense at the very low
temperatures, 21-26 K, associated with the outer solar nebula. We propose that
a plausible solution to the enigma of Jupiter's uniform enrichment pattern is
that Jupiter's core formed exterior to the N2 and Ar snowlines, beyond 30 au,
resulting in a Solar composition core in all volatiles heavier than Ne. During
envelope accretion and planetesimal bombardment, some of the core mixed in with
the envelope causing the observed enrichment pattern. We show that this
scenario naturally produces the observed atmosphere composition, even with
substantial pollution from N-poor pebble and planetesimal accretion in
Jupiter's final feeding zone. We note that giant core formation at large
nebular radii is consistent with recent models of gas giant core formation
through pebble accretion, which requires the core to form exterior to Jupiter's
current location to counter rapid inward migration during the core and envelope
formation process. If this scenario is common, gas giant core formation may

  Conversations","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing",,,,"cs.LG cs.HC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a chronic mental illness characterized by extreme
mood and energy changes from mania to depression. These changes drive behaviors
that often lead to devastating personal or social consequences. BPD is managed
clinically with regular interactions with care providers, who assess mood,
energy levels, and the form and content of speech. Recent work has proposed
smartphones for monitoring mood using speech. However, these works do not
predict when to intervene. Predicting when to intervene is challenging because
there is not a single measure that is relevant for every person: different
individuals may have different levels of symptom severity considered typical.
Additionally, this typical mood, or baseline, may change over time, making a
single symptom threshold insufficient. This work presents an innovative
approach that expands clinical mood monitoring to predict when interventions
are necessary using an anomaly detection framework, which we call Temporal
Normalization. We first validate the model using a dataset annotated for
clinical interventions and then incorporate this method in a deep learning
framework to predict mood anomalies from natural, unstructured, telephone
speech data. The combination of these approaches provides a framework to enable
real-world speech-focused mood monitoring.

commonly employed Galactic potentials: the St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential and the
default Milky Way-like potential used in the ""Galpy"" package (MWPotential2014),
making use of stars with available metallicities, radial velocities, and proper
motions from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. Adopting the
St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential, we find that the shape of the metallicity
distribution function (MDF) and the distribution of orbital rotation abruptly
change at $Z_{\rm max}$ = 15 kpc and $r_{\rm max}$ = 30 kpc (where $Z_{\rm
max}$ and $r_{\rm max}$ are the maximum distances reached by a stellar orbit
from the Galactic plane and from the Galactic center, respectively), indicating
that the transition from dominance by the inner-halo stellar population to the
outer-halo population occurs at those distances. Stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $>$
15 kpc show an average retrograde motion of $V_{\rm \phi}$ = $-$60 km s$^{-1}$,
while stars with $r_{\rm max}$ $>$ 30 kpc exhibit an even larger retrograde
value, $V_{\rm \phi}$ = $-$150 km s$^{-1}$. This retrograde signal is also
confirmed using the sample of stars with radial velocities obtained by $Gaia$
Data Release 2, assuming the St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential. In comparison, when
using the shallower Galpy potential, a noticeable change in the MDF occurs only
at $Z_{\rm max}$ = 25 kpc, and a much less extreme retrograde motion is
derived. This difference arises because stars with highly retrograde motions in
the St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential are unbound in the shallower Galpy potential,
and stars with lower rotation velocities reach larger $Z_{\rm max}$ and $r_{\rm
max}$. The different kinematic characteristics derived from the two potentials
suggest that the nature of the adopted Galactic potential can strongly
influence interpretation of the properties of the Galactic halo.

the change in posterior probabilities p(y|X) while the latter is the change in

Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a

the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data

CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ sub-classes, based on their absolute carbon abundances,
$A$(C), and examine the spatial distributions and kinematics associated with
each sub-class. The CEMP-no stars are the majority sub-class of CEMP stars in
the OHR ($\sim$ 65%), and the minority sub-class in the IHR ($\sim$ 44%),

The dwarf galaxy colors and Sersic structural parameters are consistent with

equations admits three different limits: the magneto-quasi-static,
electro-quasi-static, and electromagnetic-quasi-static limits, in addition to
the two obvious static limits. The first two quasi-static limits have been
previously identified as Galilean Electromagnetics, while the latter is also
known as the Darwin approximation. Using a perturbation expansion, a
generalization of Rappetti and Rousseaux [Applied Numerical Mathematics, 79,
92] orders the vacuum Maxwell equations and obtains all three limits. To order
the equations, the dimensionless version of the Maxwell equations are derived
using a modification of Jackson's review of EM unit systems [Jackson, Classical
Electrodynamics, Wiley, 1999, 3rd ed.] The perturbation expansion is repeated
for the potential form of the Maxwell equations to emphasize the importance of
gauge conditions. The integral solutions of the potentials are derived for the
three limits, and the generalized Coulomb and Biot-Savart equations are derived
from these solutions. It is shown that although the forms are the same as the
static equations, the quasi-static forms of the Maxwell equations are
recovered. The induction term is recovered when the time derivative of the

or strong asteroid is studied using theoretical and simulation models. The
theory and simulations show that under an increasing spin rate (such as due to
the YORP effect), the regolith covering is preferentially lost across certain
regions of the body. For regolith with little or no cohesive strength, failure
occurs by landsliding from the mid latitudes of the body at high enough spin
rates. As the cohesive strength of the regolith increases, failure occurs by
fission of grains (or coherent chunks of grains) across a greater extent of
latitudes and eventually will first occur at the equator. As the spin rate is
further increased, failure regions migrate from the first failure point to
higher and lower latitudes. Eventually failure will encompass the equatorial
region, however there always remains a region of high latitudes (around the
poles) that will not undergo failure for arbitrarily high spin rates (unless
disturbed by some other phenomenon). With these results a scaling law is
derived that can be used to determine whether observed asteroids could retain
surface regolith grains of a given size. The implications of this for the
interpretation of spectral observations of small asteroids and boulder
migration on large asteroids are discussed.

ability of networks with huge model size. The classical learning theory
suggests that overparameterized models cause overfitting. However, practically
used large deep models avoid overfitting, which is not well explained by the
classical approaches. To resolve this issue, several attempts have been made.
Among them, the compression based bound is one of the promising approaches.
However, the compression based bound can be applied only to a compressed
network, and it is not applicable to the non-compressed original network. In
this paper, we give a unified frame-work that can convert compression based
bounds to those for non-compressed original networks. The bound gives even
better rate than the one for the compressed network by improving the bias term.
By establishing the unified frame-work, we can obtain a data dependent
generalization error bound which gives a tighter evaluation than the data
independent ones.

charge qubits (MCQs). Two MCQs, $A$ and $B$, are prepared in a Bell state and
separated for negligible $A$-$B$ interactions. Interactions between the local
environment and each MCQ unravels $A$-$B$ entanglement during coherent
system+environment evolution. Three models are used for dynamics: (1) a
previously-developed, numerical model, in which both $AB$ and environment
$\mathcal{E}$ are modeled explicitly; (2) an exact, semi-analytic model, in
which only the dynamics of $AB$ are calculated, and (3) an approximate model
developed from the semi-analytic model and assumptions about randomness in
$\mathcal{E}$. In the approximate model, the non-zero coherences of the density
operator for $AB$ decay with a Gaussian time dependence. This provides a time
scale for system dynamics in the exact models as well. This time scale is
related directly to the strength of AB-$\mathcal{E}$ interaction. This time
scale describes cases where environmental interaction with one target MCQ is
dominant, generalizing a previous time scale applicable only when both MCQs
have roughly the same strength of interaction with the local environment.
Entanglement is measured using two-qubit correlation functions, the dynamics of
which are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the time scale. The
early-time decay of coherences and the loss of entanglement is
well-characterized as Gaussian, a behavior that Markovian models for memoryless
environments cannot capture. The approximate Gaussian model may be used to
describe the dynamics of MCQ disentanglement under the influence of
environments modeled here, as well as other environments where randomness is
present.

phenomenon occurs frequently on natural beaches, but has not yet been
quantified in the literature. Novel application of wave tracking methods
allowed for investigation of this phenomenon at seven sandy, micro-tidal,
wave-dominated Australian beaches. The results showed that, for the locations
where beach slope and environmental conditions allowed for bore-bore capture to
occur, there was a high probability 40% of one bore capturing another bore in
the surf or swash zones. The landward-most 10% of the nearshore region (i.e.,
the time-varying surf-swash extent) was found to be the most likely location
for a bore-bore capture event. Amplitude and frequency dispersion and the
interaction between bores and infragravity waves are (indirectly) shown to to
be equally important for driving bore-bore capture. Capture events infrequently
led to extreme horizontal shoreline maxima (approximately 20% of the cases),
however, most extreme shoreline maxima were directly driven by bore-bore
capture events >97% of the cases). For the analysed data, there was a direct
relation between the probability of bore-bore capture driving extreme shoreline
maxima and the Iribarren Number and beach morphodynamic state: the steeper or
more reflective the beach, the higher the probability of a bore-bore capture
event causing an extreme shoreline maxima event. Such correlation has direct
importance for the future development of predictive runup models, which
currently do not account for this phenomenon.

learning, a number of open questions remain to fully understand them and

proper diversity and sampling of the multi-mode data space. To address this, we
introduce BasisGAN, a stochastic conditional multi-mode image generator. By
exploiting the observation that a convolutional filter can be well approximated
as a linear combination of a small set of basis elements, we learn a
plug-and-played basis generator to stochastically generate basis elements, with
just a few hundred of parameters, to fully embed stochasticity into
convolutional filters. By sampling basis elements instead of filters, we
dramatically reduce the cost of modeling the parameter space with no sacrifice
on either image diversity or fidelity. To illustrate this proposed
plug-and-play framework, we construct variants of BasisGAN based on
state-of-the-art conditional image generation networks, and train the networks
by simply plugging in a basis generator, without additional auxiliary
components, hyperparameters, or training objectives. The experimental success
is complemented with theoretical results indicating how the perturbations
introduced by the proposed sampling of basis elements can propagate to the
appearance of generated images.

of deep neural networks for automatic quantification of foveal avascular zone
(FAZ) parameters and perifoveal vessel density of OCT-A images in healthy and

eccentricity) and perifoveal vessel density were used as outcome measures. The
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the DNN vessel segmentations were
comparable across all three device platforms. No significant difference between
the means of the measurements from automated and manual segmentations were
found for any of the outcome measures on any system. The intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) was also good (> 0.51) for all measurements. Automated deep

the main differences that arise compared to the massless Dirac fermions. The
different behavior is shown to be relevant at higher magnetic fields. The
calculations are performed in the framework of the linear response theory using
the exact quantum mechanical solution of the system in a constant magnetic
field. We prove that the Mott formula and the Wiedemann-Franz law are valid at

scattered-disk objects, and centaurs. Then we combined the orbital data to
calibrate the angular momenta of these small bodies, and evaluated the specific
contribution of the massive dwarf planets. The effects of uncertainties on the
mass determination and the observational incompleteness were also estimated. We
determine the total angular momentum of the known minor planets to be
$1.7817\times10^{46}$ g $\cdot$ cm$^2$ $\cdot$ s$^{-1}$. The relative angle
$\alpha$ between this vector and the total angular momentum of the Sun-planets

Pluto, and Haumea, which have peculiar angular momentum directions, $\alpha$
drops sharply to 1.76 deg.; a similar result applies to each individual minor
planet group. This suggests that, without these three most massive bodies, the
plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum of the minor planets would be
close to the invariable plane of the solar system. On the other hand, the
inclusion of Eris, Haumea, and Makemake can produce a difference of 1254 mas in
the inclination of the invariable plane, which is much larger than the
difference of 9 mas induced by Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas as found previously. By
taking into account the angular momentum contributions from all minor planets,
including unseen ones, the orientation improvement of the invariable plane is
larger than 1000 mas in inclination with a $1\sigma$ error of 50-140 mas.

range of [Fe/H] can be formed from rather massive and compact molecular cloud
with a mass of 2 * 10^7 M_sun in the central region of its dwarf galaxy within
less than a few hundred Myr. Gas ejected from SNe II and AGB stars can mix well
to form new stars with higher He abundances (Y) and higher [Fe/H]. The He-rich
stars are strongly concentrated in the GC's central region so that the GC can
show a steep negative gradient of Y. Relative ratios of light elements to Fe
show bimodal distributions for a given [Fe/H] owing to star formation from
original gas and AGB ejecta. [La/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] can rapidly increase until
[Fe/H]~-1.5 and then decrease owing to Fe ejection from SNe II. Although AGB

retained only partially. This difference in the retention capability is

  5G Networks",,"IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference, 2020",,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is the key driver of
the current 5G new radio standardization. URLLC encompasses sporadic and
small-payload transmissions that should be delivered within extremely tight
radio latency and reliability bounds, i.e., a radio latency of 1 ms with
99.999% success probability. However, such URLLC targets are further
challenging in the 5G dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) systems, due to the
switching between the uplink and downlink transmission opportunities and the
additional inter-cell cross-link interference (CLI). This paper presents a
system level analysis of the URLLC outage performance within the 5G new radio
flexible TDD systems. Specifically, we study the feasibility of the URLLC
outage targets compared to the case with the 5G frequency division duplexing
(FDD), and with numerous 5G design variants. The presented results therefore
offer valuable observations on the URLLC outage performance in such
deployments, and hence, introducing the state-of-the-art flexible-FDD

multipath fading channel, which has multiple tasks including blind channel

recognition, and data detection. Each of these tasks has been sufficiently
studied in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, this overall
problem has not been investigated previously. This paper is the first attempt
to address this overall problem jointly. We propose a complete blind receiver
approach that jointly estimates the unknown channel state information and noise
power, recognizes the unknown modulation and coding scheme, detects the data of
interest, and thus named BERD receiver. Another merit of the proposed BERD
receiver is that it can be implemented for both a single receiver and multiple
receivers, which ensures successful estimation, recognition, and detection for
such an extremely difficult problem. In addition, numerical results show the
performance of the proposed receiver in three folds: a) the BERD receiver
outperforms the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) pilot-based channel
estimator by over 3.5 dB at the MSE of 0.01; b) the correct modulation/coding
recognition performance of the BERD receiver is within 0.3 dB as close to the
recognition benchmark when the perfect channel state information (CSI) is
available; c) the BERD receiver is within 0.5 dB at the bit error rate of 0.001
compared to the benchmark when the modulation, the channel coding, and the CSI
are perfectly known. Finally, the BERD receiver finds many applications in both
civilian and military scenarios, such as the interference cancelation in
spectrum sharing, real-time signal interception, and processing in electronic
warfare operations, automatic recognition of a detect signal in
software-defined radio.

meanwhile reducing the use of high-quality data in training. We propose an
image generation method based on conditional transferring features, which can
capture pixel-level semantic changes when transforming low-quality images into
high-quality ones. Moreover, self-supervision learning is integrated into our
GAN architecture to provide more label-free semantic supervisory information
observed from the training data. As such, training our GAN architecture
requires much fewer high-quality images with a small number of additional
low-quality images. The experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 show that even
removing 30% high-quality images from the training set, our method can still
outperform previous ones. The scalability on object classes has been
experimentally validated: our method with 30% fewer high-quality images obtains
the best quality in generating 1,000 ImageNet classes, as well as generating

Nevertheless, a survey based on the data of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Istanbul,
Turkey [19] displayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals
and fatalities. With the motivation of investigating the underlying reason, we
use multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time
shift. Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidences that the
delay is approximately half of the infection period of the epidemic disease. In
addition, graphs of the classical SIR and the multistage SIR models; and the
classical SEIR and the multistage SEIR models are compared for various epidemic
parameters. Depending on the number of stages, it is observed that the delay
varies for relatively small stage numbers whereas it does not change for large
numbers in multistage systems. One important result that follows immediately
from this observation is that this fixed delay for large numbers explains the
time shift. Additionally, depending on the stage number and the duration of the
epidemic disease, the distance between the points where each infectious stage
reaches its maximum is found approximately both graphically and qualitatively
for both systems. Variations of the time shift, the maximum point of the sum of
all infectious stages, and the in ection point of the removed stage are
observed subject to the stage number N and it is shown that these variations
stay unchanged for greater values of N.

Convolution (DSConv), which replaces a standard convolution with a depthwise

are limited when compressing a trained CNN model since 1) they are mostly
heuristic approaches without a precise understanding of their relations to
standard convolution, and 2) their accuracies do not match that of the standard

method to compress CNN. FALCON uses GEP, our proposed mathematical formulation
to approximate the standard convolution kernel, to interpret existing
convolution methods based on depthwise separable convolution. By exploiting the
knowledge of a trained standard model and carefully determining the order of
depthwise separable convolution via GEP, FALCON achieves sufficient accuracy
close to that of the trained standard model. Furthermore, this interpretation
leads to developing a generalized version rank-k FALCON which performs k
independent FALCON operations and sums up the result. Experiments show that
FALCON 1) provides higher accuracy than existing methods based on depthwise
separable convolution and tensor decomposition, and 2) reduces the number of
parameters and FLOPs of standard convolution by up to a factor of 8 while
ensuring similar accuracy. We also demonstrate that rank-k FALCON further

performed binary population synthesis calculations to simulate the potential
population of detached binaries containing BHs and normal-star companions in

model, BHs in binaries evolve from stars more massive than $ \sim25M_{\odot} $.
However, it is difficult for this model to produce BH low-mass X-ray binaries.
Recent investigations on massive star evolution suggest that the BH progenitors
may have masses as low as $ \sim15M_{\odot} $. Based on this model, we provide
the expected distributions of various parameters for detached BH binaries with
normal-star companions, including the component masses, the orbital parameters
of the binary systems, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes, and the astrometric
signatures of the optical companions. %the detached BH systems with low-mass
companions can be easily produced in our simulations. Our calculations show
that there are more than thousands of such detached binaries in the Galaxy, and
hundreds of them are potentially observable systems with luminous companions
brighter than 20 mag. In addition, detached BH binaries are dominated by those
with main-sequence companions and only a few percent of them are expected to
have giant companions.

observational feature of these objects is their high degree of polarisation

this contribution, we test if state-of-the-art high resolution cosmological

Therefore, we present a new analysis of high-resolution cosmological

create mock radio observations of the diffuse polarised emission from a massive

the effect of Faraday rotation, it is extremely difficult to relate the
morphology of the polarised emission for observing frequencies below $1.4 \
\mathrm{GHz}$ to the real magnetic field structure in relics. We can reproduce
the observed degree of polarisation and also several small-scale structures
observed in real radio relics, but further work would be needed to reproduce

environments is a critical capability for autonomous systems. This generally
involves the prediction and understanding of motion patterns of dynamic
entities, such as vehicles and people, in the surroundings. Many motion
prediction methods in the literature can learn a function, mapping position and
time to potential trajectories taken by people or other dynamic entities.
However, these predictions depend only on previously observed trajectories, and
do not explicitly take into consideration the environment. Trends of motion
obtained in one environment are typically specific to that environment, and are
not used to better predict motion in other environments. In this paper, we
address the problem of generating likely motion dynamics conditioned on the
environment, represented as an occupancy map. We introduce the Occupancy
Conditional Trajectory Network (OCTNet) framework, capable of generalising the
previously observed motion in known environments, to generate trajectories in
new environments where no observations of motion has not been observed. OCTNet
encodes trajectories as a fixed-sized vector of parameters and utilises neural
networks to learn conditional distributions over parameters. We empirically
demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex multi-modal trajectory
patterns in different environments.

well described. To unveil the biological and ecological factors promoting the
emergence and stability of cooperative traits we take an interdisciplinary
perspective and review insights gained from both mathematical models and
well-controlled experimental model systems. Ecologically, we include crucial
aspects of the microbial life cycle into our analysis and particularly consider
population structures where an ensemble of local communities (sub populations)
continuously emerge, grow, and disappear again. Biologically, we explicitly
consider the synthesis and regulation of public good production. The discussion
of the theoretical approaches includes general evolutionary concepts,
population dynamics, and evolutionary game theory. As a specific but generic
biological example we consider populations of Pseudomonas putida and its
regulation and utilization of pyoverdines, iron scavenging molecules. The
review closes with an overview on cooperation in spatially extended systems and
also provides a critical assessment of the insights gained from the
experimental and theoretical studies discussed. Current challenges and
important new research opportunities are discussed, including the biochemical
regulation of public goods, more realistic ecological scenarios resembling
native environments, cell to cell signalling, and multi-species communities.

restricted settings. Our approach is designed with the following goals in mind:
(a) Improving accuracy in restricted domains; (b) preventing overfitting to new
domains and forgetting of generalized capabilities; (c) aggressive model
compression and acceleration. To this end, we propose a novel loss that
balances compression and acceleration of a deep learning model vs. loss of
generalization capabilities. We apply our method to the existing tracker and
detector models. We report detection results on the VIRAT and CAVIAR data sets.
These results show our method to offer unprecedented compression rates along
with improved detection. We apply our loss for tracker compression at test
time, as it processes each video. Our tests on the OTB2015 benchmark show that
applying compression during test time actually improves tracking performance.

observed in cool spectral lines and appearing in warm spectral lines. A
proposed mechanism to explain this evolution is that the threads were heated by
turbulence driven by the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability that developed as a
result of wave-driven shear flows on the surface of the thread. As the
Kelvin--Helmholtz instability is an instability that works to mix the fluids,
in the solar corona it can be expected to work by mixing the cool prominence
material with that of the hot corona to form a warm boundary layer. In this
paper we develop a simple phenomenological model of nonlinear Kelvin--Helmholtz
mixing, using it to determine the characteristic density and temperature of the
mixing layer, which for the case under study with constant pressure across the
two fluids are $\rho_{\rm mixed}=\sqrt{\rho_1\rho_2}$ and $T_{\rm
mixed}=\sqrt{T_1T_2}$. One result from the model is that it provides an
accurate, as determined by comparison with simulation results, determination of
the kinetic energy in the mean velocity field. A consequence of this is that
the magnitude of turbulence, and with it the energy that can be dissipated on
fast time-scales, as driven by this instability can be determined. For the
prominence-corona system, the mean temperature rise possible from turbulent
heating is estimated to be less than 1\% of the characteristic temperature
(which is found to be $10^5$\,K). These results highlight that mixing, and not
heating, are likely to be the cause of the observed transition between cool to
warm material in Okamoto et. al (2015). One consequence of this result is that
the mixing creates a region with higher radiative loss rates on average than
either of the original fluids, meaning that this instability could contribute a
net loss of thermal energy from the corona, i.e. coronal cooling.

composed of the equations for the evolution of both width and phase of magnetic
island due to forced reconnection driven by the external magnetic perturbation,
and the force-balance equation for the plasma flow. When the island width is
much less than the resistive layer width, the island growth is governed by the
linear Hahm-Kulsrud-Taylor solution in presence of time-dependent plasma flow.
In the other regime when the island width is much larger than the resistive
layer width, the evolution of both island width and phase can be described
using the Rutherford theory. The island solution is used to construct the
quasi-linear electromagnetic force, which together with viscous one,
contributes to the nonlinear variation in plasma flow. The no-slip condition
assumed in the conventional error field theory is not imposed here, where the
island oscillation frequency depends on but does not necessarily equal to the
plasma flow frequency at the rational surface.

phase transition (SFOPT) in the early Universe that leads to observable
gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we propose a novel method for
presenting and comparing the GW signals that are predicted by different models.
Our approach is based on the observation that the GW signal has an
approximately model-independent spectral shape. This allows us to represent it
solely in terms of a finite number of observables, that is, a set of peak
amplitudes and peak frequencies. As an example, we consider the GW signal in
the real-scalar-singlet extension of the Standard Model (xSM). We construct the
signal region of the xSM in the space of observables and show how it will be
probed by future space-borne interferometers. Our analysis results in
sensitivity plots that are reminiscent of similar plots that are typically
shown for dark-matter direct-detection experiments, but which are novel in the
context of GWs from a SFOPT. These plots set the stage for a systematic model
comparison, the exploration of underlying model-parameter dependencies, and the
construction of distribution functions in the space of observables. In our
plots, the experimental sensitivities of future searches for a stochastic GW
signal are indicated by peak-integrated sensitivity curves. A detailed
discussion of these curves, including fit functions, is contained in a

Here, we study this type of resonance in the overdamped and underdamped

is the conjugate phenomenon: the oscillations caused by the time-delay may be
enhanced by means of the forcing without modifying their frequency. The
resonance takes place when the frequency of the oscillations induced by the
time-delay matches the ones caused by the forcing and vice versa. This is an
interesting result as the nature of both perturbations is different. Even for
the parameters for which the time-delay does not induce sustained oscillations,
we show that a resonance may appear following a different mechanism.

heterogeneities on the appearance of non-Gaussianity in Fickian diffusion. We
study the diffusion of fluorescent colloidal particles in a matrix of
micropillars having a range of structural configurations: from completely
ordered to completely random. We show that non-Gaussianity emerges as a direct
consequence of two coupled factors; individual particle diffusivities become
spatially dependent in a heterogeneous randomly structured environment, and the
spatial distribution of the particles varies significantly in such
environments, further influencing the diffusivity of a single particle. The
coupled mechanisms lead to a considerable non-Gaussian nature even due to weak
disorder in the arrangement of the micropillars. A simple mathematical model
validates our hypothesis that non-Gaussian yet Fickian diffusion in our system
arises from the superstatistical behavior of the ensemble in a structurally
heterogeneous environment. The two mechanisms identified here are relevant for
many systems of crowded heterogeneous environments where non-Gaussian diffusion
is frequently observed, for example in biological systems, polymers, gels and

of the PWN HESS J1825-137 from 1 GeV to 1 TeV. This PWN is an archetypal system
making it a perfect laboratory for studying particle transport mechanisms.
Combining this analysis with recent H.E.S.S. results enables a more complete

research has been done on techniques for watermarking relational databases and

some classes of relational structures preserving first-order and monadic second
order queries. For relational structures whose Gaifman graphs have bounded
degree, watermarking can be done preserving first-order queries.
  We extend this line of work and study watermarking schemes for other classes
of structures. We prove that for relational structures whose Gaifman graphs
belong to a class of graphs that have locally bounded tree-width and is closed
under minors, watermarking schemes exist that preserve first-order queries. We
use previously known properties of logical formulas and graphs, and build on
them with some technical work to make them work in our context. This

cells involve morphological evaluation based on cell staining, designed to

in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time consuming
or expensive to implement. Here, we present a new deep-learning approach,
called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired
without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images.
We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a
well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the
morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the
other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in
vitro fertilization (IVF). We use deep convolutional Generative Adversarial
Networks (DCGANs) with training that is based on both the quantitative phase
images and two gradient phase images, all extracted from the digital holograms
of the stain-free cells, with the ground truth of bright-field images of the
same cells that subsequently underwent chemical staining. To validate the
quality of our virtual staining approach, an experienced embryologist analyzed
the unstained cells, the virtually stained cells, and the chemically stained
sperm cells several times in a blinded and randomized manner. We obtained a
5-fold recall (sensitivity) improvement in the analysis results. With the
introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical settings, the
proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF
procedures, as well as to significantly simplify and facilitate other cell
analyses and techniques such as imaging flow cytometry.

strongly stratified fluid at low Reynolds numbers. A particular emphasis of the
present study is given to the understanding of the low-Froude-number mode
observed by the recent experiment (Meunier, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 699, 2012, pp.
174-197). In the limit of low Froude number, the linearised equations of motion
can be reduced to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation on the horizontal plane, except
the viscous term that contains vertical dissipation. Based on this equation, it
is proposed that the low-Froude-number mode would be a horizontal inflectional
instability, and should remain two dimensional at small tilting angles. To
support this claim, the asymptotic regime where this equation would be strictly
valid is subsequently discussed in relation to previous arguments on the proper
vertical length scale. Furthermore, the absolute and convective instability
analysis of parallel wake is performed, revealing qualitatively good agreement
with the experimental result. The low-Froude-number mode is found to be
stabilised on increasing Froude number, as is in the experiment. The emergence
of small vertical velocity at finite Froude number, the size of which is
proportional to the square of Froude number, plays the key role in the
stabilisation. It modifies the inflectional instability and is also associated
with the paradoxically stabilising buoyancy on increasing Froude number.
Lastly, we proposed some possible behaviours of the base flow when the tilting
angle changes, and they may provide a better approximation to produce the
behaviour consistent with the experiment.

properties that make the design of effective classification systems difficult.
For instance, the number of classes encountered in practical settings is
potentially very large, and classes can be ambiguous or overlap. In addition,
the choice of taxonomy often differs between researchers and between
institutions. Although high accuracy has been achieved in benchmarks using
standard classifier architectures, biases caused by an inflexible
classification scheme can have profound effects when the output is used in
ecosystem assessments and monitoring.
  Here, we propose using a deep convolutional network to construct a vector
embedding of zooplankton images. The system maps (embeds) each image into a
high-dimensional Euclidean space so that distances between vectors reflect
semantic relationships between images. We show that the embedding can be used
to derive classifications with comparable accuracy to a specific classifier,
but that it simultaneously reveals important structures in the data.
Furthermore, we apply the embedding to new classes previously unseen by the
system, and evaluate its classification performance in such cases.
  Traditional neural network classifiers perform well when the classes are
clearly defined a priori and have sufficiently large labeled data sets

is not the case, and we argue that the vector embedding method presented here

quantum vortex, which is surprisingly in contrast to the result for an
inter-flux vortex. Related to this result, there are singular excitation modes
that have opposite angular momenta, moving in the opposite direction around the
core of the vortex. The topological index (skyrmion number) for a
fractional-flux quantum vortex becomes fractional since the topological index
is divided into two parts where one from the vortex (bulk) and the other from

This shows an interesting analogy between this result and the index theorem for

Hot Cores (SHCs) in the inner $160$ pc of NGC\,253. Our LTE and non-LTE
modelling of the HC$_3$N$^*$ emission indicate that SHCs have dust temperatures
of $200-375$ K, relatively high H$_2$ densities of $1-6\times 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$
and high IR luminosities of $0.1-1\times 10^8$ L$_\odot$. As expected from
their short lived phase ($\sim 10^4$ yr), all SHCs are associated with young
Super Star Clusters (SSCs). We use the ratio of luminosities form the SHCs
(protostar phase) and from the free-free emission (ZAMS star phase), to
establish the evolutionary stage of the SSCs. The youngest SSCs, with the
larges ratios, have ages of a few $10^4$ yr (proto-SSCs) and the more evolved
SSCs are likely between $10^5$ and $10^6$ yr (ZAMS-SSCs). The different
evolutionary stages of the SSCs are also supported by the radiative feedback
from the UV radiation as traced by the HNCO/CS ratio, with this ratio being
systematically higher in the young proto-SSCs than in the older ZAMS-SSCs. We
also estimate the SFR and the SFE of the SSCs. The trend found in the estimated
SFE ($\sim40\%$ for proto-SSCs and $>85\%$ for ZAMS-SSCs) and in the gas mass
reservoir available for star formation, one order of magnitude higher for
proto-SSCs, suggests that star formation is still going on in proto-SSCs. We
also find that the most evolved SSCs are located, in projection, closer to the
center of the galaxy than the younger proto-SSCs, indicating an inside-out SSC
formation scenario.

Past work used attention and rationale mechanisms to find words that predict
the target variable of a document. Often though, they result in a tradeoff
between noisy explanations or a drop in accuracy. Furthermore, rationale
methods cannot capture the multi-faceted nature of justifications for multiple
targets, because of the non-probabilistic nature of the mask. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Target Masker (MTM) to address these shortcomings. The
novelty lies in the soft multi-dimensional mask that models a relevance
probability distribution over the set of target variables to handle
ambiguities. Additionally, two regularizers guide MTM to induce long,
meaningful explanations. We evaluate MTM on two datasets and show, using
standard metrics and human annotations, that the resulting masks are more
accurate and coherent than those generated by the state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, MTM is the first to also achieve the highest F1 scores for all the
target variables simultaneously.

estimate mutual information (MI) between each hidden layer and the
input/desired output, to construct the IP. For instance, hidden layers with
many neurons require MI estimators with robustness towards the high
dimensionality associated with such layers. MI estimators should also be able
to naturally handle convolutional layers, while at the same time being
computationally tractable to scale to large networks. None of the existing IP
methods to date have been able to study truly deep Convolutional Neural

kernels over convolutional layers, leveraging the power of kernel methods to
represent properties of the probability distribution independently of the

well layer and a spin echo decay time $T_2^{\text{echo}}=128\,\mu$s. The power
spectral density (PSD) of the charge noise explains both the observed
transition of a $1/f^2$- to a $1/f$-dependence of the detuning noise PSD as
well as the observation of a decreasing time-ensemble spin dephasing time from

Despite their strong hyperfine contact interaction, the few $^{73}$Ge nuclei
overlapping with the quantum dot in the barrier do not limit $T_2^*$, as their

exists no silver-bullet countermeasure. To raise the bar, a wide range of
protection measures were proposed in the literature each of which adds
resilience against certain attacks on certain digital assets of a program.
Intuitively, composing a set of protections (rather than applying just one of
them) can mitigate a wider range of attacks and hence offer a higher level of
security. Despite the potential benefits, very limited research has been done
on the composition of protections. Naive compositions could lead to conflicts
which, in turn, limit the application of protections, raise false alarms, and
worse yet, yield corrupted binaries. More importantly, inadequate compositions
of such protections are not tailored for the program at hand and thus the
offered security and performance are sub-optimal. In this paper, we first lay
out a set of generic constraints for a conflict-free composition of
protections. Then, we develop a composition framework based on a defense graph
in which nodes and edges capture protections, their relations, and constraints.
The conflicts problem together with optimization requirements are then
translated into a set of integer constraints. We then use Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) to handle conflicts while optimizing for a higher security
and lower overhead. To measure the overhead, we use a set of real-world
programs (MiBench dataset and open source games). Our evaluation results
indicate that our composition framework reduces the overhead by $\approx$ 39%
while maximizing the coverage. Moreover, our approach yields a 5-fold decrease

program segments (code) in memory hash to known values at runtime. SC has few
restrictions on application and hence can protect a vast majority of programs.
The code verification in SC requires computation of the expected hashes after
compilation, as the machine-code is not known before. This means the expected
hash values need to be adjusted in the binary executable, hence combining SC
with other protections is limited due to this adjustment step. However,
obfuscation protections are often necessary, as SC protections can be otherwise
easily detected and disabled via pattern matching. In this paper, we present a
layered protection using virtualization obfuscation, yielding an
architecture-agnostic SC protection that requires no post-compilation
adjustment. We evaluate the performance of our scheme using a dataset of 25
real-world programs (MiBench and 3 CLI games). Our results show that the SC
scheme induces an average overhead of 43% for a complete protection (100%
coverage). The overhead is tolerable for less CPU-intensive programs (e.g.
games) and when only parts of programs (e.g. license checking) are protected.

amounts of spatio-temporal data in a continuous way. Therefore, detecting
significant places and the frequency of movements between them is fundamental
to understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for
discovering user habits without any a priori or external knowledge by
introducing a density-based clustering for spatio-temporal data to identify
meaningful places and by applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) over the set
of meaningful places to identify the representations of individual habits. To
evaluate the proposed method we use two real-world datasets. One dataset
contains high-density GPS data and the other one contains GSM mobile phone data
in a coarse representation. The results show that the proposed method is
suitable for this task as many unique habits were identified. This can be used
for understanding users' behavior and to draw their characterizing profiles
having a panorama of the mobility patterns from the data.

Likewise, the invasion front of tumors has been investigated, from which

develop a model to study how tumors' invasion front depends on the relevant
properties of a cellular environment. To do so, we develop a model based on a
nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov
(FKPP) equation, to model tumor growth. Our study aims to understand how
heterogeneity in the cellular environment's stiffness, as well as spatial
correlations in its morphology, the existence of both of which has been
demonstrated by experiments, affects the properties of tumor invasion front. It
is demonstrated that three important factors affect the properties of the
front, namely, the spatial distribution of the local diffusion coefficients,
the spatial correlations between them, and the ratio of the cells' duplication
rate and their average diffusion coefficient. Analyzing the scaling properties
of tumor invasion front computed by solving the governing equation, we show
that, contrary to several previous claims, the invasion front of tumors and
cancerous cell colonies cannot be described by the well-known models of kinetic
growth, such as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as

  Image-Text Matching","Accepted by ACMMM2019",,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning semantic correspondence between image and text is significant as it
bridges the semantic gap between vision and language. The key challenge is to
accurately find and correlate shared semantics in image and text. Most existing
methods achieve this goal by representing the shared semantic as a weighted
combination of all the fragments (image regions or text words), where fragments
relevant to the shared semantic obtain more attention, otherwise less. However,
despite relevant ones contribute more to the shared semantic, irrelevant ones
will more or less disturb it, and thus will lead to semantic misalignment in
the correlation phase. To address this issue, we present a novel Bidirectional
Focal Attention Network (BFAN), which not only allows to attend to relevant
fragments but also diverts all the attention into these relevant fragments to
concentrate on them. The main difference with existing works is they mostly
focus on learning attention weight while our BFAN focus on eliminating
irrelevant fragments from the shared semantic. The focal attention is achieved
by pre-assigning attention based on inter-modality relation, identifying
relevant fragments based on intra-modality relation and reassigning attention.
Furthermore, the focal attention is jointly applied in both image-to-text and
text-to-image directions, which enables to avoid preference to long text or
complex image. Experiments show our simple but effective framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with relative Recall@1 gains of
2.2% on both Flicr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks.

(P.E.) to 4000 P.E. are required for the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA),
which is one of the key components in the Large High Altitude Air Shower
Observatory (LHAASO). To simplify the circuit structure of the readout
electronics, a front end ASIC was designed. Based on the charge-to-time
conversion method, the output pulse width of the ASIC corresponds to the input
signal charge information while time information of the input signal is picked
off through a discriminator, and thus the time and charge information can be
digitized simultaneously using this ASIC and a following Time-to-Digital
Converter (TDC). To address the challenge of mismatch among the channels
observed in the previous prototype version, this work presents approaches for
analyzing the problem and optimizing the circuits. A new version of the ASIC
was designed and fabricated in the GLOBALFOUNDRIES 0.35 um CMOS technology,
which integrates 6 channels (corresponding to the readout of the 3 PMTs) in
each chip. The test results indicate that the mismatch between the channels is
significantly reduced to less than 20% using the proposed approach. The time
measurement resolution better than 300 ps is achieved, and the charge
measurement resolution is better than 10% at 1 P.E., and 1% at 4000 P.E., which
meets the application requirements.

suggests that the scattering of unpolarized electrons and photons with nearly
equal energy of the order of MeV at cross-channel can create entangled pair of
up-spin electron and RCP photon or down-spin electron and LCP photon. The
entanglement is quite strong exhibiting jump-concurrence for particular
directions of scattering however not limited by the Kapitza-Dirac restriction.
Such strong electron-photon entanglement is observed to be highly selective
along the directions of scattering on the surface of two opposite cones at 45
degree around the electron-detector axis and on the plane perpendicular to it,
the latter one exhibiting maximal entanglement. The work predicts that
spin-polarization entangled electron-photon pairs are highly possible to be
found in practical experiments of high-energy Compton scattering with specific
directional selectivity.

over an individual's lifetime and must deal robustly with the finite lifespan
of cells or with connection failure - rendering aging a relevant feature in
this context. How do computations degrade over an organism's lifespan? How
reliable can computations remain throughout? In order to answer these
questions, here we approach the problem under a multiobjective (Pareto)
optimization approach. We consider a population of digital organisms equipped
with a neural network that must solve a given computational task reliably. We
demand that they remain functional (as reliable as possible) for an extended
lifespan. Neural connections are costly (as an associated metabolism in living
beings) and degrade over time. They can also be regenerated at some expense. We
investigate the simultaneous minimization of the metabolic burden (due to
connections and regeneration costs) and the computational error and the
tradeoffs emerging thereof. We show that Pareto optimal designs display a broad
range of potential solutions: from small networks with high regeneration rate,
to larger and redundant circuits that regenerate slowly. The organism's
lifespan and the external damage rates are found to act as an evolutionary
pressure that improve the exploration of the space of solutions and poses
tighter optimality conditions. We also find that large damage rates to the
circuits can constrain the space of the possible and pose organisms to commit
to unique strategies for neural systems maintenance.

playing an important and rapidly growing role in today's multi-frequency and
multi-messenger astrophysics. In the past several years, blazars have been
discovered in relatively large numbers in radio, microwave, X-ray and gamma-ray
surveys, and more recently have been associated to high-energy astrophysical
neutrinos and possibly to ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Blazars are expected
to dominate the high-energy extragalactic sky that will soon be surveyed by the
new generation of very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories such as CTA. In
parallel to the discovery of many blazars at all frequencies, the technological
evolution, together with the increasing adoption of open data policies is
causing and exponential growth of astronomical data that is freely available
through the network of Virtual Observatories (VO) and the web in general,
providing an unprecedented potential for multi-wavelength and multi-messenger
data analysis. We present VOU-Blazars, a tool developed within the OU,
initiative that has been designed to facilitate the discovery of blazars and
build their spectral energy distributions (SED) using multi-wavelength
photometric and spectral data that are available from public archives, or that
have been generated as part of the OU, initiative and are accessible through VO
services. VOU-Blazars implements a heuristic approach based on the well known
SED that differentiate blazars from other astronomical sources. The VOU-Blazars
outputs are flux tables, bibliographic references, sky plots and SEDs.
VOU-Blazars has been extensively tested during the selection of new high-energy
peaked (HSP) blazars recently published in the 3HSP catalog, and has been used
to search for blazar counterparts of Fermi 3FHL, Fermi 4FGL, AGILE sources, and
of IceCube astrophysical neutrinos.

Estimating a driver's drowsiness level by monitoring the electroencephalogram
(EEG) signal and taking preventative actions accordingly may improve driving
safety. However, individual differences among different drivers make this task
very challenging. A calibration session is usually required to collect some
subject-specific data and tune the model parameters before applying it to a new
subject, which is very inconvenient and not user-friendly. Many approaches have
been proposed to reduce the calibration effort, but few can completely
eliminate it. This paper proposes a novel approach, feature weighted episodic
training (FWET), to completely eliminate the calibration requirement. It
integrates two techniques: feature weighting to learn the importance of
different features, and episodic training for domain generalization.
Experiments on EEG-based driver drowsiness estimation demonstrated that both
feature weighting and episodic training are effective, and their integration
can further improve the generalization performance. FWET does not need any
labelled or unlabelled calibration data from the new subject, and hence could
be very useful in plug-and-play brain-computer interfaces.

presented with the key property that it exhibits non-linearly stability,
independent of the mesh (of the full order model), the time step, the
viscosity, and the number of modes. The two essential elements to non-linear
stability are: (1) first discretise the full order model, and then project the
discretised equations, and (2) use spatial and temporal discretisation schemes
for the full order model that are globally energy-conserving (in the limit of
vanishing viscosity). For this purpose, as full order model a staggered-grid
finite volume method in conjunction with an implicit Runge-Kutta method is
employed. In addition, a constrained singular value decomposition is employed
which enforces global momentum conservation. The resulting `velocity-only' ROM
is thus globally conserving mass, momentum and kinetic energy. For
non-homogeneous boundary conditions, a (one-time) Poisson equation is solved
that accounts for the boundary contribution. The stability of the proposed ROM
is demonstrated in several test cases. Furthermore, it is shown that explicit
Runge-Kutta methods can be used as a practical alternative to implicit time
integration at a slight loss in energy conservation.

gravity is Weyl invariance in its stochastic (d+1)-dimensional bulk.
Observables are defined as depending only on conformal classes of d-dimensional
metrics. We work with the second order stochastic quantization of Einstein
equations in a (d+1)-dimensional bulk. There, the evolution is governed by the
stochastic time, which foliates the bulk into Euclidean d-dimensional leaves.
The internal metric of each leaf can be parametrized by its unimodular part and
conformal factor. Additional bulk metric components are the ADM stochastic
lapse and a stochastic shift. The Langevin equation determines the acceleration
of the leaf as the sum of a quantum noise, a drift force proportional to
Einstein equations and a viscous first order force. Using Weyl covariant
decomposition, this Langevin equation splits into irreducible stochastic
equations, one for the unimodular part of the metric and one for its conformal
factor. For the first order Langevin equation, the unphysical fields are the
conformal factor, which is a classical spectator, and the stochastic lapse and
shift. These fields can be gauge-fixed in a BRST invariant way in function of
the initial data of the process. One gets observables that are covariant with
respect to internal reparametrization in each leaf, and invariant under
arbitrary reparametrization of the stochastic time. The interpretation of
physical observable at finite stochastic time is encoded in a transitory
(d+1)-dimensional phase where the Lorentz time cannot be defined. The latter
emerges in the infinite stochastic time limit by an abrupt phase transition
from quantum to classical gravity.

prevent this, which we evaluated while training and re-training a CNN to
segment glioma on two different datasets. The network was trained on the public

Inspired by quantization-aware training approaches, we propose a
compression-aware training (CAT) method that involves training the model in a

trains the model to achieve low-entropy feature maps, which enables efficient
compression at inference time using classical transform coding methods. CAT
significantly improves the state-of-the-art results reported for quantization.

of the genome under selection versus those evolving in a neutral manner.
Correct identification allows accurate inference of the evolutionary process

phenotypic change and adaptation. A fundamental difficulty lies in
distinguishing sites targeted by selection from both sites linked to these
targets and sites fully independent of selection. These three categories of
sites necessitate attention in light of the debate over the relative importance
of selection versus neutrality and the neutral theory. Modern genomic insights
have proved that complex processes such as linkage, demography, and biased gene
conversion complicate our understanding of the role of neutral versus selective
processes in evolution. In this perspective, we first highlight the importance
of the genomic and (a)biotic context of new mutations to identify the targets
of natural selection. We then present mechanisms that may constrain the
evolution of genomes and bias the inference of selection. We discuss these
mechanisms within the two critical levels that they occur: the population level
and the molecular level. We highlight that they should be taken into account to
correctly distinguish sites across the genome subject to selective or
non-selective forces and stress that a major current field-wide goal is to
quantify the absolute importance of these mechanisms.

observational samples. Its core-excised X-ray luminosity is low for its mass
M500, well below the mean relation for an X-ray selected sample, but only ~1.5
sigma below that derived for an X-ray unbiased sample. We derived thermodynamic
profiles and hydrostatic masses with the acquired deep Swift X-ray data, and we
used archival Einstein, Planck, and SDSS data to derive additional
measurements, such as integrated Compton parameter, total mass, and stellar
mass. The pressure and the electron density profiles of CL2015 are
systematically outside the +/- 2 sigma range of the universal profiles; in
particular the electron density profile is even lower than the one derived from
Planck-selected clusters. CL2015 also turns out to be fairly different in the
X-ray luminosity versus integrated pressure scaling compared to an X-ray
selected sample, but it is a normal object in terms of stellar mass fraction.
CL2015's hydrostatic mass profile, by itself or when is considered together
with dynamical masses, shows that the cluster has an unusual low concentration
and an unusual sparsity compared to clusters in X-ray selected samples. The
different behavior of CL2015 is caused by its low concentration. When
concentration differences are accounted for, the properties of CL2015 become
consistent with comparison samples. CL2015 is perhaps the first known cluster
with a remarkably low mass concentration for which high quality X-ray data
exist. Objects similar to CL2015 fail to enter observational X-ray selected
samples because of their low X-ray luminosity relative to their mass.

extending this pipeline to determine the terminal mass estimate of a meteoroid
is a complex next step. Established methods typically require assumptions to be
made of the physical meteoroid characteristics (such as shape and bulk
density). To determine which meteoroids may have survived entry there are
empirical criteria that use a fireball's final height and velocity - low and
slow final parameters are likely the best candidates. We review the more
elegant approach of the dimensionless coefficient method. Two parameters,
$\alpha$ (ballistic coefficient) and $\beta$ (mass-loss), can be calculated for
any event with some degree of deceleration, given only velocity and height
information. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be used to analytically describe a
trajectory with the advantage that they are not mere fitting coefficients; they
also represent the physical meteoroid properties. This approach can be applied
to any fireball network as an initial identification of key events and
determine on which to concentrate resources for more in depth analyses. We used
a set of 278 events observed by the Desert Fireball Network to show how

intricate correlations. Yet, most theoretical work on neural networks does not
explicitly model training data, or assumes that elements of each data sample
are drawn independently from some factorised probability distribution. These
approaches are thus by construction blind to the correlation structure of
real-world data sets and their impact on learning in neural networks. Here, we
introduce a generative model for structured data sets that we call the hidden

captured by a set of integro-differential equations that track the performance
of the network at all times. This permits us to analyse in detail how a neural

  Language Model based on Statement Embedding Generated by BiLSTM","The experimental data is not complete and has some error!",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Language models such as RNN, LSTM or other variants have been widely used as
generative models in natural language processing. In last few years, taking
source code as natural languages, parsing source code into a token sequence and
using a language model such as LSTM to train that sequence are state-of-art
methods to get a generative model for solving the problem of code completion.
However, for source code with hundreds of statements, traditional LSTM model or
attention-based LSTM model failed to capture the long term dependency of source
code. In this paper, we propose a novel statement-level language model (SLM)
which uses BiLSTM to generate the embedding for each statement. The standard
LSTM is adopted in SLM to iterate and accumulate the embedding of each
statement in context to help predict next code. The statement level attention
mechanism is also adopted in the model. The proposed model SLM is aimed at
token level code completion. The experiments on inner-project and cross-project
data sets indicate that the newly proposed statement-level language model with
attention mechanism (SLM) outperforms all other state-of-art models in token

available for diagnosis. Yet, the number and quality of contrasts is limited in
practice by various factors including scan time and patient motion. Synthesis
of missing or corrupted contrasts can alleviate this limitation to improve
clinical utility. Common approaches for multi-contrast MRI involve either
one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis methods. One-to-one methods take as input
a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to
unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple
distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive
to common features across sources. For enhanced image synthesis, here we
propose a multi-stream approach that aggregates information across multiple
source images via a mixture of multiple one-to-one streams and a joint
many-to-one stream. The shared feature maps generated in the many-to-one stream
and the complementary feature maps generated in the one-to-one streams are
combined with a fusion block. The location of the fusion block is adaptively
modified to maximize task-specific performance. Qualitative and quantitative
assessments on T1-, T2-, PD-weighted and FLAIR images clearly demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to previous
state-of-the-art one-to-one and many-to-one methods.

induced by the contact vector fields are used to construct various maps among
thermodynamic quantities. Thermodynamic variables and equations of state of
Schwarzschild black holes are mapped to that of Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black
holes in AdS, with charge as the deformation parameter. In addition, the
equations of state of general black holes in AdS are shown to emerge from the
high-temperature ideal gas limit equations via suitable deformations induced by

set up, and the corresponding characteristic curves of contact vector fields

mixups the input with other random clean samples, which can shrink and transfer

  entropy",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding the inductive bias of neural networks is critical to explaining
their ability to generalise. Here, for one of the simplest neural networks -- a
single-layer perceptron with n input neurons, one output neuron, and no
threshold bias term -- we prove that upon random initialisation of weights, the
a priori probability $P(t)$ that it represents a Boolean function that
classifies t points in ${0,1}^n$ as 1 has a remarkably simple form: $P(t) =
2^{-n}$ for $0\leq t < 2^n$.
  Since a perceptron can express far fewer Boolean functions with small or
large values of t (low entropy) than with intermediate values of t (high
entropy) there is, on average, a strong intrinsic a-priori bias towards
individual functions with low entropy. Furthermore, within a class of functions
with fixed t, we often observe a further intrinsic bias towards functions of
lower complexity. Finally, we prove that, regardless of the distribution of
inputs, the bias towards low entropy becomes monotonically stronger upon adding

We tackle the domain adaptation problem on two levels: 1) the image-level

implemented as domain classifiers with adversarial training. We evaluate our

vector field determined by its values at the earth's surface. The direction
problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields vanishing at infinity and
with prescribed direction of the field vector at the surface. In general this
type of data does neither guarantee existence nor uniqueness of solutions of
the corresponding nonlinear boundary value problem. To determine conditions for
existence, to specify the non-uniqueness, and to identify cases of uniqueness
is of particular interest when modeling the earth's (or any other celestial

  Here we consider the case of {\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields $\BB$ outside
the sphere $S^2 \subset \real^3$. We introduce a rotation number $\ro \in
\ints$ along a meridian of $S^2$ for any axisymmetric H\""older continuous
direction field $\DD \neq 0$ on $S^2$ and, moreover, the (exact) decay order $3

Fixing a meridional plane and in this plane $\ro - \de +1 \geq 0$ points $z_n$
(symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis and with $|z_n| > 1$, $n =

decay order $\de$ at infinity, and with direction $\DD$ at $S^2$. The proof is
based on the global solution of a nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem,

devised. It is proved that the SCF iteration is globally convergent to a KKT

of fundamental physics. However, finding them can be challenging. Several
subdwarf B (sdB) binary systems with possible neutron star companions have been
identified, allowing us to perform a targeted search for MSPs within these
systems. Six sdBs with companions in the neutron star mass range, as determined
from their optical light curves, were observed with the Green Bank and
Westerbork radio telescopes. The data were searched for periodic signals as
well as single pulses. No radio pulsations from sdB systems were detected, down
to an average sensitivity limit of 0.11 mJy. We did, however, discover a pulsar
in the field of sdB HE0532-4503. Follow-up observations with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope showed that this pulsar, J0533-4524, is not spatially
coincident with the sdB system. The pulsar has a relatively low magnetic field
but still emits giant pulses. We place an upper limit of three to the number of
radio pulsars in the six sdB systems. The non-detections may be explained by a
combination of the MSP beaming fraction, luminosity, and a recycling fraction
<0.5. Alternatively, the assumption of co-rotation between the MSP and sdB may
break down, which implies the systems are more edge-on than previously thought.
This would shift the predicted companion masses into the white dwarf range. It
would also explain the relative lack of edge-on sdB systems with massive
companions.

most direct way to address this issue. By considering bandwidth extension as a
regression problem in machine learning, we propose an architecture of
convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extrapolate the missing low
frequencies without preprocessing and post-processing steps. The bandlimited
recordings are the inputs of the CNN and, in our numerical experiments, a
neural network trained from enough samples can predict a reasonable
approximation to the seismograms in the unobserved low frequency band, both in
phase and in amplitude. The numerical experiments considered are set up on
simulated P-wave data. In extrapolated FWI (EFWI), the low-wavenumber
components of the model are determined from the extrapolated low frequencies,
before proceeding with a frequency sweep of the bandlimited data. The proposed
deep-learning method of low-frequency extrapolation shows adequate
generalizability for the initialization step of EFWI. Numerical examples show
that the neural network trained on several submodels of the Marmousi model is
able to predict the low frequencies for the BP 2004 benchmark model.
Additionally, the neural network can robustly process seismic data with
uncertainties due to the existence of noise, poorly-known source wavelet, and
different finite-difference scheme in the forward modeling operator. Finally,
this approach is not subject to the structural limitations of other methods for
bandwidth extension, and seems to offer a tantalizing solution to the problem

massive fermions during inflation. The size of the fermionic backreaction and
the density fraction of dark fermions put upper bounds on the fermion's mass.

coupled to the visible sector, can be as heavy as $m\lesssim 10 TeV$.

represent uniformly distributed clients. The $n$ players of the game are
servers who need to place themselves on the line segment, and once this is
done, each client gets served by the player closest to it. The goal of each
player is to choose its location so as to maximize the number of clients it
attracts.
  In this paper we study a variant of the Hotelling game where each client $v$
has a tolerance interval, randomly distributed according to some density
function $f$, and $v$ gets served by the nearest among the players eligible for
it, namely, those that fall within its interval. (If no such player exists,
then $v$ abstains.) It turns out that this modification significantly changes
the behavior of the game and its states of equilibria. In particular, it may
serve to explain why players sometimes prefer to ""spread out"", rather than to
cluster together as dictated by the classical Hotelling game.
  We consider two variants of the game: symmetric games, where clients have the
same tolerance range to their left and right, and asymmetric games, where the
left and right ranges of each client are determined independently of each
other. We fully characterize the Nash equilibria of the 2-player game. For at
least 3 players, we characterize a specific class of strategy profiles,
referred to as canonical profiles, and show that these profiles are the only
ones that may yield Nash equilibria in our game. Moreover, the canonical
profile, if exists, is uniquely defined for every $n$ and $f$. In both the
symmetric and asymmetric setting, we give necessary and sufficient conditions
for the canonical profile to be a Nash equilibrium, and demonstrate their
application for several distributions.

not located far from the ecliptic, many asteroids will cross occasionally the

focuses on detecting already known asteroids using the Virtual Observatory tool
SkyBoT, which predicts their positions and motions in the sky at a specific

distinct variations of cycleGAN architecture can be derived: for example, one
with two pairs of generators and discriminators, and the other with only a
single pair of generator and discriminator. Even for the two generator cases,
we show that the structural knowledge of the forward operator can lead to a
simpler generator architecture which significantly simplifies the neural

WiderPerson for dense pedestrian detection in the wild. This dataset involves
five types of annotations in a wide range of scenarios, no longer limited to
the traffic scenario. There are a total of $13,382$ images with $399,786$

contains dense pedestrians with various kinds of occlusions. Hence, pedestrians
in the proposed dataset are extremely challenging due to large variations in

scheme for AWGN channels under the constraint of one-bit quantization in the
receivers. Specifically, it is first shown that the optimum error correction
code that minimizes the probability of bit error can be obtained by perfectly
training a special autoencoder, in which ""perfectly"" refers to converging the
global minima. However, perfect training is not possible in most cases. To
approach the performance of a perfectly trained autoencoder with a suboptimum
training, we propose utilizing turbo codes as an implicit regularization, i.e.,
using a concatenation of a turbo code and an autoencoder. It is empirically
shown that this design gives nearly the same performance as to the
hypothetically perfectly trained autoencoder, and we also provide a theoretical
proof of why that is so. The proposed coding method is as bandwidth efficient
as the integrated (outer) turbo code, since the autoencoder exploits the excess
bandwidth from pulse shaping and packs signals more intelligently thanks to
sparsity in neural networks. Our results show that the proposed coding scheme
at finite block lengths outperforms conventional turbo codes even for QPSK
modulation. Furthermore, the proposed coding method can make one-bit
quantization operational even for 16-QAM.

significantly improve decision making processes in the smart power grid when
integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point forecasting
provides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more
information in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full predictive
densities. Traditionally quantile regression is applied for such forecasting
and recently quantile regression neural networks have become popular for
weather and renewable energy forecasting. However, one major shortcoming of
composite quantile estimation in neural networks is the quantile crossover
problem. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel smoothed loss and
penalty function for neural network architectures to prevent the quantile
crossover problem. Its efficacy is examined on the wind power forecasting
problem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly available wind data
from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. Multiple quantiles are
estimated to form 10\%, to 90\% prediction intervals which are evaluated using
a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models such as the
persistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile regression, and
support vector quantile regression are used for comparison where results
demonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance while
preventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates.

to a stochastic trajectory in space-time, corresponding to samples of a
statistical mechanical steady-state in a higher dimensional quasi-time. This is
proved using the Q-function of quantum theory with time-symmetric diffusion,
that is equivalent to a forward-backward stochastic process in both the
directions of time. The resulting probability distribution has a positive,
time-symmetric action principle and path integral, whose solution corresponds
to a classical field equilibrating in an additional dimension. Comparisons are
made to stochastic quantization and other higher dimensional physics proposals.
Five-dimensional space-time was originally introduced by Kaluza and Klein, and
is now widely proposed in cosmology and particle physics. Time-symmetric action
principles for quantum fields are also related to electrodynamical absorber
theory, which is known to be capable of violating a Bell inequality. We give
numerical methods and examples of solutions to the resulting stochastic partial

useful computational techniques for quantum field theory, as the action

giant, accreting black hole. Foremost among these effects is the blueshift and
beaming of incident radiation on the planet, due to the time dilation of an
observer orbiting very close to the black hole. This results in high-energy
flux incoming from surrounding stars and background radiation, with significant
implications for habitability.

  kinematics-based fundamental frequency control",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental frequency (F0) of human voice is generally controlled by
changing the vocal fold parameters (including tension, length and mass), which
in turn is manipulated by the muscle exciters, activated by the neural
synergies. In order to begin investigating the neuromuscular F0 control
pathway, we simulate a simple biomechanical arm prototype (instead of an
artificial vocal tract) that tends to control F0 of an artificial sound
synthesiser based on the elbow movements. The intended arm movements are
decoded from the EEG signal inputs (collected simultaneously with the kinematic
hand data of the participant) through a combined machine learning and
biomechanical modeling strategy. The machine learning model is employed to
identify the muscle activation of a single-muscle arm model in ArtiSynth (from
input brain signal), in order to match the actual kinematic (elbow joint angle)
data . The biomechanical model utilises this estimated muscle excitation to
produce corresponding changes in elbow angle, which is then linearly mapped to
F0 of a vocal sound synthesiser. We use the F0 value mapped from the actual
kinematic hand data (via same function) as the ground truth and compare the F0
estimated from brain signal. A detailed qualitative and quantitative
performance comparison shows that the proposed neuromuscular pathway can indeed
be utilised to accurately control the vocal fundamental frequency, thereby
demonstrating the success of our closed loop neuro-biomechanical control
scheme.

  Measurements in Paper Mills","9 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automation is at the core of modern industry. It aims to increase production
rates, decrease production costs, and reduce human intervention in order to
avoid human mistakes and time delays during manufacturing. On the other hand,
human assistance is usually required to customize products and reconfigure
control systems through a special process interface called Human Machine
Interface (HMI). Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can effectively be used to
resolve this tradeoff between full automation and human assistance.This paper
provides an example of the industrial application of ML algorithms to help
human operators save their mental effort and avoid time delays and unintended
mistakes for the sake of high production rates. Based on real-time sensor
measurements, several ML algorithms have been tried to classify paper rolls
according to paper grammage in a white paper mill. The performance evaluation
shows that the AdaBoost algorithm is the best ML algorithm for this application
with classification accuracy (CA), precision, and recall of 97.1%. The
generalization of the proposed approach for achieving cost-effective mills
construction will be the subject of our future research.

electric aircraft applications. One potential technology that is very promising
to achieve the required power-to-weight ratio for short-range aircraft, are
superconductors used for high current densities in the stator or high magnetic
fields in the rotor. In this paper, we present an indepth analysis of the
potential for fully and partially superconducting electric machines that is
based on an analytical approach taking into account all relevant physical
domains such as electromagnetics, superconducting properties, thermal behavior
as well as structural mechanics. For the requirements of the motors in the NASA
N3-X concept aircraft, we find that fully superconducting machines could
achieve 3.5 times higher power-to-weight ratio than partially superconducting
machines. Furthermore, our model can be used to calculate the relevant KPIs
such as mass, efficiency and cryogenic cooling requirements for any other
machine design.

backbone instead of sugar phosphate backbone of DNA or RNA. Their resistance to
degradation, selectivity and greater binding affinity in comparison to usual
nucleic acids led to consideration of their great potential for different
applications. For example, they can be used in molecular diagnostics and
antisense therapeutics such as antimicrobial agents or gene regulatory tools.
On the other hand, large hydrophilic property of PNA molecules, which inhibit
them to cross cell membranes readily, is an obstacle for their delivery to
considered target cells and a limiting criterion for their applications.
Therefore, PNA delivery technologies have been developing to hurdle this
limitation. For example, addition of lysine residues, charged membrane
penetrating peptide sequences, PNAs conjugated with antibodies or steroids,
cationic liposomes as carriers of PNA conjugates, protective peptides and
technology of photochemical internalization (PCI) as well as by the recent
technology of nanoparticle-based delivery have been employed. In this article
we compared different delivery technologies which can be applicable to PNAs. As
a result nanoparticle-based delivery showed more advantages in comparison to
others and its application is growing fast. Keywords: Target cell delivery,
