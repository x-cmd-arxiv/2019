since the discovery that the Higgs boson has a relatively light mass. It has
been pointed out in the past that the mass of a scalar boson can be
destabilized by loop corrections. Many theories have been proposed beyond the
SM to address this problem. It is possible that such mechanisms contribute to
the running of the Higgs mass with the energy scale. We present predictions for
the precision of the Higgs mass measurement up to a Higgs boson transverse
momentum of 1 TeV for the LHC in Run 3 with a luminosity of 300 fb-1, and the
high luminosity LHC with a luminosity of 3000 fb-1. Predictions are generated
with Madgraph5, Pythia8 and Delphes based on the CMS detector resolution.

algorithms that solve NP-hard problems. As Machine Learning (ML) and deep
learning have popularized, several research groups have started to use ML to
solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the well-known Travelling
Salesman Problem (TSP). Based on deep (reinforcement) learning, new models and
architecture for the TSP have been successively developed and have gained
increasing performances. At the time of writing, state-of-the-art models
provide solutions to TSP instances of 100 cities that are roughly 1.33% away
from optimal solutions. However, despite these apparently positive results, the
performances remain far from those that can be achieved using a specialized
search procedure. In this paper, we address the limitations of ML approaches
for solving the TSP and investigate two fundamental questions: (1) how can we
measure the level of accuracy of the pure ML component of such methods; and (2)
what is the impact of a search procedure plugged inside a ML model on the
performances? To answer these questions, we propose a new metric, ratio of
optimal decisions (ROD), based on a fair comparison with a parametrized oracle,
mimicking a ML model with a controlled accuracy. All the experiments are
carried out on four state-of-the-art ML approaches dedicated to solve the TSP.
Finally, we made ROD open-source in order to ease future research in the field.

Comparison with experiments at a higher Reynolds number in a plane section of
the near-wake at mid-height shows that the simulation captures several features
of the experimental flow, in particular the antisymmetric quasi-steady
deviation mode. 3-D POD analysis allows us to classify the different physical
processes in terms of mode contribution to the kinetic energy over the entire
domain. It is found that the dominant fluctuating mode on the entire domain
corresponds to the 3-D quasi-steady wake deviation, and that its amplitude is
well estimated from 2-D near-wake data. The next most energetic flow
fluctuations consist of vortex shedding and bubble pumping mechanisms. It is
found that the amplitude of the deviation is negatively correlated with the
intensity of the vortex shedding in the spanwise direction and the suction drag
coefficient. Finally, we find that despite the slow convergence of the
decomposition, a POD-based low-dimensional model reproduces the dynamics of the

modelling of the bolometric light curve and expansion velocities suggests that
the event is an outcome of the massive star explosion that ejected 28 Msun with
the kinetic energy of 1.7x10^51 erg and 0.03 Msun of radioactive Ni-56. We
recover the bipolar distribution of Ni-56 from the H-alpha profile via the
simulation of the emissivity produced by non-spherical Ni-56 ejecta. The
conspicuous effect of the dust absorption in the H-alpha profile rules out the
occultation by the dusty sphere or dusty thick disk but turns out consistent
with the thin dusty disk-like structure in the plane perpendicular to the
bipolar axis. We speculate that the absence of the nebular [O I] emission might
originate from the significant cooling of the oxygen-rich matter mediated by CO

however, these tools rely on simulations, which do not cover all aspects of the

optimal sizing, the focus was always on criteria or objectives. Here, we
present a new sound and automated approach to obtain optimal sizing using an
unprecedented program synthesis. Our variant of counterexample guided inductive
synthesis (CEGIS) approach has two phases linking the technical and cost
analysis: first we synthesize a feasible candidate based on power reliability,
but that may not achieve the lowest cost; second, the candidate is then
verified iteratively with a lower bound cost via symbolic model checking. If
the verification step does not fail, the lower bound is adjusted; and if it
fails, a counterexample provides the optimal solution. Experimental results
using seven case studies and commercial equipment data show that our synthesis
method can produce within an acceptable run-time the optimal system sizing. We
also present a comparative with a specialized simulation tool over real
photovoltaic systems to show the effectiveness of our approach, which can
provide a more detailed and accurate solution than that simulation tool.

order to analyze DNA fragments found in environmental samples.One important
step in this analysis is the taxonomic classification of the DNA fragments.
Conventional read classification methods require large databases and vast
amounts of memory to run, with recent deep learning methods suffering from very
large model sizes. We therefore aim to develop a more memory-efficient
technique for taxonomic classification. A task of particular interest is
abundance estimation in metagenomic samples. Current attempts rely on
classifying single DNA reads independently from each other and are therefore
agnostic to co-occurence patterns between taxa. In this work, we also attempt
to take these patterns into account. We develop a novel memory-efficient read
classification technique, combining deep learning and locality-sensitive
hashing. We show that this approach outperforms conventional mapping-based and
other deep learning methods for single-read taxonomic classification when
restricting all methods to a fixed memory footprint. Moreover, we formulate the
task of abundance estimation as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem and
we extend current deep learning architectures with two different types of
permutation-invariant MIL pooling layers: a) deepsets and b) attention-based
pooling. We illustrate that our architectures can exploit the co-occurrence of
species in metagenomic read sets and outperform the single-read architectures
in predicting the distribution over taxa at higher taxonomic ranks.

those of LRNe and the class of intermediate luminosity red transients (ILRTs)
similar to SN 2008S. Through the detailed analysis of the observed parameters,
our study support that it actually belongs to the LRN class, and was likely
produced by the coalescence of two massive stars. Methods: We obtained ten
months of optical and near-infrared photometric monitoring, and eleven epochs
of low-resolution optical spectroscopy of AT~2018hso. We compared its observed
properties with those of other ILRTs and LRNe. We also inspected the archival
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained about 15 years ago to constrain
the progenitor's properties. Results: The light curves of AT 2018hso show a
first sharp peak (Mr = -13.93 mag), followed by a broader and shallower second
peak, that resembles a plateau in the optical bands. The spectra dramatically
change with time. Early time spectra show prominent Balmer emission lines and a
weak Ca II] doublet, which is usually observed in ILRTs. However, the major
decrease in the continuum temperature, the appearance of narrow metal
absorption lines, the major change in the H$\alpha$ strength and profile, and
the emergence of molecular bands support a LRN classification. The possible
detection of an I ~ -8 mag source at the position of AT 2018hso in HST archive
images is consistent with expectations for a pre-merger massive binary, similar
to the precursor of the 2015 LRN in M101. Conclusions: We provide reasonable
arguments to support a LRN classification for AT~2018hso. This study reveals
growing heterogeneity in the observables of LRNe than thought in the past,
making sometimes tricky the discrimination between LRNe and ILRTs. This
suggests the need of monitoring the entire evolution of gap transients to avoid
misclassifications.

and uniformly cooled planar surface subject to an additional forcing due to a
uniform downslope wind field aloft. We adopt an extension of Prandtl's original
model for slope flows (Lykosov & Gutman 1972) to derive the base flow, which
constitutes an interesting basic state in stability analysis because it cannot
be reduced to a single universal form independent of external parameters. We
apply a linear modal analysis to this basic state to demonstrate that for a
fixed Prandtl number and slope angle, two independent dimensionless parameters
are sufficient to describe the flow stability. One of these parameters is the
stratification perturbation number that we have introduced in Xiao & Senocak
(2019). The second parameter, which we will henceforth designate the wind
forcing number, is hitherto uncharted and can be interpreted as the ratio of
the kinetic energy of the ambient wind aloft to the damping due to viscosity
and stabilizing effect of the background stratification. For a fixed Prandtl
number, stationary transverse and travelling longitudinal modes of
instabilities can emerge, depending on the value of the slope angle and the
aforementioned dimensionless numbers. The influence of ambient wind forcing on
the base flow's stability is complicated as the ambient wind can be both
stabilizing as well as destabilizing for a certain range of the parameters. Our
results constitute a strong counter-evidence against the current practice of
relying solely on the gradient Richardson number to describe the dynamic
stability of stratified atmospheric slope flows.

local symmetry in a warped extra dimensional bulk. In contrast to other works,
we break the additional gauge symmetry in the bulk via two complex scalars
which acquire bulk vevs, rather than relying on brane-localized symmetry
breaking. A gauge-covariant Kaluza-Klein decomposition of a theory with a bulk
spontaneously broken gauge symmetry is performed, and exact expressions for the
bulk profiles of all physical particles in such systems are given. The SM quark
masses and mixings are then recreated using gauge-covariant bulk quark mass
terms and Yukawa-like couplings to the new bulk scalars. A numerical sampling
of points in the model parameter space that recreate the quark masses and
mixings is performed at a KK scale of $M_{KK} =5$ TeV. We then compute the
$\Delta F = 2$ 4-quark operators arising from our new flavor gauge bosons and
scalars, and those arising from Kaluza-Klein modes of SM gauge bosons. By
decoupling one of our bulk scalar fields to all quark fields except the
right-handed up-like sector, we find that it is possible to greatly suppress
tree-level contributions to the highly constrained Kaon mixing parameters.
Instead, the dominant constraints on the model emerge from neutral $B_d$ and
$D$ meson mixing. These constraints are explored with our numerical sampling of
the model parameter space, and the specific contribution of the new flavor
gauge bosons and scalars is discussed. We find that for a significant range of
realistic flavor gauge couplings, the new gauge bosons compete with the
normally dominant gluon flavor-changing currents, but flavor-changing operators
emerging from the bulk scalar fields are highly suppressed. Finally, we briefly
comment on flavor constraints that are independent of the flavor gauge sector

($\mathrm{80\sim200\,km\,s^{-1}}$) dense ($\mathrm{\sim10^{5}\,cm^{-3}}$)
outflows expanding into a stationary ambient medium. In the case of an atomic
wind interacting with an atomic medium, a decelerating advancing turbulent
shell thickens with time. This contrasts with all other cases where a shell
fragments into a multitude of cometary-shaped protrusions with weak oblique
shocks as the main source of gas excitation. We find that the atomic
wind-ambient simulation leads to considerably higher excitation, stronger peak
and integrated atomic emission as the nebula expands. The weaker emission when
one component is molecular is due to the shell fragmentation into fingers so
that the shock surface area is increased and oblique shocks are prevalent.
Position-velocity diagrams indicate that the atomic-wind model may be most easy
to distinguish with more emission at higher radial velocities. With post-AGB
winds and shells often highly obscured and the multitude of configurations that
are observed, this study suggests and motivates selection criteria for new
surveys.

challenging task. Most existing learning based methods deal with this task in a

More recent approaches explore the possibility of estimating scene depth and

results are shown, current methods either learn from monocular videos for depth
and pose and typically do so without enforcing multi-view geometry constraints
between scene structure and camera motion, or require stereo sequences as input

this paper we propose to jointly optimize the scene depth and camera motion via
incorporating differentiable Bundle Adjustment (BA) layer by minimizing the

synthesis as the final supervisory signal. The proposed approach only needs
unlabeled monocular videos as input, and extensive experiments on the KITTI and

reconstruct a single high-resolution cerebral blood flow (CBF) map, corrected
for rigid motion, point-spread-function (PSF) blurring and partial-volume
effect (PVE).Six volunteers were recruited for CBF imaging using PCASL
labelling, 2-shot 3D-GRASE sequences and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI. For
two volunteers, high-resolution scans with double and triple resolution in the
partition direction were additionally collected. Simulations were designed for
evaluations against a high-resolution ground-truth CBF map, including a
simulated hyper-perfused lesion and hyper/hypo-perfusion abnormalities. MOCHA
was compared to standard reconstruction and a 3D linear regression (3DLR) PVE
correction method and was further evaluated for acquisitions with reduced
control-label pairs and k-space undersampling. MOCHA reconstructions of
low-resolution ASL data showed enhanced image quality particularly in the
partition direction. In simulations, both MOCHA and 3DLR provided more accurate
CBF maps than the standard reconstruction, however MOCHA resulted in the lowest
errors and well delineated the abnormalities. MOCHA reconstruction of
standard-resolution in-vivo data showed good agreement with higher-resolution
scans requiring 4x and 9x longer acquisitions. MOCHA was found to be robust for
4x-accelerated ASL acquisitions, achieved by reduced control-label pairs or
k-space undersampling. Conclusion: MOCHA reconstruction reduces PVE by direct
reconstruction of CBF maps in the high-resolution space of the corresponding
anatomical image, incorporating motion correction and PSF modelling. Following
further evaluation, MOCHA should promote the clinical application of ASL.

random stimulus has become ubiquitous as a means of stimulating a designs
functionality and ensuring it fully meets expectations. In theory, random
stimulus allows all possible combinations to be exercised given enough time,
but in practice with highly complex designs a purely random approach will have
difficulty in exercising all possible combinations in a timely fashion. As a
result it is often necessary to steer the Design Verification (DV) environment
to generate hard to hit combinations. The resulting constrained-random approach
is powerful but often relies on extensive human expertise to guide the DV
environment in order to fully exercise the design. As designs become more
complex, the guidance aspect becomes progressively more challenging and time
consuming often resulting in design schedules in which the verification time to
hit all possible design coverage points is the dominant schedule limitation.
This paper describes an approach which leverages existing constrained-random DV
environment tools but which further enhances them using supervised learning and
reinforcement learning techniques. This approach provides better than random
results in a highly automated fashion thereby ensuring DV objectives of full
design coverage can be achieved on an accelerated timescale and with fewer

  Two hardware verification examples are presented, one of a Cache Controller

performed via a Bayesian-based multiple-model square root cubature Kalman

scheme to regulate the MAP response of the patient is carried out via
time-delay linear parameter-varying (LPV) control techniques. In this regard,
an LPV gain-scheduled output-feedback controller is designed to meet the MAP
response requirements of tracking a desired reference MAP target and guarantee

sufficient conditions for the robust stabilization of a general LPV system with

way to operate an engine in the quantum realm. Recently there have been in the
literature several proposals for ""quantum measurement engines"" where energy is
fed into the machine by operations which otherwise would be conducive to
quantum measurements on the working substance (henceforth ""the system""). In the
analysis of the working of these devices, oftentimes it is assumed that the
only effect of measurement is to turn the state of the system from whatever
prior state to an eigenstate of the measured property, and energy exchanges are
determined therefrom. This ignores the intricacies of the quantum measurement
process. We propose a simple model of a quantum measurement engine where the
measurement process may be analyzed in detail, and therefore energy exchanges,
and limitations on their duration, may be traced more fully.

  elasticities: the case for additional scaling of food consumption using the
  total food expenditure elasticity",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0230506",,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background Food taxes and subsidies are one intervention to address poor
diets. Price elasticity (PE) matrices are commonly used to model the change in
food purchasing. Usually a PE matrix is generated in one setting then applied
to another setting with differing starting consumption and prices of foods.
This violates econometric assumptions resulting in likely misestimation of
total food consumption. We illustrate rescaling all consumption after applying
a PE matrix using a total food expenditure elasticity (TFEe, the expenditure
elasticity for all food combined given the policy induced change in the total
price of food). We use case studies of NZ$2 per 100g saturated fat (SAFA) tax,
NZ$0.4 per 100g sugar tax, and a 20% fruit and vegetable (F&V) subsidy. Methods
We estimated changes in food purchasing using a NZ PE matrix applied
conventionally, then with TFEe adjustment. Impacts were quantified for total
food expenditure and health adjusted life years (HALYs) for the total NZ
population alive in 2011 over the rest of their lifetime using a multistate
lifetable model. Results Two NZ studies gave TFEes of 0.68 and 0.83, with
international estimates ranging from 0.46 to 0.90. Without TFEe adjustment,
total food expenditure decreased with the tax policies and increased with the
F&V subsidy, implausible directions of shift given economic theory. After TFEe
adjustment, HALY gains reduced by a third to a half for the two taxes and
reversed from an apparent health loss to a health gain for the F&V subsidy.
With TFEe adjustment, HALY gains (in 1000s) were 1,805 (95% uncertainty
interval 1,337 to 2,340) for the SAFA tax, 1,671 (1,220 to 2,269) for the sugar
tax, and 953 (453 to 1,308) for the F&V subsidy. Conclusions If PE matrices are
applied in settings beyond where they were derived, additional scaling is
likely required. We suggest that the TFEe is a useful scalar.

spatial template characteristic of a PWN can fit the GeV data. We suggest that
the GeV source is an extended PWN powered by the central middle-aged pulsar PSR

most significant gamma-ray flares of the blazars in the sample and introduce
the blazar duty cycle as an important parameter to be considered when assessing
a possible neutrino counterpart. For the selected blazars we show the expected
neutrino flux variability with different time binning assuming the gamma-rays
observed by Fermi-LAT as a product of a leptohadronic emission scenario. The
neutrino expectations from the blazar sample are then compared with the IceCube
discovery flux searching for the optimal time bin in a multi-messenger context.
This analysis indicates that the detection of a single flare represents a
challenge for a single cubic kilometer detector, underlining the importance of
increasing the size of current neutrino telescopes and obtaining a good
monitoring of the entire sky through a global neutrino network.

electric monopole (charge) and magnetic dipole (spin) but prohibit its magnetic
counterpart. Recently it was predicted that the magnetic ""monopoles"" carrying
emergent magnetic charges in spin ice systems can induce electric dipoles. The
inspiring prediction offers a novel way to study magnetic monopole excitations
and magnetoelectric coupling. However, no clear example has been identified up
to now. Here, we report the experimental evidence for electric dipoles induced
by magnetic monopoles in spin frustrated Tb2Ti2O7. The magnetic field applied
to pyrochlore Tb2Ti2O7 along [111] direction, brings out a ""3-in-1-out""
magnetic monopole configuration, and then induces a subtle structural phase
transition at Hc~2.3 T. The transition is evidenced by the non-linear phonon
splitting under magnetic fields and the anomalous crystal-field excitations of
Tb3+ ions. The observations consistently point to the displacement of the
oxygen O"" anions along [111] axis which gives rise to the formation of electric
dipoles. The finding demonstrates that the scenario of magnetic monopole having
both magnetic charge and electric dipole is realized in Tb2Ti2O7 and sheds
light into the coupling between electricity and magnetism of magnetic monopoles
in spin frustrated systems.

quantify the influence of CAVs on HVs by studying the high-resolution vehicle
trajectory data that is obtained from microscopic simulation. Two clustering
strategies for CACC are implemented: an ad hoc coordination one and a local
coordination one. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad
hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of
network throughput and productivity. The greatest performance difference
between the two strategies is observed at 30% and 40% MPR for throughput and
productivity, respectively. However, the distributions of the hard braking
observations (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly under
local coordination strategy. Regardless of the clustering strategy, CAVs
increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. 30% MPR is the break-even
point for local coordination, after which the average lane change frequency
decreases from the peak 5.42 to 5.38. Such inverse relationship to MPR is not
found in the ah hoc case and the average lane change frequency reaches the

In radio observations, nonthermal particles generally manifest as spectral fine

type III pair bursts, narrow band stochastic spike bursts following the type
III bursts and spike-like bursts superimposed on type II burst in an X1.3 flare

suggest that they are possibly generated from different accelerating

beams accelerated by the flaring magnetic reconnection, spike bursts are
produced by the energetic electrons accelerated by a termination shock wave
triggered by the fast reconnecting plasma outflows impacting on the flaring

communication requires security, privacy, auditability, and efficiency. To
satisfy these requirements simultaneously, several conditional

together with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can induce novel electronic and
piezoelectric properties. In this work, the piezoelectric properties along with
carrier mobilities of Janus monolayer XTeI (X=Sb and Bi) are studied by density
functional theory (DFT). By using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus
SOC, they are found to be indirect gap semiconductors with the Rashba spin
splitting. The piezoelectric tensors of Janus monolayer XTeI (X=Sb and Bi) are
reported by using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Due to lacking
both the inversion symmetry and out-of-plane mirror symmetry for Janus
monolayer XTeI (X=Sb and Bi), both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric
effects can be observed, and the large piezoelectric coefficients are predicted
(e.g. $d_{11}$=12.95 pm/V for SbTeI and $d_{11}$=8.20 pm/V for BiTeI), which
are comparable and even higher than ones of many other two-dimensional (2D)
materials and other well-known bulk piezoelectric materials, especially for
out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients. With GGA+SOC, the high electron
carrier mobilities are obtained, and the electron mobility of BiTeI along
armchair direction reaches up to about 1319 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$. The
carrier mobility shows a rather pronounced anisotropy between electron and
hole/armchair and zigzag directions. It is found that tensile strain can
improve the piezoelectric coefficients $d_{11}$ of Janus monolayer XTeI (X=Sb

modality which could potentially be used for the localized treatment of
prostate cancer. One of the limiting factors of this therapy is prostatic
calcifications. These attenuate and reflect ultrasound and thus reduce the
efficacy of the heating. The aim of this study is to investigate how prostatic
calcifications affect therapeutic efficacy, and to identify the best sonication
strategy when calcifications are present. Methods: Realistic computational
models were used on clinical patient data in order to simulate different
therapeutic situations with naturally occurring calcifications as well as
artificial calcifications of different sizes (1-10 mm) and distances (5-15 mm).
Furthermore, different sonication strategies were tested in order to deliver
therapy to the untreated tissue regions behind the calcifications. Results: The
presence of calcifications in front of the ultrasound field was found to
increase the peak pressure by 100% on average while the maximum temperature
only rose by 9% during a 20-s sonication. Losses in ultrasound energy were due
to the relatively large acoustic impedance mismatch between the prostate tissue
and the calcifications (1.63 vs 3.20 MRayl) and high attenuation coefficient
(0.78 vs 2.64 dB/MHz^1.1/cm), which together left untreated tissue regions
behind the calcifications. In addition, elevated temperatures were seen in the
region between the transducer and the calcifications. Lower sonication
frequencies (1-4 MHz) were not able to penetrate through the calcifications
effectively, but longer sonication durations (20-60 s) with selective
transducer elements were effective in treating the tissue regions behind the
calcifications.

lightweight model from the views of reconstructing the structure of
convolutional kernels and efficient storage. Our approach transforms a
traditional square convolution kernel to line segments, and automatically learn
a proper strategy for equipping these line segments to model diverse features.
The experimental results indicate that our approach can massively reduce the

that attract the most attention. Many methods have achieved state-of-the-art
performance levels on this task. Recently, salient instance segmentation has
become an even more challenging task than traditional salient region detection;
however, few of the existing methods have concentrated on this underexplored
problem. Unlike the existing methods, which usually employ object proposals to
roughly count and locate object instances, our method applies salient objects
subitizing to predict an accurate number of instances for salient instance
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a multitask densely connected neural
network (MDNN) to segment salient instances in an image. In contrast to
existing approaches, our framework is proposal-free and category-independent.
The MDNN contains two parallel branches: the first is a densely connected
subitizing network (DSN) used for subitizing prediction; the second is a
densely connected fully convolutional network (DFCN) used for salient region
detection. The MDNN simultaneously outputs saliency maps and salient object
subitizing. Then, an adaptive deep feature-based spectral clustering operation
segments the salient regions into instances based on the subitizing and
saliency maps. The experimental results on both salient region detection and
salient instance segmentation datasets demonstrate the satisfactory performance
of our framework. Notably, its APr@0.5 and Apr@0.7 reaches 73.46% and 60.14% in
the salient instance dataset, substantially higher than the results achieved by
the state-of-the-art algorithm.

might be caused by the presence of ionized material in the wind. On the
contrary, the wind in S-NLS1s is fast, the ionized material could be swept by
such a strong wind, thus the complex feature is missing which results in a
simple X-ray spectrum. Furthermore, this outflow scenario seems to be an
inclination effect. Since the speed of the wind is higher in a small
inclination while lower in a large inclination, S-NLS1s might be sources viewed
at small angles while C-NLS1s might be sources viewed at large angles.

employ the CEM-GMsFEM and obtain appropriate offline multiscale basis functions

multivariate polynomial over the unit sphere. This problem is equivalent to
finding the leading eigenvalue of the associated symmetric tensor of higher
order, which is nonconvex and NP-hard. Recent advances show that semidefinite
relaxation is quite effective to find a global solution. However, the solution
methods involve full/partial eigenvalue decomposition during the iterates,
which heavily limits its efficiency and scalability. On the other hand, for odd
degree (odd order) cases, the order has to be increased to even, which
potentially reduces the efficiency.
  To find the global solutions, instead of convexifying the problem, we
equivalently reformulate the problem as a nonconvex matrix program based on an
equivalence property between symmetric rank-1 tensors and matrices of any
order, which is a generalization of the existing results. The program is
directly solved by a vanilla alternating direction method, which only involves
the computation of leading eigenvalue/singular value of certain matrices,
benefiting from the special structure of the program. Although being nonconvex,
under certain hypotheses, it is proved that the algorithm converges to a
leading eigenvalue of the associated tensor. Numerical experiments on different
classes of tensors demonstrate that the proposed approach has a significant
improvement in efficiency and scalability, while it can keep the effectiveness
of semidefinite relaxation as much as possible. For instance, the proposed
method finds the leading eigenpair of a third-order 500 dimensional Hilbert
tensor in a personal computer within 100 seconds.

dissipation, their effects are distinct. In particular, under certain drivings
the asymptotic Floquet states of the system exhibit robustness against a range
of system-bath coupling strength: the asymptotic behaviors of the system are
insensitive to different system-bath coupling strength, while they are highly
tunable by the chemical potential difference of baths. Further simulations show
that such robustness may be essentially a result of the interplay between
driving, bath electronic structure and system-bath coupling. Therefore the
robustness could break down depending on the characteristics of the interplay.
In addition, under fast linearly polarized driving the quantum stochastic
resonance is demonstrated that stronger system-bath coupling (stronger
dissipation) enhances rather than suppresses the amplitude of coherent

and growth of embryonic tissues. They are secreted in a localized region and
spread through the tissue to form a graded concentration profile. We present a
cell-based model of morphogen spreading that combines secretion in a local
source, extracellular diffusion and cellular trafficking. We introduce
hydrodynamic modes of morphogen transport and characterize the dynamics of
transport by dispersion relations of these dynamic eigenmodes. These dispersion
relations specify the characteristic relaxation time of a mode as a function of
its wavelength. In a simple model we distinguish two distinct dynamic modes
characterized by different timescales. We find that the slower mode defines the
effective diffusion and degradation as well as the shape of the concentration
profile in steady state. Using our approach we discuss mechanisms of morphogen
transport in the developing wing imaginal disc of the fruit fly
\textit{Drosophila}, distinguishing three transport regimes: transport by
extracellular diffusion, transport by transcytosis and a regime where both
transport mechanisms are combined.

variety of complex tasks in the near future. IoT objects capable of handling
multiple sensing and actuating functions are the cornerstone of smart
applications such as smart buildings, smart factories, home automation, and
healthcare automation. These smart applications express their demands in terms
of high-level requests. These requests are characterised by the different
requirements of sensing actuating functions, processing and memory needs,
activation zones, latency, etc. In service-oriented architecture-based IoT,
application requests are translated into a business process BP workflow. In
this study, we model such a BP as a virtual network containing a set of virtual
nodes and links connected in a specific topology. These virtual nodes represent
the requested processing and location where sensing or actuation are needed.
The virtual links capture the requested communication requirements between
nodes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, optimised using mixed integer
linear programming MILP, that embeds the BPs from the virtual layer into a
lower-level implementation at the IoT physical layer. The proposed framework
results in a physical plan that optimally allocates the processing needed and
provisions the sensing and actuation at the required locations requirements to
an appropriate set of IoT nodes. The optimisation goal is to minimise the IoT
layer total power consumption and optimise the traffic distribution in a manner
that minimises the traffic latency of each IoT node. Our results show that the
proposed framework enhances the network performance by reducing the power
consumption and latency.

agents. Specifically, each agent adds privacy noise (e.g., Gaussian noise)
point-wise in time to its own outputs before sharing them with a local hub.
Each local hub runs a Kalman filter to estimate the state of the corresponding
agent and periodically sends such state estimates to the cloud. The cloud
computes the optimal inputs for each agent subject to an MTL specification.
While guaranteeing differential privacy of each agent, the controller is also
synthesized to ensure a probabilistic guarantee for satisfying the MTL
specification.We provide an implementation of the proposed method on a

results compared to their real-valued (RV) counterparts for polarimetric
synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) classification, the extension of pixel-level
RV networks to the complex domain has not yet thoroughly examined. This paper
presents a novel complex-valued deep fully convolutional neural network
(CV-FCN) designed for PolSAR image classification. Specifically, CV-FCN uses
PolSAR CV data that includes the phase information and utilizes the deep FCN
architecture that performs pixel-level labeling. It integrates the feature
extraction module and the classification module in a united framework.
Technically, for the particularity of PolSAR data, a dedicated complex-valued
weight initialization scheme is defined to initialize CV-FCN. It considers the
distribution of polarization data to conduct CV-FCN training from scratch in an
efficient and fast manner. CV-FCN employs a complex
downsampling-then-upsampling scheme to extract dense features. To enrich
discriminative information, multi-level CV features that retain more
polarization information are extracted via the complex downsampling scheme.
Then, a complex upsampling scheme is proposed to predict dense CV labeling. It
employs complex max-unpooling layers to greatly capture more spatial
information for better robustness to speckle noise. In addition, to achieve
faster convergence and obtain more precise classification results, a novel
average cross-entropy loss function is derived for CV-FCN optimization.

Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph; IRIS), carries about the chromosphere
during solar flares, and to validate models of energy transport via model-data
comparison, forward modelling is required. The assumption of statistical
equilibrium is typically used to obtain the atomic level populations from
snapshots of flare atmospheres, due to computational necessity. However it is
possible that relying on statistical equilibrium could lead to spurious
results. We compare solving the atomic level populations via statistical
equilibrium versus a non-equilibrium time-dependent approach. This was achieved
using flare simulations from RADYN alongside the minority species version,
MS_RADYN, from which the time-dependent Mg II atomic level populations and
radiation transfer were computed in complete frequency redistribution. The
impacts on the emergent profiles, lightcurves, line ratios, and formation
heights are discussed. In summary we note that non-equilibrium effects during
flares are typically important only in the initial stages and for a short
period following the cessation of the energy injection. An analysis of the
timescales of ionisation equilibrium reveals that for most of the duration of
the flare, when the temperatures and densities are sufficiently enhanced, the
relaxation timescales are short ($\tau_{\mathrm{relax}}<0.1$ s), so that the
equilibrium solution is an adequate approximation. These effects vary with the
size of the flare, however. In weaker flares effects can be more pronounced. We
recommend that non-equilibrium effects be considered when possible, but that
statistical equilibrium is sufficient at most stages of the flare.

most halo finders. With cosmological simulations, we further show that HIKER

enable analysis of arbitrarily-complex interactions between combinations of
student-level predictor variables and intervention outcome, defined as the
improvement in grade point average (GPA) during the transition to high school.
We utilized two separate machine learning models: one to control for complex

the change in GPA due to the intervention. We analyzed the trained models to
discover which features influenced model predictions most, finding that prior
academic achievement, blocked navigations (attempting to navigate through the

an intervention effect as low as 0.185 GPA points (on a 0-4 scale) less than

approach to address the automated blood pressure regulation problem in the

vasopressors. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) response of a patient subject to
the intravenous vasoactive drug treatment is modeled as a linear
parameter-varying (LPV) model, where varying model parameters and varying
time-delay are considered as scheduling parameters of the system.
Parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are used to design an
output-feedback dynamic controller to satisfy the closed-loop stability and
reference MAP tracking requirements. The synthesis conditions are formulated in
terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) that characterize the induced
$\mathcal{L}_2$-norm performance specification of the closed-loop system. The
main objectives of the proposed control method in the presence of limitations
posed by the time-varying model parameters and the large time-varying delay are
to track the MAP reference command and maintain the blood pressure within the
permissible range of commanded set-point, avoid undesirable overshoot and slow
response, and to provide a smooth drug injection. Finally, to evaluate the
performance of the proposed LPV blood pressure regulation approach, closed-loop
simulations are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness of the

model parameters, the input delay cannot be captured by a random-walk process,
a multiple-model module with a posterior probability estimation is implemented
to provide the delay identification. Validation results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed identification algorithm both in simulation
scenarios and also using animal experiment data.

  of Antisemitism",,,"10.5967/3r3m-na89",,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online antisemitism is hard to quantify. How can it be measured in rapidly
growing and diversifying platforms? Are the numbers of antisemitic messages
rising proportionally to other content or is it the case that the share of
antisemitic content is increasing? How does such content travel and what are
reactions to it? How widespread is online Jew-hatred beyond infamous websites
and fora, and closed social media groups? However, at the root of many
methodological questions is the challenge of finding a consistent way to
identify diverse manifestations of antisemitism in large datasets. What is
more, a clear definition is essential for building an annotated corpus that can
be used as a gold standard for machine learning programs to detect antisemitic
online content. We argue that antisemitic content has distinct features that
are not captured adequately in generic approaches of annotation, such as hate
speech, abusive language, or toxic language. We discuss our experiences with
annotating samples from our dataset that draw on a ten percent random sample of
public tweets from Twitter. We show that the widely used definition of
antisemitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance can be applied
successfully to online messages if inferences are spelled out in detail and if
the focus is not on intent of the disseminator but on the message in its
context. However, annotators have to be highly trained and knowledgeable about
current events to understand each tweet's underlying message within its
context. The tentative results of the annotation of two of our small but
randomly chosen samples suggest that more than ten percent of conversations on
Twitter about Jews and Israel are antisemitic or probably antisemitic. They
also show that at least in conversations about Jews, an equally high number of
tweets denounce antisemitism, although these conversations do not necessarily
coincide.

  Prediction on a Mobile Social Application","Published at KDD 2018",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As online platforms are striving to get more users, a critical challenge is
user churn, which is especially concerning for new users. In this paper, by
taking the anonymous large-scale real-world data from Snapchat as an example,
we develop \textit{ClusChurn}, a systematic two-step framework for
interpretable new user clustering and churn prediction, based on the intuition
that proper user clustering can help understand and predict user churn.
Therefore, \textit{ClusChurn} firstly groups new users into interpretable
typical clusters, based on their activities on the platform and ego-network
structures. Then we design a novel deep learning pipeline based on LSTM and
attention to accurately predict user churn with very limited initial behavior
data, by leveraging the correlations among users' multi-dimensional activities
and the underlying user types. \textit{ClusChurn} is also able to predict user
types, which enables rapid reactions to different types of user churn.
Extensive data analysis and experiments show that \textit{ClusChurn} provides
valuable insight into user behaviors, and achieves state-of-the-art churn
prediction performance. The whole framework is deployed as a data analysis
pipeline, delivering real-time data analysis and prediction results to multiple
relevant teams for business intelligence uses. It is also general enough to be
readily adopted by any online systems with user behavior data.

  Discovery","Published at ECML-PKDD 2018",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous networks are widely used to model real-world semi-structured
data. The key challenge of learning over such networks is the modeling of node
similarity under both network structures and contents. To deal with network
structures, most existing works assume a given or enumerable set of meta-paths
and then leverage them for the computation of meta-path-based proximities or
network embeddings. However, expert knowledge for given meta-paths is not
always available, and as the length of considered meta-paths increases, the
number of possible paths grows exponentially, which makes the path searching
process very costly. On the other hand, while there are often rich contents
around network nodes, they have hardly been leveraged to further improve
similarity modeling. In this work, to properly model node similarity in
content-rich heterogeneous networks, we propose to automatically discover
useful paths for pairs of nodes under both structural and content information.
To this end, we combine continuous reinforcement learning and deep content
embedding into a novel semi-supervised joint learning framework. Specifically,
the supervised reinforcement learning component explores useful paths between a
small set of example similar pairs of nodes, while the unsupervised deep
embedding component captures node contents and enables inductive learning on
the whole network. The two components are jointly trained in a closed loop to
mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments on three real-world
heterogeneous networks demonstrate the supreme advantages of our algorithm.

lack of annotation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with
limited amount of annotated data, the method can achieve very competitive
results while not using any pre-processing or re-scoring tricks. These findings
open the way to the exploitation of non-annotated datasets which is the current
bottleneck for the E2E NLG system development to new applications.

seeing them at one glance, and is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. It
is challenging for conventional machine learning approaches to mimic this way,
since limited data are hard to effectively represent the data variance. The
goal of one-shot face recognition is to learn a large-scale face recognizer,
which is capable to fight off the data imbalance challenge. In this paper, we
propose a novel generative adversarial one-shot face recognizer, attempting to
synthesize meaningful data for one-shot classes by adapting the data variances
from other normal classes. Specifically, we target at building a more effective
general face classifier for both normal persons and one-shot persons.
Technically, we design a new loss function by formulating knowledge transfer
generator and a general classifier into a unified framework. Such a two-player
minimax optimization can guide the generation of more effective data, which
effectively promote the underrepresented classes in the learned model and lead
to a remarkable improvement in face recognition performance. We evaluate our
proposed model on the MS-Celeb-1M one-shot learning benchmark task, where we
could recognize 94.98% of the test images at the precision of 99% for the
one-shot classes, keeping an overall Top1 accuracy at $99.80\%$ for the normal
