occlusion happens frequently among different pedestrians. In this paper, we
propose an effective and efficient detection network to hunt pedestrians in
crowd scenes. The proposed method, namely PedHunter, introduces strong
occlusion handling ability to existing region-based detection networks without
bringing extra computations in the inference stage. Specifically, we design a
mask-guided module to leverage the head information to enhance the feature
representation learning of the backbone network. Moreover, we develop a strict
classification criterion by improving the quality of positive samples during
training to eliminate common false positives of pedestrian detection in crowded
scenes. Besides, we present an occlusion-simulated data augmentation to enrich
the pattern and quantity of occlusion samples to improve the occlusion
robustness. As a consequent, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three
pedestrian detection datasets including CityPersons, Caltech-USA and
CrowdHuman. To facilitate further studies on the occluded pedestrian detection
in surveillance scenes, we release a new pedestrian dataset, called SUR-PED,
with a total of over 162k high-quality manually labeled instances in 10k
images. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models will be released.

determine the relationship between the observationally inferred surface
toroidal field (as a proxy for flux emergence), and the modelled subsurface
toroidal flux density. We use a combination of sunspot area observations, the
surface toroidal field inferred from WSO line-of-sight magnetic field
observations, and compare with the results of a 1-D mean-field evolution
equation for the subsurface toroidal field, driven by the observed radial field
from the National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak and SOLIS observations. We derive
calibration curves relating the subsurface toroidal flux density to the
observed surface toroidal field strengths and sunspot areas. The calibration
curves are for two regimes, one corresponding to ephemeral region emergence
outside of the butterfly wings, the other to active region emergence in the
butterfly wings. We discuss this in terms of the size and vertical velocity
associated with the two types of flux emergence.

selected based on the oretical design to maintain the predefined distortion
level. Thus, their degradations are automatically restricted below the
pre-defined levels which correspond to target OoB radiation. We also discuss
the practical design of peak-cancellation (PC) signal with target OoB radiation

Numerical results show the improvements with respect to both achievable bit

H}^r_{n,M}$ be the random $M$-edge $r$-graph on $V=\{1,\ldots ,n\}$; that is,
${\mathcal H}$ is chosen uniformly from the $M$-subsets of ${\mathcal K}:={V
\choose r}$ ($:= \{\mbox{$r$-subsets of $V$}\}$). Shamir's Problem (circa 1980)
asks, roughly, for what $M=M(n)$ is ${\mathcal H}$ likely to contain a perfect
matching (that is, $n/r$ disjoint $r$-sets)?
  In 2008 Johansson, Vu and the author showed that this is true for $M>C_rn\log
n$. The present paper has two purposes. First, it establishes the
asymptotically correct version of the 2008 result:
  Theorem 1. For fixed $\epsilon>0$ and $M> (1+\epsilon)(n/r)\log n$,
$P({\mathcal H} ~\mbox{contains a perfect matching})\rightarrow 1 $ as
$n\rightarrow\infty$.
  Second, it begins a proof of the definitive ``hitting time"" statement:
  Theorem 2. If $A_1, \ldots ~$ is a uniform permutation of ${\mathcal K}$,
${\mathcal H}_t=\{A_1,\ldots ,A_t\}$, and $T=\min\{t:A_1\cup \cdots\cup
A_t=V\},$ then $P({\mathcal H}_T ~\mbox{contains a perfect
matching})\rightarrow 1 $ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
  It is shown here that Theorem 2 follows from a conditional version of Theorem
1 that will be proved elsewhere. The key ideas in that proof are similar to
those for Theorem 1, but the argument is a longer story, and it has seemed best
to give the present separate proof of Theorem 1, in which those ideas may
appear more clearly.

many real-world applications, including production, warehouse management and

40 items are unsolved to proven optimality, despite many attempts, since the
1990s. In this paper, we solve the problem with a combinatorial Benders
decomposition that is based on a simple model in which the two-dimensional
items and bins are just represented by their areas, and infeasible packings are
imposed by means of exponentially-many no-good cuts. The basic decomposition
scheme is quite naive, but we enrich it with a number of preprocessing
techniques, valid inequalities, lower bounding methods, and enhanced algorithms
to produce the strongest possible cuts. The resulting algorithm behaved very
well on the benchmark sets of instances, improving on average upon previous
algorithms from the literature and solving for the first time a number of open

complex hot core chemistry. We describe a small and diverse sample of the LMC

an order of magnitude. We discuss future prospects for research in the field of
complex chemistry in the low-metallicity environment. The detection of COMs in
the Magellanic Clouds has important implications for astrobiology. The
metallicity of the Magellanic Clouds is similar to galaxies in the earlier

that a similar prebiotic chemistry leading to the emergence of life, as it

quantum structure describing a Bose gas in a state close to a Bose-Einstein
condensate near absolute zero temperature. For this we introduce energy levels
for the words (concepts) used in the story and we also introduce the new notion
of 'cogniton' as the quantum of human thought. Words (concepts) are then
cognitons in different energy states as it is the case for photons in different
energy states, or states of different radiative frequency, when the considered
boson gas is that of the quanta of the electromagnetic field. We show that
Bose-Einstein statistics delivers a very good model for these pieces of texts
telling stories, both for short stories and for long stories of the size of
novels. We analyze an unexpected connection with Zipf's law in human language,
the Zipf ranking relating to the energy levels of the words, and the
Bose-Einstein graph coinciding with the Zipf graph. We investigate the issue of
'identity and indistinguishability' from this new perspective and conjecture
that the way one can easily understand how two of 'the same concepts' are
'absolutely identical and indistinguishable' in human language is also the way
in which quantum particles are absolutely identical and indistinguishable in
physical reality, providing in this way new evidence for our conceptuality
interpretation of quantum theory.

resources, such as battery life and computation capacity. The computation
offloading in MEC can help mobile users to reduce battery usage and speed up
task execution. Although there are many solutions for offloading in MEC, most
usually only employ one MEC server for improving mobile device energy
consumption and execution time. Instead of conventional centralized
optimization methods, the current paper considers a decentralized optimization
mechanism between MEC servers and users. In particular, an assignment mechanism
called school choice is employed to assist heterogeneous users to select
different MEC operators in a distributed environment. With this mechanism, each
user can benefit from minimizing the price and energy consumption of executing
tasks while also meeting the specified deadline. The present research has
designed an efficient mechanism for a computation offloading scheme that
achieves minimal price and energy consumption under latency constraints.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can attain efficient

The adoption of intraocular pCLE scanning is currently limited due to the
narrow field of view and the micron-scale range of focus. In the absence of
motion compensation, physiological tremors of the surgeons' hand and patient

  Therefore, an image-based hybrid control strategy is proposed to mitigate the

Better image quality, smoother motion, and reduced workload are all achieved in

practical procedures for decision making that may accomplish some of what Wald

uses a point estimate of the true state as if the estimate were accurate. It
then extends this idea to as-if maximin and minimax-regret decisions, which use
point estimates of some features of the true state as if they were accurate.
The paper primarily uses finite-sample maximum regret to evaluate the

This is especially beneficial for terahertz radiation, as the corresponding
photon energy lies in the range of a few meV - an energy where no semiconductor
detectors are available and coherent detection schemes or cryogenically cooled
bolometers have to be employed. Here, we report on the first demonstration of
quantum sensing in the terahertz frequency range in which the terahertz photons
interact with a sample in free space and information about the sample thickness
is obtained by the detection of visible photons. A nonlinear single-crystal
interferometer setup with a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal (PPLN)

associated (idler) photons in the terahertz frequency range. Separation from
the pump photons and detection of the visible signal photons is achieved by
using highly efficient and narrowband volume Bragg gratings and an uncooled
scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. The acquired
frequency-angular spectra show quantum interference in the Stokes as well as
the Anti-Stokes part of collinear forward generation caused by spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and down-conversion as well as up-conversion
of thermal photons. The information encoded in the quantum interference can be
used to determine the thickness of coatings or functional layers that are

propose a multi-agent reinforced ranking model, named MarlRank. In particular,
by considering each document as an agent, we formulate the ranking process as a

each document predicts its relevance to a query considering not only its own

defining reward as a function of NDCG, we can optimize our model directly on
the ranking performance measure. Our experimental results on two LETOR

because they ignore the structure and semantics of the objects. We define
semantics as a form of abstraction, in terms of the intrinsic properties of the

automatically. This is facilitated by the graph having two distinct
hierarchies: abstraction and parts, which also makes its representation of
objects more accurate and versatile. Previous semantic networks had only one
amorphous hierarchy and were difficult to build and traverse. Our system
performs both the learning and recognition by an algorithm that traverses both

bottom-up strategies. This reduces dimensionality and obviates the need for the
brute force of big data training.

convert the problem into a binary classification task where the users are

convert the user churn prediction problem into the prediction of user return

at each time-step the model predicts the user return time instead of predicting
a churn label. However, the previous works in this category suffer from lack of

introduce \emph{ChOracle}, an oracle that predicts the user churn by modeling
the user return times to service by utilizing a combination of Temporal Point
Processes and Recurrent Neural Networks. Moreover, we incorporate latent

  The control of a large collection of heterogeneous loads is in part a
resource allocation problem, since different classes of loads are valuable for
different services.
  The goal of this paper is to unveil the structure of the optimal solution to
the resource allocation problem and to investigate short term market
implications. It is found that the marginal cost for each load class evolves on
a two-dimensional subspace, spanned by an optimal costate process and its
derivative.
  The resource allocation problem is recast to construct a dynamic competitive
equilibrium model, in which the consumer utility is the negative of the cost of
deviation from ideal QoS. It is found that a competitive equilibrium exists,
with the equilibrium price equal to the negative of an optimal costate process.
Moreover, the equilibrium price is different from what would be obtained based
on the standard assumption that the consumer's utility is a function of power
consumption.

generating stable biped locomotion. This paper presents an optimal closed-loop
biped locomotion planner which can plan reference trajectories even in
challenging conditions. The proposed planner is designed based on a
Time-Varying Model Predictive Control~(TVMPC) scheme to be able to consider
some constraints in the states, inputs and outputs of the system and also mixed
input-output. Moreover, the proposed planner takes into account the vertical
motion of the Center of Mass~(COM) to generate walking with mostly stretched
knees which is more human-like. Additionally, the planner uses the concept of
Divergent Component of Motion~(DCM) to modify the reference ZMP online to
improve the withstanding level of the robot in the presence of severe
disturbances. The performance and also the robustness of the proposed planner
are validated by performing several simulations using~\mbox{MATLAB}. The
simulation results show that the proposed planner is capable of generating the
biped locomotion robustly.

$p= 10$ GPa and 14 GPa the room temperature resistivity goes through a minimum
and increases again; above $p = 14$ GPa a semiconducting state is observed.
From this pressure up to the highest pressure of $p = 45$ GPa reached in this

an extremely large resistivity reduction between ambient pressure and 10 GPa by
more than 6 orders of magnitude. This decrease is among the largest reported
changes in the resistivity for this narrow pressure regime. We show - by an
analysis of the electronic band structure evolution of this material - that the
large change in resistivity under pressure in not caused by a crossing of the
bands at the Fermi level. We find that it instead stems from two bands that are
pinned at the Fermi level and that are moving towards one another as a
consequence of the mixed-valent to single-valent transition. This mechanism
appears to be especially effective for the rapid buildup of the density of

be well described by a two-gap model consisting of two $s$-wave symmetric gaps

a conventional London superconductor, while more exotic superconducting gap
symmetries cannot be excluded. The intertwining of topological electronic

Computer Vision, typically addressed by matching local descriptors. Recently, a
few attempts at applying the deep learning paradigm to the task have shown
promising results. Yet, the only explored way to learn rotation invariant
descriptors has been to feed neural networks with highly engineered and
invariant representations provided by existing hand-crafted descriptors, a path
that goes in the opposite direction of end-to-end learning from raw data so
successfully deployed for 2D images. In this paper, we explore the benefits of
taking a step back in the direction of end-to-end learning of 3D descriptors by
disentangling the creation of a robust and distinctive rotation equivariant
representation, which can be learned from unoriented input data, and the
definition of a good canonical orientation, required only at test time to
obtain an invariant descriptor. To this end, we leverage two recent
innovations: spherical convolutional neural networks to learn an equivariant
descriptor and plane folding decoders to learn without supervision. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally validated by
outperforming hand-crafted and learned descriptors on a standard benchmark.

trustless electronic cash systems such as Bitcoin. However, these peer-to-peer
networks also introduce a new attack surface which is not well-understood
today. This paper identifies and analyzes, a novel Denial-of-Service attack
which is based on route hijacking, i.e., which exploits the way transactions
are routed and executed along the created channels of the network. This attack
is conceptually interesting as even a limited attacker that manipulates the
topology through the creation of new channels can navigate tradeoffs related to
the way it attacks the network. Furthermore, the attack also highlights a
fundamental design tradeoff for the defender (who determines its own routes):
to become less predictable and hence secure, a rational node has to pay higher
fees to nodes that forward its payments. We find that the three most common
implementations for payment channels in Bitcoin (lnd, C-lightning, Eclair)
approach routing differently. We begin by surveying the current state of the
Lightning network and explore the routes chosen by these implementations. We
find that in the current network nearly 60\% of all routes pass through only
five nodes, while 80\% go through only 10 nodes. Thus, a relatively small
number of colluding nodes can deny service to a large fraction of the network.
  We then turn to study an external attacker who creates links to the network
and draws more routes through its nodes by asking for lower fees. We find that
just five new links are enough to draw the majority (65\% - 75\%) of the
traffic regardless of the implementation being used. The cost of creating these
links is very low.
  We discuss the differences between implementations and eventually derive our
own suggested routing policy, which is based on a novel combination of existing
approaches.

promising sweet spot, achieving accuracy close to full-precision networks on

We evaluate an implementation of TiM-DNN in 32nm technology using an
architectural simulator calibrated with SPICE simulations and RTL synthesis. We
evaluate TiM-DNN across a suite of state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks including
both deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. A 32-tile instance of

cost of training large-scale neural network models. Mini-batch sub-sampling
(MBSS) is often employed for computational tractability. However, MBSS
introduces a sampling error, that can manifest as a bias or variance in a line
search. This is because MBSS can be performed statically, where the mini-batch
is updated only when the search direction changes, or dynamically, where the
mini-batch is updated every-time the function is evaluated. Static MBSS results
in a smooth loss function along a search direction, reflecting low variance but
large bias in the estimated ""true"" (or full batch) minimum. Conversely, dynamic
MBSS results in a point-wise discontinuous function, with computable gradients
using backpropagation, along a search direction, reflecting high variance but
lower bias in the estimated ""true"" (or full batch) minimum. In this study,
quadratic line search approximations are considered to study the quality of
function and derivative information to construct approximations for dynamic
MBSS loss functions. An empirical study is conducted where function and
derivative information are enforced in various ways for the quadratic
approximations. The results for various neural network problems show that being
selective on what information is enforced helps to reduce the variance of

generally, this Cardy-like formula applies for static black holes whose
gravitational entropy scales as a power of the temperature, and is also

scaling power, the black hole mass and the energy of a gravitational soliton
identified as the ground state of the theory. The robustness of this formula is
verified in the most famous example of solution with negative heat capacity,

$\overline{f}$. In this article, we prove a lower estimate on the Newton
polygon of $L(\overline{f},V,s)$. The estimate depends on the local monodromy
of $f$ around each point $x \in X-V$. This confirms a hope of Deligne that the
irregular Hodge filtration forces bounds on $p$-adic valuations of Frobenius

of a curve with an action of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ in terms of local
monodromy invariants.

explanation as an iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the

explanations in a dialog which takes into account three important aspects at
each dialog turn: (a) human's intention (or curiosity); (b) human's
understanding of the machine; and (c) machine's understanding of the human
user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly
modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as
human's mind as inferred by the machine. In other words, these explicit mental
representations in ToM are incorporated to learn an optimal explanation policy
that takes into account human's perception and beliefs. Furthermore, we also
show that ToM facilitates in quantitatively measuring justified human trust in
the machine by comparing all the three mental representations.
  We applied our framework to three visual recognition tasks, namely, image
classification, action recognition, and human body pose estimation. We argue
that our ToM based explanations are practical and more natural for both expert
and non-expert users to understand the internal workings of complex machine
learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to derive
explanations using ToM. Extensive human study experiments verify our
hypotheses, showing that the proposed explanations significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art XAI methods in terms of all the standard quantitative and

multiple-monoenergetic neutron transmission measurements of several

It demonstrates the ability to determine the hydrogenous content of a cargo

areal densities of up to 30 g/cm$^2$ of high density polyethylene (HDPE), even

also allow the unfolding of the individual elemental contributions from an
effective atomic number, $Z_{\mathrm{eff}}$, as determined from multiple

anomalies in temporal streaming data. A variety of algorithms have been
developed in the data mining community, which can be divided into two
categories (i.e., general and ad hoc). In most cases, general approaches assume
the one-size-fits-all solution model where a single anomaly detector can detect
all anomalies in any domain. To date, there exists no single general method
that has been shown to outperform the others across different anomaly types,
use cases and datasets. In this paper, we propose SAFARI, a general framework
formulated by abstracting and unifying the fundamental tasks in streaming
anomaly detection, which provides a flexible and extensible anomaly detection
procedure to overcome the limitations of one-size-fits-all solutions. SAFARI
helps to facilitate more elaborate algorithm comparisons by allowing us to
isolate the effects of shared and unique characteristics of different
algorithms on detection performance. Using SAFARI, we have implemented various
anomaly detectors and identified a research gap that motivates us to propose a
novel learning strategy in this work. We conducted an extensive evaluation
study of 20 detectors that are composed using SAFARI and compared their
performances using real-world benchmark datasets with different properties. The
results indicate that there is no single superior detector that works well for
every case, proving our hypothesis that ""there is no free lunch"" in the
streaming anomaly detection world. Finally, we discuss the benefits and

of a given location, including the type of land cover and the expected land
use. Historically, such tasks have relied on relatively coarse-grained
categories due to the difficulty of obtaining fine-grained annotations. In this
work, we propose an easily extensible approach that makes it possible to
estimate fine-grained properties from overhead imagery. In particular, we
propose a cross-modal distillation strategy to learn to predict the
distribution of fine-grained properties from overhead imagery, without
requiring any manual annotation of overhead imagery. We show that our learned
models can be used directly for applications in mapping and image localization.

Steen, Amir Sadovnik","Unaligned Sequence Similarity Search Using Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gene annotation has traditionally required direct comparison of DNA sequences
between an unknown gene and a database of known ones using string comparison
methods. However, these methods do not provide useful information when a gene
does not have a close match in the database. In addition, each comparison can
be costly when the database is large since it requires alignments and a series
of string comparisons. In this work we propose a novel approach: using
recurrent neural networks to embed DNA or amino-acid sequences in a
low-dimensional space in which distances correlate with functional similarity.
This embedding space overcomes both shortcomings of the method of aligning
sequences and comparing homology. First, it allows us to obtain information
about genes which do not have exact matches by measuring their similarity to
other ones in the database. If our database is labeled this can provide labels
for a query gene as is done in traditional methods. However, even if the
database is unlabeled it allows us to find clusters and infer some
characteristics of the gene population. In addition, each comparison is much
faster than traditional methods since the distance metric is reduced to the
Euclidean distance, and thus efficient approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
can be used to find the best match. We present results showing the advantage of
our algorithm. More specifically we show how our embedding can be useful for
both classification tasks when our labels are known, and clustering tasks where
our sequences belong to classes which have not been seen before.

loss function for classification problems by theoretically analyzing the
intra-class distance and inter-class distance (i.e. the distance between any
two points belonging to the same class and different classes, respectively) in
the feature space, i.e. the space of representations learnt by neural networks.
Specifically, we consider an arbitrary network architecture having a fully
connected final layer with Softmax activation and trained using the
cross-entropy loss. We derive expressions for the value and the distribution of
the squared L2 norm of the product of a network dependent matrix and a random
intra-class and inter-class distance vector (i.e. the vector between any two
points belonging to the same class and different classes), respectively, in the
learnt feature space (or the transformation of the original data) just before
Softmax activation, as a function of the cross-entropy loss value. The main
result of our analysis is the derivation of a lower bound for the probability
with which the inter-class distance is more than the intra-class distance in
this feature space, as a function of the loss value. We do so by leveraging
some empirical statistical observations with mild assumptions and sound
theoretical analysis. As per intuition, the probability with which the
inter-class distance is more than the intra-class distance decreases as the
loss value increases, i.e. the classes are better separated when the loss value
is low. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of theoretical
nature trying to explain the separability of classes in the feature space
learnt by neural networks trained with the cross-entropy loss function.

the growth speed of the instabilities. The main difference between 2-D and 3-D

have no knowledge of the attack-starting time and the misbehaving agents (i.e.,
agents under attack); (ii) in tracking system in the absence of attacks,
Luenberger observer has no constraint on the magnitudes of observer gains and

features to enhance local context representations, based on which the
sequential information flow leads to more specific (slot and intent) global
utterance representations. Through stacking multiple CM-blocks, our CM-Net is
able to alternately perform information exchange among specific memories, local
contexts and the global utterance, and thus incrementally enriches each other.
We evaluate the CM-Net on two standard benchmarks (ATIS and SNIPS) and a
self-collected corpus (CAIS). Experimental results show that the CM-Net
achieves the state-of-the-art results on the ATIS and SNIPS in most of

strategy builds on changing the null-space via switching through a set of
topologies. In this paper, we propose a realistic ZDA variation where the
attacker is aware of this topology-switching strategy, and hence employs the
policy to avoid detection: ""pause (update and resume) attack"" before (after)
topology switching to evade detection. We first systematically study the
proposed ZDA variation, and then develop defense strategies under the realistic
assumptions. Particularly, we characterize conditions for detectability of the

the set of agents to be monitored, and the measurements of the monitored agents

prevalent multi-view data. Among them, spectral clustering-based methods have
drawn much attention and demonstrated promising results recently. Despite
progress, there are still two fundamental questions that stay unanswered to
date. First, how to fuse different views into one graph. More often than not,
the similarities between samples may be manifested differently by different
views. Many existing algorithms either simply take the average of multiple
views or just learn a common graph. These simple approaches fail to consider
the flexible local manifold structures of all views. Hence, the rich
heterogeneous information is not fully exploited. Second, how to learn the
explicit cluster structure. Most existing methods don't pay attention to the
quality of the graphs and perform graph learning and spectral clustering
separately. Those unreliable graphs might lead to suboptimal clustering
results. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view
spectral clustering model which performs graph fusion and spectral clustering
simultaneously. The fusion graph approximates the original graph of each
individual view but maintains an explicit cluster structure. Experiments on
four widely used data sets confirm the superiority of the proposed method.

web-based interactive multi-user power system simulation environment and open

autonomy of a robot at off-road environments. Geometry-based and
appearance-based methods have been studied in decades, while behavior-based
methods exploiting learning from demonstration (LfD) are new trends.
Behavior-based methods learn cost functions that guide trajectory planning in
compliance with experts' demonstrations, which can be more scalable to various
scenes and driving behaviors. This research proposes a method of off-road
traversability analysis and trajectory planning using Deep Maximum Entropy
Inverse Reinforcement Learning. To incorporate vehicle's kinematics while
solving the problem of exponential increase of state-space complexity, two
convolutional neural networks, i.e., RL ConvNet and Svf ConvNet, are developed
to encode kinematics into convolution kernels and achieve efficient forward
reinforcement learning. We conduct experiments in off-road environments. Scene
maps are generated using 3D LiDAR data, and expert demonstrations are either
the vehicle's real driving trajectories at the scene or synthesized ones to
represent specific behaviors such as crossing negative obstacles. Different
cost functions of traversability analysis are learned and tested at various
scenes of capability in guiding the trajectory planning of different behaviors.
We also demonstrate the performance and computation efficiency of the proposed
method.

pre-trained neural networks. For the audio model, we compute an enhanced set of
low-level descriptors including intensity, loudness, cepstrum, linear predictor

concatenated to create audio-visual features, which are used to predict the

time-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While
the static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even
if consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a
static policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits.
To accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy
availability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the

policy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on
full state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic

optimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep
reinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy. The two case

geometry in the analysis of plane curve singularities, which are germs $(C,o)$

The embedded topological type of such a pair $(S, C)$ is usually defined to be
that of the oriented link obtained by intersecting $C$ with a sufficiently
small oriented Euclidean sphere centered at the point $o$, defined once a
system of local coordinates $(x,y)$ was chosen on the germ $(S,o)$. If one
works more generally over an arbitrary algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero, one speaks instead of the combinatorial type of $(S, C)$.
One may define it by looking either at the Newton-Puiseux series associated to
$C$ relative to a generic local coordinate system $(x,y)$, or at the set of
infinitely near points which have to be blown up in order to get the minimal
embedded resolution of the germ $(C,o)$ or, thirdly, at the preimage of this
germ by the resolution. Each point of view leads to a different encoding of the
combinatorial type by a decorated tree: an Eggers-Wall tree, an Enriques
diagram, or a weighted dual graph. The three trees contain the same
information, which in the complex setting is equivalent to the knowledge of the
embedded topological type. There are known algorithms for transforming one tree
into another. In this paper we explain how a special type of two-dimensional
simplicial complex called a lotus allows to think geometrically about the
relations between the three types of trees. Namely, all of them embed in a

lotus is constructed from the finite set of Newton polygons created during any

level of service that is set forth by the American with Disability Act (ADA)
for the visually impaired. One of the major issues of existing APSs is the
failure to deliver adequate crossing information for the visually impaired.
This paper presents a mobile-based APS application, namely Virtual Guide Dog
(VGD). Integrating intersection information and onboard sensors (e.g., GPS,
compass, accelerometer, and gyroscope sensor) of modern smartphones, the VGD
application can notify the visually impaired: 1) the close proximity of an
intersection and 2) the street information for crossing. By employing a screen
tapping interface, VGD can remotely place a pedestrian crossing call to the
controller, without the need of using a push button. In addition, VGD informs
VIs the start of a crossing phase by using text-to-speech technology. The
proof-of-concept test shows that VGD keeps the users informed about the
remaining distance as their approaching the intersection. It was also found
that the GPS-only mode is accompanied by greater distance deviation compared to
the mode jointly operating with both GPS and cellular positioning.

Despite the potential risk they bring, adversarial examples are also valuable
for providing insights into the weakness and blind-spots of DNNs. Thus, the
interpretability of a DNN in the adversarial setting aims to explain the
rationale behind its decision-making process and makes deeper understanding
which results in better practical applications. To address this issue, we try
to explain adversarial robustness for deep models from a new perspective of
neuron sensitivity which is measured by neuron behavior variation intensity
against benign and adversarial examples. In this paper, we first draw the close
connection between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivities, as
sensitive neurons make the most non-trivial contributions to model predictions
in the adversarial setting. Based on that, we further propose to improve
adversarial robustness by constraining the similarities of sensitive neurons
between benign and adversarial examples which stabilizes the behaviors of
sensitive neurons towards adversarial noises. Moreover, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art adversarial training methods improve model robustness by
reducing neuron sensitivities which in turn confirms the strong connections
between adversarial robustness and neuron sensitivity as well as the
effectiveness of using sensitive neurons to build robust models. Extensive

set of objects to their target configuration while satisfying physically
feasibility. In contrast to existing works that assume known object templates,
we are interested in manipulation planning for a category of objects with
potentially unknown instances and large intra-category shape variation. To
achieve it, we need an object representation with which the manipulation
planner can reason about both the physical feasibility and desired object
configuration, while being generalizable to novel instances. The widely-used
pose representation is not suitable, as representing an object with a
parameterized transformation from a fixed template cannot capture large
intra-category shape variation. Hence, we propose a new hybrid object
representation consisting of semantic keypoint and dense geometry (a point
cloud or mesh) as the interface between the perception module and motion
planner. Leveraging advances in learning-based keypoint detection and shape
completion, both dense geometry and keypoints can be perceived from raw sensor
input. Using the proposed hybrid object representation, we formulate the
manipulation task as a motion planning problem which encodes both the object
target configuration and physical feasibility for a category of objects. In
this way, many existing manipulation planners can be generalized to categories
of objects, and the resulting perception-to-action manipulation pipeline is
robust to large intra-category shape variation. Extensive hardware experiments
demonstrate our pipeline can produce robot trajectories that accomplish tasks
with never-before-seen objects.

tensor nuclear norm for third-order tensor completion. In the literature, the
tensor nuclear norm can be computed by using tensor singular value
decomposition based on the discrete Fourier transform matrix, and tensor
completion can be performed by the minimization of the tensor nuclear norm
which is the relaxation of the sum of matrix ranks from all Fourier transformed
matrix frontal slices. These Fourier transformed matrix frontal slices are
obtained by applying the discrete Fourier transform on the tubes of the
original tensor. In this paper, we propose to employ the framelet
representation of each tube so that a framelet transformed tensor can be
constructed. Because of framelet basis redundancy, the representation of each
tube is sparsely represented. When the matrix slices of the original tensor are
highly correlated, we expect the corresponding sum of matrix ranks from all
framelet transformed matrix frontal slices would be small, and the resulting
tensor completion can be performed much better. The proposed minimization model
is convex and global minimizers can be obtained. Numerical results on several
types of multi-dimensional data (videos, multispectral images, and magnetic
resonance imaging data) have tested and shown that the proposed method
outperformed the other testing methods.

have shown that statistical language models can improve the performance of code
completion tools through learning from large-scale software repositories.
However, these models suffer from three major drawbacks: a) The hierarchical
structural information of the programs is not fully utilized in the program's
representation; b) In programs, the semantic relationships can be very long.
Existing recurrent neural networks based language models are not sufficient to
model the long-term dependency. c) Existing approaches perform a specific task
in one model, which leads to the underuse of the information from related
tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
self-attentional neural architecture for code completion with multi-task
learning. To utilize the hierarchical structural information of the programs,
we present a novel method that considers the path from the predicting node to
the root node. To capture the long-term dependency in the input programs, we
adopt a self-attentional architecture based network as the base language model.
To enable the knowledge sharing between related tasks, we creatively propose a
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework to learn two related tasks in code
completion jointly. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

we explore more physics insights through the emission times and momentum
correlations among different light particles. The specific emphasize is the
effects of total pair momentum among different light particles, impact
parameters and in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section. Both two-deuteron and
two-triton correlation functions are anti-correlation due to the final state
interaction, and they are affected by in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section
for the higher total momentum of the particle pairs, but not for the lower
ones. In addition, impact parameter and in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section
dependences of the emission source radii are extracted by fitting the momentum
correlation functions. The results indicate that momentum correlation functions
gating with total pair momentum is stronger for the smaller in-medium

hand, is easy to generate, but generally does not render safe behaviors in
diverse real-life scenarios. In this work we propose a novel method for
learning robust visuomotor policies for real-world deployment which can be
trained purely with simulated data. We develop rich state representations that
combine supervised and unsupervised environment data. Our approach takes a
cross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera
data and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose of
gates to the drone in the case of drone racing. We feed both data modalities
into a novel factored architecture, which learns a joint low-dimensional
embedding via Variational Auto Encoders. This compact representation is then
fed into a control policy, which we trained using imitation learning with
expert trajectories in a simulator. We analyze the rich latent spaces learned

dynamic rating of power transformers to serve the long-term planning purpose.
Historically, research works on dynamic rating have been focused on
real-time/near-future system operations. There has been a lack of research for
long-term planning oriented applications. Currently, most utility companies
still rely on static rating numbers when planning power transformers for the
next few years. In response, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive
method to analyze the past 5-year temperature, loading and load composition
data of existing power transformers in a planning region. Based on such data
and the forecasted area load composition, a future power transformer loading
profile can be constructed by using Gaussian Mixture Model. Then according to
IEEE std. C57.91-2011, a power transformer thermal aging model can be
established to incorporate future loading and temperature profiles. As a
result, annual continuous dynamic rating profiles under different temperature
scenarios can be determined. The profiles can reflect the long-term thermal
overloading risk in a much more realistic and granular way, which can
significantly improve the accuracy of power transformer planning. A real
utility application example in Canada has been presented to demonstrate the
practicality and usefulness of this method.

km~s^{-1}$ through an ambient gas are known to be destroyed by nonthermal
sputtering. Yet, previous studies of nonthermal sputtering disregarded the fact
that dust grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic
mechanical torques from gas-grain collisions. In this paper, we show that such
grain suprathermal rotation can disrupt a small grain into small fragments
because induced centrifugal stress exceeds the maximum tensile strength of
grain material, $S_{\rm max}$. We term this mechanism {\it MEchanical Torque
Disruption} (METD). We find that METD is more efficient than nonthermal
sputtering in destroying smallest grains ($a<10$ nm) of nonideal structures
moving with velocities of $v_{d}<500 \rm km~s^{-1}$. The ratio of rotational
disruption to sputtering time is $\tau_{\rm disr}/\tau_{\rm sp}\sim 0.7(S_{\rm
max}/10^{9}\rm erg~cm^{-3})(\bar{A}_{\rm sp}/12)(Y_{\rm sp}/0.1)(a/0.01\mu
m)^{3}(300\rm km~s^{-1}/v_{d})^{2}$ where $a$ is the radius of spherical
grains, and $Y_{\rm sp}$ is sputtering yield. We also consider the high-energy
regime and find that the rate of METD is reduced and becomes less efficient
than sputtering for $v_{d}>500\rm km~s^{-1}$ because impinging particles only
transfer part of their momentum to the grain. We finally discuss implications
of the METD mechanism for the destruction of hypersonic grains accelerated by
radiation pressure as well as grains in fast shocks. Our results suggest that
the destruction of small grains by METD in fast shocks of supernova remnants
may be more efficient than previously predicted by nonthermal sputtering,
depending on grain internal structures.

that optical losses in Ni do hardly broaden the linewidth of SPP-driven

be used to create time reversed waves. Such waves are special 'pre-scattered'
spatiotemporal fields, which propagate through a complex medium as if observing
a scattering process in reverse, entering the medium as a complicated
spatiotemporal field and arriving after propagation as a desired target field,
such as a spatiotemporal focus. Time reversed waves have previously been
demonstrated for relatively low frequency phenomena such as acoustics, water
waves and microwaves. Many attempts have been made to extend these techniques
into optics. However, the much higher frequencies of optics make for very
different requirements. A fully time reversed wave is a volumetric field with
arbitrary amplitude, phase and polarisation at every point in space and time.
The creation of such fields has not previously been possible in optics. We
demonstrate time reversed optical waves with a device capable of independently
controlling all of light's classical degrees of freedom simultaneously. Such a
class of ultrafast wavefront shaper is capable of generating a sequence of
arbitrary 2D spatial/polarisation wavefronts at a bandwidth limited rate of 4.4

to control both linear and nonlinear optical phenomena.

are of low porosity, were subject to centrally directed pressure, may contain
high temperature products like microchondrules and there is a linear
relationship between the rim thickness and the radius of the enclosed object.
FGRs are thought to have formed by the gentle adhesion of dust onto the central
object with the subsequent compression of this fluffy rim within the parent
body. However, this model does not explain the low porosity, micro-chondrules
and centralized pressure. This model also has difficulties explaining the

FGRs formed by the relatively high-speed interaction between dust and the

microchondrules. FGR formation occurred over a range of lower speeds aided by
vacuum adhesion of fragments from the impacting dust particles. This model
naturally produces the rim thickness linear relationship with non-zero
constant, low porosity and centrally directed pressure. We call this process
kinetic dust aggregation (KDA), which is another name for the aerosol

observed in dependently with the 2.4 meter telescope at the Thai National
Observatory and the 1 meter telescope at Yunnan Observatories. The light curves
were analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney program and the two sets of light curves
produced consistent results, which show that PZ UMa is a W-subtype contact
binary with an extreme mass ratio ($M_{1}/M_{2} = 0.18)$. The basic physical
parameters of PZ UMa were determined to be $M_{2} = 0.77(2)M_\odot$, $M_{1} =
0.14(1)M_\odot$, $R_{2} = 0.92(1)R_\odot$, $R_{1} = 0.43(1)R_\odot$, $L_{2} =
0.46(2)L_\odot$ and $L_{1} = 0.15(3)L_\odot$. The orbital period analysis of PZ
UMa revealed a 13.22 year periodicity, which implies that there may be a
tertiary component orbiting around the binary system. The mass and orbital
radius of the tertiary component were calculated to be $M_{3} = 0.88 M_\odot$
and $a_{3} = 3.67 AU$, if the orbit was coplanar with the central binary
system. It is interesting that the minimum mass of the tertiary was calculated
to be $M_{3min} = 0.84 M_\odot$, which means the tertiary component is even
larger than the primary star and the secondary one of PZ UMa. PZ UMa is a
late-type contact binary with stellar activity. The O'Connell effect appeared
on its light curves when it was observed on April 2016. However, the O'Connell
effect reversed when the target was observed again on December 2016. The
changes of the O'Connell effect in such a short time-scale strongly support the
occurrence of rapidly changing magnetic activity on this W UMa binary.

general methods such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA) and
so forth have been devised to these hard problems, their accuracy and time

have been fabricated using metal catalyzed electroless etching (MCEE)
technique. p-n junction has been produced by spin-on-dopant technique followed
by thermal diffusion process. Front and rear electrodes have been deposited by
e-beam evaporation techniques. SiNW lengths have been controlled from ~ 320 nm

Photovoltaic properties of the solar cells have been characterized by measuring
quantum efficiency and photocurrent density vs. voltage characteristics.
Morphological studies have been carried out by using scanning electron
microscopy. Reduction in light trapping capability comes at the benefit of
reduced surface defects. The reduction of surface defects has been proved to be
more advantageous in comparison to the decrement of light trapping capability.
The major contribution to the changes in cell efficiency comes from the
enhancement of short circuit current density with a very weak dependence on
open circuit voltage. This work is beneficial for the production commercial Si

particle and heat currents between a few-body fermionic Hamiltonian prepared in
one of its eigenstates and an external, weakly coupled Fermi-Dirac gas. The
latter acts as a thermometric probe, with its temperature and chemical
potential set so that there is neither particle nor heat current between the
two subsystems. We argue that the probe temperature can be attributed to the
few-fermion eigenstate in the sense that (i) it varies smoothly with energy
from eigenstate to eigenstate, (ii) it is equal to the temperature obtained
from a thermodynamic relation in a wide energy range, (iii) it is independent
of details of the coupling between the two systems in a finite parameter range,
(iv) it satisfies the transitivity condition underlying the zeroth law of
thermodynamics and (v) it is consistent with Carnot's theorem. These conditions
are essentially independent of the interaction between the few fermions. When
the interaction strength is weak, however, orbital occupancies in the few
fermion system differ from the Fermi-Dirac distribution so that partial
currents from or to the probe will eventually change its state. We find that
(vi) above a certain critical interaction strength, orbital occupancies become
close to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, leading to a true equilibrium between
the few-fermion system and the probe. We conclude that for few-body systems
with sufficiently strong interaction, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
of Deutsch and Srednicki is complemented by ensemble equivalence: individual
many-body eigenstates define a microcanonical ensemble that is equivalent to a
canonical ensemble.

to employ prediction and pose matching in a frame-by-frame manner. For this
type of approach, uncertainty-aware modeling is essential because precise
prediction is impossible. However, previous studies have relied on only a
single prediction without incorporating uncertainty, which can cause critical
tracking errors if the prediction is unreliable. This paper proposes an
extension to this approach with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). This naturally
reformulates the tracking scheme to handle multiple predictions (or hypotheses)
of poses, thereby mitigating the negative effect of prediction errors. An
important component of SMC, i.e., a proposal distribution, is designed as a
probabilistic neural pose predictor, which can propose diverse and plausible
hypotheses by incorporating epistemic uncertainty and heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainty. In addition, a recurrent architecture is introduced to our neural
modeling to utilize time-sequence information of poses to manage difficult
situations, such as the frequent disappearance and reappearances of poses.
Compared to existing baselines, the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art
MOTA score on the PoseTrack2018 validation dataset by reducing approximately
50% of tracking errors from a state-of-the art baseline method.

ground-based stations, these properties allow for the development of new tools
for the measurement of primary cosmic ray fluxes. In order to verify and
quantify the suitability of Trasgo detectors, whether a single one or arrays of
them, to provide reliable information of the properties (mass, energy, incoming
direction) of primary cosmic rays we have started an initiative for the
systematic study of the 'lateral distributions' displayed by electrons and
muons, or by bundles of those particles, using MonteCarlo simulations. In a
first approach, electrons and muons were produced in vertical showers from
primary H, He, C and Fe nuclei, and with incoming energies limited to a maximum
of 10$^{15}$ eV per nucleon. This choice represents a significant component of
all secondary particles, which can be measured on Earth's surface. The lateral
distributions study has been done at the two locations of Santiago de

vehicles with multiple cameras. In this letter we demonstrate that sharing
semantics between cameras with different perspectives and overlapped views can
boost the parsing performance when compared with traditional methods, which
individually process the frames from each camera. Our framework is based on a
deep neural network for semantic segmentation but with two kinds of additional
modules for sharing and fusing semantics. On the one hand, a semantics sharing
module is designed to establish the pixel-wise mapping between the input
images. Features as well as semantics are shared by the map to reduce
duplicated workload which leads to more efficient computation. On the other
hand, feature fusion modules are designed to combine different modal of
semantic features, which leverage the information from both inputs for better
accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have
applied our network to a dual-camera vision system for driving scene parsing.
Experimental results show that our network outperforms the baseline method on
the parsing accuracy with comparable computations.

a great variety of disciplines. It has been playing a significant role in

few decades, particularly, almost all data structures and corresponding
algorithms suitable to searching information generated based on treelike
models. Hence, we, in this paper, study in detail geodesic distance on some
treelike models which can be generated by three different types of operations,
including first-order subdivision, ($1,m$)-star-fractal operation and
$m$-vertex-operation. Compared to the most best used approaches for calculating
geodesic distance on graphs, for instance, enumeration method and matrix
multiplication, we take useful advantage of a novel method consisting in spirit
of the concept of vertex cover in the language of graph theory and mapping. For
each kind of treelike model addressed here, we certainly obtain an exact
solution for its geodesic distance using our method. With the help of computer
simulations, we confirm that the analytical results are in perfect agreement
with simulations. In addition, we also report some intriguing structure
properties on treelike models of two types among them. The one obeys
exponential degree distribution seen in many complex networks, by contrast, the
other possesses all but leaf vertices with identical degree and shows more
homogeneous topological structure than the former. Besides that, the both have,

Accurately diagnosing vascular anomalies is challenging for pediatricians and
primary care physicians due to subtle visual differences and similarity to
other pediatric dermatologic conditions. This can result in delayed or
incorrect referrals for treatment. To address this problem, we developed a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify images of vascular
anomalies and other pediatric skin conditions to aid physicians with diagnosis.
We constructed a dataset of 21,681 clinical images, including data collected
between 2002-2018 at Seattle Children's hospital as well as five
dermatologist-curated online repositories, and built a taxonomy over vascular
anomalies and other common pediatric skin lesions. The CNN achieved an average
AUC of 0.9731 when ten-fold cross-validation was performed across a taxonomy of
12 classes. The classifier's average AUC and weighted F1 score was 0.9889 and
0.9732 respectively when evaluated on a previously unseen test set of six of
these classes. Further, when used as an aid by pediatricians (n = 7), the
classifier increased their average visual diagnostic accuracy from 73.10% to
91.67%. The classifier runs in real-time on a smartphone and has the potential
to improve diagnosis of these conditions, particularly in resource-limited

via Markovian master equations; identifying regions of non-renewal behavior due
to telegraphic switching. Non-renewal behavior is characterized by the
emergence of correlations between successive first-passage times of detection
in one of the leads. Our method of including telegraphic switching is general
for any source-molecule-drain setup, but we consider three specific cases. In
the first, we model stochastic transitions between an Anderson impurity with
and without an applied magnetic field $B$. The last two scenarios couple the
electronic level to a single vibrational mode via the Holstein model. We then
stochastically switch between two vibrational conformations, with different
electron-phonon coupling and vibrational frequency, which corresponds to
different molecular conformations. Finally, we model the molecule attaching and
detaching from an electrode by switching between two different
molecule-electrode coupling strengths. We find, for all three cases, that
including the telegraph process in the master equation induces relatively
strong positive correlations, with Pearson coefficient $p \approx 0.5$, between
successive first-passage times. These correlations only appear, however, when
there is telegraphic switching between two significantly different transport
scenarios, and we show that it arises from the underlying physics of the model.
We also find that, in order for correlations to appear, the switching rate
$\nu$ must be much smaller than the rate of electron transfer $\gamma$.

generalization from data acquired in experiments under controlled conditions
prior to deployment of the equipment. Detecting or predicting failures and
estimating machine health in this way assumes that future field data will have
a very similar distribution to the experiment data. However, many complex
machines operate under dynamic environmental conditions and are used in many
different ways. This makes collecting comprehensive data very challenging, and
the assumption that pre-deployment data and post-deployment data follow very
similar distributions is unlikely to hold. Transfer Learning (TL) refers to
methods for transferring knowledge learned in one setting (the source domain)
to another setting (the target domain). In this work, we present a TL method
for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment, under the assumption
that labels are available only for the source domain and not the target domain.
This setting corresponds to generalizing from a limited number of
run-to-failure experiments performed prior to deployment into making
prognostics with data coming from deployed equipment that is being used under
multiple new operating conditions and experiencing previously unseen faults. We
employ a deviation detection method, Consensus Self-Organizing Models (COSMO),
to create transferable features for building the RUL regression model. These
features capture how different target equipment is in comparison to its peers.
The efficiency of the proposed TL method is demonstrated using the NASA
Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set. Models using the COSMO
transferable features show better performance than other methods on predicting
RUL when the target domain is more complex than the source domain.

  models using integrated partial likelihood",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frailty models are often the model of choice for heterogeneous survival data.
A frailty model contains both random effects and fixed effects, with the random
effects accommodating for the correlation in the data. Different estimation
procedures have been proposed for the fixed effects and the variances of and
covariances between the random effects. Especially with an unspecified baseline
hazard, i.e., the Cox model, the few available methods deal only with a
specific correlation structure. In this paper, an estimation procedure, based
on the integrated partial likelihood, is introduced, which can generally deal
with any kind of correlation structure. The new approach, namely the
maximisation of the integrated partial likelihood, combined with a stochastic
estimation procedure allows also for a wide choice of distributions for the
random effects. First, we demonstrate the almost sure convergence of the
stochastic algorithm towards a critical point of the integrated partial
likelihood. Second, numerical convergence properties are evaluated by
simulation. Third, the advantage of using an unspecified baseline hazard is
demonstrated through application on cancer clinical trial data.

leveraging the annotation of center positions for pedestrians' heads. Promising
progresses have been made with the prevalence of deep Convolutional Neural
Networks. Existing methods widely employ the Euclidean distance (i.e., $L_2$
loss) to optimize the model, which, however, has two main drawbacks: (1) the
loss has difficulty in learning the spatial awareness (i.e., the position of
head) since it struggles to retain the high-frequency variation in the density
map, and (2) the loss is highly sensitive to various noises in crowd counting,
such as the zero-mean noise, head size changes, and occlusions. Although the
Maximum Excess over SubArrays (MESA) loss has been previously proposed to
address the above issues by finding the rectangular subregion whose predicted
density map has the maximum difference from the ground truth, it cannot be
solved by gradient descent, thus can hardly be integrated into the deep
learning framework. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called
SPatial Awareness Network (SPANet) to incorporate spatial context for crowd
counting. The Maximum Excess over Pixels (MEP) loss is proposed to achieve this
by finding the pixel-level subregion with high discrepancy to the ground truth.
To this end, we devise a weakly supervised learning scheme to generate such
region with a multi-branch architecture. The proposed framework can be
integrated into existing deep crowd counting methods and is end-to-end
trainable. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that our
method can significantly improve the performance of baselines. More remarkably,
our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark
datasets.

2) A static magnetic field can be read out at frequencies in the kHz range,

essential role in the design of approximate counting algorithms for spin
systems. A notable example is the algorithm of Weitz (2006) for the hard-core
model on weighted independent sets. We study SSM for the $q$-colorings problem
on the infinite $(d+1)$-regular tree. Weak spatial mixing (WSM) captures
whether the influence of the leaves on the root vanishes as the height of the
tree grows. Jonasson (2002) established WSM when $q>d+1$. In contrast, in SSM,
we first fix a coloring on a subset of internal vertices, and we again ask if
the influence of the leaves on the root is vanishing. It was known that SSM
holds on the $(d+1)$-regular tree when $q>\alpha d$ where $\alpha\approx
1.763...$ is a constant that has arisen in a variety of results concerning
random colorings. Here we improve on this bound by showing SSM for $q>1.59d$.
Our proof establishes an $L^2$ contraction for the BP operator. For the
contraction we bound the norm of the BP Jacobian by exploiting combinatorial
properties of the coloring of the tree.

properties can be derived by calibrating finite element heat transfer models
using experimentally measured temperature records. In the past, the calibration
of the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches,
which was inefficient and prone to error. In this contribution, the calibration
problem is reformulated in a probabilistic setting and solved using the
Bayesian model calibration framework. This not only gives a set of best-fit
parameters but also confidence bounds on the latter. To make this framework
feasible, the procedure is accelerated through the use of advanced surrogate
modelling techniques: polynomial chaos expansions combined with principal
component analysis. This surrogate modelling technique additionally allows one
to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis at no additional cost by
giving access to the Sobol' indices. The calibration is finally validated by
using the calibrated material properties to predict the temperature development
in different experimental setups.

is the question regarding the level of appropriate human and computer
contributions. Engineers and designers lack a way of systematically defining
and delimiting possible options for designing such systems in terms of levels
of automation. In this paper, we propose, apply and reflect on a method for
human-computer configuration design. It supports the systematic investigation
of the design space for developing an interactive intelligent system. We
illustrate our method with a use case in the context of collaborative ideation.
Here, we developed a tool for information extraction from idea content. A
challenge was to find the right level of algorithmic support, whereby the
quality of the information extraction should be as high as possible, but, at
the same time, the human effort should be low. Such contradicting goals are
often an issue in system development; thus, our method proposed helped us to
conceptualize and explore the design space. Based on a critical reflection on
our method application, we want to offer a complementary perspective to the
value-centered design of interactive intelligent systems. Our overarching goal
is to contribute to the design of so-called hybrid systems where humans and
computers are partners.

proposal generation and proposal ranking. It does not exactly conform to the
habit of human cognition. To this end, we propose a novel Realtime
Cross-modality Correlation Filtering method (RCCF). RCCF reformulates the
referring expression comprehension as a correlation filtering process. The
expression is first mapped from the language domain to the visual domain and
then treated as a template (kernel) to perform correlation filtering on the
image feature map. The peak value in the correlation heatmap indicates the
center points of the target box. In addition, RCCF also regresses a 2-D object
size and 2-D offset. The center point coordinates, object size and center point
offset together to form the target bounding box. Our method runs at 40 FPS

benchmarks. In the challenging RefClef dataset, our methods almost double the

the most convenient Charging Station (CS) to Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs)
that need charging. In particular, we use different cost functions to describe
the possibly different priorities of PEV drivers, such as the preference to
minimize charging costs, charging times, or the distance between them and the
CS. For this purpose, we leverage on an IoT architecture based on a
permissioned Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to enforce compliance of
drivers and reduces the occurrence of detrimental misbehaviours of drivers.
Extensive simulations performed with the mobility simulator SUMO in realistic
city-wide networks have been provided to illustrate how the proposed PEV
assignment procedure works in practice, and to validate its performance.

autonomous driving. Although it has advanced considerably in the past few
years, recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discard
temporal coherence in the video sequence and estimate depth independently for
each frame, which often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. To
address this problem, we propose to memorize temporal consistency in the video
sequence, and leverage it for the task of depth prediction. To this end, we
introduce a two-stream CNN with a flow-guided memory module, where each stream
encodes visual and temporal features, respectively. The memory module,
implemented using convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRUs), inputs visual
and temporal features sequentially together with optical flow tailored to our
task. It memorizes trajectories of individual features selectively and
propagates spatial information over time, enforcing a long-term temporal
consistency to prediction results. We evaluate our method on the KITTI
benchmark dataset in terms of depth prediction accuracy, temporal consistency
and runtime, and achieve a new state of the art. We also provide an extensive
experimental analysis, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach
to memorizing temporal consistency for depth prediction.

plays an important role in mathematical optimization and has various
applications in computer vision and machine learning. Usually, binary
optimization problems are NP-hard and difficult to solve due to the binary
constraints, especially when the number of variables is very large. Existing
methods often suffer from high computational costs or large accumulated
quantization errors, or are only designed for specific tasks. In this paper, we
propose a fast algorithm to find effective approximate solutions for general
binary optimization problems. The proposed algorithm iteratively solves
minimization problems related to the linear surrogates of loss functions, which
leads to the updating of some binary variables most impacting the value of loss
functions in each step. Our method supports a wide class of empirical objective
functions with/without restrictions on the numbers of $1$s and $-1$s in the
binary variables. Furthermore, the theoretical convergence of our algorithm is
proven, and the explicit convergence rates are derived, for objective functions
with Lipschitz continuous gradients, which are commonly adopted in practice.
Extensive experiments on several binary optimization tasks and large-scale

greater than 2, having only one fixed point shows that the conjecture does not

the following Arnold-type principle continues to hold in continuous settings:
Suppose that X is a non-smooth object for which one can define spectral

than the number predicted by the (homological) Arnold conjecture, then the set
of fixed/intersection points of X is homologically non-trivial, hence it is

we verify this principle in two new settings: $C^0$ Lagrangians in cotangent

to its own propensity. When all the weight is assigned to the interacting
partner ($\omega=0$), agents' propensities are quickly driven to one of the
extreme values $p=0$ or $p=1$, until an extremist absorbing consensus is
achieved. However, for $\omega>0$ the system first reaches a quasi-stationary
state of symmetric polarization where the distribution of propensities has the
shape of an inverted Gaussian with a minimum at the center $p=1/2$ and two
maxima at the extreme values $p=0,1$, until the symmetry is broken and the
system is driven to an extremist consensus. A linear stability analysis shows
that the lifetime of the polarized state, estimated by the mean consensus time
$\tau$, diverges as $\tau \sim (1-\omega)^{-2} \ln N$ when $\omega$ approaches
$1$, where $N$ is the system size. Finally, a continuous approximation allows
to derive a transport equation whose convection term is compatible with a drift
of particles from the center towards the extremes.

Multi-Weight Traffic Graph Convolutional (MW-TGC) network, is proposed and
applied to two urban networks with contrasting geometric constraints. The model
conducts graph convolution operations on speed data with multi-weighted
adjacency matrices to combine the features, including speed limit, distance,

the combined features to learn the dependencies among the features and reduce
the size of the output to a computationally feasible level. The output of
multi-weight graph convolution is applied to the sequence-to-sequence model
with Long Short-Term Memory units to learn temporal dependencies. When applied
to two urban sites, urban-core and urban-mix, MW-TGC network not only
outperformed the comparative models in both sites but also reduced variance in
the heterogeneous urban-mix network. We conclude that MW-TGC network can
provide a robust traffic forecasting performance across the variations in
spatial complexity, which can be a strong advantage in urban traffic
forecasting.

that this region of heated ionospheric ion is collocated with another heavy

hypercubic lattice, $\zeta^{(d)}(s) = (1/2)\sideset{}{'}\sum_{n_1,\ldots,n_d}
(n_1^2+\cdots+n_d^2)^{-s/2}$ where $\Re(s)>d$ and the summation runs over all
integers excluding the origin. An analytical continuation of the Epstein
function to the whole complex $s$-plane is constructed for spatial dimension
$d$ being a continuous variable ranging from $0$ to $\infty$. We are interested
in zeros $\rho=\rho_x+{\rm i}\rho_y$ defined by $\zeta^{(d)}(\rho) = 0$.
Besides the trivial zeros, there exist ""critical"" zeros (on the critical line)
with $\rho_x=\frac{d}{2}$ and ""off-critical"" zeros (off the critical line) with
$\rho_x \ne \frac{d}{2}$. Our numerical results reveal that critical zeros form
closed or semi-open curves $\rho_y(d)$ which enclose disjunctive regions of the
complex plane $(\rho_x= d/2,\rho_y)$. Each curve involves a number of
left/right edge points $\rho^*$, defined by an infinite tangent ${\rm
d}\rho_y/{\rm d}d\vert_{\rho^*}$, which give rise to two conjugate tails of
off-critical zeros with continuously varying dimension $d$. The curves of
critical and off-critical zeros exhibit a singular expansion around edge points
whose derivation resembles to the one around a critical point of mean-field
type (with exponent $1/2$ for the order parameter) in many-body statistical
models. Further it turns out that for each $d>9.24555\ldots$ there exists a
conjugate pair of {\em real} off-critical zeros which tend to the boundaries
$0$ and $d$ of the critical strip in the limit $d\to\infty$. As a by-product of
the formalism, we derive an exact result for $\lim_{d\to 0} \zeta^{(d)}(s)/d$
and an equidistant distribution of critical zeros along the imaginary axis in
the limit $d\to\infty$.

convolutional neural networks. Nonetheless, most of the previous methods may
not work well in recognizing text with low resolution which is often seen in
natural scene images. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution
techniques as pre-processing. However, conventional super-resolution methods in
the literature mainly focus on reconstructing the detailed texture of natural
images, which typically do not work well for text due to the unique
characteristics of text. To tackle these problems, in this work, we propose a
content-aware text super-resolution network to generate the information desired
for text recognition. In particular, we design an end-to-end network that can
perform super-resolution and text recognition simultaneously. Different from
previous super-resolution methods, we use the loss of text recognition as the
Text Perceptual Loss to guide the training of the super-resolution network, and
thus it pays more attention to the text content, rather than the irrelevant
background area. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in restoring a sharp
high-resolution image from a small blurred one, and show that the recognition
performance clearly boosts up the performance of text recognizer. To our
knowledge, this is the first work focusing on text super-resolution. Code will
be released in https://github.com/xieenze/TextSR.

users has received much attention as a promising technology for the future
wireless systems. In order to maximize the cooperation gain in the cell-free
systems, acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) at the BSs is
crucial. While this task is relatively easy for the time division duplexing
(TDD) systems due to the channel reciprocity, it is not easy for the frequency
division duplexing (FDD) systems due to the CSI feedback overhead. This issue
is even more pronounced in the cell-free systems since the user needs to feed
back the CSIs of multiple BSs. In this paper, we propose a novel feedback
reduction technique for the FDD-based cell-free systems. Key feature of the
proposed technique is to choose a few dominating paths and then feed back the
path gain information (PGI) of the chosen paths. By exploiting the property
that the angles of departure (AoDs) are quite similar in the uplink and
downlink channels (this property is referred to as angle reciprocity), the BSs
obtain the AoDs directly from the uplink pilot signal. From the extensive
simulations, we observe that the proposed technique can achieve more than 80%
of feedback overhead reduction over the conventional CSI feedback scheme.

significantly from that expected from the star formation history due to the
redistribution of stars through radial orbit mixing. We propose and fit a
global model for the Milky Way disk, specified by an inside-out star formation
history, radial orbit mixing, and an empirical, parametric model for its
chemical evolution. We account for the spatially complex survey selection
function, and find that the model fits all data well. We find distinct
inside-out growth of the Milky Way disk; the best fit model implies that the
half-mass radius of the Milky Way disk has grown by 43\% over the last 7 Gyr.
Yet, such inside-out growth still results in present-day age gradient weaker
than 0.1 Gyr/kpc. Our model predicts the half-mass and half-light sizes of the
Galactic disk at earlier epochs, which can be compared to the observed redshift
-size relations of disk galaxies. We show that radial orbit migration can
reconcile the distinct disk-size evolution with redshift, also expected from

first phase, it attempts to rank visited POIs higher than the unvisited ones,

our algorithm tries to rank users' favorite POIs higher on the recommendation

intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs). However, this scenario is difficult
to explain the formation of IMBPs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) less
than 3 d. It has recently been proposed that a system consisting of a neutron
star (NS) and a helium (He) star can form IMBPs with $P_{\rm orb}$ less than 3
d (known as the NS+He star scenario), but previous works can only cover a few
observed sources with short orbital periods. We aim to investigate the NS+He
star scenario by adopting different descriptions of the Eddington accretion
rate ($\dot M_{\rm Edd}$) for NSs and different NS masses ($M_{\rm NS}$)
varying from $1.10\,\rm M_{\odot}$ to $1.80\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Our results can
cover most of the observed IMBPs with short orbital periods and almost half of
the observed IMBPs with long orbital periods. We found that $\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd}$$\propto$$M_{\rm NS}$$^{\rm -1/3}$ could match the observations better
than a specific value for all NSs. We also found that the final spin periods of
NSs slightly decrease with the initial $M_{\rm NS}$. The observed parameters of
PSR J0621+1002, which is one of the well-observed IMBPs whose pulsar mass has
been precisely measured, can be reproduced by the present work.

First, we prove sufficient conditions for the presence of entangled states in

interpolation stage guided by the realistic scene. Using this coarse-to-fine
cascade structure, our method can progressively perceive multi-modal

knowledge, this is the first deep framework for Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud
interpolation, which shows appealing applications in navigation systems
equipped with LiDAR and cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that PLIN
achieves promising performance on the KITTI dataset, significantly
outperforming the traditional interpolation method and the state-of-the-art

commonly sample random configurations following a uniform distribution. In this

hypothesis testing. We show that there is little-to-no agreement in the
automated machine learning literature regarding which methods should be used.
We contrast this disparity with the methods recommended by the broader
statistics literature, and identify a suitable approach. We then select three
popular model-free solutions to CASH and evaluate their performance, with
uniform sampling as well as the proposed sampling scheme, across 67 datasets
from the OpenML platform. We investigate the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation across the three algorithms, and verify empirically that the

of classifiers that can support both fast ruleset updating and high-speed
packet classification. However, existing packet classification approaches focus
either on high-speed packet classification or fast rule update, but no known

(RVH) to effectively accelerate the packet classification with a hash-based

observation that the number of distinct combinations of each field prefix
lengths is not evenly distributed. To reduce the number of hash tables for fast
classification, we introduce a novel concept range-vector with each specified
the length range of each field prefix of the projected rules. RVH can overcome
the major obstacle that hinders hash-based packet classification by balancing
the number of hash tables and the probability of hash collision. Experimental
results demonstrate that RVH can achieve the classification speed up to 15.7

effects in one dimensional quantum disordered isolated systems near the
Many-Body Localization (MBL) transitions. The model is constituted by a
collection of 1d tight-binding chains with on-site random energies, locally
coupled to a weak GOE-like perturbation, which mimics the effect of thermal
inclusions due to delocalizing interactions by providing a local broadening of
the Poisson spectrum. While in absence of such a coupling the model is
localized as expected for the one dimensional Anderson model, increasing the
coupling with the GOE perturbation we find a delocalization transition to a
conducting one driven by the proliferation of quantum avalanches which does not
fit the standard paradigm of Anderson localization. In particular an
intermediate Griffiths region emerges, where exponentially distributed
insulating segments coexist with a few, rare resonances. Typical correlations
decay exponentially fast, while average correlations decay as stretched
exponential and diverge with the length of the chain, indicating that the
conducting inclusions have a fractal structure and that the localization length
is broadly distributed at the critical point. This behavior is consistent with
a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like criticality of the transition. Transport and
relaxation are dominated by rare resonances and rare strong insulating regions,
and show anomalous behaviors strikingly similar to those observed in recent
simulations and experiments in the bad metal delocalized phase preceding MBL.
In particular, we find sub-diffusive transport and power-laws decay of the
return probability at large times, with exponents that gradually change as one
moves across the intermediate region. Concomitantly, the a.c. conductivity
vanishes near zero frequency with an anomalous power-law.

addressing large problems. Load imbalance is one of the major performance
degradation factors of parallel applications. Therefore, distributing,
cleverly, and as evenly as possible, the workload among processing elements

method consists in distributing the workload evenly between PEs and, when load
imbalance appears, redistributing the extra load from overloaded PEs to
underloaded PEs. However, this does not anticipate the load imbalance growth
that may continue during the next iterations. In this paper, we present a first
step toward a novel philosophy of load balancing that unloads the PEs that will
be overloaded in the near future to let the application rebalance itself via
its own dynamics. Herein, we present a formal definition of our new approach
using a simple mathematical model and discuss its advantages compared to the
standard load balancing method. In addition to the theoretical study, we apply
our method to an application that reproduces the computation of a fluid model

rotation is derived from the nuclear Schrodinger equation by applying a
rotation operator to a deformed nuclear ground state. This Hamiltonian is
obtained only when a rigid-flow prescription is used for the three rotation
angles in the rotation operator. Using Hartree-Fock variational and second
quantization methods, the rotor Hamiltonian is transformed into that of a
self-consistent triaxial cranking model (MSCRM-3) with a self-consistent
angular-velocity vector, plus residual terms associated with the square of the
angular momentum operator and with a two-body interaction. The approximations
underlying the conventional cranking model are revealed. For a self-consistent
deformed harmonic oscillator potential, the MSCRM-3 Schrodinger equation is
transformed into that of a uniaxial cranking model plus local potential-energy
cross terms using a rotation of the co-ordinate system. It is shown that
uniform rotation is not generally possible. However, for a slow-wobbling
rotation, an approximate uniform rotation becomes possible. In this limiting
wobbly motion, the potential-energy cross terms are negligibly small, and the
uni-axial cranking-model equation is solved analytically using a generalization
of the isotropic-velocity-distribution condition of Bohr-Mottelson and
Ripka-Blaizot-Kassis. The ground-state rotational-band excitation energy and
quadrupole moment are calculated and compared with the measured data in Ne-20 .
The results explain the mysterious decrease in the excitation-energy level

information through different types of feedback including publishing posts,
leaving comments and other type of reactions. However, some comments or
feedback on SNSs are inconsiderate and offensive, and sometimes this type of
feedback has a very negative effect on a target user. The phenomenon known as
flaming goes hand-in-hand with this type of posting that can trigger almost
instantly on SNSs. Most popular users such as celebrities, politicians and news
media are the major victims of the flaming behaviors and so detecting these
types of events will be useful and appreciated. Flaming event can be monitored
and identified by analyzing negative comments received on a post. Thus, our
main objective of this study is to identify a way to detect flaming events in
SNS using a sentiment prediction method. We use a deep Neural Network (NN)
model that can identity sentiments of variable length sentences and classifies
the sentiment of SNSs content (both comments and posts) to discover flaming
events. Our deep NN model uses Word2Vec and FastText word embedding methods as
its training to explore which method is the most appropriate. The labeled
dataset for training the deep NN is generated using an enhanced lexicon based
approach. Our deep NN model classifies the sentiment of a sentence into five
classes: Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative and Very Negative. To
detect flaming incidents, we focus only on the comments classified into the
Negative and Very Negative classes. As a use-case, we try to explore the
flaming phenomena in the news media domain and therefore we focused on news
items posted by three popular news media on Facebook (BBCNews, CNN and FoxNews)
to train and test the model.

both the distance measurement and hypothesis testing approaches on generated

used for data exploration (e.g. by quantifying the discrepancy/separability
between categories of images), which can be particularly useful in the early

presented with the important property that its quantisation is defined by its
irreducible unitary representations which span the many-nucleon Hilbert space
of every nucleus. The model is uniquely defined by the requirement that its Lie
algebra of observables includes the nuclear quadrupole moments and kinetic
energy. It then follows that there can be no non-zero isoscalar E2 transitions
between any states belonging to its different irreducible representations and,
as a result, the states of the model are uniquely defined with the property
that observed transitions between rotational states of nuclei are to be
expressed in terms of mixtures of the model irreps. The algebraic version of
the unified model parallels the Bohr-Mottelson model in most respects,
including the possibility of including the effects of Coriolis and centrifugal
forces as subsequent perturbations. However, it corrects its treatment of
angular momentum quantisation and no longer uses an over-complete set of
coordinates. These changes have significant implications for the dynamics of
nuclear rotations which are hidden when its moments of inertia are considered
as inertial masses in the standard expression of rotational kinetic energies.
Thus, the developments put a new perspective on the phenomenon of shape
coexistence.

such as Halide and Forma, operate by 1) dividing the image into overlapped
tiles, and 2) fusing loops to improve memory locality. However, current
approaches have limitations: 1) they require intra thread block
synchronization, which has a non-trivial cost, 2) they must choose between
small tiles that require more overlapped computations or large tiles that
increase shared memory access (and lowers occupancy), and 3) their
autoscheduling algorithms use simplified GPU models that can result in
inefficient global memory accesses. We present a new approach for executing
image processing pipelines on GPUs that addresses these limitations as follows.
1) We fuse loops to form overlapped tiles that fit in a single warp, which
allows us to use lightweight warp synchronization. 2) We introduce hybrid
tiling, which stores overlapped regions in a combination of thread-local
registers and shared memory. Thus hybrid tiling either increases occupancy by
decreasing shared memory usage or decreases overlapping computations using
larger tiles. 3) We present an automatic loop fusion algorithm that considers
several factors that affect the performance of GPU kernels. We implement these
techniques in PolyMage-GPU, which is a new GPU backend for PolyMage. Our
approach produces code that is faster than Halide's manual schedules: 1.65x
faster on an NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 1.33 faster on an NVIDIA Tesla V100.

heat flow induced by a pressure gradient. This is done by using Onsager's
reciprocity relationship for the equivalence of the thermo-osmotic and

solvent containing non-interacting solute particles, and (ii) a
single-component fluid without thermal expansivity. The derivation of the
mechano-caloric coefficient appears to be remarkably simple, and provides a
simple interpretation for the connection between interfacial heat and particle

  equation with time-dependent potentials",,,,,"cs.CE cs.NA math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The semiclassical Schr\""odinger equation with time-dependent potentials is an
important model to study electron dynamics under external controls in the
mean-field picture. In this paper, we propose two multiscale finite element
methods to solve this problem. In the offline stage, for the first approach,
the localized multiscale basis functions are constructed using sparse
compression of the Hamiltonian operator at the initial time; for the latter,
basis functions are further enriched using a greedy algorithm for the sparse
compression of the Hamiltonian operator at later times. In the online stage,
the Schr\""odinger equation is approximated by these localized multiscale basis
in space and is solved by the Crank-Nicolson method in time. These multiscale
basis have compact supports in space, leading to the sparsity of stiffness
matrix, and thus the computational complexity of these two methods in the
online stage is comparable to that of the standard finite element method.
However, the spatial mesh size in multiscale finite element methods is $
H=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon) $, while $H=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{3/2})$ in the
standard finite element method, where $\epsilon$ is the semiclassical
parameter. By a number of numerical examples in 1D and 2D, for approximately
the same number of basis, we show that the approximation error of the
multiscale finite element method is at least two orders of magnitude smaller
than that of the standard finite element method, and the enrichment further
reduces the error by another one order of magnitude.

microsensors able to detect local pH changes before irreversible damages caused

variations. They are efficient but often rely on sophisticated and costly
syntheses, and present significant risks of leakage and photobleaching damages,
which is detrimental for mainstream applications. Another approach consists in
exploiting the distance-dependent plasmonic properties of metallic

pH-sensitive sensors remains a challenge. Here, we show how to combine
optically active plasmonic gold nanoparticles and pH-responsive thin shells
into ""plasmocapsules"". Upon pH change, plasmocapsules swell or shrink.
Concomitantly, the distance between the gold nanoparticles embedded in the
polymeric matrix varies, resulting in an unambiguous color change. Billions of
micron-size sensors can thus be easily fabricated. They are non-intrusive,
reusable, and sense local pH changes. Each plasmocapsule is an independent
reversible microsensor over a large pH range. Finally, we demonstrate their
potential use for the detection of bacterial growth, thus proving that
plasmocapsules are a new class of sensing materials.

Supergravity models are with equal field strength at the time of inflation. If
this relationship holds down to the electroweak scale for the corresponding

assign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to
incentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks.
In the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks
which were countered through modification of the metering mechanism.
  This paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically
exploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of
transactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the
metering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the
instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation
between the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory.
Based on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call
Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate
low-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that
generates contracts with a throughput on average 200 times slower than typical
contracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are
vulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in
sync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be
financially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but
also for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential
long-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed

wide fields requires a correction for time and direction-dependent effects.
Applying direction-dependent correction can be done by either partitioning the
image in facets and applying a direction-independent correction per facet, or
by including the correction in the gridding kernel (AW-projection).
  An advantage of AW-projection over faceting is that the effectively applied
beam is a sinc interpolation of the sampled beam, where the correction applied
in the faceting approach is a discontinuous piece wise constant beam. However,
AW-projection quickly becomes prohibitively expensive when the corrections vary
over short time scales. This occurs for example when ionospheric effects are
included in the correction. The cost of the frequent recomputation of the
oversampled convolution kernels then dominates the total cost of gridding.
  Image domain gridding is a new approach that avoids the costly step of
computing oversampled convolution kernels. Instead low-resolution images are
made directly for small groups of visibilities which are then transformed and
added to the large $uv$ grid. The computations have a simple, highly parallel
structure that maps very well onto massively parallel hardware such as
graphical processing units (GPUs). Despite being more expensive in pure
computation count, the throughput is comparable to classical W-projection. The
accuracy is close to classical gridding with a continuous convolution kernel.
Compared to gridding methods that use a sampled convolution function, the new
method is more accurate. Hence the new method is at least as fast and accurate
as classical W-projection, while allowing for the correction for quickly
varying direction-dependent effects.

solutions for reaction-diffusion equations where the reaction function is of
Nagumo (or bistable) type and with diffusivities which are density dependent
and degenerate at zero (one of the equilibrium points of the reaction).
Spectral stability is understood as the property that the spectrum of the
linearized operator around the wave, acting on an exponentially weighted space,
is contained in the complex half plane with non-positive real part. Three
different types of monotone waves are studied: (i) stationary
diffusion-degenerate fronts, connecting the two stable equilibria of the
reaction; (ii) traveling diffusion-degenerate fronts connecting zero with the
unstable equilibrium; and, (iii) non-degenerate fronts. In the first two cases,
the degeneracy is responsible of the loss of hyperbolicity of the asymptotic
coefficient matrices of the spectral problem at one of the end points,
precluding the application of standard techniques to locate the essential
spectrum. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the
spectrum, a generalized convergence of operators technique, the analysis of
singular (or Weyl) sequences and the use of energy estimates. The monotonicity
of the fronts, as well as detailed descriptions of the decay structure of
eigenfunctions on a case by case basis, are key ingredients to show that all
traveling fronts under consideration are spectrally stable in a suitably chosen
exponentially weighted $L^2$ energy space.

$(y,0)^t$ in the periodic channel $\mathbb T \times [-1,1]$ with no-slip
boundary conditions in the vanishing viscosity $\nu \to 0$ limit. We split the
vorticity evolution into the free evolution (without a boundary) and a boundary
corrector that is exponentially localized to at most an $O(\nu^{1/3})$ boundary
layer. If the initial vorticity perturbation is supported away from the
boundary, we show inviscid damping of both the velocity and the vorticity
associated to the boundary layer. For example, our $L^2_t L^1_y$ estimate of
the boundary layer vorticity is independent of $\nu$, provided the initial data
is $H^1$. For $L^2$ data, the loss is only logarithmic in $\nu$. Note both such
estimates are false for the vorticity in the interior. To the authors'
knowledge, this inviscid decay of the boundary layer vorticity seems to be a
new observation not previously isolated in the literature. Both velocity and
vorticity satisfy the expected $O(\exp(-\delta\nu^{1/3}\alpha^{2/3}t))$
enhanced dissipation in addition to the inviscid damping. Similar, but slightly
weaker, results are obtained also for $H^1$ data that is against the boundary
initially. For $L^2$ data against the boundary, we at least obtain the boundary
layer localization and enhanced dissipation.

However, in visually-denied scenarios (e.g. heavy smoke or darkness), pose
estimates degrade or even fail. Thermal cameras are commonly used for
perception and inspection when the environment has low visibility. However,
their use in odometry estimation is hampered by the lack of robust visual
features. In part, this is as a result of the sensor measuring the ambient
temperature profile rather than scene appearance and geometry. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Deep Neural Network model for thermal-inertial odometry
(DeepTIO) by incorporating a visual hallucination network to provide the
thermal network with complementary information. The hallucination network is
taught to predict fake visual features from thermal images by using Huber loss.
We also employ selective fusion to attentively fuse the features from three
different modalities, i.e thermal, hallucination, and inertial features.
Extensive experiments are performed in hand-held and mobile robot data in
benign and smoke-filled environments, showing the efficacy of the proposed
model.

popular and are used for a variety of interventions and outcomes, often chosen
for their feasibility advantages. SW-CRTs must account for time trends in the
outcome because of the staggered rollout of the intervention inherent in the
design. Robust inference procedures and non-parametric analysis methods have
recently been proposed to handle such trends without requiring strong
parametric modeling assumptions, but these are less powerful than model-based
approaches. We propose several novel analysis methods that reduce reliance on
modeling assumptions while preserving some of the increased power provided by
the use of mixed effects models. In one method, we use the synthetic control
approach to find the best matching clusters for a given intervention cluster.
This approach can improve the power of the analysis but is fully
non-parametric. Another method makes use of within-cluster crossover
information to construct an overall estimator. We also consider methods that
combine these approaches to further improve power. We test these methods on
simulated SW-CRTs and identify settings for which these methods gain robustness
to model misspecification while retaining some of the power advantages of mixed
effects models. Finally, we propose avenues for future research on the use of
these methods; motivation for such research arises from their flexibility,
which allows the identification of specific causal contrasts of interest, their
robustness, and the potential for incorporating covariates to further increase
power. Investigators conducting SW-CRTs might well consider such methods when
common modeling assumptions may not hold.

follow a desired trajectory. So far, ADP tracking controllers assume that the
reference trajectory follows time-invariant exo-system dynamics-an assumption
that does not hold for many applications. In order to overcome this limitation,
we propose a new Q-function which explicitly incorporates a parametrized

learned, the associated controller copes with time-varying reference
trajectories without need of further training and independent of exo-system

provide analysis of the important special case of linear quadratic tracking. We
conclude our paper with an example which demonstrates that our new method
successfully learns the optimal tracking controller and outperforms existing

Therefore they can serve as a stellar dust probe in the same way as the Balmer

line in 97 Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The
reddening corrected fluxes follow a tight correlation with a fixed ratio of
7.76 for the He II 1640 to 4686 line ratio. Dust attenuation decreases this
ratio. We provide a relation between the stellar E(B-V) and the observed line
ratio for several attenuation laws. Combining this technique with the use of
the nebular Balmer decrement allows the determination of the stellar and
nebular dust attenuation in galaxies and can probe its effects at different
stellar age and mass regimes, independently of the initial mass function and
the star-formation history. We derived the dust reddening from the He II line
fluxes and compared it to the reddening from the Balmer decrement and from the
slope of the ultraviolet continuum in two star-forming galaxies. The three
methods result in dust attenuations which agree to within the errors. Future
application of this technique permits studies of the stellar dust attenuation
compared to the nebular attenuation in a representative galaxy sample.

literature reviews are required to keep current on work in specific areas. One
tedious work in literature reviews is to find relevant studies amongst
thousands of non-relevant search results. In theory, expert systems can assist
in finding relevant work but those systems have primarily been tested in
simulations rather than in application to actual literature reviews. Hence, few
researchers have faith in such expert systems. Accordingly, using a realistic
case study, this paper assesses how well our state-of-the-art expert system can
help with literature reviews.
  The assessed literature review aimed at identifying test case prioritization
techniques for automated UI testing, specifically from 8,349 papers on IEEE
Xplore. This corpus was studied with an expert system that incorporates an
incrementally updated human-in-the-loop active learning tool. Using that expert
system, in three hours, we found 242 relevant papers from which we identified
12 techniques representing the state-of-the-art in test case prioritization
when source code information is not available. These results were then
validated by six other graduate students manually exploring the same corpus.
Without the expert system, this task would have required 53 hours and would
have found 27 additional papers. That is, our expert system achieved 90% recall
with 6% of the human effort cost when compared to a conventional manual method.
Significantly, the same 12 state-of-the-art test case prioritization techniques
were identified by both the expert system and the manual method. That is, the
27 papers missed by the expert system would not have changed the conclusion of
the literature review.

on-the-fly construction of a bias potential that is function of a selected
number of collective variables. We propose here a change in perspective that
shifts the focus from the bias to the probability distribution reconstruction,
while keeping some of the key characteristics of metadynamics, such as the
flexible on-the-fly adjustments to the free energy estimate. The result is an
enhanced sampling method that presents a drastic improvement in convergence
speed, especially when dealing with suboptimal and/or multidimensional sets of
collective variables. The method is especially robust and easy to use, in fact
it requires only few simple parameters to be set, and it has a straightforward
reweighting scheme to recover the statistics of the unbiased ensemble.
Furthermore it gives more control on the desired exploration of the phase
space, since the deposited bias is not allowed to grow indefinitely and it does
not push the simulation to uninteresting high free energy regions. We
demonstrate the performance of the method in a number of representative
examples.

covariance descriptors (CovDs) that lie on a non-linear symmetric positive

improved version of CovDs for image set coding by extending the traditional
CovDs from Euclidean space to the SPD manifold. Specifically, the manifold of
SPD matrices is a complete inner product space with the operations of
logarithmic multiplication and scalar logarithmic multiplication defined in the
Log-Euclidean framework. In this framework, we characterise covariance
structure in terms of the arc-cosine kernel which satisfies Mercer's condition
and propose the operation of mean centralization on SPD matrices. Furthermore,
we combine arc-cosine kernels of different orders using mixing parameters
learnt by kernel alignment in a supervised manner. Our proposed framework
provides a lower-dimensional and more discriminative data representation for
the task of image set classification. The experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance, measured in terms of recognition accuracy, as compared
with the state-of-the-art methods.

ascent sequences are enumerated by the Fishburn numbers, which appear as the
coefficients of the formal power series $$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\prod_{i=1}^m
(1-(1-t)^i).$$ In this paper, we present a novel way to recursively decompose
ascent sequences, which leads to: (i) a calculation of the Euler--Stirling
distribution on ascent sequences, including the numbers of ascents ($\asc$),
repeated entries $(\rep)$, zeros ($\zero$) and maximal entries ($\max$). In
particular, this confirms and extends Dukes and Parviainen's conjecture on the
equidistribution of $\zero$ and $\max$. (ii) a far-reaching generalization of
the generating function formula for $(\asc,\zero)$ due to Jel\'inek. This is
accomplished via a bijective proof of the quadruple equidistribution of
$(\asc,\rep,\zero,\max)$ and $(\rep,\asc,\rmin,\zero)$, where $\rmin$ denotes
the right-to-left minima statistic of ascent sequences. (iii) an extension of a
conjecture posed by Levande, which asserts that the pair $(\asc,\zero)$ on
ascent sequences has the same distribution as the pair $(\rep,\max)$ on
$({\bf2-1})$-avoiding inversion sequences. This is achieved via a decomposition
of $({\bf2-1})$-avoiding inversion sequences parallel to that of ascent
sequences.
  This work is motivated by a double Eulerian equidistribution of Foata (1977)
and a tempting bi-symmetry conjecture, which asserts that the quadruples
$(\asc,\rep,\zero,\max)$ and $(\rep,\asc,\max,\zero)$ are equidistributed on
ascent sequences.

densities through a rectangular function, which results in a kernel based on
the sinc function with straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero
frequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its use in regression,
the relationship between the sinc kernel and the classic theory is illuminated,
in particular, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior
reconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we show that the sinc
kernel is instrumental in two fundamental signal processing applications:
first, in stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc kernel arises
naturally. Second, for band-pass filtering, where the proposed kernel allows
for a Bayesian treatment that is robust to observation noise and missing data.
The developed theory is complemented with illustrative graphic examples and
validated experimentally using real-world data.

technique that enables wireless communications with low hardware cost and low

multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, where a source communicates with its
destination with the help of an IRS. Our goal is to maximize the spectral
efficiency of this system by jointly optimizing the (active) precoding at the
source and the (passive) phase shifters (PSs) at the IRS. However, this turns
out to be an intractable mixed integer non-convex optimization problem. To
circumvent the intractability, we propose a new sum-path-gain maximization
(SPGM) criterion to obtain a high-quality and efficient suboptimal solution to
this problem. Specifically, the PSs are first designed based on a simplified
optimization problem, which aims to maximize the sum-gains of the spatial paths
between the source and the destination. Then, a low-complexity alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this
simplified problem. Finally, with the above obtained PSs, the source precoding
is derived by performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the
effective channel between the source and the destination. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance.

of this capture reaction, the ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$-${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$
scattering phase shifts, as well as properties of ${}^{7}\mathrm{Be}$, have
been used to constrain employed theoretical models. Here we show that much more
information than was previously appreciated can be extracted from
angle-integrated capture data alone. We use the next-to-leading-order (NLO)
amplitude in an effective field theory (EFT) for the reaction to perform the
extrapolation. At this order the EFT describes the reaction using an s-wave
scattering length and effective range, the asymptotic properties of the final
bound states, and short-distance contributions to the $E1$ capture amplitude.
We extract the multi-dimensional posterior of all these parameters via a
Bayesian analysis. We find that properties of the ${}^{7}\mathrm{Be}$ ground
and excited states are well constrained. The total $S$ factor $S(0)=
0.578^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ keV~b, while the branching ratio for excited- to
ground-state capture at zero energy, $Br(0)=0.406^{+0.013}_{-0.011}$, both at
68\% degree of belief. This $S(0)$ is broadly consistent with other recent
evaluations, including the previously recommended value $S(0)=0.56 \pm 0.03$ eV
b, but has a smaller error bar. We also find significant constraints on the
scattering parameters, and we obtain constraints on the $S(E)$'s angular
dependence. The path forward seems to lie with better measurements of the
scattering phase shift and $S(E)$'s angular dependence, together with better
understanding of the asymptotic normalization coefficients of the ${}^7$Be

systems when constraints are given for the combinations of configurations.
Combinatorial interaction strategies can systematically reduce the number of
test cases to construct a minimal test suite without affecting the
effectiveness of the tests. This paper presents a new efficient search-based
strategy to generate constrained interaction test suites to cover all possible
combinations. The paper also shows a new application of constrained interaction
testing in software fault searches. The proposed strategy initially generates
the set of all possible t-tuple combinations; then, it filters out the set by
removing the forbidden t-tuples using the base forbidden tuple (BFT) approach.
The strategy also utilizes a mixed neighborhood tabu search (TS) to construct
optimal or near-optimal constrained test suites. The efficiency of the proposed
method is evaluated through a comparison against two well-known
state-of-the-art tools. The evaluation consists of three sets of experiments
for 35 standard benchmarks. Additionally, the effectiveness and quality of the
results are assessed using a real-world case study. Experimental results show
that the proposed strategy outperforms one of the competitive strategies, ACTS,
for approximately 83% of the benchmarks and achieves similar results to CASA
for 65% of the benchmarks when the interaction strength is 2. For an
interaction strength of 3, the proposed method outperforms other competitive
strategies for approximately 60% and 42% of the benchmarks. The proposed
strategy can also generate constrained interaction test suites for an
interaction strength of 4, which is not possible for many strategies.
Real-world case study shows that the generated test suites can effectively

accessible, or partially observed. Downstream learning tasks on these
incomplete networks can produce low quality results. In addition, reducing the
incompleteness of the network can be costly and nontrivial. As a result,
network discovery algorithms optimized for specific downstream learning tasks
given resource collection constraints are of great interest. In this paper, we
formulate the task-specific network discovery problem in an incomplete network
setting as a sequential decision making problem. Our downstream task is
selective harvesting, the optimal collection of vertices with a particular
attribute. We propose a framework, called Network Actor Critic (NAC), which
learns a policy and notion of future reward in an offline setting via a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm. The NAC paradigm utilizes a task-specific
network embedding to reduce the state space complexity. A detailed comparative
analysis of popular network embeddings is presented with respect to their role
in supporting offline planning. Furthermore, a quantitative study is presented
on several synthetic and real benchmarks using NAC and several baselines. We
show that offline models of reward and network discovery policies lead to
significantly improved performance when compared to competitive online
discovery algorithms. Finally, we outline learning regimes where planning is
critical in addressing sparse and changing reward signals.

the probability of large vacuum fluctuations compared to time averaging alone,
we find that the probability distribution decreases more slowly than
exponentially as the magnitude of the measured energy density increases. This
implies that vacuum fluctuations can sometimes dominate over thermal

the available methods. Also, the L+ Laplace transform of the impulse becomes
zero, thus involving an inconsistency. In contrast to these direct approaches,
some studies propose convoluted methods to address the issue. Here, a direct,

It computes the consistent 0+ initial conditions and solution based on
singular-nonsingular decomposition of the system model. The inconsistency
associated with the L+ Laplace transform of discontinuous functions and impulse
is not involved in the nonsingular part. The emergence of discontinuity is
easily elucidated from the singular part, and the solution yields the same 0+

modelled velocities attract deployed drifters and manikins emulating people
fallen in the water. TRAPs, which remain hidden to prior flow diagnostics, thus
provide critical information for hazard responses, such as SAR and oil spill
containment, and hence have the potential to save lives and limit environmental

to design and train DNN models in a way such that, the DNN inference

that for a wormhole solution in the framework of this model, after the nominal
classical density exceeds a critical value in the Planck range, the components
of the energy-momentum tensor become negative in a certain order. First, the

physically legitimate stellar model. We have seen the measurement of basic
physical parameter such as pressure, density, energy and redshift are satisfied
the reality condition. All the physical quantities such as density, pressure
pressure-density ratio and speed of sound is monotonically decreasing. The
outcomes acquired are valuable in exploring the strength of other compact
objects like white dwarfs, gravastars and neutron stars. Finally, we have shown
that the obtained solutions are compatible with observational data for compact
objects.

interest, since, discovering communities reveals hidden information about
networks. There exist many algorithms to detect inherent community structures
and recently few of them are investigated on social networks. However, it is
non-trivial to decide the best approach in the presence of diverse nature of
graphs, in terms of density and sparsity, and inadequate analysis of the
results. Therefore, in this study, we analyze and compare various algorithms to
detect communities in two networks, namely social and road networks, with
varying structural properties. The algorithms under consideration are evaluated
with unique metrics for internal and external connectivity of communities that
includes internal density, average degree, cut ratio, conductance, normalized
cut, and average Jaccard Index. The evaluation results revealed key insights
about selected algorithms and underlying community structures.
