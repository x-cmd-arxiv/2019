namely the query-commit and price-of-information models. In the query-commit
model, an edge e independently exists with probability $p_e$. We can query
whether an edge exists or not, but if it does exist, then we have to take it
into our solution. In the unweighted case, one can query edges in the order
given by the classical online algorithm of Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani to get
a $(1-1/e)$-approximation. In contrast, the previously best known algorithm in
the weighted case is the $(1/2)$-approximation achieved by the greedy algorithm
that sorts the edges according to their weights and queries in that order.
  Improving upon the basic greedy, we give a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm
in the weighted query-commit model. We use a linear program (LP) to upper bound
the optimum achieved by any strategy. The proposed LP admits several structural
properties that play a crucial role in the design and analysis of our
algorithm. We also extend these techniques to get a $(1-1/e)$-approximation
algorithm for maximum bipartite matching in the price-of-information model
introduced by Singla, who also used the basic greedy algorithm to give a
$(1/2)$-approximation.

Chinese online financial news, to predict Chinese stock tendency and stock
prices based on support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we collect 2,302,692
news items, which date from 1/1/2008 to 1/1/2015. Secondly, based on this
dataset, a specific domain stop-word dictionary and a precise sentiment
dictionary are formed. Thirdly, we propose a forecasting model using SVM. On
the algorithm of SVM implementation, we also propose two-parameter optimization
algorithms to search for the best initial parameter setting. The result shows
that parameter G has the main effect, while parameter C's effect is not
obvious. Furthermore, support vector regression (SVR) models for different
Chinese stocks are similar whereas in support vector classification (SVC)
models best parameters are quite differential. Series of contrast experiments
show that: a) News has significant influence on stock market; b) Expansion
input vector for additional situations when that day has no news data is better
than normal input in SVR, yet is worse in SVC; c) SVR shows a fantastic degree
of fitting in predicting stock fluctuation while such result has some time lag;
d) News effect time lag for stock market is less than two days; e) In SVC,
historic stock data has a most efficient time lag which is about 10 days,
whereas in SVR this effect is not obvious. Besides, based on the special
structure of the input vector, we also design a method to calculate the
financial source impact factor. Result suggests that the news quality and
audience number both have a significant effect on the source impact factor.
Besides, for Chinese investors, traditional media has more influence than
digital media.

first identify causes of the precision losses for unproven properties. While
most of the existing work has diagnosed main causes of imprecision in static
analysis by manual investigation, manually tracing the imprecision causes is
challenging because it requires detailed knowledge of analyzer internals.
Recently, several studies proposed to localize the analysis imprecision causes
automatically, but these localization techniques work for only specific
analysis techniques.
  In this paper, we present an automatic technique that can trace analysis
imprecision causes of JavaScript applications starting from user-selected
variables. Given a set of program variables, our technique stops an analysis
when any of the variables gets imprecise analysis values. It then traces the
imprecise analysis values using intermediate analysis results back to program
points where the imprecision first started. Our technique shows the trace
information with a new representation called tracing graphs, whose nodes and
edges together represent traces from imprecise points to precise points. In
order to detect major causes of analysis imprecision automatically, we present
four node/edge patterns in tracing graphs for common imprecision causes. We
formalized the technique of generating tracing graphs and identifying patterns,
and implemented them on SAFE, a state-of-the-art JavaScript static analyzer
with various analysis configurations, such as context-sensitivity,
loop-sensitivity, and heap cloning. Our evaluation demonstrates that the
technique can easily find 96 % of the major causes of the imprecision problems
in 17 applications by only automatic detection in tracing graphs using the
patterns, and selectively adopting various advanced techniques can eliminate
the found causes of imprecision.

suspended in a simple viscous liquid, very closely resembles the case of an
ideal random walker. A variety of new phenomena have been observed when such
colloid is suspended in a viscoelastic fluid instead, for example pronounced
nonlinear responses when the viscoelastic bath is driven out of equilibrium.
Here, using a micron-sized particle in a micellar solution, we investigate in
detail, how these nonlinear bath properties leave their fingerprints already in
equilibrium measurements, for the cases where the particle is unconfined or
trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the coefficients in an effective
linear (generalized) Langevin equation show intriguing inter-dependencies,
which can be shown to arise only in nonlinear baths: For example, the friction
memory can depend on the external potential that acts only on the colloidal
particle (as recently noted in simulations of molecular tracers in water in
Phys. Rev. X 7, 041065 (2017)), it can depend on the mass of the colloid, or,
in an overdamped setting, on its bare diffusivity. These inter-dependencies,
caused by so-called fluctuation renormalizations, are seen in an exact small
time expansion of the friction memory based on microscopic starting points.
Using linear response theory, they can be interpreted in terms of
microrheological modes of force-controlled or velocity-controlled driving. The
mentioned nonlinear markers are observed in our experiments, which are
astonishingly well reproduced by a stochastic Prandtl-Tomlinson model mimicking
the nonlinear viscoelastic bath. The pronounced nonlinearities seen in our
experiments together with the good understanding in a simple theoretical model
make this system a promising candidate for exploration of colloidal motion in
nonlinear stochastic environments.

employs a formulation of quantum field theory based on equal-time correlation

illustrated by estimating the irreducible vertices at equal times both
analytically and using numerical simulations. We then demonstrate explicitly

applies to general-sum, many-player games. Despite this, prior studies of PSRO
have been focused on two-player zero-sum games, a regime wherein Nash
equilibria are tractably computable. In moving from two-player zero-sum games
to more general settings, computation of Nash equilibria quickly becomes
infeasible. Here, we extend the theoretical underpinnings of PSRO by
considering an alternative solution concept, $\alpha$-Rank, which is unique
(thus faces no equilibrium selection issues, unlike Nash) and applies readily
to general-sum, many-player settings. We establish convergence guarantees in
several games classes, and identify links between Nash equilibria and
$\alpha$-Rank. We demonstrate the competitive performance of
$\alpha$-Rank-based PSRO against an exact Nash solver-based PSRO in 2-player
Kuhn and Leduc Poker. We then go beyond the reach of prior PSRO applications by
considering 3- to 5-player poker games, yielding instances where $\alpha$-Rank
achieves faster convergence than approximate Nash solvers, thus establishing it
as a favorable general games solver. We also carry out an initial empirical
validation in MuJoCo soccer, illustrating the feasibility of the proposed

  https://seas.upenn.edu/~nkolot/projects/spin",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-based human pose estimation is currently approached through two
different paradigms. Optimization-based methods fit a parametric body model to
2D observations in an iterative manner, leading to accurate image-model
alignments, but are often slow and sensitive to the initialization. In
contrast, regression-based methods, that use a deep network to directly
estimate the model parameters from pixels, tend to provide reasonable, but not
pixel accurate, results while requiring huge amounts of supervision. In this
work, instead of investigating which approach is better, our key insight is
that the two paradigms can form a strong collaboration. A reasonable, directly
regressed estimate from the network can initialize the iterative optimization
making the fitting faster and more accurate. Similarly, a pixel accurate fit
from iterative optimization can act as strong supervision for the network. This
is the core of our proposed approach SPIN (SMPL oPtimization IN the loop). The
deep network initializes an iterative optimization routine that fits the body
model to 2D joints within the training loop, and the fitted estimate is
subsequently used to supervise the network. Our approach is self-improving by
nature, since better network estimates can lead the optimization to better
solutions, while more accurate optimization fits provide better supervision for
the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different
settings, where 3D ground truth is scarce, or not available, and we
consistently outperform the state-of-the-art model-based pose estimation
approaches by significant margins. The project website with videos, results,

hierarchical decision approach to resource planning and allocation considers
only technology planning as a strategic-level decision, with workforce
recruiting and training planning as a subsequent tactical-level decision.
However, two other decision approaches - joint and integrated - elevate
workforce planning to the same strategic level as technology planning. Thus we
investigate the impact of strategically aligning technology and workforce
decisions through the comparison of joint and integrated models to each other
and to a baseline hierarchical model in terms of the total cost. Numerical
experiments are conducted to characterize key features of solutions provided by
these approaches under conditions typically found in this type of service
company. Our results show that the integrated model is the lowest cost across
all conditions. This is because the integrated approach maintains a small but
skilled workforce that can operate new and more advanced technology with higher
capacity. However, the cost performance of the joint model is very close to the
integrated model under many conditions and is easier to implement
computationally and managerially, making it a good choice in many environments.
Managerial insights derived from this study can serve as a valuable guide for
choosing the proper decision approach for technology-oriented and

global scene descriptors only provide coarse information. We therefore present
SegMap: a map representation solution for localization and mapping based on the
extraction of segments in 3D point clouds. Working at the level of segments
offers increased invariance to view-point and local structural changes, and
facilitates real-time processing of large-scale 3D data. SegMap exploits a
single compact data-driven descriptor for performing multiple tasks: global
localization, 3D dense map reconstruction, and semantic information extraction.
The performance of SegMap is evaluated in multiple urban driving and search and

We present an efficient novel numerical scheme to accurately compute the
evolution of the particle distribution function by solving the Fokker-Planck
equation with a low number of spectral bins (10 - 20), which is required to
include a full spectrum for every computational fluid element. The distribution
function is represented by piecewise power laws and is not forced to be
continuous, which enables an optimal representation of the spectrum. The
Fokker-Planck equation is solved with a two-moment approach evolving the CR
number and energy density. The low numerical diffusion of the scheme reduces
the numerical errors by orders of magnitude in comparison to classical schemes
with piecewise constant spectral representations. With this method not only the
spectral evolution of CRs can be computed accurately in magnetohydrodynamic
simulations but also their dynamical impact as well as CR ionisation. This
allows for more accurate models for astrophysical plasmas, like the

structure, approximate or coarse-grained dynamics, decoherence, and the
emergence of classicality. It is straightforward to produce a reduced density
matrix with the partial-trace map by ``tracing out'' part of the quantum state,
but in many natural situations this reduction may not be achievable. We
investigate the general problem of identifying how the quantum state reduces
given a restriction on the observables. For example, in an experimental
setting, the set of observables that can actually be measured is usually modest
(compared to the set of all possible observables) and their resolution is
limited. In such situations, the appropriate state-reduction map can be defined
via a generalized bipartition, which is associated with the structure of
irreducible representations of the algebra generated by the restricted set of
observables. One of our main technical results is a general, not inherently
numeric, algorithm for finding irreducible representations of matrix algebras.
We demonstrate the viability of this approach with two examples of
limited--resolution observables. The definition of quantum state reductions can
also be extended beyond algebras of observables. To accomplish this task we
introduce a more flexible notion of bipartition, the partial bipartition, which
describes coarse-grainings preserving information about a limited set (not
necessarily algebra) of observables. We describe a variational method to choose
the coarse-grainings most compatible with a specified Hamiltonian, which
exhibit emergent classicality in the reduced state space. We apply this
construction to the concrete example of the 1-D Ising model. Our results have
relevance for quantum information, bulk reconstruction in holography, and

stars, apart from their monumental astrophysical significance, could also shed
light on fundamental physics and exotic particle states. One such avenue is
based on the fact that magnetic fields cause deformations of a neutron star,
which results in a magnetic-field-induced quadrupole ellipticity. If the
magnetic and rotation axes are different, this quadrupole ellipticity may
generate continuous gravitational waves which may last decades, and may be
observable in current or future detectors. Light, milli-magnetic monopoles, if
they exist, could be pair-produced non-perturbatively in the extreme magnetic
fields of neutron stars, such as magnetars. This non-perturbative production
furnishes a new, direct dissipative mechanism for the neutron star magnetic
fields. Through their consequent effect on the magnetic-field-induced
quadrupole ellipticity, they may then potentially leave imprints in the early
stage continuous gravitational wave emissions. We speculate on this possibility
in the present study, by considering some of the relevant physics and taking a
very simplified toy model of a magnetar as the prototypical system. Preliminary
indications are that new-born millisecond magnetars could be promising
candidates to look for such imprints. Deviations from conventional evolution,
and comparatively abrupt features in the early stage gravitational waveforms,
distinct from other astrophysical contributions, could be distinguishable
signatures for these exotic monopole states.

itself. This is not an effect we can remove but instead needs to be accurately
modelled to ensure we infer the correct physical parameters from an
observation. We describe the full calculation of the distortion of the 21-cm
signal, and propose a new code that integrates the 21-cm intensity along the
line of sight for each individual light cone pixel to fully capture the
intensity contributions from multiple redshifts. This algorithm naturally deals
with the typical divergences found in standard approaches, allowing for large
optical depths and 21-cm absorption events at high redshifts. We find the new
method results in up to a 60% decrease in power on the largest scales on the
sky, and an increase of over 80% on the smallest scales on the sky. We find
that the new implementation of the light cone results in a longer tail of
bright temperatures in the brightness temperature distribution, as a result of
the successful circumventing of a previous cap that had to be implemented to
avoid a divergence in the brightness temperature. We conclude that this full
treatment of the evolution of the light cone pixel can be an important effect.

the spectral hardening found by previous experiments and reveals a softening at
~13.6 TeV, with the spectral index changing from ~2.60 to ~2.85. Our result
suggests the existence of a new spectral feature of cosmic rays at energies
lower than the so-called knee, and sheds new light on the origin of Galactic

economy, and sustainability, but measuring it is challenging and controversial.
Previous studies of taxis are limited to taxi stands or hail markets at
aggregate spatial units. Here we estimate the dynamic demand and supply of
taxis in New York City (NYC) at street segment level, using in-vehicle Global
Positioning System (GPS) data which preserve individual privacy. To this end,
we model taxi demand and supply as non-stationary Poisson random fields on the
road network, and pickups result from income-maximizing drivers searching for
impatient passengers. With 868 million trip records of all 13,237 licensed
taxis in NYC in 2009 - 2013, we show that while taxi demand are almost the same
in 2011 and 2012, it declined about 2% in spring 2013, possibly caused by
transportation network companies (TNCs) and fare raise. Contrary to common
impression, street-hail taxis out-perform TNCs such as Uber in high-demand
locations, suggesting a taxi/TNC regulation change to reduce congestion and
pollution. We show that our demand estimates are stable at different supply
levels and across years, a property not observed in existing matching
functions. We also validate that taxi pickups can be modeled as Poisson
processes. Our method is thus simple, feasible, and reliable in estimating
street-hail taxi activities at a high spatial resolution; it helps quantify the
ongoing discussion on congestion charges to taxis and TNCs.

where in each step one is allowed to move along a fixed set of directions,
called circuits, that is a superset of the edges of a polytope. We show that in
the circuit-augmentation framework the greatest-improvement and Dantzig pivot
rules are NP-hard, already for 0/1-LPs. Differently, the steepest-descent pivot
rule can be carried out in polynomial time in the 0/1 setting, and the number
of circuit augmentations required to reach an optimal solution according to
this rule is strongly-polynomial for 0/1-LPs.
  The number of circuit augmentations has been of interest as a proxy for the
number of steps in the Simplex method, and the circuit-diameter of polyhedra
has been studied as a lower bound to the combinatorial diameter of polyhedra.
Extending prior results, we show that for any polyhedron $P$ the
circuit-diameter is bounded by a polynomial in the input bit-size of $P$. This
is in contrast with the best bounds for the combinatorial diameter of
polyhedra.
  Interestingly, we show that the circuit-augmentation framework can be
exploited to make novel conclusions about the classical Simplex method itself:
In particular, as a byproduct of our circuit results, we prove that (i)
computing the shortest (monotone) path to an optimal solution on the 1-skeleton
of a polytope is NP-hard, and hard to approximate within a factor better than
2, and (ii) for $0/1$ polytopes, a monotone path of strongly-polynomial length

spin-triplet state, we introduce and study a variant of the $t-J$ model in
which the holes carry S=1. We name this new model the Type II $t-J$ model. We
find two distinct mechanisms for $d$ wave superconductivity. In both scenarios
the pairing is driven by the spin coupling $J$. However, coherence is gained in
distinct ways in these two scenarios. In the first case, the spin-one holes
condense leading to a $d$ wave superconductor along with spin-symmetry
breaking. Different orders including spin-nematic orders are possible. This
scenario is captured by a spin one slave boson theory. In the second scenario,
a coherent and symmetric $d$ wave superconductor is achieved from ""Kondo
resonance"": spin one holes contribute two electrons to form large Fermi surface
together with the spin 1/2 singly occupied sites. The large Fermi surface then
undergoes $d$ wave pairing because of spin coupling $J$, similar to heavy
fermion superconductor. We propose a three-fermion parton theory to treat these
two different scenarios in one unified framework and calculate its doping phase
diagram within a self consistent mean field approximation. Our study shows that
a combination of ""cuprate physics"" and ""heavy fermion physics"" may emerge in

vision tasks, where it is comparatively easy to apply imperceptible
perturbations without changing an image's semantic meaning. In our work, we
adapt AutoAugment to automatically discover effective perturbation policies for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as dialogue generation. We start
with a pool of atomic operations that apply subtle semantic-preserving
perturbations to the source inputs of a dialogue task (e.g., different POS-tag
types of stopword dropout, grammatical errors, and paraphrasing). Next, we
allow the controller to learn more complex augmentation policies by searching
over the space of the various combinations of these atomic operations.
Moreover, we also explore conditioning the controller on the source inputs of
the target task, since certain strategies may not apply to inputs that do not
contain that strategy's required linguistic features. Empirically, we
demonstrate that both our input-agnostic and input-aware controllers discover
useful data augmentation policies, and achieve significant improvements over
the previous state-of-the-art, including trained on manually-designed policies.

interaction of a planet with the gas disc, providing original outcomes.
However, FARGO3D does not consider the gas accretion of the planet which may
affect the planetary migration process. Thus, the aim of this paper is to
include a model for the gas accretion in the FARGO3D code. For this task, we
choose Russell's scheme, which is an adaptation of Kley's model for the gas
accretion on to migrating planets. Initially, we study the influence of the gas
accretion on to the planet on type II migration of giant planets. For this
purpose, we follow the evolution of planets in a 2D locally isothermal disc
with a specific accretion rate and different values of viscosity and planetary
mass considering two scenarios. In the first, the gas mass is withdrawn from
the disc and is not added to the planet. In the second, the planets migrate,
while their masses grow due to the gas accretion. Then, we extend our study to
estimate the time needed for a low-mass planet to open a gap in the gas disc
and compare its value with the characteristic time of type I migration.

genomes with the same content allowing only inversions of DNA segments, can be
exactly computed thanks to a pioneering approach of Hannenhalli and Pevzner
from 1995. In 2000, El-Mabrouk extended the inversion model to perform the
comparison of unichromosomal genomes with unequal contents, combining
inversions with insertions and deletions (indels) of DNA segments, giving rise
to the inversion-indel distance. However, only a heuristic was provided for its
computation. In 2005, Yancopoulos, Attie and Friedberg started a new branch of
research by introducing the generic double cut and join (DCJ) operation, that
can represent several genome rearrangements (including inversions). In 2006,
Bergeron, Mixtacki and Stoye showed that the DCJ distance can be computed in
linear time with a very simple procedure. As a consequence, in 2010 we gave a
linear-time algorithm to compute the DCJ-indel distance. This result allowed
the inversion-indel model to be revisited from another angle. In 2013, we could
show that, when the diagram that represents the relation between the two
compared genomes has no bad components, the inversion-indel distance is equal
to the DCJ-indel distance. In the present work we complete the study of the
inversion-indel distance by giving the first algorithm to compute it exactly

Fourier density amplitude: this can be interpreted as evidence for the role of
bars in ring formation. The sizes of inner rings, normalised by the disk size,
are positively correlated with bar strength: this can be linked to the radial

the pattern speed decreases. The fraction of rings is larger in barred galaxies

high dimensional yet finite sample nature of trauma data collected from

treatment protocols has not been statistically evaluated.To conduct robust and
reliable estimation with sparse data, we built an estimation ""machine"" for
estimating causal impacts of candidate variables using the collaborative
targeted maximum loss-based estimation(CTMLE) framework.The computational
efficiency is achieved by using the scalable version of CTMLE such that the
covariates are pre-ordered by summary statistics of their importance before
proceeding to the estimation steps.To extend the application of the estimator
in practice, we used super learning in combination with CTMLE to flexibly
choose the best convex combination of algorithms. By selecting the optimal
covariates set in high dimension and reducing constraints in choosing
pre-ordering algorithms, we are able to construct a robust and data-adaptive
model to estimate the parameter of interest.Under this estimation framework,
CTMLE outperformed the other doubly robust estimators(IPW,AIPW,stabilized
IPW,TMLE) in the simulation study. CTMLE demonstrated very accurate estimation
of the target parameter (ATE). Applying CTMLE on the real trauma data, the
treatment protocol (using TEG values immediately after injury) showed
significant improvement in trauma patient hemostasis status (control of
bleeding), and a decrease in mortality rate at 6h compared to standard care.The

while skyrmions in the bulk of the channel undergo localized orbits with no net
transport. The magnitude of the edge currents can be controlled by varying the
amplitude and frequency of the ac drive or by changing the ratio of the Magnus
force to the damping term. We identify a localized phase in which the orbits
are small and edge transport is absent, an edge transport regime, and a
fluctuating regime that appears when the ac drive is strong enough to
dynamically disorder the skyrmion lattice. We also find that in some cases,
multiple rows of skyrmions participate in the transport due to a drag effect
from the skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. The edge currents are robust for
finite disorder and should be a general feature of skyrmions interacting with
confined geometries or inhomogeneous disorder under an ac drive. We show that
similar effects can occur for skyrmion lattices at interfaces or along domain
boundaries for multiple coexisting skyrmion species. The edge current effect
provides a new method to control skyrmion motion, and we discuss the connection
of these results with recent studies on the emergence of edge currents in
chiral active matter systems and gyroscopic metamaterials.

scenario in which feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) maintains the

argued that either AGN feedback saturates in very massive clusters or the
central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is too small to produce enough kinetic
feedback and hence is unable to quench the catastrophic cooling. In this work,
we present an alternate scenario wherein intense short-lived cooling and star
formation phases followed by strong AGN outbursts are part of the AGN feedback
loop. Using results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of a standard cool-core

system reliability and stability. In future smart grids, certain portions of a
customers load usage could be under automatic control with a cyber-enabled DSM
program which selectively schedules loads as a function of electricity prices
to improve power balance and grid stability. In such a case, the security of
DSM cyberinfrastructure will be critical as advanced metering infrastructure,
and communication systems are susceptible to hacking, cyber-attacks. Such
attacks, in the form of data injection, can manipulate customer load profiles
and cause metering chaos and energy losses in the grid. These attacks are also
exacerbated by the feedback mechanism between load management on the consumer
side and dynamic price schemes by independent system operators. This work
provides a novel methodology for modeling and simulating the nonlinear
relationship between load management and real-time pricing. We then investigate
the behavior of such a feedback loop under intentional cyber-attacks using our
feedback model. We simulate and examine load-price data under different levels
of DSM participation with three types of additive attacks: ramp, sudden, and
point attacks. We apply change point and supervised learning methods for
detection of DSM attacks. Results conclude that while higher levels of DSM
participation can exacerbate attacks they also lead to better detection of such
attacks. Further analysis of results shows that point attacks are the hardest
to detect and supervised learning methods produce results on par or better than
sequential detectors.

Complementary Eulerian velocity data is available with global coverage, but is
itself limited by the spatial and temporal resolution possible with satellite
altimetry measurements. Additionally, altimetry measurements approximate
geostrophic components of ocean currents but neglect smaller sub-mesoscale

drifter datasets, we have trained a recurrent neural network on the time

receiver (RX) in molecular communication (MC) systems can provide faster and
more reliable communication. Existing theoretical models in the literature are
not suitable for distance estimation in a practical scenario. Furthermore,
deriving an analytical model is not easy due to effects such as boundary
conditions in the diffusion process, the initial velocity of the molecules and
unsteady flows. Therefore, five different practical methods comprising three
novel data analysis based methods and two supervised machine learning (ML)
methods, Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) and Neural Network Regression
(NNR), are proposed for distance estimation at the RX side. In order to apply
the ML methods, a macroscale practical MC system, which consists of an electric
sprayer without a fan, alcohol molecules, an alcohol sensor and a
microcontroller, is established, and the received signals are recorded. A
feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize the measured signals as the
inputs in ML methods. The numerical results show that the ML methods outperform
the data analysis based methods in the root mean square error sense with the
cost of complexity. Moreover, the peak time based estimation, which is one of
the proposed data analysis based methods, yields better results with respect to
the other proposed four methods, as the distance increases. Given the
experimental data and fluid dynamics theory, a possible trajectory of the
molecules between the TX and RX is given. Our findings show that distance
estimation performance is jointly affected by unsteady flows and the
non-linearity of the sensor. According to our findings based on fluid dynamics,
it is evaluated that fluid dynamics should be taken into account for more
accurate parameter estimation in practical macroscale MC systems.

of a background plane wave with the result obtained by using the Volkov state
solution of the Dirac equation, and confirm that we obtain the same result. We
then investigate the interaction of a circularly polarized short laser pulse
scattering with GeV electrons and see that the finite duration of the pulse
leads to a lower transfer of circular polarization than that predicted by the
known formulas in the monochromatic case. We also see how the transfer of
circular polarization from the laser beam to the gamma ray beam is gradually
deteriorated as the laser intensity increases, entering the nonlinear regime.
However, this is shown to be recovered if the scattered photon beam is
collimated to only allow for passage of photons emitted with angles smaller
than $1/\gamma$ with respect to the initial electron direction, where $\gamma$
is the approximately constant Lorentz factor of the electron. The obtained

compactify the set of normalized Einstein metrics with a lower bound on the

has to add singular spaces called Einstein orbifolds, and the singularities
form as blow-downs of Ricci-flat ALE spaces. This raises some natural issues,
in particular: can all Einstein orbifolds be Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth
Einstein manifolds? Can we describe more precisely the smooth Einstein metrics
close to a given singular one? In this first paper, we prove that Einstein
manifolds sufficiently close, in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, to an orbifold are
actually close to a gluing of model spaces in suitable weighted H\""older
spaces. The proof consists in controlling the metric in the neck regions thanks
to the construction of optimal coordinates. This refined convergence is the
cornerstone of our subsequent work on the degeneration of Einstein metrics or,
equivalently, on the desingularization of Einstein orbifolds in which we show
that all Einstein metrics Gromov-Hausdorff close to an Einstein orbifold are
the result of a gluing-perturbation procedure. This procedure turns out to be
generally obstructed, and this provides the first obstructions to a
Gromov-Hausdorff desingularization of Einstein orbifolds.

of generation of quantum gates (logical elements for quantum computations) for
two--level systems are investigated for short duration of the control. The
problem of existence of local but not global extrema, the so called traps, is
considered. In prior works the absence of traps was proved for a sufficiently
long control duration. In this paper we prove that for almost all target
unitary operators and system Hamiltonians traps are absent for an arbitrarily
small control duration. For the remainder target unitary operators and
Hamiltonians we obtain a new estimate for the lower boundary of the control
duration which guarantees the absence of traps.

for classification of four major colorectal polyp types, tubular adenoma,
tubulovillous/villous adenoma, hyperplastic polyp, and sessile serrated

Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), in New Hampshire. We evaluated the
deep neural network on an internal dataset of 157 histopathology slide images
from DHMC, as well as on an external dataset of 238 histopathology slide images
from 24 different institutions spanning 13 states in the United States. We
measured accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our model in this evaluation
and compared its performance to local pathologists' diagnoses at the
point-of-care retrieved from corresponding pathology laboratories. For the
internal evaluation, the deep neural network had a mean accuracy of 93.5% (95%
CI 89.6%-97.4%), compared with local pathologists' accuracy of 91.4% (95% CI
87.0%-95.8%). On the external test set, the deep neural network achieved an
accuracy of 87.0% (95% CI 82.7%-91.3%), comparable with local pathologists'

Even a \textit{quantum-limited} detector that simultaneously measures a second

also boost the performance of a single network, which substantially outperforms

the thermal energy of the heat source can be converted into acoustic energy,
which may generate a loud oscillation. If uncontrolled, these nonlinear
acoustic oscillations, also known as thermoacoustic instabilities, can cause
large vibrations up to structural failure. Numerical and experimental studies
showed that thermoacoustic oscillations can be chaotic. It is not yet known,
however, how to minimise such chaotic oscillations. We propose a strategy to
analyse and minimise chaotic acoustic oscillations, for which traditional
stability and sensitivity methods break down. We investigate the acoustics of a
nonlinear heat source in an acoustic resonator. First, we propose covariant
Lyapunov analysis as a tool to calculate the stability of chaotic acoustics
making connections with eigenvalue and Floquet analyses. We show that covariant
Lyapunov analysis is the most general flow stability tool. Second, covariant
Lyapunov vector analysis is applied to a chaotic system. The time-averaged
acoustic energy is investigated by varying the heat-source parameters.
Thermoacoustic systems can display both hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic chaos, as
well as discontinuities in the time-averaged acoustic energy. Third, we embed
sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy in an optimisation routine.
This procedure achieves a significant reduction in acoustic energy and
identifies the bifurcations to chaos.
  The analysis and methods proposed enable the reduction of chaotic
oscillations in thermoacoustic systems by optimal passive control. The
techniques presented can be used in other unsteady fluid-dynamics problems with
virtually no modification.

processes driven by a common unknown input, thus effectively generalizing the
classical blind multi-channel identification problem to graphs. More precisely,
we model network processes as graph filters and consider the observation of
multiple graph signals corresponding to outputs of different filters defined on
a common graph and driven by the same input. Assuming that the underlying graph
is known and the input is unknown, our goal is to recover the specifications of
the network processes, namely the coefficients of the graph filters, only
relying on the observation of the outputs. Being generated by the same input,
these outputs are intimately related and we leverage this relationship for our
estimation purposes. Two settings are considered, one where the orders of the
filters are known and another one where they are not known. For the former
setting, we present a least-squares approach and provide conditions for
recovery. For the latter scenario, we propose a sparse recovery algorithm with
theoretical performance guarantees. Numerical experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, the influence of different parameter

PSF of an AO system is developed. When phase errors from high altitude
turbulence scintillate due to Fresnel propagation, wavefront amplitude errors
may be spatially offset from residual phase errors. These correlated errors
appear as asymmetry in the image plane under the Fraunhofer condition. In an
analytic model with an open-loop AO system, the strength of the asymmetry is
calculated for a single mode of phase aberration, which generalizes to two
dimensions under a Fourier decomposition of the complex illumination. Other
parameters included are the spatial offset of the AO correction, which is the
wind velocity in the frozen flow regime multiplied by the effective AO time
delay, and propagation distance or altitude of the turbulent layer. In this
model, the asymmetry is strongest when the wind is slow and nearest to the
coronagraphic mask when the turbulent layer is far away, such as when the
telescope is pointing low towards the horizon. A great emphasis is made about
the fact that the brighter asymmetric lobe of the PSF points in the opposite
direction as the wind, which is consistent analytically with the clarification
that the image plane electric field distribution is actually the inverse
Fourier transform of the aperture plane. Validation of this understanding is
made with observations taken from the Gemini Planet Imager, as well as being
reproducible in end-to-end AO simulations.

It combines the scalability of the multigrid algorithm and the performance of

number of parameters due to a strongly recursive structure. In MGBPv2, we make
full use of the multigrid recursion from the beginning of the network; we allow
different parameters in every module of the network; we simplify the main
modules; and finally, we allow adjustments of the number of network features
based on the scale of operation. For inference tasks, we introduce an
overlapping patch approach to further allow processing of very large images

relaxation rates ($R_1$) for individual tissues. One potential source of
variation is the protocol used to determine $R_1$. The methodological
dependence of R1 and relaxivity $r_1$ are investigated.
  Methods: $R_1$ is quantified in gel phantoms with varying concentration of
MnCl2, and a small cohort of three healthy volunteers using different
acquisition methods. Siemens inversion recovery (IR) and saturation recovery
(SR) protocols are applied to phantoms and volunteers. Variable flip angle
(VFA) protocols are additionally applied to phantoms. $R_1$ is quantified using
single voxel fits, and distributions examined for regions in the thalamus, and
cerebellum as well as grey and white matter. Phantoms exclude boundary fits and
relaxivity is quantified across the full concentration range. Normality of
$R_1$ distributions is assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov score, and inter-sequence
agreement by two-sample t-test.
  Results: Phantom relaxivity is found to be 7.16 Hz/mM, 9.22 Hz/mM and 10.65
Hz/mM to 11.91 Hz/mM for IR, SR and VFA methods, respectively. In vivo $R_1$
exhibit low intra-participant variation for IR. SR $R_1$ are lower than IR
values with inter- and intra-participant variation on the same order. Brain
regions and phantoms mapped with different protocols varied significantly with
t-test p-values between 0 and 5E-10.
  Conclusion: Results suggest a significant protocol dependence of $R_1$, and
corresponding relaxivity, suggesting inter-method comparisons should be

bound states of a massive and complex-valued scalar field $\Psi$) around exact
{\it extremal} ($a = M$) Kerr black holes (BH's) possessing {\it bounded radial
derivatives at the horizon} (in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates) as opposed to
similar cloud solutions that exist but with unbounded derivatives in the same
coordinate system. The latter solutions have been reported recently both
analytically and numerically. The superregular clouds cannot be obtained from
the regular clouds around subextremal Kerr BH's ($|a|< M$) in the limit of
extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$ as in this limit the radial derivatives of
$\Psi$ at the horizon $r_H$ diverge when $r_H\rightarrow r_H^{\rm ext}:=M=a$,
thus, such superregular clouds must be analyzed separately. We conclude that
the superregular clouds, which are found in the {\it exact} extremal scenario
($a = M$), are not continuously connected with the regular ones in the limit of
extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$. Remarkably, the spectrum leading to the
existence of the radial part of the full solution of these superregular clouds
(which obeys a Teukolsky equation) is given by the exact formula
$M=a=\frac{1}{2\mu}\sqrt{m^2 + \left[-\kappa+\sqrt{\kappa^2+m^2}\,\right]^2}$,
which depends on three (positive) integers: the principal number $n$, the {\it
magnetic number} $m$, and an integer $j$, related with the {\it type} of
regularity at the horizon. Here $\kappa= j +n$, and $\mu$ is the mass
associated with $\Psi$. This spectrum depends implicitly on the {\it orbital}
number $l$, an integer number that determines the existence of well behaved
spheroidal harmonics which are associated with the angular part of the cloud
solution. Since the separation constants that are obtained from the
superregularity conditions in the radial part of the solution do {\it not}
coincide in general with the standard separation constants required for the
spheroidal harmonics to be well behaved on the axis of symmetry, we conclude
that non-trivial boson clouds having such superregularity conditions cannot
exist in the background of an exact extremal Kerr BH. The only exception to
this conclusion is in the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $m\ll n$. In such a
large $n$ limit consistency in the separation constants leads to a quadratic
Diophantine equation of Pell's type for the integer numbers $(l,m)$. Such
Pell's equation can be readily solved using standard techniques. In that
instance well behaved spheroidal harmonics are obtained, and thus, well behaved
non-trivial superregular clouds can be computed. Of course, this situation,
does not preclude the existence of other kind of smooth cloud solutions for any
other $n$, not necessarily large (e.g. clouds with a non-integer $\kappa$) when
using a better behaved coordinate system at the horizon (e.g. Wheeler's
tortoise coordinate or proper radial distance).

stretched exponential rather than a Cole-Cole model to represent the IP
phenomenon. Our paper begins with an example that illuminates the physical
understanding about how negative transients (the typical signature of an IP
signal in airborne data) can be generated. The effects of the background
conductivity are investigated; this study shows that a moderately conductive

strong IP signals. We then examine the important topic of estimating the

strategy of Distributed Iterative Gating (DIGNet). The structure of this
mechanism derives from a strong conceptual foundation and presents a
light-weight mechanism for adaptive control of computation similar to recurrent
convolutional neural networks by integrating feedback signals with a
feed-forward architecture. In contrast to other RNN formulations, DIGNet
generates feedback signals in a cascaded manner that implicitly carries
information from all the layers above. This cascaded feedback propagation by
means of the propagator gates is found to be more effective compared to other
feedback mechanisms that use feedback from the output of either the
corresponding stage or from the previous stage. Experiments reveal the high
degree of capability that this recurrent approach with cascaded feedback
presents over feed-forward baselines and other recurrent models for pixel-wise
labeling problems on three challenging datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff,
and ADE20K.

square degrees, corresponding to a projected area of $160\times160 \rm{kpc}$ at
the distance of M81. The resulting stellar catalogue enables a homogeneous
analysis of the member galaxies with unprecedented sensitivity to low surface
brightness emission. The radial profiles of the dwarf galaxies are
well-described by Sersic and King profiles, and show no obvious signatures of
tidal disruption. The measured radii for most of these systems are larger than
the existing literature values and we find the total luminosity of IKN
($\rm{M_{V,0}}=-14.29$) to be almost 3 magnitudes brighter than
previously-thought. We identify new dwarf satellite candidates, d1006+69 and
d1009+68, which we estimate to lie at a distance of $4.3\pm0.2$ Mpc and
$3.5\pm0.5$ Mpc. With $\rm{M_{V,0}}=-8.91\pm0.40$ and
$\rm{[M/H]}=-1.83\pm0.28$, d1006+69 is one of the faintest and most metal-poor
dwarf satellites currently-known in the M81 Group. The luminosity functions of
young stellar systems in the outlying tidal HI debris imply continuous star
formation in the recent past and the existence of populations as young as 30
Myr old. We find no evidence for old RGB stars coincident with the young
MS/cHeB stars which define these objects, supporting the idea that they are
genuinely new stellar systems resulting from triggered star formation in
gaseous tidal debris.

  Methods: A T2 blip-up/down echo planar imaging (EPI) acquisition with
generalized Slice-dithered enhanced resolution (T2-BUDA-gSlider) is proposed. A
radiofrequency (RF)-encoded multi-slab spin-echo EPI acquisition with multiple
echo times (TEs) was developed to obtain high SNR efficiency with reduced
repetition time (TR). This was combined with an interleaved 2-shot EPI
acquisition using blip-up/down phase encoding. An estimated field map was
incorporated into the joint multi-shot EPI reconstruction with a structured low
rank constraint to achieve distortion-free and robust reconstruction for each
slab without navigation. A Bloch simulated subspace model was integrated into
gSlider reconstruction and utilized for T2 quantification.
  Results: In vivo results demonstrated that the T2 values estimated by the
proposed method were consistent with gold standard spin-echo acquisition.
Compared to the reference 3D fast spin echo (FSE) images, distortion caused by
off-resonance and eddy current effects were effectively mitigated.
  Conclusion: BUDA-gSlider SE-EPI acquisition and gSlider-subspace joint
reconstruction enabled distortion-free whole-brain T2 mapping in 2 min at ~1
mm3 isotropic resolution, which could bring significant benefits to related

paper, instead of using a pre-defined graph which is inflexible and may be
sub-optimal for multi-label classification, we propose the A-GCN, which
leverages the popular Graph Convolutional Networks with an Adaptive label
correlation graph to model label dependencies. Specifically, we introduce a
plug-and-play Label Graph (LG) module to learn label correlations with word
embeddings, and then utilize traditional GCN to map this graph into
label-dependent object classifiers which are further applied to image features.
The basic LG module incorporates two 1x1 convolutional layers and uses the dot
product to generate label graphs. In addition, we propose a sparse correlation
constraint to enhance the LG module and also explore different LG
architectures. We validate our method on two diverse multi-label datasets:

For the minimally-coupling, the regularized spectra are also zero in the
radiation-dominant stage, the matter-dominant stage, and de Sitter space as
well. The vanishing of these adiabatically regularized spectra are also
confirmed by direct regularization of the Green's functions. For a general
coupling and general RW spacetimes, the regularized spectra can be negative
under the conventional prescription. By going to higher order of
regularization, the spectra will generally become positive, but will also
acquire IR divergence which is inevitable for a massless field. To avoid the IR
divergence, the inside-horizon regularization is applied. By these procedures,
one will eventually achieve nonnegative, UV- and IR-convergent power spectrum

dark energy, allowing for tests of the cosmological model through the
measurement of distance and expansion rate from a 3D galaxy distribution. The
signal appears at large scales in the correlation function where linear theory
applies, allowing for the construction of accurate models. However, due to the
lower number of modes available at these scales, sample variance has a
significant impact on the signal, and may sharpen or widen the underlying peak.
Therefore, equivalent mock realizations of a galaxy survey present different
errors in the position of the peak when uncertainties are estimated from the
posterior probability distribution corresponding to the individual mocks. Hence
the posterior width, often quoted as the error in BAO survey measurements, is
subject to sample noise. A different definition of the error is provided by the
asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator, which involves the
average over multiple realizations, and is not subject to sample noise. In this
work we re-analyse the main galaxy survey data available for BAO measurements
and quantify the impact of the noise component on the error quoted for BAO
measurements. We quantify the difference between three definitions of the
error: the confidence region computed from a single posterior, the average of
the variances of many realizations, and the Fisher matrix prediction assuming a
Gaussian likelihood.

millions of devices. Due to these systems challenges as well as issues related
to statistical heterogeneity of data and privacy concerns, designing a provably

challenging. In this paper, we present FedPAQ, a communication-efficient
Federated Learning method with Periodic Averaging and Quantization. FedPAQ
relies on three key features: (1) periodic averaging where models are updated
locally at devices and only periodically averaged at the server; (2) partial
device participation where only a fraction of devices participate in each round

quantize their updates before uploading to the parameter server. These features
address the communications and scalability challenges in federated learning. We
also show that FedPAQ achieves near-optimal theoretical guarantees for strongly

reducing the dimension space of predictors without losing regression
information requires inverting the covariance matrix of the predictors. This
has posed a number of challenges especially when analyzing high-dimensional
data sets in which the number of predictors $\mathit{p}$ is much larger than
number of samples $n,~(n\ll p)$. A new covariance estimator, called the
\textit{Maximum Entropy Covariance} (MEC) that addresses loss of covariance
information when similar covariance matrices are linearly combined using
\textit{Maximum Entropy} (ME) principle is proposed in this work. By
benefitting naturally from slicing or discretizing range of the response
variable, y into \textit{H} non-overlapping categories, $\mathit{h_{1},\ldots
,h_{H}}$, MEC first combines covariance matrices arising from samples in each y
slice $\mathit{h\in H}$ and then select the one that maximizes entropy under
the principle of maximum uncertainty. The MEC estimator is then formed from
convex mixture of such entropy-maximizing sample covariance $S_{\mbox{mec}}$
estimate and pooled sample covariance $\mathbf{S}_{\mathit{p}}$ estimate across
the $\mathit{H}$ slices without requiring time-consuming covariance
optimization procedures. MEC deals directly with singularity and instability of
sample group covariance estimate in both regression and classification
problems. The efficiency of the MEC estimator is studied with the existing
sufficient dimension reduction methods such as \textit{Sliced Inverse
Regression} (SIR) and \textit{Sliced Average Variance Estimator} (SAVE) as
demonstrated on both classification and regression problems using real life
Leukemia cancer data and customers' electricity load profiles from smart meter
data sets respectively.

that, for single-molecule strong coupling with the photon mode, nonadiabatic

high-mass cores in three dimensions, where the gas gravity mainly adds up to

indirectly how an alloy recrystallizes if at all. Given this relevance, it has
become common practice to study the evolution of deformation microstructure
heterogeneities with 3D experiments and full-field crystal plasticity computer
simulations including tools such as the spectral method.
  Quantifying material point to grain or phase boundary distances, though, is a
practical challenge with spectral method crystal plasticity models because
these discretize the material volume rather than mesh explicitly the grain and
phase boundary interface network. This limitation calls for the development of
interface reconstruction algorithms which enable us to develop specific data
post-processing protocols to quantify spatial correlations between state
variable values at each material point and the points' corresponding distance
to the closest grain or phase boundary.
  This work contributes to advance such post-processing routines. Specifically,
two grain reconstruction and three distancing methods are developed to solve
above challenge. The individual strengths and limitations of these methods
surplus the efficiency of their parallel implementation is assessed with an
exemplary DAMASK large scale crystal plasticity study. We apply the new tool to
assess the evolution of subtle stress and disorientation gradients towards

large variety of dynamics in robotics, BRTs can be quickly approximated in
lower-dimensional chained subsystems with the guaranteed-safety property

processed only at specific levels seems to be available for conscious
awareness. We do not have direct experience of information available at the
level of individual neurons, which is noisy and highly stochastic. Neither do
we have experience of more macro-level interactions such as interpersonal
communications. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that conscious experiences
co-vary with information encoded in coarse-grained neural states such as the
firing pattern of a population of neurons. In this article, we introduce a new
informational theory of consciousness: Information Closure Theory of
Consciousness (ICT). We hypothesise that conscious processes are processes
which form non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) with respect to the
environment at certain coarse-grained levels. This hypothesis implies that
conscious experience is confined due to informational closure from conscious
processing to other coarse-grained levels. ICT proposes new quantitative
definitions of both conscious content and conscious level. With the
parsimonious definitions and a hypothesise, ICT provides explanations and
predictions of various phenomena associated with consciousness. The
implications of ICT naturally reconciles issues in many existing theories of
consciousness and provides explanations for many of our intuitions about
consciousness. Most importantly, ICT demonstrates that information can be the
common language between consciousness and physical reality.

global optimizer by iteratively proposing the decision maker a new comparison
to make, based on actively learning a surrogate of the latent (unknown and
perhaps unquantifiable) objective function from past sampled decision vectors
and pairwise preferences. The surrogate is fit by means of radial basis
functions, under the constraint of satisfying, if possible, the preferences
expressed by the decision maker on existing samples. The surrogate is used to
propose a new sample of the decision vector for comparison with the current
best candidate based on two possible criteria: minimize a combination of the
surrogate and an inverse weighting distance function to balance between
exploitation of the surrogate and exploration of the decision space, or
maximize a function related to the probability that the new candidate will be
preferred. Compared to active preference learning based on Bayesian
optimization, we show that our approach is superior in that, within the same

(asymptotic Newtonian mass zero) wormholes can reproduce post-merger initial
ring-down gravitational waves characteristic of black hole horizon. In the
massless case, it is the non-zero charge of other fields, equivalent to what we
call here the ""Wheelerian mass"", that is responsible for mimicking ring-down
quasi-normal modes. In this paper, we enquire whether the same Wheelerian mass
can reproduce black hole observables also in an altogether different
experiment, viz., the strong field lensing. We examine two classes of massless
wormholes, one in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory and the other in
the Einstein-Minimally-coupled-Scalar field (EMS) theory. The observables such
as the radius of the shadow, image separation and magnification of the
corresponding Wheelerian masses are compared with those of a black hole
(idealized SgrA* chosen for illustration) assuming that the three types of
lenses share the same minimum impact parameter and distance from the observer.
It turns out that, while the massless EMS\ wormholes can closely mimic the
black hole in terms of strong field lensing observables, the EMD wormholes show
considerable differences due to the presence of dilatonic charge. The
conclusion is that masslessless alone is enough to closely mimic Schwarzschild
black hole strong lensing observables in the EMS theory but not in the other,
where extra parameters also influence those observables. The motion of timelike
particles is briefly discussed for completeness.

topological superconducting chain (TSC) system, in which the braiding is
performed by controlling the electron-chemical potentials of the TSCs and the
couplings between them. By solving rigorously the Majorana qubit dynamics, we
show how the Majorana qubit coherence is generated through bogoliubon
correlations formed by exchanging Majorana zero modes (MZMs) between two TSCs
in braiding operations. Using the exact master equation, we demonstrate how
MZMs and also the bogoliubon correlations dissipate due to charge fluctuations
of the controlling gates at both the zero and finite temperatures. As a result,
Majorana qubit coherence and the fermion parity conservation cannot be immune
from local perturbations during braiding operations.

process multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to produce each output
high-resolution (HR) frame separately in a sliding window fashion or
recurrently exploit the previously estimated HR frames to super-resolve the
following frame. The main weaknesses of these approaches are: 1) separately
generating each output frame may obtain high-quality HR estimates while
resulting in unsatisfactory flickering artifacts, and 2) combining previously
generated HR frames can produce temporally consistent results in the case of
short information flow, but it will cause significant jitter and jagged
artifacts because the previous super-resolving errors are constantly
accumulated to the subsequent frames. In this paper, we propose a fully
end-to-end trainable frame and feature-context video super-resolution (FFCVSR)
network that consists of two key sub-networks: local network and context
network, where the first one explicitly utilizes a sequence of consecutive LR
frames to generate local feature and local SR frame, and the other combines the
outputs of local network and the previously estimated HR frames and features to
super-resolve the subsequent frame. Our approach takes full advantage of the
inter-frame information from multiple LR frames and the context information
from previously predicted HR frames, producing temporally consistent
high-quality results while maintaining real-time speed by directly reusing
previous features and frames. Extensive evaluations and comparisons demonstrate
that our approach produces state-of-the-art results on a standard benchmark
dataset, with advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and visual quality
over the existing approaches.

package of binutils. Gprof records the flow of the program including the callee
and caller information and their respective execution time. This information is
represented in the form of a call graph. Profilers at the time of execution
creates a call graph file which indicates the full flow of the program
including the individual execution time as well. This paper aims at providing a
better understanding of the data structure used to store the information and
how is a profiler(gprof) actually using this data structure to give user a
readable format. The next section of this paper solves one of the limitation of
gprof i.e. edit the time of block of code without understanding the call graph.
Any changes in the execution time of a particular block of code would affect
the total execution time. So if we edit the gprof in such a way that its
consistent and platform independent, then it can yield various results like
testing execution time after parallelism, before even designing it by replacing
the values with theoretical/emulated ones and see if the total execution time
is getting reduced by a desired number or not? Gprof edit can help us figure
out that what section of code can be parallelized or which part of code is
taking the most time and which call or part can be changed to reduce the
execution time. The last section of the paper walks through the application of
gprof in minisat and how gprof helps in the hardware acceleration in minisat by
suggesting which part to be parallelised and how does it affect the total

preserve the monotonicity of solutions to scalar nonlinear autonomous
fractional ODEs, both of which are novel. Significantly, by improving a result

$\mathcal{L}$1 scheme is $\mathcal{CM}$-preserving, so that the $\mathcal{L}$1

a simple two-tier architecture that has the properties of both a VAE and a GAN.

Furthermore, it results in a low discriminability of the compressed networks by

Herein, we modeled a wide debris disk of solids with several initial conditions

account of orbital evolutions of satellites due to the planetary tides after

the power index of its surface density is similar to that of the disk generated

larger masses than Ariel or Umbriel, while the outermost satellite did not grow
to the mass of Oberon. Our results indicate that we should consider the thermal

five major satellites through the in-situ formation scenario. On the other
hand, the small inner satellites would be formed from the rings produced by the
disrupted satellites which migrated from around the corotation radius of Uranus

different uncertainties that can make them volatile and challenging to predict.
Demand unpredictability is one of the managers' concerns in the supply chain
that can cause large forecasting errors, issues in the upstream supply chain
and impose unnecessary costs. We investigate 843 real demand time series with
different values of coefficient of variations (CoV) where promotion causes
volatility over the entire demand series. In such a case, forecasting demand
for different CoV require different models to capture the underlying behavior
of demand series and pose significant challenges due to very different and
diverse demand behavior. We decompose demand into baseline and promotional
demand and propose a hybrid model to forecast demand. Our results indicate that
our proposed hybrid model generates robust and accurate forecast across series
with different levels of volatilities. We stress the necessity of decomposition
for volatile demand series. We also model demand series with a number of well
known statistical and machine learning (ML) models to investigate their
performance empirically. We found that ARIMA with covariate (ARIMAX) works well

  Objective: This paper proposes an algorithm for constructing locating arrays
with a small number of rows. Testing cost increases as the number of tests
increases; thus the problem of finding locating arrays of small sizes is of
practical importance.
  Method: The proposed algorithm uses simulation annealing, a meta-heuristic
algorithm, to find locating array of a given size. The whole algorithm
repeatedly executes the simulated annealing algorithm by dynamically varying
the input array size.
  Results: Experimental results show 1) that the proposed algorithm is able to
construct locating arrays for problem instances of large sizes and 2) that, for
problem instances for which nontrivial locating arrays are known, the algorithm
is often able to generate locating arrays that are smaller than or at least

energy equipartition and mass segregation are expected to develop as a result
of the cumulative effect of stellar encounters even in systems initially
characterized by star-mass independent density and energy distributions. In
parallel, numerical simulations have demonstrated that radially-biased pressure
anisotropy slowly builds up in realistic models of globular clusters from
initial isotropic conditions, leading to anisotropy profiles that, to some
extent, mimic those resulting from incomplete violent relaxation known to be
relevant to elliptical galaxies. In this paper we consider a set of realistic
simulations realized by means of Monte Carlo methods and analyze them by means
of self-consistent two-component models. For the purpose, we refer to an
underlying distribution function, originally conceived to describe elliptical
galaxies, that has been recently truncated and adapted to the context of
globular clusters. The two components are meant to represent light stars
(combining all main sequence stars) and heavy stars (giants, dark remnants, and
binaries). We show that this conceptually simple family of two-component
truncated models provides a reasonable description of simulated density,
velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles, especially for the most relaxed
systems, with the capability to express quantitatively the attained levels of
energy equipartition and mass segregation. In contrast, two-component isotropic
models based on the King distribution function do not offer a comparably
satisfactory representation of the simulated globular clusters. With this work
we provide a new reliable diagnostic tool applicable to nonrotating globular
clusters that are characterized by significant gradients in the local value of
the mass-to-light ratio, beyond the commonly used one-component dynamical
models.

function of the two-partition cubic Hodge integrals. The associated Lax
operators turn out to satisfy an algebraic relation. This algebraic relation
can be used to identify a reduced system of the 2D Toda hierarchy that emerges
when the parameter $\tau$ of the cubic Hodge integrals takes a special value.
Integrable hierarchies of the Volterra type are shown to be such reduced
systems. They can be derived for positive rational values of $\tau$. In
particular, the discrete series $\tau = 1,2,\ldots$ correspond to the Volterra
lattice and its hungry generalizations. This provides a new explanation to the
integrable structures of the cubic Hodge integrals observed by Dubrovin et al.
in the perspectives of tau-symmetric integrable Hamiltonian PDEs.

  Systems","This manuscript is draft only, not intended for publication",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Together with the spread of DevOps practices and container technologies,
Microserivce Architecture has become a mainstream architecture style in recent
years. Resilience is a key characteristic in Microservice Architecture
Systems(MSA Systems), and it shows the ability to cope with various kinds of
system disturbances which cause degradations of services. However, due to lack
of consensus definition of resilience in the software field, although a lot of
work has been done on resilience for MSA Systems, developers still don't have a
clear idea on how resilient an MSA System should be, and what resilience
mechanisms are needed. In this paper, by referring to existing systematic
studies on resilience in other scientific areas, the definition of microservice
resilience is provided and a Microservice Resilience Measurement Model is
proposed to measure service resilience. And a requirement model to represent
resilience requirements of MSA Systems is given. The requirement model uses
elements in KAOS to represent notions in the measurement model, and decompose
service resilience goals into system behaviors that can be executed by system
components. As a proof of concept, a case study is conducted on an MSA System
to illustrate how the proposed models are applied.

volume scheme for the wave equation system in the zero Mach number limit is
presented. The accuracy of a numerical scheme at low Mach numbers is its
ability to maintain the solution close to the incompressible solution for all
times, and this can be formulated in terms of the invariance of a space of
constant densities and divergence-free velocities. An IMEX-RK methodology is
employed to obtain a time semi-discrete scheme, and a space-time fully-discrete
scheme is derived by using standard finite volume techniques. The existence of
a unique numerical solution, its uniform stability with respect to the Mach
number, the AP property, and the accuracy at low Mach numbers are established
for both time semi-discrete, and space-time fully-discrete schemes. Extensive
numerical case studies confirm uniform second order convergence of the scheme
with respect to the Mach number, and all the above-mentioned properties.

high-contrast imaging and characterization of protoplanetary disks, and has the
potential to be instrumental in characterizing exoplanets. VLT/SPHERE contains
the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) with a dual-beam
polarimetric imaging (DPI) mode, which offers the capability to obtain linear
polarization images at high contrast and resolution. Aims. We aim to provide an
overview of IRDIS/DPI and study its optical design to improve observing
strategies and data reduction. Methods. For H-band observations of TW Hya, we
compare two data reduction methods that correct for instrumental polarization
effects in different ways: a minimization of the noise image, and a
polarimetric-model-based correction method that we present in Paper II of this
study. Results. We use observations of TW Hya to illustrate the data reduction.
In the images of the protoplanetary disk around this star we detect variability
in the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization with
pointing-dependent instrument configuration. We explain these variations as
instrumental polarization effects and correct for these effects using our
model-based correction method. Conclusions. IRDIS/DPI has proven to be a very
successful and productive high-contrast polarimetric imaging system. However,
the instrument performance depends on the specific instrument configuration. We
suggest adjustments to future observing strategies to optimize polarimetric
efficiency in field tracking mode by avoiding unfavourable derotator angles. We
recommend reducing on-sky data with the pipeline called IRDAP that includes the
model-based correction method (described in Paper II) to optimally account for
the remaining telescope and instrumental polarization effects and to retrieve
the true polarization state of the incident light.

capabilities to perform such measurements, but uncalibrated instrumental
polarization effects limit the attainable polarimetric accuracy. Aims. We aim
to characterize and correct the instrumental polarization effects of the
complete optical system, i.e. the telescope and SPHERE/IRDIS. Methods. We
create a detailed Mueller matrix model in the broadband filters Y-, J-, H- and
Ks, and calibrate it using measurements with SPHERE's internal light source and
observations of two unpolarized stars. We develop a data-reduction method that
uses the model to correct for the instrumental polarization effects, and apply
it to observations of the circumstellar disk of T Cha. Results. The
instrumental polarization is almost exclusively produced by the telescope and
SPHERE's first mirror and varies with telescope altitude angle. The crosstalk
primarily originates from the image derotator (K-mirror). At some orientations,
the derotator causes severe loss of signal (>90% loss in H- and Ks-band) and
strongly offsets the angle of linear polarization. With our correction method
we reach in all filters a total polarimetric accuracy of <0.1% in the degree of
linear polarization and an accuracy of a few degrees in angle of linear
polarization. Conclusions. The correction method enables us to accurately
measure the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization of
circumstellar disks, and is a vital tool for detecting unresolved (inner) disks
and measuring the polarization of substellar companions. We have incorporated
the correction method in a highly-automatic end-to-end data-reduction pipeline

heterogeneities in their photophysical properties. In particular, the relation

surface and in the bulk, crucial for efficient collection of charges in a light
harvesting device, is not well understood. Here, a photoluminescence tomography
technique is developed in a confocal microscope using one- and two-photon
excitation to distinguish between local surface and bulk diffusion of charge
carriers in methylammonium lead bromide single crystals. The local temporal
diffusion is probed at various excitation depths to build statistics of local
electronic diffusion coefficients. The measured values range between 0.3 to 2
$cm^2.s^{-1}$ depending on the local trap density and the morphological
environment - a distribution that would be missed from analogous macroscopic or

learn an auxiliary network that predicts residuals around the aggregated
actions, which ensures the target policy's expressiveness even when some of the
source policies perform poorly. We demonstrated the effectiveness of MULTIPOLAR

current state information science and technology which necessitates proper
characterization of the resources yielding QT. While entanglement is known to
be the basic requirement to achieve QT, condition of sufficiency for QT still
remains an open question. Here, we provide an analytic proof that in the case
of Gaussian entangled resources, in general, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlation is {\em sufficient for QT}. For a relatively restricted set of
Gaussian states we provide even a tighter condition that EPR correlation is
{\em both necessary and sufficient for QT}. Our results, in turn, provide a
complete characterization of the resources required for QT.

of pulsars are affected by their dynamical properties. We derive thorough
analytical expressions for such dynamical contributions in terms of the
Galactic coordinates, the proper motion, the pulsar distance, and the radial
velocity. We find that the effects of the dynamical terms in the
second-derivative of frequencies or parameters based on such second
derivatives, e.g., braking index, are usually negligible. However, unique
pulsars for which the effects of the dynamical terms are significant can exist.
In particular, dynamical effects can make the magnitude of the observed value
of the braking index to be in the order of thousand while the true value of it
is close to the theoretically expected value three, especially if the pulsars
lie close to the Galactic centre. Dynamics can also affect the value of the
second derivative of the orbital frequency of a binary pulsar at the first
decimal place. We also emphasize the fact that our expressions provide more
accurate results than pre-existing approximate ones that exclude some of the
terms. Comparison with a set of pulsars showed that the median value of the
difference between the results obtained by our method and a pre-existing method
is about 50 percent.

interest in bioinformatics and several methods including GC-skew,

extended the auto-correlation method to predict ORI location with much higher
resolution for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which can be very helpful in
experimental validation of the computational predictions. The proposed complex
correlation method (iCorr) converts the genome sequence into a sequence of
complex numbers by mapping the nucleotides to {+1,-1,+i,-i} instead of {+1,-1}
used in the auto-correlation method (here, i is square root of -1). Thus, the
iCorr method exploits the complete spatial information about the positions of
all the four nucleotides unlike the earlier auto-correlation method which uses
the positional information of only one nucleotide. Also, the earlier
auto-correlation method required visual inspection of the obtained graphs to
identify the location of origin of replication. The proposed iCorr method does
away with this need and is able to identify the origin location simply by
picking the peak in the iCorr graph.

on identifying relationships between elements of the video and language

recent cognitive theoretic findings concerning mathematics. Contemporary
cognitive science opens new approaches to reformulate the fundamental questions
concerning mathematics and helps mathematicians break through the Platonic
beliefs about the essence and sources of mathematical knowledge. In this
article, we introduce and discuss mathematical thinking activities and
fundamental processes such as symbolic/formal and visual/spatial ones. Two
different aspects of mathematics should be separated in mathematical cognition.
One aspect considers mathematics as an explicit crystallized knowledge. The
other aspect considers mathematics as an ongoing and transient mental
processing. The cognitive processes and corresponding tasks involved in these
aspects are different. Ongoing mathematical activities both elementary and
advanced, demand working memory resources. Using dual-task techniques, we
design some pilot experiments to differentiate the symbolic/formal and
visual/spatial processes. Using this memory theoretic approach, we explain the
crucial roles of language-based processes such as verbal articulation and
instructive speech and also visuo-spatial intuition such as spatial imagery and
mental movement in various aspects of mathematics.

demanding and thus cannot be used in situations where computational speed
matters. To overcome this, approximations of these spectral lineshape models
can be used instead. In this paper, we develop a method called support vector
spectrum approximation (SVSA). This method uses machine learning to create
efficient and accurate approximations of any existing spectral lineshape model.
The SVSA framework improves upon existing methods by allowing efficient
approximations of spectral lineshapes to be calculated in arbitrary flow
regimes. We demonstrate the efficacy of SVSA in approximating coherent and
spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillioun spectra. We also show that SVSA reduces the
computational cost of a simulated filtered Rayleigh scattering experiment by a

formulate this as a constrained minimax game between an encoder and an
adversary where the constraint ensures a measure of usefulness (utility) of the
representation. The resulting problem is that of censoring, i.e., finding a
representation that is least informative about the sensitive attributes given a
utility constraint. For appropriately chosen adversarial loss functions, our
censoring framework precisely clarifies the optimal adversarial strategy
against strong information-theoretic adversaries; it also achieves the fairness
measure of demographic parity for the resulting constrained representations. We
evaluate the performance of our proposed framework on both synthetic and
publicly available datasets. For these datasets, we use two tradeoff measures:
censoring vs. representation fidelity and fairness vs. utility for downstream
tasks, to amply demonstrate that multiple sensitive features can be effectively
censored even as the resulting fair representations ensure accuracy for
multiple downstream tasks.

An
inaccurate wave-equation simulation, as a forward operator, will offset the

deal with incomplete physics. One proxy of incomplete physics is an inaccurate
discretization of Laplacian in simulation of wave equation via
finite-difference method. We exploit intrinsic one-to-one similarities between
timestepping algorithm with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and propose
to intersperse CNNs between low-fidelity timesteps. Augmenting neural networks
with low-fidelity timestepping algorithms may allow us to take large timesteps
while limiting the numerical dispersion artifacts. While simulating the
wave-equation with low-fidelity timestepping algorithm, by correcting the
wavefield several time during propagation, we hope to limit the numerical
dispersion artifact introduced by a poor discretization of the Laplacian. As a
proof of concept, we demonstrate this principle by correcting for numerical
dispersion by keeping the velocity model fixed, and varying the source
locations to generate training and testing pairs for our supervised learning
algorithm.

obtain feasible solutions to the AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem with
negligible optimality gaps on extremely fast timescales (e.g., milliseconds),
bypassing solving an AC OPF altogether. This is motivated by the fact that as
the power grid experiences increasing amounts of renewable power generation,
controllable loads, and other inverter-interfaced devices, faster system
dynamics and quicker fluctuations in the power supply are likely to occur.
Currently, grid operators typically solve AC OPF every 15 minutes to determine
economic generator settings while ensuring grid constraints are satisfied. Due
to the computational challenges with solving this nonconvex problem, many
efforts have focused on linearizing or approximating the problem in order to
solve the AC OPF on faster timescales. However, many of these approximations
can be fairly poor representations of the actual system state and still require
solving an optimization problem, which can be time consuming for large
networks. In this work, we leverage historical data to learn a mapping between
the system loading and optimal generation values, enabling us to find
near-optimal and feasible AC OPF solutions on extremely fast timescales without
actually solving an optimization problem.

cell transmission has received more and more research attention. In mobile
social networks, content popularity prediction has always been an important
part of traffic offloading and expanding data dissemination. However, current
mainstream content popularity prediction methods only use the number of
downloads and shares or the distribution of user interests, which do not
consider important time and geographic location information in mobile social
networks, and all of data is from OSN which is not same as MSN. In this work,
we propose D2D Long Short-Term Memory (D2D-LSTM), a deep neural network based
on LSTM, which is designed to predict a complete D2D diffusion path. Our work
is the first attempt in the world to use real data of MSN to predict diffusion
path with deep neural networks which conforms to the D2D structure. Compared to
linear sequence networks, only learn users' social features without time
distribution or GPS distribution and files' content features, our model can
predict the propagation path more accurately (up to 85.858\%) and can reach
convergence faster (less than 100 steps) because of the neural network that
conforms to the D2D structure and combines user social features and files
features. Moreover, we can simulate generating a D2D propagation tree. After
experiment and comparison, it is found to be very similar to the ground-truth
trees. Finally, we define a user prototype refinement that can more accurately
describe the propagation sharing habits of a prototype user (including content
preferences, time preferences, and geographic location preferences), and
experimentally validate the predictions when the user prototype is added to
1000 classes, it is almost identical to the 50 categories.

To address both limitations, we propose an efficient end-to-end method based on
a scalable sequential attention mechanism over a graph neural network that is
transferable to new graphs. On a diverse set of representative deep learning
models, including Inception-v3, AmoebaNet, Transformer-XL, and WaveNet, our

predicting more precise 3D bounding box coordinates. The proposed approach
requires 40 minutes of training to improve the detection performance. Moreover,
epBRM imposes less than 12ms to network inference time for up-to 20 objects.
  The proposed approach utilizes a spatial transformation mechanism to simplify
the box regression task. Adopting spatial transformation mechanism into epBRM
makes it possible to improve the quality of detection with a small sized

  We conduct in-depth analysis of the effect of various spatial transformation
mechanisms applied on raw LiDAR 3D point clouds. We also evaluate the proposed
epBRM by applying it to several state-of-the-art 3D object detection systems.
  We evaluate our approach on KITTI dataset, a standard 3D object detection

robustness for deep learning models in computer vision, especially when applied
in risk-sensitive areas. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models
either fail to obtain uncertainty estimation or need significant modification
(e.g., formulating a proper Bayesian treatment) to obtain it. Most previous
methods are not able to take an arbitrary model off the shelf and generate
uncertainty estimation without retraining or redesigning it. To address this
gap, we perform a systematic exploration into training-free uncertainty
estimation for dense regression, an unrecognized yet important problem, and
provide a theoretical construction justifying such estimations. We propose
three simple and scalable methods to analyze the variance of outputs from a
trained network under tolerable perturbations: infer-transformation,
infer-noise, and infer-dropout. They operate solely during the inference,
without the need to re-train, re-design, or fine-tune the models, as typically
required by state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods. Surprisingly, even
without involving such perturbations in training, our methods produce
comparable or even better uncertainty estimation when compared to
training-required state-of-the-art methods.

diversity (such as self-Bleu) are taken into account, the GAN variants even are
worse than a well-adjusted language model. But, Bleu and self-Bleu can not

distributional discrepancy between real text and generated text is still an
open problem. In this paper, we theoretically propose two metric functions to
measure the distributional difference between real text and generated text.
Besides that, a method is put forward to estimate them. First, we evaluate
language model with these two functions and find the difference is huge. Then,
we try several methods to use the detected discrepancy signal to improve the

Experimenting on two existing language GANs, the distributional discrepancy

atomic holes in a plasma environment generated by strong optical lasers is
investigated theoretically. The considered scenario involves the interaction of
a strong optical laser with a solid-state nuclear target leading to the
generation of a plasma. In addition, intense x-ray radiation from an X-ray Free
Electron Laser (XFEL) produces inner-shell holes in the plasma ions, into which
NEEC may occur. As case study we consider the $4.85$-keV transition starting
from the 2.4 MeV long-lived $^{\mathrm{93m}}$Mo isomer that can be used to
release the energy stored in this metastable nuclear state. We find that the
recombination into $2p_{1/2}$ inner-shell holes is most efficient in driving
the nuclear transition. Already at few hundred eV plasma temperature, the
generation of inner-shell holes can allow optimal conditions for NEEC,
otherwise reached for steady-state plasma conditions in thermodynamical
equilibrium only at few keV. The combination of x-ray and optical lasers
presents two advantages: first, NEEC rates can be maximized at plasma
temperatures where the photoexcitation rate remains low. Second, with mJ-class
optical lasers and an XFEL repetition rate of $10$ kHz, the NEEC excitation
number can reach $\sim 1$ depleted isomer per second and is competitive with
scenarios recently envisaged at petawatt-class lasers.

and sustaining livelihoods. Yet the way decisions are made on who is eligible
for jobs, and why, are rapidly changing with the advent and growth in uptake of
automated hiring systems (AHSs) powered by data-driven tools. Key concerns
about such AHSs include the lack of transparency and potential limitation of
access to jobs for specific profiles. In relation to the latter, however,
several of these AHSs claim to detect and mitigate discriminatory practices
against protected groups and promote diversity and inclusion at work. Yet
whilst these tools have a growing user-base around the world, such claims of
bias mitigation are rarely scrutinised and evaluated, and when done so, have
almost exclusively been from a US socio-legal perspective. In this paper, we
introduce a perspective outside the US by critically examining how three
prominent automated hiring systems (AHSs) in regular use in the UK, HireVue,
Pymetrics and Applied, understand and attempt to mitigate bias and
discrimination. Using publicly available documents, we describe how their tools
are designed, validated and audited for bias, highlighting assumptions and
limitations, before situating these in the socio-legal context of the UK. The
UK has a very different legal background to the US in terms not only of hiring
and equality law, but also in terms of data protection (DP) law. We argue that
this might be important for addressing concerns about transparency and could
mean a challenge to building bias mitigation into AHSs definitively capable of
meeting EU legal standards. This is significant as these AHSs, especially those
developed in the US, may obscure rather than improve systemic discrimination in
the workplace.
