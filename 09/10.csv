practitioners and researchers investigate the potential of driver
identification to enable a personalized driving experience. Within recent
years, a selection of studies have reported that individuals could be perfectly
identified based on their driving behavior under controlled conditions.
However, research investigating the potential of driver identification under
naturalistic conditions claim accuracies only marginally higher than random
guess. The paper at hand provides a comprehensive summary of the recent work,
highlighting the main discrepancies in the design of the machine learning
approaches, primarily the window length parameter that was considered. Key
findings further indicate that the longitudinal vehicle control information is
particularly useful for driver identification, leaving the research gap on the
extent to which the lateral vehicle control can be used for reliable
identification. Building upon existing work, we provide a novel approach for
the design of the window length parameter that provides evidence that reliable
driver identification can be achieved with data limited to the steering wheel
only. The results and insights in this paper are based on data collected from
the largest naturalistic driving study conducted in this field. Overall, a
neural network based on GRUs was found to provide better identification
performance than traditional methods, increasing the prediction accuracy from
under 15\% to over 65\% for 15 drivers. When leveraging the full field study
dataset, comprising 72 drivers, the accuracy of identification prediction of
the approach improved a random guess approach by a factor of 25.

  references",,"10.1093/mnras/stz2555",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previously, we showed that surface density profiles of the form of a
power-law times a Sersic function satisfy the hydrostatic Jeans equations, a
variety of observational constraints, and the condition of a minimal radial
entropy profile in two-dimensional galaxy discs with fixed power-law, halo
potentials. It was assumed that such density profiles are generated by star
scattering by clumps, waves, or other inhomogeneities. Here we generalize these
models to self-gravitating discs. The cylindrically symmetric Poisson equation
imposes strong constraints. Scattering processes favor smoothness, so the
smoothest solutions, which minimize entropy gradients, are preferred. In the
case of self-gravitating discs (e.g., inner discs), the gravity, surface
density and radial velocity dispersion in these smoothest models are all of the
form 1/r times an exponential. When vertical balance is included, the vertical
velocity dispersion squared has the same form as the surface density, and the
scale height is constant. In combined self-gravitating plus halo gravity cases,
the radial dispersion has an additional power-law term. Nonetheless, the
surface density profile has the same form at all radii, without breaks,
satisfying the disc-halo conspiracy. The azimuthal velocity and velocity
dispersions are smooth, though the former can have a distinct peak. In these
models the vertical dispersion increases inwards, and scattering may mediate a
transition to a secular bulge. If halo gravity dominates vertically in the
outer disc, it flares. The models suggest a correlation between disc mass and
radial scale length. The combination of smoothness, simplicity, ability to
match generic observational features and physical constraints is unique to
these models.

  Protocol",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proof-of-stake blockchain protocols are becoming one of the most promising
alternatives to the energy-consuming proof-of-work protocols. However, one
particularly critical threat in the PoS setting is the well-known long-range
attacks caused by secret key leakage (LRSL attack). Specifically, an adversary
can attempt to control/compromise accounts possessing substantial stake at some
past moment such that double-spend or erase past transactions, violating the
fundamental persistence property of blockchain. Puncturable signatures provide
a satisfying solution to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain
resilient to LRSL attack, despite of the fact that existent constructions are
not efficient enough for practical deployments.
  In this paper, we provide an in-depth study of puncturable signatures and
explore its applications in the proof-of-stake blockchain. We formalize a
security model that allows the adversary for adaptive signing and puncturing
queries, and show a construction with efficient puncturing operations based on
the Bloom filter data structure and strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. The
puncturing functionality we desire is for a particular part of message, like
prefix, instead of the whole message. Furthermore, we use puncturable
signatures to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain protocols that are
resilient to LRSL attack, while previously the forward-secure signature is used
to immunize this attack. We implement our scheme and provide experimental
results showing that in comparison with the forward-secure signature, our
construction performs substantially better on signature size, signing and
verification efficiency, significantly on key update efficiency.

involves computing model visibilities from a list of clean components, in order
that the contribution from the model can be subtracted from the observed
visibilities. This step is normally performed using a forward fast Fourier
transform (FFT), followed by a 'degridding' step that interpolates over the uv
plane to construct the model visibilities. An alternative approach is to
calculate the model visibilities directly by summing over all the members of
the clean component list, which is a more accurate method that can also be much
slower. However, if the clean components are used to construct a model image on
the surface of the celestial sphere then the model visibilities can be
generated directly from the wavelet coefficients, and the sparsity of the model
means that most of these coefficients are zero, and can be ignored. We have
constructed a prototype imager that uses a spherical-wavelet representation of
the model image to generate model visibilities during each major cycle, and
find empirically that the execution time scales with the wavelet resolution
level, J, as O(1.07 J), and with the number of distinct clean components, N_C,
as O(N_C). The prototype organises the wavelet coefficients into a tree
structure, and does not store or process the zero wavelet coefficients.

turn, produce gamma rays throughout the interactions with matter. Therefore,
the study of their very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray spectra is fundamental to
understand the cosmic-ray acceleration mechanisms in these objects. Blazars are
the most common type of AGNs populating gamma-ray catalogs, among these sources
BL-Lacs present featureless or very weak emission/absorption lines spectra.
Given that the extragalactic VHE gamma-ray catalog is poorly populated (about
70 blazars), having a redshift estimation of every single source is important
for the study of cosmic rays origin. In this work we use EBL absorption as a
tool to estimate KUV 00311-1938 redshift by comparing HE gamma-ray observations
with modeled EBL absorbed flux points. KUV 00311-1938 is a very interesting
BL-Lac; a priori it can be one of the most distant blazars since it has an
estimated redshift in the range 0.5 to 1.54. Assuming that there is no spectral
cutoff, we consider the intrinsic VHE spectrum to be the extrapolation of the
Fermi-LAT spectrum and model the intergalactic absorption by using the main
current EBL models. Comparing these results with the VHE measured point by
H.E.S.S., we give an estimate for the redshift of the blazar within observation

reduced to the question whether or not the first party can perform measurements

measurements which the first party is able to perform. We introduce a local
hidden state model explaining the conditional states for all generalized
measurements on Bell-diagonal states of two qubits. More precisely, it is known
for the restricted case of projective measurements and Bell-diagonal states
characterised by the correlation matrix $T$ that a local hidden state model
exists if and only if $R_T= 2 \pi N_T |\det (T)| \ge 1$, where $N_T$ is defined
by an integral over the Bloch sphere. For generalized measurements described by
positive operator valued measures we construct a model if $R_T \ge 6/5$. Our
work paves the way for a systematic study of steerability of quantum states

investigate three different ways of evaluating the naturalness of long-form

sentences in isolation, evaluating whole paragraphs of speech, and presenting a
selection of speech or text as context and evaluating the subsequent speech. We
find that, even though these three evaluations are based upon the same

not necessarily correlate with each other. We show that our findings are
consistent between a single speaker setting of read paragraphs and a

not suffice, and that multiple evaluations are required.

the black hole from sufficiently near the horizon, the first order area
increase, $\delta A$, of the black hole can be made arbitrarily small, i.e.,
the process can be done in a ``reversible'' manner. At second order, there may
be effects on the energy delivered to the black hole---quadratic in $q$ and
$S$---resulting from (i) the finite size of the body and (ii) self-force
corrections to the energy. Sorce and Wald have calculated these effects for a
charged, non-spinning body on the symmetry axis of an uncharged Kerr black
hole. We consider the generalization of this process for a charged and spinning
body on the symmetry axis of a Kerr-Newman black hole, where the self-force
effects have not been calculated. A spinning body (with negligible extent along
the spin axis) must have a mass quadrupole moment $\gtrsim S^2/m$, so at
quadratic order in the spin, we must take into account quadrupole effects on
the motion. After taking into account all such finite size effects, we find
that the condition $\delta^2 A \geq 0$ yields a nontrivial lower bound on the
self-force energy, $E_{SF}$, at the horizon. In particular, for an uncharged,
spinning body on the axis of a Kerr black hole of mass $M$, the net
contribution of spin self-force to the energy of the body at the horizon is
$E_{SF} \geq S^2/8M^3$, corresponding to an overall repulsive spin self-force.
A lower bound for the self-force energy, $E_{SF}$, for a body with both charge
and spin at the horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole is given. This lower bound
will be the correct formula for $E_{SF}$ if the dropping process can be done
reversibly to second order.

an alternative direct imaging correlation strategy using a Direct Fourier

multiplication between the DFT matrix and a vector of the electric fields from
each antenna. This offers perfect correction for wide field and non-coplanarity
effects. When implemented with data from the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), it
offers comparable computational performance to previously demonstrated direct
imaging techniques, despite having a theoretically higher floating point cost.
It also has additional benefits, such as imaging sparse arrays and control over
which sky co-ordinates are imaged, allowing variable pixel placement across an
image. It is in practice a highly flexible and efficient method of direct radio
imaging when implemented on suitable arrays. A functioning Electric Field
Direct imaging architecture using the DFT is presented, alongside an
exploration of techniques for wide-field imaging similar to those in visibility

patterns presented as submatrices that are dense in 1's. At each iteration,
MEBF permutates the rows and columns such that the permutated matrix is
approximately Upper Triangular-Like (UTL) with so-called Simultaneous

clusters in the raw sample. In the second step, a surface acoustic wave-based
active microfluidic separation device is used to continuously deflect
tardigrades from their original streamlines inside the microchannel and thus
selectively isolate them from algae and eggs. The experimental results

specifically, we propose the equivalent for graphs of the so-called Laplacian

The proposed filter is able to reveal interesting spatial patterns while still
enabling the definition of entropy of time slices. The entropy reveals the
degree of randomness of a time slice, helping users to identify expected and
unexpected phenomena over time. The effectiveness of our approach appears in
applications involving synthetic and real data sets, which show that the

This question is still being investigated on the basis of the Earth-based and
space-borne observations of the Martian moons and of the more modern theories
proposed to account for the formation of other moon systems. The most recent
scenario of formation of the Martian moons relies on a giant impact occurring
at early Mars history and having also formed the so-called hemispheric crustal
dichotomy. This scenario accounts for the current orbits of both moons unlike
the scenario of capture of small size asteroids. It also predicts a composition
of disk material as a mixture of Mars and impactor materials that is in
agreement with remote sensing observations of both moon surfaces, which
suggests a composition different from Mars. The composition of the Martian
moons is however unclear, given the ambiguity on the interpretation of the
remote sensing observations. The study of the formation of the Martian moon
system has improved our understanding of moon formation of terrestrial planets:
The giant collision scenario can have various outcomes and not only a big moon

the early solar system when conditions were favorable for giant collisions to
occur. The next step in exploration of Martian moon is a sample return mission

the unique magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy pattern of the boron nitride

results in distinctively different valley polarization of the emitted phonon, a
result of the different intervalley scattering mechanism for the electron and

affect the nuclear structure of exotic nuclei, its influence on nuclear
reactions has only recently been investigated. The primary reason for this
neglect is the fact that most studies of nuclear dynamics do not include the
tensor force at all in their models. Indeed, only a few Skyrme parametrizations
consider the tensor interaction in parameter determination. With modern
research facilities extending our ability to probe exotic nuclei, a correct
description of nuclear dynamics and heavy-ion fusion is vital to both
supporting and leading experimental efforts.
  [Method] Fusion cross sections are calculated using ion-ion potentials
generated by the fully microscopic density-constrained time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) method with the complete Skyrme tensor interaction.
  [Results] For light nuclei, the tensor force only slightly changes the
sub-barrier fusion cross sections at very low energies. Heavier nuclei,
however, begin to exhibit a substantial hindrance effect in the sub-barrier
region. This effect is strongest in spin-unsaturated systems, though can
manifest in other configurations as well. Static, ground state deformation
effects of the tensor force can also affect cross sections by shifting the
fusion barrier.
  [Conclusions] The tensor interaction has a measurable effect on the fusion
cross sections of nuclei spanning the nuclear chart. The effect comes from both
static effects present in the ground state and dynamic processes arising from
the time evolution of the system. This motivates the development of a modern
Skyrme parameter set that includes all time-odd and tensor terms and that
studies moving forward should include the tensor force to ensure a more robust
and complete description of nuclei.

fibers and high detection yield of single-pixel photon counters. Upon
irradiation at 6 MV, our fiber probe led to a linear detection response with a

hyperparameter space. To this end we interpret hyperparameters as controlling
the level of correlated noise in training, which can be mapped to an effective

allowed to exchange their hyperparameters throughout the training using the
well established parallel tempering technique of statistical physics. Each
simulation corresponds then to a unique path, or history, in the joint

infinite number of such solutions exist at discrete complex frequencies. Our
results apply to linear electromagnetic and acoustic wave scattering and also
to quantum scattering, in all dimensions, for arbitrary geometries including
scatterers in free space, and for any choice of the input/output sets. We refer
to such a state as reflection-zero (R-zero) when it occurs off the
real-frequency axis and as an Reflectionless Scattering Mode (RSM) when it is
tuned to a real frequency as a steady-state solution. Such reflectionless
behavior requires a specific monochromatic input wavefront, given by the
eigenvector of a filtered scattering matrix with eigenvalue zero. Steady-state
RSMs may be realized by index tuning which do not break flux conservation or by
gain-loss tuning. RSMs of flux-conserving cavities are bidirectional while
those of non-flux-conserving cavities are generically unidirectional. Cavities
with ${\cal PT}$-symmetry have unidirectional R-zeros in complex-conjugate
pairs, implying that reflectionless states naturally arise at real frequencies
for small gain-loss parameter but move into the complex-frequency plane after a
spontaneous ${\cal PT}$-breaking transition. Numerical examples of RSMs are
given for one-dimensional cavities with and without gain/loss, a ${\cal PT}$
cavity, a two-dimensional multiwaveguide junction, and a two-dimensional
deformed dielectric cavity in free space. We outline and implement a general

high-frequency and periodical features of the safety message broadcast, the
application-layer design of the CIDC enables each vehicle to estimate the
instantaneous channel contention intensity in a fully distributed manner. With
the contention intensity information, the MAC layer design of CIDC allows
vehicles to adopt a better channel access strategy compared to the 802.11p.
This is because CIDC selects the initial back-off counter for each new packet
deterministically, i.e., based on the contention intensity, instead of
randomly. The proposed CIDC is modeled, and key performance indicators in terms
of the packet collision probability and average contention delay, are derived.
It is shown that the proposed change in the initial counter selection leads to
a system model completely different from the classic Markov chain based model.
Moreover, the proposed CIDC, fully distributed and compatible with the 802.11p,
can achieve both a much lower collision probability and a smaller contention
delay compared with 802.11p at the cost of a small communication and
computation overhead. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the CIDC in both of the accurate and the erroneous contention
intensity estimation scenarios.

enhancement which takes place in tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) in indium
nitride. In addition to the well-known first-order optical phonons of indium
nitride, near-field Raman modes, not detectable in the far-field, appear when
approaching the plasmonic probe. The frequencies of these modes coincide with
calculated energies of second order combinational modes consisting of optical
zone center phonons and acoustic phonons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The
appearance of strong combinational modes suggests that TERS in indium nitride
represents a special case of Raman scattering in which a resonance condition on
the nanometer scale is achieved between the localized surface plasmons (LSPs)
and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of the probe with the surface charge
oscillation of the material. We suggest that the surface charge accumulation
(SCA) in InN, which can render the surface a degenerate semiconductor, is the
dominating reason for the unusually large enhancement of the TERS signal as
compared to other inorganic semiconductors. Thus, the plasmon-resonant TERS
(PR-TERS) process in InN makes this technique an excellent tool for defect
characterization of indium-rich semiconductor heterostructures and
nanostructures with high carrier concentrations.

materials are typically studied independently. However, there have been rapid
recent developments in quantum materials in which topological phase transitions
emerge when the single-particle band structure is modified by strong
interactions. We here demonstrate that the room-temperature phase of
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I is a Weyl semimetal with 24 pairs of Weyl nodes. Owing to its
quasi-1D structure, (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I hosts an established CDW instability just
below room temperature. Using X-ray diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we find that the CDW in
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I couples the bulk Weyl points and opens a band gap. The
correlation-driven topological phase transition in (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I provides a
route towards observing condensed-matter realizations of axion electrodynamics
in the gapped regime, topological chiral response effects in the semimetallic
phase, and represents an avenue for exploring the interplay of correlations and
topology in a solid-state material.

simulations of Milky Way formation, we investigate the origin of the baryonic
material found in stars at redshift zero. We find that roughly half of this
material originates from subhalo/satellite systems and half is smoothly
accreted from the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM). About $90 \%$ of all material
has been ejected and re-accreted in galactic winds at least once. The vast
majority of smoothly accreted gas enters into a galactic fountain that extends
to a median galactocentric distance of $\sim 20$ kpc with a median recycling
timescale of $\sim 500$ Myr. We demonstrate that, in most cases, galactic
fountains acquire angular momentum via mixing of low-angular momentum,
wind-recycled gas with high-angular momentum gas in the Circum-Galactic Medium
(CGM). Prograde mergers boost this activity by helping to align the disc and
CGM rotation axes, whereas retrograde mergers cause the fountain to lose
angular momentum. Fountain flows that promote angular momentum growth are
conducive to smooth evolution on tracks quasi-parallel to the disc sequence of
the stellar mass-specific angular momentum plane, whereas retrograde minor
mergers, major mergers and bar-driven secular evolution move galaxies towards
the bulge-sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that fountain flows act to flatten
and narrow the radial metallicity gradient and metallicity dispersion of disc
stars, respectively. Thus, the evolution of galactic fountains depends strongly
on the cosmological merger history and is crucial for the chemo-dynamical
evolution of Milky Way-sized disc galaxies.

relics of an early phase of galaxy formation. They contain some of the oldest
and most metal-poor stars in the Universe which likely formed before the epoch
of hydrogen reionisation. These galaxies are so faint that they can only be
detected as satellites of the Milky Way. They are so small that they are just
barely resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Here we
combine very high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations with a
semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to study the demographics and spatial
distribution of ultrafaint satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes. We show that
the abundance of these galaxies is correlated with the assembly history of the
host halo: at fixed mass, haloes assembled earlier contain, on average, more
ultrafaint satellites today than haloes assembled later. We identify simulated
galactic haloes that experience an ancient Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage-like and a
recent LMC-like accretion event and find that the former occurs in 33% of the
sample and the latter in 9%. Only 3% experience both events and these are
especially rich in ultrafaint satellites, most acquired during the ancient
accretion event. Our models predict that the radial distribution of satellites
is more centrally concentrated in early-forming haloes. Accounting for the
depletion of satellites by tidal interactions with the central disc, we find a
very good match to the observed radial distribution of satellites in the Milky
Way over the entire radial range. This agreement is mainly due to the ability
of our model to track 'orphan' galaxies after their subhaloes fall below the
resolution limit of the simulation.

$r_h$) and outer field (0.7 $ r_h$) that reach below the oldest main sequence
turnoff. WLM has no early dominant episode of star formation: 20% of its
stellar mass formed by ~12.5 Gyr ago (z~5). It also has an SFR that rises to
the present with 50% of the stellar mass within the most recent 5 Gyr (z<0.7).
There is evidence of a strong age gradient: the mean age of the outer field is
5 Gyr older than the inner field despite being only 0.4 kpc apart. Some models
suggest such steep gradients are associated with strong stellar feedback and
dark matter core creation. The SFHs of real isolated dwarf galaxies and those
from the the Feedback In Realistic Environment suite are in good agreement for
$M_{\star}(z=0) \sim 10^7-10^9 M_{\odot}$, but in worse agreement at lower
masses ($M_{\star}(z=0) \sim 10^5-10^7 M_{\odot}$). These differences may be
explainable by systematics in the models (e.g., reionization model) and/or
observations (HST field placement). We suggest that a coordinated effort to get
deep CMDs between HST/JWST (crowded central fields) and WFIRST (wide-area halo
coverage) is the optimal path for measuring global SFHs of isolated dwarf

dispersion-dominated spheroids is central to our comprehension of galaxy
evolution. Morphological transformation is largely merger-driven. While major
mergers can efficiently create spheroids, recent work has highlighted the
significant role of other processes, like minor mergers, in driving
morphological change. Given their rich merger histories, spheroids typically
exhibit large fractions of `ex-situ' stellar mass, i.e. mass that is accreted,
via mergers, from external objects. This is particularly true for the most
massive galaxies, whose stellar masses typically cannot be attained without a
large number of mergers. Here, we explore an unusual population of extremely
massive (M* > 10^11 MSun) spheroids, in the Horizon-AGN simulation, which
exhibit anomalously low ex-situ mass fractions, indicating that they form
without recourse to significant merging. These systems form in a single
minor-merger event (with typical merger mass ratios of 0.11 - 0.33), with a
specific orbital configuration, where the satellite orbit is virtually
co-planar with the disc of the massive galaxy. The merger triggers a
catastrophic change in morphology, over only a few hundred Myrs, coupled with
strong in-situ star formation. While this channel produces a minority (~5 per
cent) of such galaxies, our study demonstrates that the formation of at least
some of the most massive spheroids need not involve major mergers -- or any
significant merging at all -- contrary to what is classically believed.

depend on galaxy environment. To this end we analyse a sample of 1162 local,
star-forming galaxies from the galaxy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO
(MaNGA). Generally, both parameters do not show any significant dependence on
environment. However, in agreement with previous studies, we find that low-mass
satellite galaxies are an exception to this rule. The gas metallicity in these
objects increases while their {\Sigma}SFR decreases slightly with environmental
density. The present analysis of MaNGA data allows us to extend this to
spatially resolved properties. Our study reveals that the gas metallicity
gradients of low-mass satellites flatten and their {\Sigma}SFR gradients
steepen with increasing environmental density. By extensively exploring a
chemical evolution model, we identify two scenarios that are able to explain
this pattern: metal-enriched gas accretion or pristine gas inflow with varying
accretion timescales. The latter scenario better matches the observed
{\Sigma}SFR gradients, and is therefore our preferred solution. In this model,
a shorter gas accretion timescale at larger radii is required. This suggests
that 'outside-in quenching' governs the star formation processes of low-mass
satellite galaxies in dense environments.

connecting the fragments. For the poorly resolved observations we find low Q
values in the outskirts of the disk. Therefore we are able to predict that the
disk is unstable and fragmenting even in poorly resolved observations. This
conclusion is true regardless of knowledge about the inclination of the disk.

combined information from the main sequence turn-off and the horizontal branch
to resolve the ancient star formation rates on a finer temporal scale than

formation, two very close together at ancient times and the last one ending
between 6 and 8 Gyr ago. We show that the three discrete clumps of stars on the
horizontal branch are linked to the distinct episodes of star formation in
Tucana. The spatial distribution of the clumps reveals that each generation of
stars presents a higher concentration than the previous one. The simultaneous
modelling of the horizontal branch and the main sequence turn-off also allows
us to measure the amount of mass lost by red giant branch stars in Tucana with
unprecedented precision, confirming dwarf spheroidals to be excellent
laboratories to study the advanced evolution of low-mass stars.

that the clustering of primordial black holes (PBHs) emerges even on
super-horizon scales at the formation time. This effect has been investigated
in the high-peak limit of the PBH formation in the radiation-dominated epoch in
the literature. There is another possibility that the PBH formation takes place
in the early matter-dominated epoch. In this scenario, the high-peak limit is
not applicable because even initially small perturbations grow and can become a
PBH. We first derive a general formula to estimate the clustering of PBHs with
primordial non-Gaussianity without assuming the high-peak limit, and then apply
this formula to a model of PBH formation in a matter-dominated epoch.
Clustering is less significant in the case of the PBH formation in the
matter-dominated epoch than that in the radiation-dominated epoch.
Nevertheless, it is much larger than the Poisson shot noise in many cases.
Relations to the constraints of the isocurvature perturbations by the cosmic
microwave background radiation are quantitatively discussed.

single stellar cluster, even taking into account residual gas expulsion. The
relic filament is also too young to be a tidal stream, since Galactic tides act
on much longer time scales of order 100 Myr. It therefore appears likely that
the structure formed from a molecular cloud filament similar to Orion A in the
OSFR and retained its morphology despite decoupling from its natal gas. Hence,
the Orion relic filament bears witness to the short-lived evolutionary phase
between gas removal and dispersion due to shears and tides, and provides
crucial new insights into how stars are formed in molecular clouds.

gravity, black holes may have discrete emission spectra. Using the time-energy
uncertainty principle they have also shown that, for a (non-rotating)
Schwarzschild black hole, the natural broadening $\delta\omega$ of the
black-hole emission lines is expected to be small on the scale set by the
characteristic frequency spacing $\Delta\omega$ of the spectral lines:
$\zeta^{\text{Sch}}\equiv\delta\omega/\Delta\omega\ll1$. BM have therefore
concluded that the expected discrete emission lines of the quantized
Schwarzschild black hole are unlikely to overlap. In this paper we calculate
the characteristic dimensionless ratio $\zeta(\bar
a)\equiv\delta\omega/\Delta\omega$ for the predicted BM emission spectra of
rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes (here $\bar a\equiv J/M^2$ is the
dimensionless angular momentum of the black hole). It is shown that $\zeta(\bar
a)$ is an increasing function of the black-hole angular momentum. In
particular, we find that the quantum emission lines of Kerr black holes in the
regime $\bar a\gtrsim 0.9$ are characterized by the dimensionless ratio
$\zeta(\bar a)\gtrsim1$ and are therefore effectively blended together. Our
results thus suggest that, even if the underlying mass (energy) spectrum of
these rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes is fundamentally discrete as suggested
by Bekenstein and Mukhanov, the natural broadening phenomenon (associated with
the time-energy uncertainty principle) is expected to smear the black-hole
radiation spectrum into a continuum.

particular, we uncover points of freezing in the space of drive parameters

constrained due to the emergence of an almost exact local conserved quantity,
which scars the {\it entire} Floquet spectrum by preventing the system from
heating up ergodically, starting from any generic state, even though it
delocalizes over an appropriate subspace. At large drive frequencies, where a

emergent conservation law is reflected in the appearance of an `integrability'

Hamiltonians, including the Ising model in a transverse field in {\it any

shown to be robust in the presence of {\it two-body Heisenberg interactions

theory allows a variety of nonsignaling resources which are useful for
distributed quantum information processing. These include quantum states,
nonlocal boxes, steering assemblages, teleportages, channel steering
assemblages, and so on. Such resources are often studied using nonlocal games,
semiquantum games, entanglement-witnesses, teleportation experiments, and
similar tasks. We introduce a unifying framework which subsumes the full range
of nonsignaling resources, as well as the games and experiments which probe
them, into a common resource theory: that of local operations and shared
randomness (LOSR). Crucially, we allow these LOSR operations to locally change
the type of a resource, so that players can convert resources of any type into
resources of any other type, and in particular into strategies for the specific
type of game they are playing. We then prove several theorems relating
resources and games of different types. These theorems generalize a number of
seminal results from the literature, and can be applied to lessen the
assumptions needed to characterize the nonclassicality of resources. As just
one example, we prove that semiquantum games are able to perfectly characterize
the LOSR nonclassicality of every resource of any type (not just quantum
states, as was previously shown). As a consequence, we show that any resource

these methods can be difficult to tune, and can easily result in imbalanced
degrees of robustness to individual perturbation models, resulting in a
sub-optimal worst-case loss over the union. In this work, we develop a natural
generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure to incorporate multiple
perturbation models into a single attack, by taking the worst-case over all
steepest descent directions. This approach has the advantage of directly
converging upon a trade-off between different perturbation models which
minimizes the worst-case performance over the union. With this approach, we are
able to train standard architectures which are simultaneously robust against

worldsheet metric and has the ambitwistor string as its tensionless limit. As
proposed by Siegel, there is a one-parameter ($\beta$) gauge family
interpolating between the chiral limit and the usual conformal gauge in string
theory. This idea was used to compute scattering amplitudes of tensile chiral
strings, which are given by standard string amplitudes with modified
($\beta$-dependent) antiholomorphic propagators.
  Due to the absence of a sensible definition of the integrated vertex
operator, there is still no ordinary prescription for higher than $3$-point
amplitude computations directly from the chiral model. The exception is the
tensionless limit.
  In this work this gap will be filled. Starting with a chiral string action,
the integrated vertex operator is defined, relying on the so-called sectorized
interpretation. As it turns out, this construction effectively emulates a
left/right factorization of the scattering amplitude and introduces a relative
sign flip in the propagator for the sector-split target space coordinates.
$N$-point tree-level amplitudes can be easily shown to coincide with the
results of Siegel et al.

learning which encodes images to obfuscate the patient identity while
preserving enough information for a target task. Our novel architecture is
composed of three components: 1) an encoder network which removes
identity-specific features from input medical images, 2) a discriminator
network that attempts to identify the subject from the encoded images, 3) a
medical image analysis network which analyzes the content of the encoded images
(segmentation in our case). By simultaneously fooling the discriminator and
optimizing the medical analysis network, the encoder learns to remove
privacy-specific features while keeping those essentials for the target task.
Our approach is illustrated on the problem of segmenting brain MRI from the

longitudinal data from PPMI, we show that the discriminator learns to heavily

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) taking place in realistic magnetic field
configurations of moderately active M-dwarf stars. Our analysis indicates that
a clear, novel, and observable, coronal response is generated due to the
collapse of the eruption and its eventual release into the stellar wind.
Escaping CME events, weakly suppressed by the large-scale field, induce a
flare-like signature in the emission from coronal material at different
temperatures due to compression and associated heating. Such flare-like
profiles display a distinctive temporal evolution in their Doppler shift signal
(from red to blue), as the eruption first collapses towards the star and then
perturbs the ambient magnetized plasma on its way outwards. For stellar fields
providing partial confinement, CME fragmentation takes place, leading to rise
and fall flow patterns which resemble the solar coronal rain cycle. In strongly
suppressed events, the response is better described as a gradual brightening,
in which the failed CME is deposited in the form of a coronal rain cloud
leading to a much slower rise in the ambient high-energy flux by relatively
small factors ($\sim2-3$). In all the considered cases (escaping/confined) a
fractional decrease in the emission from mid-range coronal temperature plasma
occurs, similar to the coronal dimming events observed on the Sun. Detection of
the observational signatures of these CME-induced features requires a sensitive
next generation X-ray space telescope.

by UV fields from the massive star $\theta^1$C. This drives thermal winds,
inducing mass loss rates of up to $\dot{M}_\mathrm{wind}\sim
10^{-7}\,M_\odot$/yr in the `proplyds' (ionised PPDs) close to the centre. For
the mean age of the ONC and reasonable initial PPD masses, such mass loss rates
imply that discs should have been dispersed. However, ~80% of stars still
exhibit a NIR excess, suggesting that significant circumstellar mass remains.
This `proplyd lifetime problem' has persisted since the discovery of
photoevaporating discs in the core of the ONC by O'Dell & Wen (1994). In this
work, we demonstrate how an extended period of star formation can solve this
problem. Coupling N-body calculations and a viscous disc evolution model, we
obtain high disc fractions at the present day. This is partly due to the
migration of older stars outwards, and younger stars inwards such that the most
strongly irradiated PPDs are also the youngest. We show how the disc mass
distribution can be used to test the recent claims in the literature for
multiple stellar populations in the ONC. Our model also explains the recent
finding that host mass and PPD mass are only weakly correlated, in contrast
with other regions of similar age. We conclude that the status of the ONC as
the archetype for understanding the influence of environment on planet
formation is undeserved; the complex star formation history (involving star
formation episodes within ~0.8 Myr of the present day) results in confusing
signatures in the PPD population.

such an autonomous learning network implements a self-inverse function. A
self-inverse network shares several distinct advantages: only one network
instead of two, better generalization and more restricted parameter space. Most

property that cannot be guaranteed by earlier approaches that are not

baseline approaches that use two separate models for the image synthesis along
two directions, our self-inverse network achieves better synthesis results in
terms of standard metrics. Finally, our sensitivity analysis confirms the
feasibility of learning a self-inverse function for the bidirectional image

(such as replanning under dynamically changing environments or tracking fast
moving targets). Typically, Dubins problem requires to solve for six path
types; however, due to the presence of currents, four of these path types
require to solve the root-finding problem involving transcendental functions.
Thus, the existing methods result in high computation times and their
applicability for real-time applications is limited. In this regard, in order
to obtain a real-time solution, this paper proposes a novel approach where only
a subset of two Dubins path types (LSL and RSR) are used which have direct
analytical solutions in the presence of currents. However, these two path types
do not provide full reachability. We show that by extending the feasible range
of circular arcs in the LSL and RSR path types from $2\pi$ to $4\pi$: 1) full
reachability of any goal pose is guaranteed, and 2) paths with lower time costs
as compared to the corresponding $2\pi$-arc paths can be produced. Theoretical
properties are rigorously established, supported by several examples, and
evaluated in comparison to the Dubins solutions by extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations.

proven to be a significant aid in medical imaging classification tasks by
decreasing the noise and variance of the training dataset. However,
implementing this approach with classical methods is challenging: the cost of
obtaining a dense segmentation is high, and the precise input area that is most
crucial to the classification task is difficult to determine a-priori. We
propose a novel joint-training deep reinforcement learning framework for image
augmentation. A segmentation network, weakly supervised with policy gradient
optimization, acts as an agent, and outputs masks as actions given samples as
states, with the goal of maximizing reward signals from the classification
network. In this way, the segmentation network learns to mask unimportant
imaging features. Our method, Adversarial Policy Gradient Augmentation (APGA),
shows promising results on Stanford's MURA dataset and on a hip fracture
classification task with an increase in global accuracy of up to 7.33% and
improved performance over baseline methods in 9/10 tasks evaluated. We discuss
the broad applicability of our joint training strategy to a variety of medical
imaging tasks.

points, around which the bosonic excitations are called Weyl magnons. Here, we
investigate the Klein tunneling of Weyl magnons, during the process of which
Weyl magnons tunnel through a high potential barrier. Specifically, we study
the magnetization current carried by Weyl magnons in a quasi-one-dimensional
magnetic wire, in the middle of which a gate magnetic field is applied to
generate a potential barrier. The transmission probability is calculated and
the Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism is used to find the magnetization current.
Various types of Weyl magnons are considered, including isotropic, tilted, and
double Weyl magnons. Unlike in Weyl semimetals where fermionic statistics is in
charge and the current oscillates with the gate field as a result of
Fabry-P\'erot resonances, here Bose distribution smears out the oscillations.
We find that the tilting of the Weyl cone causes the decrease of the
magnetization current from Klein tunneling, while for double Weyl magnons,
Klein tunneling is absent in the direction of quadratic dispersion, but is
enhanced in the direction of linear dispersion. Our results show that the
behaviour of the current-voltage characteristics of magnons is rather different
from that of electrons due to different statistics, although the
single-particle properties, such as the transmission probabilities, are the
same for both Weyl bosons and Weyl fermions.

a self-inverse network learning approach for unpaired image-to-image

simply augmenting the training samples by swapping inputs and outputs during

The outcome of such learning is a proven one-to-one mapping function. Our
extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including cross-modal medical

  slip events, part I: one-dimensional model","45 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have developed a model that describes the major characteristics of a
rupture, ranging from regular earthquakes (EQs) to slow slip events (SSEs),
including episodic tremor and slip (ETS). Previous model predictions, while
accurate, are based on a highly idealized initial stress distribution and a
simple velocity-dependent expression for friction. The full scope of the model
has, therefore, not been fully demonstrated. Further developments, presented
here, include more physically realistic treatments of both the initial
conditions and friction. Model predictions are: (1) The type of a seismic
event, i.e. regular EQ or SSE, is determined by the fault strength, the shear
to normal stress ratio, and the gradient in the ratio. Quantitative values for
these crucial parameters are also obtained here; (2) Rupture velocities for
regular EQs range from a fraction of the shear wave velocity up to the
supershear velocity. The maximum slip velocity for regular EQs is typically on
the order of 1 m/s. For SSEs, the slip velocity ranges widely from a few
cm/year up to 0.1 m/s. The magnitude of the stress drop may vary in the range
from 1% to 10% of the initial shear stress for regular EQs and from 0.1% to 10%
for the SSEs; (3) The rupture can expend as a crack-like mode or as a
self-healing pulse mode. The type of rupture mode is determined by the stress
ratio and its gradient. If stress heterogeneity has a step-like shape, the
rupture is always crack-like. If the heterogeneity is localized, the rupture is
crack-like for sufficiently large values of the stress and its gradient and is
pulse-like for smaller values; (4) After an instability develops, rupture
dynamics do not depend on the relative values of the rate-state a and b
parameters, i.e., it does not matter if frictional sliding is
velocity-weakening or velocity-strengthening. Models based on the rate-state
are not consistent with this result.

corresponding to each rule is defined in terms of elementary two-state
creation/annihilation operators. The resulting graph grammar algebra has the
following properties: (1) The product and commutator of two such operators is a
sum of such operators with integer coefficients. Thus, the algebra and the Lie
algebra occurs entirely at the structural (or graph-combinatorial) level of
graph grammar rules, lifted from the level of elementary creation/annihilation
operators (an improvement over [1], Propositions 1 and 2). (2) The product of
the off-diagonal (state-changing) parts of two such graph rule operators is a
sum of off-diagonal graph rule operators with non-negative integer
coefficients. (3) These results apply whether the semantics of a graph grammar
rule leaves behind hanging edges (Theorem 1), or removes hanging edges (Theorem
2). (4) The algebra is constructive in terms of elementary two-state

the plasma than reduced models like magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) since they
naturally retain non-ideal effects like electron inertia, Hall term, pressure
anisotropy/nongyrotropy, etc. One obstacle to broader application of these
model is that an explicit treatment of their source terms leads to the need to
resolve rapid kinetic processes like plasma oscillation and electron cyclotron
motion, even when they are not important. In this paper, we suggest two ways to
address this issue. First, we derive the analytic forms solutions to the source
update equations, which can be implemented as a practical, but less generic
solver. We then develop a time-centered, locally implicit algorithm to update
the source terms, allowing stepping over the fast kinetic time-scales. For a
plasma with $S$ species, the locally implict algorithm involves inverting a
local $3S+3$ matrix only, thus is very efficient. The performance can be
further elevated by using the direct update formulas to skip null calculations.
Benchmarks illustrated the exact energy-conservation of the locally implicit
solver, as well as its efficiency and robustness for both small-scale,
idealized problems and large-scale, complex systems. The locally implicit
algorithm can be also easily extended to include other local sources, like
collisions and ionization, which are difficult to solve analytically.

A popular alternative is to use cloud services to run deep learning models to
process raw data. This, however, imposes privacy risks. Some prior arts
proposed sending the features extracted from raw data to the cloud.
Unfortunately, these extracted features can still be exploited by attackers to
recover raw images and to infer embedded private attributes. In this paper, we
propose an adversarial training framework, DeepObfuscator, which prevents the
usage of the features for reconstruction of the raw images and inference of
private attributes. This is done while retaining useful information for the
intended cloud service. DeepObfuscator includes a learnable obfuscator that is
designed to hide privacy-related sensitive information from the features by
performing our proposed adversarial training algorithm. The proposed algorithm
is designed by simulating the game between an attacker who makes efforts to
reconstruct raw image and infer private attributes from the extracted features
and a defender who aims to protect user privacy. By deploying the trained
obfuscator on the smartphone, features can be locally extracted and then sent
to the cloud. Our experiments on CelebA and LFW datasets show that the quality
of the reconstructed images from the obfuscated features of the raw image is
dramatically decreased from 0.9458 to 0.3175 in terms of multi-scale structural
similarity. The person in the reconstructed image, hence, becomes hardly to be

$d$ can be viewed as a unitary element of the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal O}_d$
and as such defines an endomorphism of ${\mathcal O}_d$. These Yang-Baxter
endomorphisms restrict and extend to endomorphisms of several other $C^*$- and
von Neumann algebras and furthermore define a II$_1$ factor associated with an
extremal character of the infinite braid group. This paper is devoted to a
detailed study of such Yang-Baxter endomorphisms.
  Among the topics discussed are characterizations of Yang-Baxter endomorphisms
and the relative commutants of the various subfactors they induce, an
endomorphism perspective on algebraic operations on R-matrices such as tensor
products and cabling powers, and properties of characters of the infinite braid
group defined by R-matrices. In particular, it is proven that the partial trace
of an R-matrix is an invariant for its character by a commuting square
argument.
  Yang-Baxter endomorphisms also supply information on R-matrices themselves,
for example it is shown that the left and right partial traces of an R-matrix
coincide and are normal, and that the spectrum of an R-matrix can not be
concentrated in a small disc. Upper and lower bounds on the minimal and Jones
indices of Yang-Baxter endomorphisms are derived, and a full characterization
of R-matrices defining ergodic endomorphisms is given.
  As examples, so-called simple R-matrices are discussed in any dimension $d$,
and the set of all Yang-Baxter endomorphisms in $d=2$ is completely analyzed.

investigated in the Lagrangian frame. Specifically, the initial motion of
upwelling fluid material from the wall is related to the long-term attracting
manifolds in the flow field. While the short-time kinematics are governed by
the formation of a material spike upstream of the zero-skin-friction point and
ejection of particles in direction of the asymptotic separation line, the
trajectories of the fluid tracers are guided by attracting ridges in the
finite-time Lyapunov exponents once they leave the vicinity of the wall. The
wall signature of this initial fluid upwelling event, the so-called
\textit{spiking point} [Serra, M., Vetel, J., Haller, G., ""Exact theory of
material spike formation in flow separation"", \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, Vol.

the first time, from high-order numerical derivatives of the wall-normal
velocity obtained from direct numerical simulations of a circular cylinder and
a cambered NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil. As the spline-based boundary parametrization
of the airfoil profile induces oscillations, the principle spiking point can be
recovered robustly through appropriate filtering. The short-term kinematics

suitably annotated training data, hence the recent success of transfer learning
across a wide variety of them. The typical recipe involves: (i) training a
deep, possibly bidirectional, neural network with an objective related to
language modeling, for which training data is plentiful; and (ii) using the
trained network to derive contextual representations that are far richer than
standard linear word embeddings such as word2vec, and thus result in important
gains. In this work, we wonder whether the opposite perspective is also true:
can contextual representations trained for different NLP tasks improve language
modeling itself? Since language models (LMs) are predominantly locally
optimized, other NLP tasks may help them make better predictions based on the
entire semantic fabric of a document. We test the performance of several types
of pre-trained embeddings in neural LMs, and we investigate whether it is
possible to make the LM more aware of global semantic information through
embeddings pre-trained with a domain classification model. Initial experiments
suggest that as long as the proper objective criterion is used during training,
pre-trained embeddings are likely to be beneficial for neural language
modeling.

of stiff/nonlinear fractional differential equations with fractional order
$\alpha \in (0,1]$ and prove their convergence and linear stability properties.
The developed methods are based on a linear multi-step fractional Adams-Moulton
method (FAMM), followed by the extrapolation of the nonlinear force terms. In
order to handle the singularities nearby the initial time, we employ
Lubich-like corrections to the resulting fractional operators. The obtained
linear stability regions of the developed IMEX methods are larger than existing
IMEX methods in the literature. Furthermore, the size of the stability regions
increase with the decrease of fractional order values, which is suitable for
stiff problems. We also rewrite the resulting IMEX methods in the language of
nonlinear Toeplitz systems, where we employ a fast inversion scheme to achieve
a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, where $N$ denotes the

potentials are nonstationary and define Hamiltonians which are not integrals of
motion for the system under study. We take the stationary oscillator of

invariant that serves to define uniquely the state of the system. In this sense
our approach completes the program of the BSS method since the eigenfunctions
of the invariant are an orthonormal basis for the space of solutions of the
related Schrodinger equation. The orthonormality holds when the involved
functions are evaluated at the same time. The dynamical algebra of the
nonstationary oscillators is generated by properly chosen ladder operators and
coincides with the Heisenberg algebra. We also construct the related coherent
states and show that they form an overcomplete set that minimizes the
quadratures defined by the ladder operators. These states are not invariant
under time-evolution since their time-dependence relies on the basis of states

excitations are massive for any finite coupling. The two phases are separated
by a transition line. Our numerical data are consistent with the simple
scenario in which the nature of the transition is independent of the gauge
coupling. Therefore, for any finite positive value of the gauge coupling, we
predict a continuous transition in the Heisenberg universality class for N=2

that the minimal conductivity is sensitive to the order in which the

interband scattering are found to be direction dependent. In the high frequency

are weighted by the anisotropy in such a way that the geometrical mean
$\sqrt{\sigma_{xx}\sigma_{yy}}$ of the conductivity is the same as in graphene.
This results from the fact that in the zero temperature limit, interband
transitions are not affected by the tilt in the dispersion, a result that is
physically interpreted as a global tilting of the allowed transitions. Such

found that while the majority of these models explode, not all do, and that
even models in the middle of the available progenitor mass range may be less
explodable. This does not mean that those models for which we did not witness
explosion would not explode in Nature, but that they are less prone to
explosion than others. One consequence is that the ""compactness"" measure is not
a metric for explodability. We find that lower-mass massive star progenitors
likely experience lower-energy explosions, while the higher-mass massive stars
likely experience higher-energy explosions. Moreover, most 3D explosions have a
dominant dipole morphology, have a pinched, wasp-waist structure, and
experience simultaneous accretion and explosion. We reproduce the general range
of residual neutron-star masses inferred for the galactic neutron-star
population. The most massive progenitor models, however, in particular vis \`a
vis explosion energy, need to be continued for longer physical times to
asymptote to their final states. We find that while the majority of the inner
ejecta have Y$_e = 0.5$, there is a substantial proton-rich tail. This result
has important implications for the nucleosynthetic yields as a function of
progenitor. Finally, we find that the non-exploding models eventually evolve
into compact inner configurations that experience a quasi-periodic spiral SASI

symmetric gravitational field of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om type, pseudoscalar
field, associated with an axionic dark matter, strong intrinsic magnetic field,
and axionically induced electric field. Based on the analysis of the solutions
to the master equations of the model, we show that the structure of the formed

magnetic field of the star has the dipole component, the axionic halo around
the magnetic star with spherically symmetric gravitational field is no longer
spheroidal, and the distortion is induced by the axion-photon coupling; second,
due to the distortion of the axionic halo the magnetic field is no longer pure
dipolar, and the induced quadruple, octupole, etc., components appear thus
redistributing the magnetic energy between the components with more steep
radial profiles than the dipolar one; third, the interaction of the axionic and

tunable by imaging conditions such as bias voltage, set current and

The effect in STM topographic images is well reproduced by transport modeling

scattered-light, the ring appears broader at optical than at millimeter
wavelengths. The best fit to the ring seen with ALMA has inner and outer edges
at $143.1 \pm 1.7$ AU and $165.5 \pm 1.4$, respectively, and an inclination of
$57.4^\circ \pm 0.4$ from face-on. The offset of the ring centre of symmetry
from the star allows us to quantify its eccentricity to be
$e=0.09_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$. This eccentric feature is also detected in low

the presence of a background object cannot be excluded, we cannot exclude

stage projects the 3D proposal bounding boxes to the image and BEV feature maps
and sends the corresponding map crops to a detection header for classification
and bounding-box regression. Unlike other multi-view based methods, the cropped
image features are not directly fed to the detection header, but masked by the
depth information to filter out parts outside 3D bounding boxes. The fusion of

the object detector can be trained on data labelled in different views to avoid

interpretable meaning representations, aka programs whose execution against a

parsers are trained on utterance-denotation pairs treating programs as latent.
The task is challenging due to the large search space and spuriousness of
programs which may execute to the correct answer but do not generalize to
unseen examples. Our goal is to instill an inductive bias in the parser to help
it distinguish between spurious and correct programs. We capitalize on the
intuition that correct programs would likely respect certain structural
constraints were they to be aligned to the question (e.g., program fragments
are unlikely to align to overlapping text spans) and propose to model
alignments as structured latent variables. In order to make the
latent-alignment framework tractable, we decompose the parsing task into (1)
predicting a partial ""abstract program"" and (2) refining it while modeling
structured alignments with differential dynamic programming. We obtain
state-of-the-art performance on the WIKITABLEQUESTIONS and WIKISQL datasets.
When compared to a standard attention baseline, we observe that the proposed

Convolutional neural networks(CNN) have shown tremendous success in solving

for an Einstein-matter system describing total gravitational collapse of a
zero-pressure perfect-fluid sphere, representing a massive star which has
exhausted its nuclear fuel. The star collapses to a point of infinite density
within a finite comoving proper time interval $[0,t_{*}]$, and the exterior
metric matches the Schwarzchild black hole metric. The description is
re-expressed in terms of a 'density function'
$u(t)=(\rho(t)/\rho_{o}))^{1/3}=R^{-1}(t)$ for initial density
$u_{0}=R^{-1}(0)=1$ and radius $R(0)$, whereby the general-relativistic
formulation reduces to an autonomous nonlinear ODE for $u(t)$. The solution
blows up or is singular at $t=t_{*}=\pi/2(8\pi G/3\rho_{o})^{1/2}$. The blowup
interval $[0,t_{*}]$ is partitioned into domains
$[0,t_{\epsilon}]\bigcup[t_{\epsilon},t_{*}]$,with
$t_{*}=t_{\epsilon}+|\epsilon|$ and $|\epsilon|\ll 1$, so that $t_{\epsilon}$
can be infinitesimally close to $t_{*}$. Randomness or 'stochastic control' is
introduced via the 'switching on' of specific (white-noise) perturbations at
$t=t_{\epsilon}$. Hybrid nonlinear ODES-SDES are then 'engineered' over the
partition. Within the Ito interpretation, the resulting density function
diffusion $\overline{u(t)}$ is proved to be a martingale whose supremum,
volatility and higher-order moments are finite, bounded and singularity free
for all finite $t>t_{\epsilon}$. The collapse is (comovingly) eternal but never
becomes singular. Extensive and rigorous boundedness and no-blowup criteria are
established via various methods, and blowup probability is always zero. The
density singularity is therefore smoothed or 'noise-suppressed'. Within the
Stratanovitch interpretation, the singularity formation probability is unity;
however, null recurrence ensures the expected comoving time for this to occur
is now infinite.

spin switching, the electron initial momentum direction must closely follow the
spin's orientation, so the orbital angular momentum is transverse to the spin
and consequently the spin-orbit torque lies in the same direction as the spin.
The module of the spin-orbit torque is $\lambda |{\bf S}||{\bf r}||{\bf P}|
\sqrt{\cos^2\alpha+\cos^2\beta-2\cos\alpha \cos\beta \cos\gamma} $, where
$\alpha(\beta)$ is the angle between spin {\bf S} and position {\bf r}(momentum
{ \bf P}) and $\gamma$ is the angle between {\bf r} and {\bf P}. These findings
are manifested in a much larger system. The spin response depends on underlying
spin structures. A linearly polarized laser pulse creates a dip in a uniform
inplane-magnetized thin film, but has little effects on \neel and Bloch walls.
Both right- and left- circularly polarized light ($\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$)
have stronger but different effects in both uniform spin domains and Neel
walls. While $\sigma^+$ light creates a basin of spins pointing down,
$\sigma^-$ light creates a mound of spins pointing up. In the vicinity of the
structure spins are reversed, similar to the experimental observation.
$\sigma^+$ light has a dramatic effect, disrupting spins in Bloch walls. By
contrast, $\sigma^-$ light has a small effect on Bloch walls because $\sigma^-$
only switches down spins up and once the spins already point up, there is no
major effect.

many imaging, metrology and characterization platforms in science and
engineering. Because most of the indirect measurement processes are
well-described by physical models, signal retrieval can be solved with an
iterative optimization that enforces measurement consistency and prior
knowledge on the signal. These iterative processes are time-consuming and only
accommodate a linear measurement process and convex signal constraints.
Recently, neural networks have been widely adopted to supersede iterative
signal retrieval methods by approximating the inverse mapping of the
measurement model. However, networks with deterministic processes have failed
to distinguish signal ambiguities in an ill-posed measurement system, and
retrieved signals often lack consistency with the measurement. In this work we
introduce a variational generative model to capture the distribution of all
possible signals, given a particular measurement. By exploiting the known
measurement model in the variational generative framework, our signal retrieval
process resolves the ambiguity in the forward process, and learns to retrieve
signals that satisfy the measurement with high fidelity in a variety of linear
and nonlinear ill-posed systems, including ultrafast pulse retrieval, coded
aperture compressive video sensing and image retrieval from Fresnel hologram.

Variants of the distance metric are introduced to consider such optimized maps

we analyze a series of high-resolution simulations to examine the energetics
and turbulence of the medium under SNe Ia. We find that when SN remnants are
resolved, their effects differ distinctly from a volumetric heating term, as is
commonly assumed in unresolved simulations. First, the net heating is
significantly higher than expected, by 30$\pm$10\% per cooling time. This is
because a large fraction of the medium is pushed into lower densities which
cool inefficiently. Second, the medium is turbulent; the root-mean-squared
(RMS) velocity of the gas to 20-50 km s$^{-1}$ on a driving scale of tens of
parsec. The velocity field of the medium is dominated by compressional modes,
which are larger than the solenoidal components by a factor of 3-7. Third, the
hot gas has a very broad density distribution. The ratio between the density
fluctuations and the RMS Mach number, parameterized as $b$, is 2-20. This is in
contrast to previous simulations of turbulent media, which have found
$b\lesssim$ 1. The reason for the difference is mainly caused by the
\textit{localized} heating of SNe Ia, which creates a large density contrast.
Last, the typical length scale of a density fluctuation grows with time,
forming increasingly larger bubbles and filamentary ridges. These underlying
density fluctuations need to be included when X-ray observations are
interpreted.

only two, separated by already well known $T_c\sim 155\, MeV$. Above it
electric interactions are screened rather then confined. Magnetic ones remain
confined all the way to $T\rightarrow \infty$. Spectrum of ""mesonic screening
masses"" is there, but they do not represent real masses. At high $T$ they
correspond to ""heavy quarkonia"" of 2+1 d gauge theory, which is well known to
be a confining theory. There is no reason to expect any transition unbinding
them, at $T\sim 1\, GeV$ as claimed. I make calculation of correction to

attracted significant interest through potential applications in topologically

the momentum space topology of the band structure, are robust. Here we
demonstrate that in topological superconductors the surface Andreev bound

confine superfluid $^3$He within a cavity of height comparable to the Cooper

to unexpectedly large suppression of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, corresponding to an
increased density of low energy bound states.

different length scales, are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. In many
cases, one structural level may be ordered while another structural level may
be disordered. Here, we investigate the impact of structural disorder on the
mechanical properties of hierarchical filamentous structures. Through
simulations of networks with two hierarchical levels, we show that disorder
does not change how stiffness scales with the mean coordination number - the
average number of bonds per node - on large and small length scales. However,
we find that network rigidity and stiffness depend strongly on the presence or
absence of disorder on the small length scale, but not on the large length
scale. In fact, the amount of material necessary for a fully connected, network
ordered on the small scale is insufficient to create even a marginally rigid
network with small-scale disorder. We trace these phenomena back to a
difference in the maximum mean coordination number on the small scale. While
single length scale ordered and disordered networks have similar mean
coordination numbers in the interior and on surfaces, we find that disorder
strongly impacts the structure of surfaces, resulting in a larger fraction of
surface nodes on the small scale. While this effect increases in strength as
large scale bonds become narrower, it persists even for bonds that are wider
than they are long (i.e., aspect ratios < 1).

carrier agile phased array radar (CAESAR), which combines frequency and spatial
agility. The proposed DFRC system, referred to as multi-carrier agile joint

propose Signal Instructed Coordination (SIC), a novel coordination module that
can be integrated with most existing MARL frameworks. SIC casts a common signal
sampled from a pre-defined distribution to all agents, and introduces an

effective field theory point of view, but one has to take into account the
so-called trace anomaly to explicitly demonstrate the decoupling. As a result,
for example, in the $R^{2}$ inflation model, scalaron decay is insensitive to
heavy degrees of freedom when a matter sector ${\it minimally}$ couples to
gravity (up to a non-minimal coupling of a matter scalar field other than the
scalaron). The other property is a quantum contribution to a non-minimal
coupling of a scalar field. The non-minimal coupling disappears from the action
in the flat spacetime, but leaves the so-called improvement term in $T^{\mu}_{~
\mu}$. We study the renormalization group equation of the non-minimal coupling
to discuss its quantum-induced value and implications for inflation dynamics.
We work it out in the two-scalar theory and Yukawa theory.

approach. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected approximately 180
open-ended responses to several question stems from the Cybersecurity Concept
Inventory of the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools Project and from the Digital
Logic Concept Inventory. We generated preliminary distractors by filtering
responses, grouping similar responses, selecting the four most frequent groups,
and refining a representative distractor for each of these groups. We analyzed
our data in two ways. First, we compared the responses and resulting
distractors with those from the aforementioned inventories. Second, we obtained
feedback from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the resulting new draft test items

crowdsourcing include controlling the selection of subjects and filtering out
responses that do not reflect genuine effort. Despite these challenges, our
results suggest that crowdsourcing can be a very useful tool in generating
effective distractors (attractive to subjects who do not understand the

capturing the network structures and properties. Although quite a few promising
network embedding methods have been proposed, most of them focus on static
networks. In fact, temporal networks, which usually evolve over time in terms
of microscopic and macroscopic dynamics, are ubiquitous. The micro-dynamics
describe the formation process of network structures in a detailed manner,
while the macro-dynamics refer to the evolution pattern of the network scale.
Both micro- and macro-dynamics are the key factors to network evolution;
however, how to elegantly capture both of them for temporal network embedding,
especially macro-dynamics, has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel temporal network embedding method with micro- and
macro-dynamics, named $\rm{M^2DNE}$. Specifically, for micro-dynamics, we
regard the establishments of edges as the occurrences of chronological events
and propose a temporal attention point process to capture the formation process
of network structures in a fine-grained manner. For macro-dynamics, we define a
general dynamics equation parameterized with network embeddings to capture the
inherent evolution pattern and impose constraints in a higher structural level
on network embeddings. Mutual evolutions of micro- and macro-dynamics in a
temporal network alternately affect the process of learning node embeddings.
Extensive experiments on three real-world temporal networks demonstrate that
$\rm{M^2DNE}$ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts not only in
traditional tasks, e.g., network reconstruction, but also in temporal
tendency-related tasks, e.g., scale prediction.

the current one is based on the average of all past observed curvatures. More
specifically, AC-ACG uses a positive multiple of the average of all observed
curvatures until the previous iteration as a way to estimate the ""function

the next iterate. In contrast to other variable Lipschitz estimation variants,

well in different environments with only CPU computation. Using a sparse SLAM

images and depth images into a globally consistent model. The system is
carefully designed so that it can build from room-scale environments to
urban-scale environments using depth images from RGB-D cameras, stereo cameras
or even a monocular camera. First, superpixels extracted from both intensity
and depth images are used to model surfels in the system. superpixel-based
surfels make our method both run-time efficient and memory efficient. Second,
surfels are further organized according to the pose graph of the SLAM system to
achieve $O(1)$ fusion time regardless of the scale of reconstructed models.
Third, a fast map deformation using the optimized pose graph enables the map to
achieve global consistency in real-time. The proposed surfel mapping system is
compared with other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets. The
performances of urban-scale and room-scale reconstruction are demonstrated
using the KITTI dataset and autonomous aggressive flights, respectively. The

The graph convolution layer im-proves the expressive power of the daily

applying bias voltages. But these bias-induced spin state transitions (BISSTs)
are not fully understood, especially the mechanism. It is well known that the
metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitation (MLCT) and the metal-centered
excitation (MC) activated by light radiation can induce the transition from low
spin (LS) to high spin (HS) and that from HS to LS. Moreover, electronic
excitations are accessible by inelastic cotunneling in molecular junctions with
bias voltages applied. Based on these two experimental facts, we propose the
MLCT basically leads to the BISST from LS to HS, and the MC results in the
BISST from HS to LS. The rationality of the mechanism is demonstrated by
comparing first-principles results and experimental observations. The
calculated voltage threshold for activating the MLCT (MC) is close to the
experimental voltage for observing the BISST from LS to HS (from HS to LS). The
activation of MLCT (MC) depends on the bias polarity, which can explain the
bias-polarity dependence of BISST in the experiment. Our study is important for
further design of molecular spintronic devices working on spin state

effective way to expedite reinforcement learning (RL). For example,
propositional logic and first-order logic have been used as representations of
such knowledge. We study the transfer of knowledge between tasks in which the
timing of the events matters. We call such tasks temporal tasks. We concretize
similarity between temporal tasks through a notion of logical transferability,
and develop a transfer learning approach between different yet similar temporal
tasks. We first propose an inference technique to extract metric interval
temporal logic (MITL) formulas in sequential disjunctive normal form from
labeled trajectories collected in RL of the two tasks. If logical
transferability is identified through this inference, we construct a timed
automaton for each sequential conjunctive subformula of the inferred MITL
formulas from both tasks. We perform RL on the extended state which includes
the locations and clock valuations of the timed automata for the source task.
We then establish mappings between the corresponding components (clocks,
locations, etc.) of the timed automata from the two tasks, and transfer the
extended Q-functions based on the established mappings. Finally, we perform RL
on the extended state for the target task, starting with the transferred
extended Q-functions. Our results in two case studies show, depending on how

vortices are modulated by viscoelasticity at different Weissenberg numbers. The
viscoelasticity was found to induce an unsteady flow state where the 2D
roll-cell structure was periodically enhanced and damped with a constant
period, keeping the homogeneity in the streamwise direction. This pulsatile
motion of the roll cell was caused by a time lag in the response of the
viscoelastic force to the vortex development. Both the pulsation period and
time lag were found to be scaled by the turnover time of cell rotation rather
than by the relaxation time, despite the viscoelasticity-induced instability.

have been proposed, there are limited results on the post-compensation system
performance. Consequently, in this paper, a generalized reference-signal (RS)
aided low-complexity phase-noise compensation technique is proposed for
high-frequency, multi-carrier systems. The technique generalizes several
existing solutions and involves an RS that is transmitted in each symbol,
occupies adjacent sub-carriers, and is separated from the data by null
sub-carriers. A detailed theoretical analysis of the post-phase-noise
compensation performance is presented for an analog beamforming receiver under
an arbitrary phase-noise model. Using this analysis, the performance-impact of
several system parameters is examined and the throughput-optimal designs for
the RS sequence, RS bandwidth, power allocation, number of null sub-carriers,
and the number of estimated phase-noise spectral components are also derived.
Simulations performed under 3GPP compliant settings suggest that the proposed
scheme is robust to phase-noise modeling errors and can, with the optimized
parameters, achieve better performance than several existing solutions.

paper, we instead focus on generalizing the input distribution, restricting
attention to matroid constraints in both the offline and online random arrival
models. In particular, we study contention resolution when the input set is
arbitrarily distributed, and may exhibit positive and/or negative correlations
between elements. We characterize the distributions for which offline
contention resolution is possible, and establish some of their basic closure
properties. Our characterization can be interpreted as a distributional
generalization of the matroid covering theorem. For the online random arrival
model, we show that contention resolution is intimately tied to the secretary
problem via two results. First, we show that a competitive algorithm for the
matroid secretary problem implies that online contention resolution is
essentially as powerful as offline contention resolution for matroids, so long
as the algorithm is given the input distribution. Second, we reduce the matroid
secretary problem to the design of an online contention resolution scheme of a
particular form.

objects cluster into piles of clutter. In household environments, for example,
it is common to encounter piles of glassware in kitchens, dining rooms, and
reception areas, which are essentially invisible to modern robots. We present
the GlassLoc algorithm for grasp pose detection of transparent objects in
transparent clutter using plenoptic sensing. GlassLoc classifies graspable
locations in space informed by a Depth Likelihood Volume (DLV) descriptor. We
extend the DLV to infer the occupancy of transparent objects over a given space
from multiple plenoptic viewpoints. We demonstrate and evaluate the GlassLoc
algorithm on a Michigan Progress Fetch mounted with a first-generation Lytro.
The effectiveness of our algorithm is evaluated through experiments for grasp

with their relations using a single model. Prior work typically solves this
task in the extract-then-classify or unified labeling manner. However, these
methods either suffer from the redundant entity pairs, or ignore the important
inner structure in the process of extracting entities and relations. To address
these limitations, in this paper, we first decompose the joint extraction task
into two interrelated subtasks, namely HE extraction and TER extraction. The
former subtask is to distinguish all head-entities that may be involved with
target relations, and the latter is to identify corresponding tail-entities and
relations for each extracted head-entity. Next, these two subtasks are further
deconstructed into several sequence labeling problems based on our proposed
span-based tagging scheme, which are conveniently solved by a hierarchical
boundary tagger and a multi-span decoding algorithm. Owing to the reasonable
decomposition strategy, our model can fully capture the semantic
interdependency between different steps, as well as reduce noise from
irrelevant entity pairs. Experimental results show that our method outperforms

information from past actions (e.g. item/product clicks) in a session to
recommend items that a user is likely to click next. Recently it has been shown
that the sequence of item interactions in a session can be modeled as
graph-structured data to better account for complex item transitions. Graph
neural networks (GNNs) can learn useful representations for such
session-graphs, and have been shown to improve over sequential models such as
recurrent neural networks [14]. However, we note that these GNN-based
recommendation models suffer from popularity bias: the models are biased
towards recommending popular items, and fail to recommend relevant long-tail
items (less popular or less frequent items). Therefore, these models perform
poorly for the less popular new items arriving daily in a practical online
setting. We demonstrate that this issue is, in part, related to the magnitude
or norm of the learned item and session-graph representations (embedding
vectors). We propose a training procedure that mitigates this issue by using
normalized representations. The models using normalized item and session-graph
representations perform significantly better: i. for the less popular long-tail
items in the offline setting, and ii. for the less popular newly introduced
items in the online setting. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves

insulator becomes metallic by removal of a tiny fraction of its oxygen atoms.
Here, we present a detailed study of low-temperature charge transport in
Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_{3-\delta}$, documenting the evolution of resistivity with
increasing carrier concentration ($n$). Below a threshold carrier
concentration, $n^*(x)$, the polar structural phase transition has a clear
signature in resistivity and Ca substitution significantly reduces the 2 K
mobility at a given carrier density. For three different Ca concentrations, we
find that the phase transition fades away when one mobile electron is
introduced for about $7.9\pm0.6$ dipoles. This threshold corresponds to the
expected peak in anti-ferroelectric coupling mediated by a diplolar counterpart
of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. Our results imply that the
transition is driven by dipole-dipole interaction, even in presence of a dilute
Fermi sea. Charge transport for $n < n^*(x)$ shows a non-monotonic temperature
dependence, most probably caused by scattering off the transverse optical
phonon mode. A quantitative explanation of charge transport in this polar metal
remains a challenge to theory. For $n\geq n^*(x)$, resistivity follows a
T-square behavior together with slight upturns (in both Ca-free and
Ca-substituted samples). The latter are reminiscent of Kondo effect and most
probably due to oxygen vacancies.

robustness of a machine learning model. In this paper, we consider hard-label
black-box attacks (a.k.a. decision-based attacks), which is a challenging
setting that generates adversarial examples based on only a series of black-box
hard-label queries. This type of attacks can be used to attack discrete and
complex models, such as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and
detection-based defense models. Existing decision-based attacks based on
iterative local updates often get stuck in a local minimum and fail to generate
the optimal adversarial example with the smallest distortion. To remedy this
issue, we propose an efficient meta algorithm called BOSH-attack, which
tremendously improves existing algorithms through Bayesian Optimization (BO)
and Successive Halving (SH). In particular, instead of traversing a single
solution path when searching an adversarial example, we maintain a pool of
solution paths to explore important regions. We show empirically that the
proposed algorithm converges to a better solution than existing approaches,
while the query count is smaller than applying multiple random initializations
by a factor of 10.

quantum phase across a topological transition and to disentangle the role of
the spin and field topological windings. As for implementations, we discuss a

Short-Term Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition based,
unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal
patterns. The current state of the art in this space are typically univariate
methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated
independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns
and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast,
LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), where a
single prediction model is built across all the available time series to
exploit the cross series knowledge in a group of related time series.
Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art
multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning
procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on datasets from
disparate data sources, like e.g. the popular M4 forecasting competition, a
decomposition step is beneficial, whereas in the common real-world situation of
homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or
no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily
included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both

metallicity studies despite the known strong degeneracy with the ionization

in a regime where [NII] and [SII] are at the detection limit and the
measurement uncertainty associated with the [NII]/[SII] ratio is high (S/N~3),
the more sophisticated Dopita et al. diagnostic provides an improved constraint
compared to N2 by reducing the systematic uncertainty due to the ionization

stochastic or systematic variations in the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio.
While this approach improves upon N2, future progress in extending metallicity
studies into this low-mass regime will require larger samples to allow for
stochastic variations, as well as careful consideration of the global trends
among dwarf galaxies in all physical parameters, not just metallicity.

multistep Lyapunov function that looks ahead to several future updates to

that, in a whispering gallery resonator-waveguide coupled system, in the

the fabrication of epitaxial Mn$_4$N films with various nitrogen contents and
first-principles density-functional calculations. Saturation magnetization
($M_{\rm s}$) peaks of 110 mT and uniaxial PMA energy densities ($K_{\rm u}$)
of 0.1 MJ/m$^3$ were obtained for a N$_2$ gas flow ratio ($Q$) of $\sim 10 \%$
during sputtering deposition, suggesting nearly single-phase crystalline
$\epsilon$-Mn$_4$N. Segregation of $\alpha$-Mn and nitrogen-deficient Mn$_4$N
grains was observed for $Q \approx 6\%$, which was responsible for a decrease
in the $M_{\rm s}$ and $K_{\rm u}$. The first-principles calculations revealed
that the magnetic structure of Mn$_4$N showing PMA was ""type-B"" having a
collinear structure, whose magnetic moments couple parallel within the c-plane
and alternating along the c-direction. In addition, the $K_{\rm u}$ calculated
using Mn$_{32}$N$_x$ supercells showed a strong dependence on nitrogen
deficiency, in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. The
second-order perturbation analysis of $K_{\rm u}$ with respect to the
spin-orbit interaction revealed that not only spin-conserving but also
spin-flip processes contribute significantly to the PMA in Mn$_4$N. We also
found that both contributions decreased with increasing nitrogen deficiency,
resulting in the reduction of $K_{\rm u}$. It was noted that the decrease in
the spin-flip contribution occurred at the Mn atoms in face-centered sites.
This is one of the specific PMA characteristics we found for
antiperovskite-type Mn$_4$N.

these shortcomings of the existing approaches, we hypothesize that the
adversarial inputs are tied to latent features that are susceptible to
adversarial perturbation, which we call vulnerable features. Then based on this

autoencoders with two latent spaces. We thoroughly validate our model for both
blackbox and whitebox attacks on MNIST, Fashion MNIST5, and Cat & Dog datasets,

$\Phi$ in the model. The model is differentiated by others in that it explains
the hierarchy in quark-Higgs Yukawa coupling in the SM based on a series of

$<\!\!\Phi\!\!>\,\lesssim\,10^{13}-10^{14}{\rm GeV}$ (vacuum expectation value

image representation. A scene has different types (i.e., OR) each of which
consists of a number of objects (i.e., AND). This can be recursively formulated
across the scene-objects-parts-subparts hierarchy and is terminated at the
primitive level (e.g., wavelets-like basis). To realize this AND-OR hierarchy
in image synthesis, we learn a generator network that consists of the following
two components: (i) Each layer of the hierarchy is represented by an
over-complete set of convolutional basis functions. Off-the-shelf convolutional
neural architectures are exploited to implement the hierarchy. (ii)
Sparsity-inducing constraints are introduced in end-to-end training, which
induces a sparsely activated and sparsely connected AND-OR model from the
initially densely connected generator network. A straightforward
sparsity-inducing constraint is utilized, that is to only allow the top-$k$
basis functions to be activated at each layer (where $k$ is a hyper-parameter).
The learned basis functions are also capable of image reconstruction to explain
the input images. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on four
benchmark datasets. The results show that meaningful and interpretable
hierarchical representations are learned with better qualities of image
synthesis and reconstruction obtained than baselines.

perform extremely well on well-known benchmark datasets, and the second is to
test whether or not the mean reversion strategies work well on recent market

aggressive mean reversion (PAMR) strategy, the on-line moving average reversion
(OLMAR) strategy, and the transaction cost optimization (TCO) strategies. To
test the strategies, we use the historical prices of the stocks that constitute

favor mean reversion strategies, and mean reversion strategies may fail even in

as a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) [23]. However, due to the
inherent local connectivity of CNN, the CNN-based relation network (RN) can be
sensitive to the spatial position relationship of semantic objects in two

periodically quenched and kicked spin systems in recent years. In this paper,
we study the emergence of DTCs from the many-body quantum chaos perspective,
using a rather simple model depicting a harmonically driven spin chain. We
advocate to first employ a semiclassical approximation to arrive at a
mean-field Hamiltonian and then identify the parameter regime at which DTCs
exist, with standard tools borrowed from studies of classical chaos.
Specifically, we seek symmetric-breaking solutions by examining the stable
islands on the Poincare surface of section of the mean-field Hamiltonian. We
then turn to the actual many-body quantum system, evaluate the stroboscopic
dynamics of the total magnetization in the full quantum limit, and verify the
existence of DTCs. Our effective and straightforward approach indicates that in
general DTCs are one natural aspect of many-body quantum chaos with mixed
classical phase space structure. Our approach can also be applied to general
time-periodic systems, which is thus promising for finding DTCs with $n>2$ and
opening possibilities for exploring DTCs properties beyond their
time-translational breaking features.

analytic model to calculate the galactic potential, in which the possible
locations of the source by the observed angle offset and the second supernova
(SN2) kick are accounted for. We show that the upper limit of $\Delta \gamma$

These limits are more stringent by one to two orders of magnitude than those
determined solely by the measured MW potential in the literature. We
demonstrate that the WEP test is strengthened by contribution from the host
galaxy to the Shapiro time delay. Meanwhile, we also find that large natal
kicks produce a maximum deviation of about $20\%$ to the results with a typical
kick velocity 400$\sim$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. Finally, we analyze the impact from
the halo mass of NGC 4993 with a typical 0.2 dex uncertainty, and find that the

Sequence evolutionary stage of massive stars is not well understood. Westerlund
1 is an ideal astrophysical laboratory in which to study massive stars and
their winds in great detail over a large range of different evolutionary
phases. Aims: We aim to study the radio emission from Westerlund 1, in order to
measure radio fluxes from the population of massive stars, and determine
mass-loss rates and spectral indices where possible. Methods: Observations were
carried out in 2015 and 2016 with the Australia telescope compact array (ATCA)
at 5.5 and 9 GHz using multiple configurations, with maximum baselines ranging
from 750m to 6km. Results: 30 stars were detected in the radio from the fully
concatenated dataset, 10 of which were WRs (predominantly late type WN stars),
5 YHGs, 4 RSGs, 1 LBV star, the sgB[e] star W9, and several O and B
supergiants. New source detections in the radio were found for 5 WR stars, and
5 OB supergiants. These detections have led to evidence for 3 new OB supergiant
binary candidates, inferred from derived spectral index limits. Conclusions:
Spectral indices and index limits were determined for massive stars in
Westerlund 1. For cluster members found to have partially optically thick
emission, mass-loss rates were calculated. Under the approximation of a
thermally emitting stellar wind and a steady mass-loss rate, clumping ratios
were then estimated for 8 WRs. Diffuse radio emission was detected throughout
the cluster. Detections of knots of radio emission with no known stellar
counterparts indicate the highly clumped structure of this intra-cluster
medium, likely shaped by a dense cluster wind.

purpose of modeling the low-temperature environment prevailing in starless and

treatment of ion-molecule proton-donation reactions of the form $\rm XH^+ + Y
\longrightarrow X + YH^+$, which are allowed to proceed either via full
scrambling or via direct proton hop, i.e., disregarding proton exchange. The
choice of the reaction mechanism affects both deuterium and spin-state
chemistry, and in this work our main interest is on the effect on deuterated
ammonia. We applied the new models to the starless core H-MM1, where several
deuterated forms of ammonia have been observed. Our investigation slightly
favors the proton hop mechanism over full scrambling because the ammonia D/H
ratios are better fit by the former model, although neither model can reproduce
the observed $\rm NH_2D$ ortho-to-para ratio of 3 (the models predict a value
of $\sim$2). Extending the proton hop scenario to hydrogen atom abstraction
reactions yields a good agreement for the spin-state abundance ratios, but
greatly overestimates the deuterium fractions of ammonia. However, one can find
a reasonably good agreement with the observations with this model by increasing
the cosmic-ray ionization rate over the commonly-adopted value of
$\sim$$10^{-17}\,\rm s^{-1}$. We also find that the deuterium fractions of
several other species, such as $\rm H_2CO$, $\rm H_2O$, and $\rm CH_3$, are
sensitive to the adopted proton-donation reaction mechanism. Whether the full
scrambling or proton hop mechanism dominates may be dependent on the reacting
system, and new laboratory and theoretical studies for various reacting systems
are needed to constrain chemical models.

able to handle the problem of class bias by synthesizing unseen class samples.
However, these ZSL/GZSL models suffer due to the following key limitations:
$(i)$ Their training stage learns a class-conditioned generator using only
\emph{seen} class data and the training stage does not \emph{explicitly} learn
to generate the unseen class samples; $(ii)$ They do not learn a generic
optimal parameter which can easily generalize for both seen and unseen class
generation; and $(iii)$ If we only have access to a very few samples per seen
class, these models tend to perform poorly. In this paper, we propose a
meta-learning based generative model that naturally handles these limitations.
The proposed model is based on integrating model-agnostic meta learning with a
Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to handle $(i)$ and $(iii)$, and uses a novel task
distribution to handle $(ii)$. Our proposed model yields significant
improvements on standard ZSL as well as more challenging GZSL setting. In ZSL
setting, our model yields 4.5\%, 6.0\%, 9.8\%, and 27.9\% relative improvements
over the current state-of-the-art on CUB, AWA1, AWA2, and aPY datasets,
respectively.

at lower energies is responsible for the VHE emission via Inverse Compton (IC)

through a relativistic wind consisting of electrons, positrons and possibly
Poynting flux\cite{Pacini1973,Rees1974,Kennel1984}. As it expands, this wind
may eventually be terminated by a shock, where particles can be accelerated to
energies of X-ray synchrotron emission, and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is
usually detectable surrounding a young energetic
pulsar\cite{Pacini1973,Rees1974,Kennel1984}. However, the nature and/or
energetics of these physical processes remain very uncertain, largely because
they typically cannot be studied in a time-resolved fashion. Here we show that
the X-ray PWN around the young pulsar PSR B0540--69 brightens gradually up to
32$\pm8\%$ over the mean previous flux, after a sudden spin-down rate
($\dot{\nu}$) transition (SRT) by $\sim36\%$\ in December 2011, which has very
different properties from a traditional pulsar glitch\cite{Marshall2015}. No
evidence is seen for any change in the pulsed X-ray emission. We conclude that
the SRT results from a sudden change in the pulsar magnetosphere that increases
the pulsar wind power and hence the PWN X-ray emission. The X-ray light curve
of the PWN suggests a mean life time of the particles of $397\pm374$\,days,
corresponding to a magnetic field strength of $0.78_{-0.28}^{+4.50}$\,mG in the
PWN.

interests in Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR). Although recent methods have
attempted to fill the gap with deep generative networks, most of them suffer
from the inevitable misalignment between different face modalities. Instead of
imaging sensors, the misalignment primarily results from facial geometric
variations that are independent of the spectrum. Rather than building a
monolithic but complex structure, this paper proposes a Pose Aligned
Cross-spectral Hallucination (PACH) approach to disentangle the independent
factors and deal with them in individual stages. In the first stage, an
Unsupervised Face Alignment (UFA) module is designed to align the facial shapes
of the near-infrared (NIR) images with those of the visible (VIS) images in a
generative way, where UV maps are effectively utilized as the shape guidance.
Thus the task of the second stage becomes spectrum translation with aligned
paired data. We develop a Texture Prior Synthesis (TPS) module to achieve
complexion control and consequently generate more realistic VIS images than
existing methods. Experiments on three challenging NIR-VIS datasets verify the
effectiveness of our approach in producing visually appealing images and
achieving state-of-the-art performance in HFR.

questions with multiple relevant topics which helps to attract quality answers.
These topics are not predefined but user-defined conventions and it is not so
rare to have multiple such conventions present in the Quora ecosystem
describing exactly the same concept. In almost all such cases, users (or Quora
moderators) manually merge the topic pair into one of the either topics, thus
selecting one of the competing conventions. An important application for the
site therefore is to identify such competing conventions early enough that
should merge in future. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach that
uniquely combines the anomaly detection and the supervised classification
frameworks to predict whether two topics from among millions of topic pairs are
indeed competing conventions, and should merge, achieving an F-score of 0.711.
We also develop a model to predict the direction of the topic merge, i.e., the
winning convention, achieving an F-score of 0.898. Our system is also able to
predict ~ 25% of the correct case of merges within the first month of the merge
and ~ 40% of the cases within a year. This is an encouraging result since Quora
users on average take 936 days to identify such a correct merge. Human judgment
experiments show that our system is able to predict almost all the correct
cases that humans can predict plus 37.24% correct cases which the humans are
not able to identify at all.

of the phenomenological implications of a simplified model, where $S$ is
treated a SM Higgs boson, is the anomalous production of high transverse
momentum leptons. A combined study of Run 1 and Run 2 data is indicative of
very significant discrepancies between the data and SM Monte Carlos in a
variety of final states involving multiple leptons with and without $b$-quarks.
These discrepancies appear in corners of the phase-space where different SM
processes dominate, indicating that the potential mismodeling of a particular
SM process is unlikely to explain them. Systematic uncertainties from the
prediction of SM processes evaluated with currently available tools seem unable
to explain away these discrepancies. The internal consistency of these

(WCET) analysis. It has been extensively studied in the past twenty years.
Despite these efforts, all existing persistence analyses are approximative in
the sense that they are not guaranteed to find all persistent memory blocks.
  In this paper, we close this gap by introducing the first exact persistence
analysis for caches with least-recently-used (LRU) replacement. To this end, we
first introduce an exact abstraction that exploits monotonicity properties of
LRU to significantly reduce the information the analysis needs to maintain for
exact persistence classifications. We show how to efficiently implement this
abstraction using zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs) and introduce
novel techniques to deal with uncertainty that arises during the analysis of
data caches.
  The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new exact analysis is
competitive with state-of-the-art inexact analyses in terms of both memory
consumption and analysis run time, which is somewhat surprising as we show that
persistence analysis is NP-complete. We also observe that while prior analyses
are not exact in theory they come close to being exact in practice.

coarsely adjusts locations and sizes of anchors from high level detection

We studied the evolution of Sr and Ba in the Milky Way. A chemical evolution
model was employed to reproduce the Galactic enrichment. We tested two
different nucleosynthesis prescriptions for s-process in massive stars, adopted
from the Geneva group and the Rome group. Rotation was taken into account,
studying the effects of stars without rotation or rotating with different
velocities. We also tested different production sites for the r-process:
magneto rotational driven supernovae and neutron star mergers. The evolution of
the abundances of Sr and Ba is well reproduced. The comparison with the most
recent observations shows that stellar rotation is a good assumption, but
excessive velocities result in overproduction of these elements. In particular,
the predicted evolution of the [Sr/Ba] ratio at low metallicity does not
explain the data at best if rotation is not included. Adopting different
rotational velocities for different stellar mass and metallicity better
explains the observed trends. Despite the differences between the two sets of
adopted stellar models, both show a better agreement with the data assuming an
increase of rotational velocity toward low metallicity. Assuming different
r-process sources does not alter this conclusion.

reduce the number of independent form factors in the heavy-to-light $B$-meson
decays. It is expected that these symmetry relations are not exact and are
broken by the perturbative effects, namely, the vertex corrections and the
hard-spectator scatterings. The former are included in the form factors via
vertex renormalization whereas the later are calculated through light-cone
distribution amplitudes. We first calculate these symmetry breaking corrections
to the form factors involved in semileptonic $B$-meson to an axial-vector
$(K_{1})$-meson decay. Later, by using these form factors we see their effect
on the physical observables such as the zero-position of the forward-backward
$(\mathcal{A}_{FB})$ asymmetry and the longitudinal lepton polarization ($P_L$)
asymmetry in $B\rightarrow K_1(1270) \mu^+\mu^-$ decay. We find that as a
result of these corrections to the form factors, the zero-position of the
forward-backward asymmetry is shifted by $10\%$ from its SM value while the
effects on $P_L$ are rather insignificant.

computer vision tasks, several works show their vulnerability to adversarial
samples, i.e., image samples with imperceptible noise engineered to manipulate
the network's prediction. Adversarial sample generation methods range from
simple to complex optimization techniques. Majority of these methods generate
adversaries through optimization objectives that are tied to the pre-softmax or
softmax output of the network. In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such
attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and
New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an
attack, and (iii) propose a new adversarial attack FDA: Feature Disruptive
Attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating
image perturbation that disrupt features at each layer of the network and
causes deep-features to be highly corrupt. This allows FDA adversaries to
severely reduce the performance of deep networks. We experimentally validate
that FDA generates stronger adversaries than other state-of-the-art methods for
image classification, even in the presence of various defense measures. More
importantly, we show that FDA disrupts feature-representation based tasks even

image reconstruction subnet, a detail restoration (DR) subnet and a local
contrast enhancement (LCE) subnet. We delicately design these subnets so that
they are appropriately trained for the intended purpose, learning a pair of
pixel-wise 1D separable filters via the DR subnet for detail restoration and a
pixel-wise 2D local filter by the LCE subnet for contrast enhancement.
Moreover, to train the JSI-GAN effectively, we propose a novel detail GAN loss
alongside the conventional GAN loss, which helps enhancing both local details
and contrasts to reconstruct high quality HR HDR results. When all subnets are
jointly trained well, the predicted HR HDR results of higher quality are
obtained with at least 0.41 dB gain in PSNR over those generated by the
previous methods.

planets on very wide orbits in protoplanetary discs that are only a few million
years old. These planets are too young and distant to have been formed via the
Core Accretion (CA) scenario, and are much less massive than the gas clumps
born in the classical Gravitational Instability (GI) theory. It was recently
suggested that such planets may form by the partial destruction of GI
protoplanets: energy output due to the growth of a massive core may unbind all
or most of the surrounding pre-collapse protoplanet. Here we present the first
3D global disc simulations that simultaneously resolve grain dynamics in the
disc and within the protoplanet. We confirm that massive GI protoplanets may
self-destruct at arbitrarily large separations from the host star provided that
solid cores of mass around 10-20 Earth masses are able to grow inside them
during their pre-collapse phase. In addition, we find that the heating force
recently analysed by Masset and Velasco Romero (2017) perturbs these cores away
from the centre of their gaseous protoplanets. This leads to very complicated
dust dynamics in the protoplanet centre, potentially resulting in the formation
of multiple cores, planetary satellites, and other debris such as planetesimals
within the same protoplanet. A unique prediction of this planet formation
scenario is the presence of sub-Jovian planets at wide orbits in Class 0/I
protoplanetary discs.

approximation ratio of $1 + \epsilon$, for every $\epsilon > 0$ [9] (and even a
polynomial time approximation algorithm with a ratio $n^{1 - \epsilon}$ has

known approximation ratio for MCP of a polynomial time algorithm is
$O(n(log_2(log_2(n)))^2 / (log_2(n))^3)$ given by Feige [1]. In this paper, we
show that MCP can be approximated with a constant factor in polynomial time
through approximation ratio preserving reductions from MCP to MAX DNF and from
MAX DNF to MIN SAT. A 2-approximation algorithm for MIN SAT was presented in
[6]. An approximation ratio preserving reduction from MIN SAT to min vertex

which neural responses to expected and unexpected words are compared in a

in language understanding. A few recent studies have begun to address these
worries by using model-based approaches to probe the effects of linguistic
predictability in naturalistic stimuli (e.g. continuous narrative). However,
these studies so far only looked at very local forms of prediction, using
models that take no more than the prior two words into account when computing a
word's predictability. Here, we extend this approach using a state-of-the-art
neural language model that can take roughly 500 times longer linguistic
contexts into account. Predictability estimates from the neural network offer a
much better fit to EEG data from subjects listening to naturalistic narrative
than simpler models, and reveal strong surprise responses akin to the P200 and

increased, leading to significant improvements in the performance of planners.
However, the research is diverging and planners are somewhat hard to compare
against each other. This is mostly caused by the fact that there is no standard
set of benchmark domains, nor even a common description language for
hierarchical planning problems. As a consequence, the available planners
support a widely varying set of features and (almost) none of them can solve
(or even parse) any problem developed for another planner. With this paper, we
propose to create a new track for the IPC in which hierarchical planners will
compete. This competition will result in a standardised description language,
broader support for core features of that language among planners, a set of
benchmark problems, a means to fairly and objectively compare HTN planners, and
for new challenges for planners.

fine clustering, the proposed algorithm merges the clusters until a final
clustering is obtained. This, unlike many existing methods, does not require
the number of clusters apriori. Also, the proposed algorithm does not involve
the use of an unknown parameter or tuning for one. %through cross validation. A
parameter free method for producing a fine initial clustering is also
discussed, making the whole process of subspace clustering parameter free. The
comparison of proposed algorithm's performance with that of the existing
state-of-the-art techniques in synthetic and real data sets, shows the

technology enablers for supporting the dynamicity and bandwidth requirements of
emerging 5G network services. To achieve the objective of 5G, Network Services
(NSes) must be often deployed transparently over multiple administrative and
technological domains. Such case often presents security risks since a typical
NS may comprise a chain of network functions, each executed in different remote
locations, and tampering within the network infrastructure may compromise their
communication. To avoid such threats, QKD has been identified and proposed as a
future-proof method immune to any algorithmic cryptanalysis based on
quantum-physics mechanisms. The maturity of QKD has enabled the R&D of quantum
networks coexisting with optical networks using telecom equipment. This makes
the QKD a suitable candidate for the security of distributed and virtualised
network services.
  In this paper, for the first time, we propose a dynamic quantum-secured
optical network for supporting network services that are dynamically created by
chaining VNF over multiple network domains. This work includes a new
quantum-ROADM, extensions to SDN-enabled optical control plane, and extensions
to NFV orchestration to achieve quantum-aware, on-demand chaining of VNFs. The
experimental results verify the capability of routing quantum and classical
data channels both individually and dynamically over shared fibre links.
Moreover, quantum secured chaining of VNFs in 5G networks is experimentally
demonstrated via interconnecting four autonomous 5G islands simultaneously
through the q-ROADM with eight optical channels using the 5GUK Exchange
orchestration platform. The experimental scenarios and results confirm the
benefit of the proposed data plane architecture and control/management plane
framework.

conditions that demand continuity of the Ricci scalar and its normal derivative

of $R$-matching, which is ubiquitous in $f(R)$ collapse scenarios. In this
paper, we study spherically symmetric collapse with the modification term
$\alpha R^2$, and use $R$-matching to exemplify a class of new solutions. After
discussing some mathematical preliminaries by which we obtain an algebraic
relation between the shear and the anisotropy in these theories, we consider
two metric ansatzes. In the first, the collapsing metric is considered to be a
separable function of the co-moving radius and time, and the collapse is
shear-free, and in the second, a non-separable interior solution is considered,
that represents gravitational collapse with non-zero shear viscosity. We arrive
at novel solutions that indicate the formation of black holes or locally naked
singularities, while obeying all the necessary energy conditions. The separable
case allows for a simple analytic expression of the energy-momentum tensor,
that indicates the positivity of the pressures throughout collapse, and is
further used to study the heat flux evolution of the collapsing matter, whose
analytic solutions are presented under certain approximations. These clearly
highlight the role of modified gravity in the examples that we consider.

robustness of multi-scale features by matching the prediction distribution
across multiple layers. Our approach can be easily trained end-to-end and is

extrapolation schemes by including additionally new techniques such as an
exponential scaling transformation of coordinate space with weights
complemented by a dynamically adjusted balancing between the least square
minimization of force deviations and the norm of expansion coefficients in the
approximation. The expensive mean potential forces are treated in terms of the
3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation (three-dimensional reference
interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure). During the dynamics
they are calculated only after every long enough (outer) time interval, i.e.,
quite rarely to reduce the computational costs. At much shorter (inner) time
steps, these forces are extrapolated on the basis of their outer values. The
equations of motion are then solved using a multiple time step integration
within an optimized isokinetic Nos\'e-Hoover chain thermostat. The new approach
is applied to molecular dynamics simulations of various systems consisting of
solvated organic and biomolecules of different complexity. Namely, we consider
hydrated alanine dipeptide, asphaltene in toluene solvent, miniprotein 1L2Y and
protein G in aqueous solution. It is shown that in all these cases, the
enhanced extrapolation provides much better accuracy of the solvation force
approximation than the existing approaches. As a result, it can be used with
much larger outer time steps, leading to a significant speedup of the
simulations.

predominantly arises due to percolative nature of the superconducting

are luminous spots that appear ahead of an advancing leader mediating the
leader's stepped propagation. We show that space stems start as regions of
locally depleted conductivity that form in the streamers of the corona around
the leader. An attachment instability enhances the electric field leading to
strongly inhomogeneous, bright and locally warmer regions ahead of the leader
that explain the existing observations. Since the attachment instability is
only triggered by fields above 10 kV/cm and internal electric fields are lower
in positive than in negative streamers, our results explain why, although
common in negative leaders, space stems and stepping are hardly observed if not
absent in positive leaders. Further work is required to fully explain the
streamer to leader transition, which requires an electric current persisting
for timescales longer than the typical attachment time of electrons, around 100
ns.

the desired acoustic event (whistle) as a linear pattern in the images.
Detection is a four-step method: first, ridge maps are obtained from the
spectrogram images; second, a probabilistic Hough transform algorithm is
applied to detect roughly linear ridges, which are adjusted to the true
corresponding shape of the whistles via an active contour algorithm; third,
feature vectors are built from the geometry of each detected curve; and fourth,
the detections are fed to a random forest classifier to parse out false

the robustness of our two-level adaptive BDDC algorithms with respect to the

supervised Machine Learning-based approaches can leverage the actual raw data
for maximal performance. Yet in realistic scenarios, sufficient high-quality

substantial effort, compromising this approach.
  Here we propose a novel, fully unsupervised, approach to track

Using experimental results on synthetic data we show that a combination of

that hides the actual scan data from the untrusted testers; logic inserted
between the scan cells, driven by a secret key, hides the transformation
functions that map the scan-in stimulus (scan-out response) and the delivered
scan pattern (captured response). While static scan obfuscation utilizes the

the lifetime of the chip, dynamic scan obfuscation updates the key
periodically. In this paper, we propose ScanSAT: an attack that transforms a
scan obfuscated circuit to its logic-locked version and applies the Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) based attack, thereby extracting the secret key. We
implement our attack, apply on representative scan obfuscation techniques, and
show that ScanSAT can break both static and dynamic scan obfuscation schemes

is observed today in the Galaxy via gamma-ray spectroscopy and is inferred to
have been present in the early Solar System via analysis of meteorites. Massive
stars are considered the main contributors of Al26. Although most massive stars
are found in binary systems, the effect, however, of binary interactions on the
Al26 yields have not been investigated since Braun & Langer (1995). Here we aim
to fill this gap. We have used the MESA stellar evolution code to compute
massive (10Msun<=M<=80Msun), non-rotating, single and binary stars of solar
metallicity (Z=0.014). We computed the wind yields for the single stars and for
the binary systems where mass transfer plays a major role. Depending on the
initial mass of the primary star and orbital period, the Al26 yield can either
increase or decrease in a binary system. For binary systems with primary masses
up to ~35-40Msun, the yield can increase significantly, especially at the lower
mass-end, while above ~45Msun the yield becomes similar to the single star
yield or even decreases. Our preliminary results show that compared to
supernova explosions, the contribution of mass-loss in binary systems to the
total Al26 abundance produced by a stellar population is minor. On the other
hand, if massive star mass-loss is the origin of Al26 in the early Solar
System, our results will have significant implications for the identification
of the potential stellar, or stellar population, source.

dense clusters and chemically homogeneous evolution of field binaries. It is
not clear which scenario is responsible for the majority of LIGO/Virgo sources.
Finding connections between ULXs and DCOs can potentially point to the origin
of merging DCOs as more and more ULXs are discovered. We use the StarTrack
population synthesis code to show how many ULXs will form merging DCOs in the
framework of isolated binary evolution. Our merger rate calculation shows that
in the local Universe typically 50% of merging BH-BH progenitor binaries have
evolved through a ULX phase. This indicates that ULXs can be used to study the
origin of LIGO/Virgo sources. We have also estimated that the fraction of

and statistical errors. Method: We analyse 49 papers describing 2456 individual
experimental results from a previously undertaken systematic review comparing

confusion matrices and test for relevant constraints, e.g., the marginal
probabilities must sum to one. We also check for multiple statistical

transcription errors their presence does not engender confidence. We strongly

with the Keck adaptive optics system 6 years after the initial observation,
identifying the lens as a solar-type star hosting a super-Jupiter mass planet.
The masses of planets and host-stars discovered by microlensing are often not
determined from light curve data, while the star-planet mass-ratio and
projected separation in units of Einstein ring radius are well measured.
High-resolution follow-up observations after the lensing event is complete can
resolve the source and lens. This allows direct measurements of flux, and the
amplitude and direction of proper motion, giving strong constraints on the
system parameters. Due to the high relative proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel,Geo} =
12.62\pm0.11$ mas/yr, the source and lens were resolved in 2019, with a
separation of $77.1\pm0.5$ mas. Thus, we constrain the lens flux to $K_{\rm
Keck,lens}= 17.92\pm0.02$. By combining constraints from the model and Keck
flux, we find the lens mass to be $M_L = 0.88\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ at $D_L =
6.72\pm0.59$ kpc. With a mass-ratio of $q=(3.00\pm0.03)\times10^{-3}$ the
planet's mass is determined to be $M_P = 2.74\pm0.17\ M_{J}$ at a separation of
$r_\perp = 3.03\pm0.27$ AU. The lens mass is much higher than the prediction
made by the Bayesian analysis that assumes all stars have an equal probability
to host a planet of the measured mass ratio, and suggests that planets with
mass ratios of a few 10$^{-3}$ are more common orbiting massive stars. This
demonstrates the importance of high-resolution follow-up observations for
testing theories like these.

results demonstrate the $\Gamma_3$ non-Kramers doublet as the ground state of
Pr$^{3+}$ (4$f^2$) ions. This ground state is nonmagnetic but carries a
non-zero quadrupolar moment $\langle\hat{O}_2^0\rangle$. A quadrupolar phase

semimetal with non-trivial Berry phase and low total carrier density 0.06 /f.u.
We discuss the interplay between low carrier density and $4f^2$ quadrupolar
moment, and ascribe the weak quadrupolar ordering and Kondo effect to
consequences of the low carrier density. PrBi, thus, opens a new window to the
physics of topology and strongly correlated effect with quadrupolar degrees of

absorbs a lot of interest. However, an unavoidable obstacle for training such
algorithms is that annotated dialogue corpora are often unavailable. One of the
popular approaches addressing this is to train a dialogue agent with a user
simulator. Traditional user simulators are built upon a set of dialogue rules
and therefore lack response diversity. This severely limits the simulated cases
for agent training. Later data-driven user models work better in diversity but
suffer from data scarcity problem. To remedy this, we design a new corpus-free
framework that taking advantage of their benefits. The framework builds a user
simulator by first generating diverse dialogue data from templates and then
build a new State2Seq user simulator on the data. To enhance the performance,
we propose the State2Seq user simulator model to efficiently leverage dialogue
state and history. Experiment results on an open dataset show that our user
simulator helps agents achieve an improvement of 6.36% on success rate.

Geometric Brownian Motion with a reallocation parameter that was constructed to
capture the quantum and direction of composite redistribution implied in the
income distribution. It is well known that inequality has been rising in India
in the recent past, but the assumption has been that while the rich benefit
more than proportionally from economic growth, the poor are also better off
than before. Findings from our model refute this, as we find that since the
early 2000s reallocation has consistently been negative, and that the Indian
income distribution has entered a regime of perverse redistribution of
resources from the poor to the rich. Outcomes from the model indicate not only
that income shares of the bottom decile (~1%) and bottom percentile (~0.03%)
are at historic lows, but also that real incomes of the bottom decile (-2.5%)
and percentile (-6%) have declined in the 2000s. We validate these findings
using income distribution data and find support for our contention of
persistent negative reallocation in the 2000s. We characterize these findings
in the context of increasing informalization of the workforce in the formal
manufacturing and service sectors, as well as the growing economic insecurity
of the agricultural workforce in India. Significant structural changes will be
required to address this phenomenon.

two adversarial networks are trained simultaneously where a regression network
outputs predictions and a loss network that estimates mutual information (in
AdOR) and KL-divergence (in AdOSE). These methods can be formulated as a
minimax two-player game; at equilibrium, AdOR finds a deterministic map between
inputs and output and estimates mutual information between residual and inputs,
while AdOSE estimates a conditional probability distribution of output given
inputs. The proposed methods can be used as subroutines to address several

generally, causal structure learning) and causal model estimation. Synthetic

on analytic properties of the QCD grand-canonical thermodynamic potential. A

a vast area of application. In this work, we study the recently introduced
S-labeling problem, in which the nodes get labeled using labels from 1 to |V |
and for each edge the contribution to the objective function, called S-labeling
number of the graph, is the minimum label of its end-nodes. The goal is to find
a labeling with minimum value. The problem is NP-hard for planar subcubic
graphs, although for many other graph classes the complexity status is still
unknown. In this paper, we present different algorithmic approaches for
tackling this problem: We develop an exact solution framework based on
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) which is enhanced with valid inequalities,
starting and primal heuristics and specialized branching rules. We show that
our MIP formulation has no integrality gap for paths, cycles and perfect n-ary
trees, and, to the best of our knowledge, we give the first polynomial-time
algorithm for the problem on n-ary trees as well as a closed formula for the
S-labeling number for such trees. Moreover, we also present a Lagrangian
heuristic and a constraint programming approach. A computational study is
carried out in order to (i) investigate if there may be other special graph
classes, where our MIP formulation has no integrality gap, and (ii) assess the
effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches for solving the problem on a
dataset consisting of general graphs.

(ii) the design of buffer zones surrounding (or protecting) so-called core

Reserve Set Covering Problem and allows to address these two requirements

Virgo, with the waves reaching earth directly from their respective sources.
These waves will also travel to different pulsars and will cause (tiny)
transient deformations in the pulsar shape. Some of us have recently shown that
the resultant transient change in the pulsar moment of inertia may leave an
observable imprint on the pulsar signals as detected on earth, especially at
resonance. The pulsars may thus act as remotely stationed Weber gravitational
wave detectors. This allows us to revisit the past GW events via pulsars. We
give here a list of specific pulsars whose future signals will carry the
imprints of past GW events, to be specific we constrain it within 50 years.
Some interesting cases are, supernova SN1987A with earliest perturbed signals

supernova SN185 event may become observable again via pulsar J0900-3144 with
the perturbed pulsar signal reaching us sometime between 2033-2066.
Importantly, even though the strength of the signal will depend on the interior
properties of the pulsar, the expected dates of signal arrival are completely

fainter than expected. Accordingly, CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios are
orders of magnitude lower than previously thought. This may be explained either
as fast gas dispersal, or as chemical evolution and locking up of volatiles in
larger bodies leading to the low observed CO fluxes. The latter processes lead
to enhanced C/O ratios in the gas, which may be reflected in enhanced
abundances of molecules like C2H. The goal of this work is to employ C2H
observations to understand whether low CO fluxes are caused by volatile
depletion, or by fast gas dissipation. We present ALMA Cycle 4 C2H observations
of a subsample of nine sources in Lupus. The integrated C2H emission is
determined and compared to previous CO observations and model predictions.
Seven out of nine disks are detected in C2H, whose line emission is almost as
bright as 13CO. All detections are significantly brighter than the typical
sensitivity of the observations, hinting at a bimodal distribution of the C2H
line intensities. When compared with DALI models, the observed C2H fluxes can
be reproduced only if some level of volatile carbon and oxygen depletion is
allowed and C/O>1 in the gas. Models with reduced gas/dust ratios fail instead
to reproduce the observations. A steeper than linear correlation between C2H
and CN emission line is found. This is linked to the fact that C2H emission
lines are affected more strongly by C/O variations than CN lines. Ring-like
structures are detected both in C2H and in continuum emission but, as for CN,
they do not seem to be connected. Sz 71 shows ring shaped emission in both C2H
and CN with the location of the peak intensity coinciding. Our new ALMA C2H
observations favour volatile carbon and oxygen depletion rather than fast gas
dispersal to explain the faint CO observations for most of the disks.

switching the metasurface between the reflective states of a PEC mirror and a
PMC mirror, using an array of microstrip patches connected to the ground via
diode switches, according to a periodic pseudo-random noise sequence. As the
spectrum spreading induces a drastic reduction of the power spectral density of
the signal, the level of the scattered wave falls below the noise floor of the
interrogating radar, and the object covered by the metasurface is hence
perfectly camouflaged to a foe radar. Moreover, the object can be detected by a
friend radar possessing the spread-spectrum demodulation key corresponding to
the metasurface modulation, and this detection is robust to interfering

jobs (with different sizes) arriving online, and we need to assign each job to
a machine immediately upon its arrival, so as to minimize the makespan, i.e.,
the maximum completion time. In classic mechanism design problems, we assume
that the jobs are controlled by selfish agents, with the sizes being their
private information. Each job (agent) aims at minimizing its own cost, which is
its completion time plus the payment charged by the mechanism. Truthful
mechanisms guaranteeing that every job minimizes its cost by reporting its true
size have been well-studied [Aspnes et al. JACM 1997, Feldman et al. EC 2017].
  In this paper, we study truthful online load balancing mechanisms that are
well-behaved [Epstein et al., MOR 2016]. Well-behavior is important as it
guarantees fairness between machines, and implies truthfulness in some cases
when machines are controlled by selfish agents. Unfortunately, existing
truthful online load balancing mechanisms are not well-behaved. We first show
that to guarantee producing a well-behaved schedule, any online algorithm (even
non-truthful) has a competitive ratio at least $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$, where m is
the number of machines. Then we propose a mechanism that guarantees
truthfulness of the online jobs, and produces a schedule that is almost
well-behaved. We show that our algorithm has a competitive ratio of $O(\log
m)$. Moreover, for the case when the sizes of online jobs are bounded, the
competitive ratio of our algorithm improves to $O(1)$. Interestingly, we show
several cases for which our mechanism is actually truthful against selfish
machines.

and Vega. Under mild assumptions on the time function of the spacetime, the
null distance gives rise to an intrinsic, conformally invariant metric that
induces the manifold topology. We show when warped products of low regularity
and globally hyperbolic spacetimes endowed with the null distance are (local)
integral current spaces. This metric and integral current structure sets the
stage for investigating convergence analogous to Riemannian geometry. Our main
theorem is a general convergence result for warped product spacetimes relating
uniform, Gromov--Hausdorff and Sormani--Wenger intrinsic flat convergence of
the corresponding null distances. In addition, we show that non-uniform
convergence of warping functions in general leads to distinct limiting
behavior, such as limits that disagree.

concentrate on a special case where the dynamics in each step is a $\beta$-map

$\varepsilon > 0$ controlling the strength of self-consistency. We show such a
self-consistent system which has a unique absolutely continuous invariant
measure (acim) for $\varepsilon=0$, but at least two for any $\varepsilon > 0$.
With a slight modification, we transform this system into one which produces a
phase transition-like behavior: it has a unique acim for $0< \varepsilon <
\varepsilon^*$, and multiple for sufficiently large values of $\varepsilon$. We
discuss the stability of the invariant measures by the help of computer
simulations employing the numerical representation of the self-consistent

  Residual Networks","ICCV Workshop",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improving weight sparsity is a common strategy for producing light-weight
deep neural networks. However, pruning models with residual learning is more
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Variance-Aware Cross-Layer (VACL), a
novel approach to address this problem. VACL consists of two parts, a
Cross-Layer grouping and a Variance Aware regularization. In Cross-Layer
grouping the $i^{th}$ filters of layers connected by skip-connections are
grouped into one regularization group. Then, the Variance-Aware regularization
term takes into account both the first and second-order statistics of the
connected layers to constrain the variance within a group. Our approach can
effectively improve the structural sparsity of residual models. For CIFAR10,
the proposed method reduces a ResNet model by up to 79.5% with no accuracy drop
and reduces a ResNeXt model by up to 82% with less than 1% accuracy drop. For
ImageNet, it yields a pruned ratio of up to 63.3% with less than 1% top-5
accuracy drop. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall
model size and accuracy.

We aim to study the far-infrared radio correlation (FIRC) at 150 MHz in

rest-frame 150-MHz luminosity, L150, as a star-formation rate (SFR) tracer,
which is unaffected by dust extinction.
  Methods. We cross-match the 60-um selected Revised IRAS Faint Source Survey
Redshift (RIFSCz) catalogue and the 150-MHz selected LOFAR value-added source
catalogue in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Spring
Field. We estimate L150 for the cross-matched sources and compare it with the
total infrared (IR) luminosity, LIR, and various SFR tracers.
  Results. We find a tight linear correlation between log L150 and log LIR for
star-forming galaxies, with a slope of 1.37. The median qIR value (defined as
the logarithm of the LIR to L150 ratio) and its rms scatter of our main sample
are 2.14 and 0.34, respectively. We also find that log L150 correlates tightly
with the logarithm of SFR derived from three different tracers, i.e.,
SFR_Halpha based on the Halpha line luminosity, SFR_60 based on the rest-frame
60-um luminosity and SFR_IR based on LIR, with a scatter of 0.3 dex. Our
best-fit relations between L150 and these SFR tracers are, log L150 (Lsun) =
1.35(0.06) x log SFR_Halpha (Msun/yr) + 3.20(0.06), log L150 (Lsun) =

has several genuinely new points: First, it is performed on a large dataset

state-of-the-art visualization and clustering techniques to flow data and show
that visualizations are insightful despite the heterogeneous and non-metric

non-trivial acquisition process and allow for proper data preprocessing to be
able to apply DNNs to network traffic data. We conduct DNN hyper-parameter
optimization as well as feature selection experiments, which clearly show that
fine-grained network traffic forecasting is feasible, and that domain-dependent

properties derive their transferability from a locality ansatz. The properties
of a large molecule or a bulk material are written as a sum over contributions
that depend on the configurations within finite atom-centered environments. The
obvious downside of this approach is that it cannot capture non-local,
non-additive effects such as those arising due to long-range electrostatics or
quantum interference. We propose a solution to this problem by introducing
non-local representations of the system that are remapped as feature vectors
that are defined locally and are equivariant in O(3). We consider in particular
one form that has the same asymptotic behavior as the electrostatic potential.
We demonstrate that this framework can capture non-local, long-range physics by
building a model for the electrostatic energy of randomly distributed
point-charges, for the unrelaxed binding curves of charged organic molecular
dimers, and for the electronic dielectric response of liquid water. By
combining a representation of the system that is sensitive to long-range
correlations with the transferability of an atom-centered additive model, this
method outperforms current state-of-the-art machine-learning schemes, and
provides a conceptual framework to incorporate non-local physics into atomistic

identifying many small ""defective"" subsets of the N elements in a power system,
such that the simultaneous failure of all elements in a defective set triggers
a large cascading blackout. Most supersets of defective sets will also initiate
cascades. This property was leveraged by Random Chemistry (RC), a
state-of-the-art algorithm for efficiently finding minimal defective sets.
While not previously acknowledged as such, RC is a group-testing algorithm, in
that it tests pools of candidate solutions. RC then reduces the size of
defective pools until a minimal defective set is found. Using a synthetic model
of the Western United States power grid, we show that run times are minimized
with a much smaller initial pool size than previously recommended, nearly
doubling the speed of RC. We compare RC to a proposed new alternative
group-testing algorithm (SIGHT). Both algorithms have their advantages; while
SIGHT is shown to require fewer total tests than RC, RC requires fewer tests of
defective sets. Thus, the relative speed of each algorithm depends on the
relative cost of defective vs. non defective tests, a factor not previously
considered in the group-testing literature. In the power systems application,
tests of defective sets are much more computationally costly, so RC is faster.
However, with only a single control parameter (compared to many in RC), SIGHT
is easier to optimize, and in applications where the cost ratio of
defective:non-defective tests is low enough, SIGHT will be faster than RC.

increasing the network rigidity, binding affinity and the probe size. In
addition, the velocity autocorrelation functions show negative dips owing to
the viscoelasticity and caging due to surrounding network. These observations
go with general experimental findings. Surprisingly for a probe particle of
size comparable to the mesh size, unrestricted motion engulfing large length

evolution from the giant branch tip to 0.5 mag below the Li dip. Isochrone
comparison with [Fe/H] = -0.04, based upon neural network spectroscopic
analysis, produces an age of 2.25 (2.4) Gyr for E(B-V) = 0.16 (0.14) and (m-M)
= 12.40 (12.29). Despite originating outside the Li dip, only 10% of single
subgiants/giants have measurable Li. Above the Li dip, the limiting A(Li) for
single stars is 3.2 +/- 0.1 but the lower range is comparable to that found
within the dip. The F-dwarf Li dip profile agrees with the Hyades/Praesepe,
evolved forward. The Li level among stars populating the plateau fainter than
the Li dip is A(Li) = 2.83 +/- 0.16; the dispersion is larger than expected
from spectroscopic error alone. Comparison of Li and V_ROT distributions among
turnoff stars in NGC 7789, NGC 2506, NGC 3680, and NGC 6819 indicates that
rotational spindown from the main sequence is critical in defining the
boundaries of the Li dip. For higher mass dwarfs, spindown is likewise
correlated with Li depletion, creating a second dip, but at higher mass and on
a longer time scale. The Li distribution among evolved stars of NGC 6819 is
more representative of the older M67, where subgiant and giant stars emerge
from within the Li dip, than the younger NGC 7789, where a broad range in V_ROT
among the turnoff stars likely produces a range in mass among the giants.

satisfying the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Maps, and equivalent random walks,
can also do this. We study a pair of time-reversible Baker Maps, $N2$ and $N3$,
which generate dissipative{\it fractal} phase-space structures. Steadily
decreasing phase-space volumes correspond to the dissipation associated with
entropy production. Like three smooth reversible dissipative one-body
phase-space flows developed in the 1980s and 1990s our maps generate fractal
distributions, but in two dimensions rather than three, simplifying
visualization and analyses. The continuity equation, which quantifies
phase-volume loss, motivates study of the fractals' reduced ``information
dimensions'', which were approximated by Kaplan and Yorke in terms of
two-dimensional maps' two Lyapunov exponents. The maps studied here generate
fractal (fractional dimensional) distributions in their phase spaces. By
mapping uniformly dense grids of points, fractal dimensions can be determined
by ``area-wise'' mappings. Beginning with a uniform grid area-wise mapping of
the $N2$ Baker Map provides an information dimension of 1.78969. Alternatively,
as many as a trillion iterations, starting from an arbitrary point, gives a
smaller ``point-wise'' dimensionality, $1.741_5$. Neither of these precisely
determined estimates matches the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture value, 1.7337. In the
course of studying these three different approaches to information dimension we
developed random walk equivalents to both mappings, which greatly simplifies
analyses. We found that for the older $ N2$ Baker map the three approaches all
disagree with one another! We later discovered that for the newer $N3$ Baker
mapping the three approaches to information dimension, area-wise, point-wise

one for the CR pressure and one for the Alfv\'en wave energy density where CRs
are initially confined in the SNR shock. Cosmic rays trigger a streaming
instability and produce slab-type resonant Alfv\'en modes. The self-generated
turbulence is damped by ion-neutral collisions and by noncorrelated interaction
with Alfv\'en modes generated at large scales. We show that CRs leaking in cold
dense phases such as those found in cold neutral medium (CNM) and diffuse
molecular medium (DiM) can still be confined over distances of a few tens of
parsecs from the CRC center for a few thousand years. At 10 TeV, CR diffusion
can be suppressed by two or three orders of magnitude. This effect results from
a reduced ion-neutral collision damping in the decoupled regime. We calculate
the grammage of CRs in these environments. We find that in both single and
multi-phase setups at 10 GeV, CNM and DiM media can produce grammage in the
range 10-20 $\rm{g/cm^2}$ in the CNM and DiM phases. At 10 TeV, because of
nonlinear propagation the grammage increases to values in the range 0.5-20
$\rm{g/cm^2}$ in these two phases. We also present preliminary calculations in

fly-bys that occurred on system HD 106906, recently evidenced by De Rosa &
Kalas (2019), to determine if they could account for the wide orbit of the
planet. Thousands of simulations have been performed to account for the
uncertainty on the perturbers coordinates and velocities. The algorithm is able
to handle any change of hierarchy, temporary or not. We used it to fully model
HD 106906 encounters. The simulations confirm that the fly-bys could have
stabilized the planet orbit, and show that it can account for the planet
probable misalignment with respect to the disk plane as well as the disk
morphology. However, that requires a small distance at closest approach (< 0.05
pc), and this configuration is not guaranteed. ODEA is a very good choice for
the study of non-Solar type architecture. It can now adapt to an evolving

superior soft-tissue contrast information that can be leveraged if both

cross-modality educed learning approach where MR information that is educed
from CT is used to hallucinate MRI and improve CT segmentation. Our approach,
called cross-modality educed deep learning segmentation (CMEDL) combines CT and
pseudo MR produced from CT by aligning their features to obtain segmentation on

segmentation networks are aligned. We implemented this approach on U-net and
dense fully convolutional networks (dense-FCN). Our networks were trained on
unrelated cohorts from open-source the Cancer Imaging Archive CT images

separate validation (N=304) and testing (N=333) CT-delineated tumors. Our
approach using both networks were significantly more accurate (U-net $P

sends a message with probability $p(v) \in [0,1)$ and the server has a capacity
of $\sigma \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e., it can recieve at most $\sigma$ messages per
round and excess messages are dropped. The server can modify these
probabilities when clients send messages. Ideally, we wish to converge to a

propose a loosely self-stabilizing protocol with a slightly relaxed legimate

$\Omega(n^{\mathfrak{c}})$ rounds in expectation. In particular, the initial

bits of memory where $W$ is length of node identifers, making it very
lightweight. Finally we state a lower bound on the convergence time an see that
our protocol performs asymptotically optimal (up to some polylogarithmic

$r^{-\alpha}$ and whose critical dynamics depend crucially on the power
$\alpha$: for systems with $\alpha<1$ the transition is sharp while for
$\alpha>1$ it fans out in a chaotic crossover region. In this paper we explore
the fate of critical dynamics in Ising chains with long-range interactions when
the transverse field is ramped up with a finite speed. While for abrupt
quenches we observe a chaotic region that widens as $\alpha$ is increased, the
width of the crossover region diminishes as the time of the ramp increases,
suggesting that chaos will disappear altogether and be replaced by a sharp
transition in the adiabatic limit.

paradigm to combine sensing and computing within a single chip. A special
characteristic of communication networks in heterogeneous 3D SoCs is the
varying latency and throughput in each layer. As shown in this work, this
variance drastically degrades the network performance. We contribute a
co-design of routing algorithms and router microarchitecture that allows to
overcome these performance limitations. We analyze the challenges of
heterogeneity: Technology-aware models are proposed for communication and
thereby identify layers in which packets are transmitted slower. The
communication models are precise for latency and throughput under zero load.
The technology model has an area error and a timing error of less than 7.4% for
various commercial technologies from 90 to 28nm. Second, we demonstrate how to
overcome limitations of heterogeneity by proposing two novel routing algorithms
called Z+(XY)Z- and ZXYZ that enhance latency by up to 6.5x compared to
conventional dimension order routing. Furthermore, we propose a high
vertical-throughput router microarchitecture that is adjusted to the routing
algorithms and that fully overcomes the limitations of slower layers. We
achieve an increased throughput of 2 to 4x compared to a conventional router.
Thereby, the dynamic power of routers is reduced by up to 41.1% and we achieve
improved flit latency of up to 2.26x at small total router area costs between

that systematic errors in star catalogs can affect the accuracy of astrometric
observations. That, in turn, can influence the resulting orbit fits for minor
planets. In order to quantify these systematic errors, we compare the positions
and proper motion of stellar sources in the most utilized star catalogs to the
second release of the Gaia star catalog. The accuracy of Gaia astrometry allows
us to unambiguously identify local biases and derive a scheme that can be used
to correct past astrometric observations of solar system objects. Here we
provide a substantially improved debiasing scheme for 26 astrometric catalogs
that were extensively used in minor planet astrometry. Revised corrections near
the galactic center eliminate artifacts that could be traced back to reference
catalogs used in previous debiasing schemes. Median differences in stellar
positions between catalogs now tend to be on the order of several tens of
milliarcseconds (mas) but can be as large as 175 mas. Median stellar proper
motion corrections scatter around 0.3 mas/yr and range from 1 to 4 mas/yr for
star catalogs with and without proper motion, respectively. The tables in this
work are meant to be applied to existing optical observations. They are not
intended to correct new astrometric measurments as those should make use of the

systematics in past observations to a large extent, corrections beyond the

We theoretically determine the preferred occupied positions of the alkali metal

band-convergence characteristics by 6% compressive strain, which will greatly
enhance the electrical conductivity of K0.75Na0.25IrO2. Present work sheds new

each element of a super-exponentially growing set of possible structures. In
order to circumvent this notorious bottleneck, we develop a novel

all possible structures individually, we assume the generator of the CTBN to be
composed as a mixture of generators stemming from different structures. In this
framework, structure learning can be performed via a gradient-based

diagnostics. In practice, image resolution is restricted by factors like
hardware and processing constraints. Recently, deep learning methods have been
shown to produce compelling state-of-the-art results for image
enhancement/super-resolution. Paying particular attention to desired
hi-resolution MR image structure, we propose a new regularized network that
exploits image priors, namely a low-rank structure and a sharpness prior to
enhance deep MR image super-resolution (SR). Our contributions are then
incorporating these priors in an analytically tractable fashion \color{black}
as well as towards a novel prior guided network architecture that accomplishes
the super-resolution task. This is particularly challenging for the low rank
prior since the rank is not a differentiable function of the image matrix(and
hence the network parameters), an issue we address by pursuing differentiable
approximations of the rank. Sharpness is emphasized by the variance of the
Laplacian which we show can be implemented by a fixed feedback layer at the
output of the network. As a key extension, we modify the fixed feedback
(Laplacian) layer by learning a new set of training data driven filters that
are optimized for enhanced sharpness. Experiments performed on publicly
available MR brain image databases and comparisons against existing
state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed prior guided network offers
significant practical gains in terms of improved SNR/image quality measures.
Because our priors are on output images, the proposed method is versatile and
can be combined with a wide variety of existing network architectures to
further enhance their performance.

time-consuming when a large number of video frames or images have to be

stabilization. This paper investigates a simple, yet effective and efficient
technique to create a camera fingerprint when so many still images need to be
denoised. The technique utilizes Spatial Domain Averaged (SDA) frames. An
SDA-frame is the arithmetic mean of multiple still images. When it is used for

decreased with little or no performance loss. Experimental results show that
the proposed method can work more than 50 times faster than conventional

the jet-driven mass loss with a simple prescription and some free parameters.
Our results show that the jet-driven mass loss, that some systems have during
the GEE, increases the parameter space for stellar binary systems to form SN
IIb progenitors. We estimate that the binary evolution channel with GEE

each of the other three channels, binary evolution without a GEE, fatal CEE

recently started to consider evidences of safety and efficacy on new medical

medicine research community on the regulatory science aspects of this emerging
discipline. But this poses a foundational problem: in the domain of biomedical
research the use of computer modelling is relatively recent, without a widely
accepted epistemic framing for problem of model credibility. Also, because of
the inherent complexity of living organisms, biomedical modellers tend to use a
variety of modelling methods, sometimes mixing them in the solution of a single
problem. In such context merely adopting credibility approaches developed
within other research community might not be appropriate. In this position
paper we propose a theoretical framing for the problem of assessing the
credibility of a predictive models for In Silico Trials, which accounts for the
epistemic specificity of this research field and is general enough to be used

an excellent novelty rate (85-90%) while generating SMILES with a strong

commercial and social gains tends to degrade the professional experience
presented to the forum users. Automated moderation of the relevancy of posted
content is desired. Machine learning is used for text classification and finds
applications in spam email detection, fraudulent transaction detection etc. The
balance of classes in training data is essential in the case of classification
algorithms to make the learning efficient and accurate. However, in the case of
forums, the spam content is sparse compared to the relevant content giving rise
to a bias towards the latter while training. A model trained on such biased
data will fail to classify a spam sample. An approach based on Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling Technique(SMOTE) is presented in this paper to tackle
imbalanced training data. It involves synthetically creating new minority class
samples from the existing ones until balance in data is achieved. The enhanced
data is then passed through various classifiers for which the performance is
recorded. The results were analyzed on the data of forums of Spoken Tutorial,
IIT Bombay over standard performance metrics and revealed that models trained
after Synthetic Minority oversampling outperform the ones trained on imbalanced
data by substantial margins. An empirical comparison of the results obtained by
both SMOTE and without SMOTE for various supervised classification algorithms
have been presented in this paper. Synthetic oversampling proves to be a
critical technique for achieving uniform class distribution which in turn
yields commendable results in text classification. The presented approach can
be further extended to content categorization on educational websites thus
helping to improve the overall digital learning experience.

greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of
highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the
end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. In this work, we construct a quantum
algorithm to find the globally optimal parse (i.e. for infinite beam width)
with high constant success probability. When the input to the decoder is
distributed as a power-law with exponent $k>0$, our algorithm has runtime $R^{n
f(R,k)}$, where $R$ is the alphabet size, $n$ the input length; here $f<1/2$,
and $f\rightarrow 0$ exponentially fast with increasing $k$, hence making our
algorithm always more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart.
We further modify our procedure to recover a finite beam width variant, which
enables an even stronger empirical speedup while still retaining higher
accuracy than possible classically. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search
decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we
show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency.

dimming. I argue that except for a commonly accepted accelerating expansion of
the Universe, a conceivable alternative for explaining this observation is
universe opacity caused by light extinction by intergalactic dust, even though
it is commonly assumed that this effect is negligible. Using data of the
Union2.1 SN Ia compilation, I find that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and the
opaque universe model fit the SN Ia measurements at redshifts $z < 1.4$
comparably well. The optimum solution for the opaque universe model is
characterized by the B-band intergalactic opacity $\lambda_B = 0.10 \pm 0.03 \,
\mathrm{Gpc}^{-1}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.0 \pm 2.5 \,
\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. The intergalactic opacity is higher than that
obtained from independent observations but still within acceptable limits. This
result emphasizes that the issue of the accelerating expansion of the Universe
as the origin of the SN Ia dimming is not yet definitely resolved. Obviously,
the opaque universe model as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model is
attractive, because it avoids puzzles and controversies associated with dark
energy and the accelerating expansion.

system over a finite-time horizon. We use stochastic control barrier functions
as a means to quantify the probability that a system exits a given safe region
of the state space in finite time. A barrier certificate condition that bounds
the expected value of the barrier function over the time horizon is recast as a
sum-of-squares optimization problem for efficient numerical computation. Unlike
prior works, the proposed certificate condition includes a state-dependent
upper bound on the evolution of the expectation. We present formulations for
both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. Moreover, for systems for which
the drift dynamics are affine-in-control, we propose a method for synthesizing
polynomial state feedback controllers that achieve a specified probability of
safety. Several case studies are presented which benchmark and illustrate the
performance of our verification and control method in the continuous-time and
discrete-time domains.

daunting and unstable. A common solution is first stage dimension reduction
through screening or projecting the design matrix to a lower dimensional

projections often have poor performance in very high-dimensions. We propose
TArgeted Random Projection (TARP) to combine positive aspects of both

the deployment of these models become widespread in many intelligence-based
applications. Most recently, DNNs are attacked through Trojan which can
effectively infect the model during the training phase and get activated only
through specific input patterns (i.e, trigger) during inference. In this work,
for the first time, we propose a novel Targeted Bit Trojan(TBT) method, which
can insert a targeted neural Trojan into a DNN through the bit-flip attack. Our
algorithm efficiently generates a trigger specifically designed to locate
certain vulnerable bits of DNN weights stored in main memory (i.e., DRAM). The
objective is that once the attacker flips these vulnerable bits, the network
still operates with normal inference accuracy with benign input. However, when
the attacker activates the trigger by embedding it with any input, the network
is forced to classify all inputs to a certain target class. We demonstrate that
flipping only several vulnerable bits identified by our method, using available
bit-flip techniques (i.e, row-hammer), can transform a fully functional DNN
model into a Trojan-infected model. We perform extensive experiments of
CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets on both VGG-16 and Resnet-18
architectures. Our proposed TBT could classify 92 % of test images to a target
class with as little as 84 bit-flips out of 88 million weight bits on Resnet-18

shares, which are distributed to shareholders. When enough or the correct
combination of shareholders work together the secret can be restored. We
introduce two new types of shares to the secret sharing scheme of Shamir.
Crucial shares are always needed for the reconstruction of the secret, whereas
mutual redundant shares only help once in reconstructing the secret. Further,
we extend the idea of crucial and redundant shares to a compartmented secret
sharing scheme. The scheme, which is based on Shamir's, allows distributing the
secret to different compartments, that hold shareholders themselves. In each
compartment, another secret sharing scheme can be applied. Using the
modifications the overall complexity of general access structures realized
through compartmented secret sharing schemes can be reduced. This improves the
computational complexity. Also, the number of shares can be reduced and some
complex access structures can be realized with ideal amount and size of shares.

presence of an unknown or hidden nuclear reactor could be obscured by the
activities of a known reactor of much greater power nearby. Thus when
monitoring reactor activities by the observation of antineutrino emissions, one
must discriminate known background reactor fluxes from possible unknown reactor
signals under investigation. To quantify this discrimination, we find the
confidence to reject the (null) hypothesis of a single proximal reactor, by
exploiting directional antineutrino signals in the presence of a second,
unknown reactor. In particular, we simulate the inverse beta decay (IBD)
response of a detector filled with a 1 kT fiducial mass of Gadolinium-doped
liquid scintillator in mineral oil. We base the detector geometry on that of
WATCHMAN, an upcoming antineutrino monitoring experiment soon to be deployed at
the Boulby mine in the United Kingdom whose design and deployment will be
detailed in a forthcoming white paper. From this simulation, we construct an
analytical model of the IBD event distribution for the case of one $4\mathrm{\
GWt}\pm2\%$ reactor 25 km away from the detector site, and for an additional,
unknown, 35 MWt reactor 3 to 5 km away. The effects of natural-background
rejection cuts are approximated. Applying the model, we predict $3\sigma$
confidence to detect the presence of an unknown reactor within five weeks, at
standoffs of 3 km or nearer. For more distant unknown reactors, the $3\sigma$
detection time increases significantly. However, the relative significance of
directional sensitivity also increases, providing up to an eight week speedup
to detect an unknown reactor at 5 km away. Therefore, directionally sensitive
antineutrino monitoring can accelerate the mid-field detection of unknown
reactors whose operation might otherwise be masked by more powerful reactors in
the vicinity.

driving in dense traffic, which exploits cooperative behaviors of other
drivers. This paper focuses on heavy traffic where vehicles cannot change lanes
without cooperating with other drivers. In this case, classical robust controls
may not apply since there is no safe area to merge to without interacting with
the other drivers. That said, modeling complex and interactive human behaviors
is highly non-trivial from the perspective of control engineers. We propose a
mathematical control framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC)
encompassing a state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural network (RNN) architecture. In
particular, RNN predicts interactive motions of other drivers in response to
potential actions of the autonomous vehicle, which are then systematically
evaluated in safety constraints. We also propose a real-time heuristic
algorithm to find locally optimal control inputs. Finally, quantitative and
qualitative analysis on simulation studies are presented to illustrate the
benefits of the proposed framework.

socioeconomic and political processes of the 21st century. An essential feature
of India's urbanization has been the growth and persistence of informal
settlements (slums) in its fast-developing cities. Whether living conditions in
Indian urban slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap is
therefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we characterize census data using
the framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative
properties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such
as access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electrical power. We
find that slums in larger cities offer systematically higher levels of service
access than those in smaller cities. Perhaps as expected, we also find
consistent underperformance in service access in slums in comparison with
non-slum neighborhoods in the same cities. However, urban slums, on average,
offer greater access to services than neighborhoods in rural areas. This
situation, which we quantify systematically, may help explain why Indian larger
cities have remained attractive to rural populations in terms of living
standards, beyond the need for an economic income premium.

equations. Usually, solving these equations consists of computing the first
statistics of the response process, and that task has been an essential goal in
the literature. A more ambitious objective is the computation of the solution
probability density function. We present advances on these two aspects in the
case of general random non-autonomous second order linear differential
equations with analytic data processes. The Fr\""obenius method is employed to
obtain the stochastic solution in the form of a mean square convergent power
series. We demonstrate that the convergence requires the boundedness of the
random input coefficients. Further, the mean square error of the Fr\""obenius
method is proved to decrease exponentially with the number of terms in the
series, although not uniformly in time. Regarding the probability density
function of the solution at a given time, we rely on the law of total
probability to express it in closed-form as an expectation. For the computation
of this expectation, a sequence of approximating density functions is
constructed by reducing the dimensionality of the problem using the truncated
power series of the fundamental set. We prove several theoretical results
regarding the pointwise convergence of the sequence of density functions and
the convergence in total variation. The pointwise convergence turns out to be
exponential under a Lipschitz hypothesis. As the density functions are
expressed in terms of expectations, we propose a symbolic Monte Carlo sampling
algorithm for their estimation. This algorithm is implemented and applied on
several numerical examples designed to illustrate the theoretical findings of
the paper.

of perception is established. And by drawing from the successes of the
developed tactile vision substitution systems (TVSS), which render some measure
of vision,in vision handicapped persons, early or congenital blinds, the true
nature of vision as cutaneous sensations is also divulged. The mechanism of
perception involves sensing of the stimuli, and autonomous engagement of brain
neuronal complexity resolution patterns; that is the brain implicit embedded
computational instructions. Upon commencement of the triggers, brain
computations, which aso involve engaging body's biophysical feedback system,
are performed; and the results are outputted as motor signals that render the
realization of perception. However, this requires deployment of a perception
medium; an interface. Given the nature of efferent signals, there must be a
(known) bio-mechanical system interface, other than the body muscle and
skeletal system, which performs the needed function: Considering the fact that
the vocal system performs such task for verbalization of brain's synthesis of
language, the possibility of its further role in the experience of thought and
vision, in the form of mostly quiet (inaudible) recital of the related motor
signals, is suggested.

Automatic identification and classification of hip fractures using deep

normal, displaced femoral neck fracture, nondisplaced femoral neck fracture,
intertrochanteric fracture, previous ORIF, or previous arthroplasty. A deep

the bounding boxes. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet)

evaluated on a held out test set and by comparison on a 100-image subset to two

Results: The binary accuracy for fracture of our model was 93.8% (95% CI,

  In this paper, we provide a combinatorial, deterministic algorithm for

augmenting path approach. More specifically, we utilize a new concept of short
augmenting walks in auxiliary labeled graphs to capture a possible augmentation
of the number of edge-disjoint $T$-paths. To design a search procedure for a
short augmenting walk, we introduce blossoms analogously to the matching
algorithm of Edmonds (1965). When the search procedure terminates without
finding a short augmenting walk, the algorithm provides a certificate for the
optimality of the current edge-disjoint $T$-paths. From this certificate, one
can obtain the Edmonds--Gallai type decomposition introduced by Seb\H{o} and
Szeg\H{o} (2004). The algorithm runs in $O(|E|^2)$ time, which is much faster

Inferring neutron spectra is important for several applications, including
nonproliferation and nuclear security, as it allows the discrimination of
fission sources in special nuclear material (SNM) from other types of neutron
sources based on the differences of the emitted neutron spectra. Organic
scintillators interact with neutrons mostly via elastic scattering on hydrogen
nuclei and therefore partially retain neutron energy information. Consequently,
the neutron spectrum can be derived through deconvolution of the measured light
output spectrum and the response functions of the scintillator to monoenergetic
neutrons. The proposed approach is compared to three existing methods using
simulated data to enable controlled benchmarks. We consider three sets of
detector responses. One set corresponds to a 2.5 MeV monoenergetic neutron
source and two sets are associated with (energy-wise) continuous neutron
sources ($^{252}$Cf and $^{241}$AmBe). Our results show that the proposed
method has similar or better unfolding performance compared to other iterative
or Tikhonov regularization-based approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness
against limited detection events, while requiring less user supervision. The
proposed method also provides a posteriori confidence measures, which offers
additional information regarding the uncertainty of the measurements and the

communication infrastructure breaks down, however, they become almost useless
as most services rely on Internet connectivity. Building post-disaster networks
based purely on smartphones remains a challenging task, and, as of today, no
practical solutions exist. The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) offers
the possibility to improve this situation. With an increase in smart spaces
such as smart homes and smart offices, we move towards digital cities that are
deeply penetrated by IoT technology. Many IoT devices are battery powered and
can aid in mediating an emergency network. In scenarios where the electrical
grid is still operational, yet communication infrastructure failed, non-battery
powered IoT devices can similarly help to relief congestion or build a backup
network in case of cyber attacks. With the recent release of the Bluetooth Mesh
standard, a common interface between mobile devices and the IoT has become
available. The key idea behind this standard is to allow existing and new
devices to build large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. By enabling hundreds of
devices to communicate with each other, Bluetooth Mesh (BT MESH) becomes a
practical technical solution for enabling communication post disaster. In this
paper, we propose a novel emergency network concept that utilises the parts of
digital cities that remains operational in case of disaster, thus mediating
large-scale post-disaster device-to-device communication. Since the Bluetooth
Mesh standard is backwards compatible to Bluetooth 4.0, most of todays mobile
devices can join such a network. No special hardware or software modifications
are necessary, especially no jail-breaking of the smartphones.

evidence. Moreover, as the amount of prior evidence goes to infinity, learning
occurs and is consistent with traditional social learning theory.

materials to modern researchers because of its remarkable thermal, optical,
electronic, and mechanical properties. Graphene holds enormous potentials for
lab on chip (LOC) devices and can provide diverse fabrication routes and
structural features due to their special electronic and electrochemical
properties. A LOC device can manipulate fluids using microchannels and chamber
structures, to accomplish fast, highly sensitive and inexpensive analysis with
high yield. Hence, the graphene based LOC devices can constitute a
well-controlled microenvironment for both advanced chemical/biological
evaluation and low-cost point-of-care analysis etc. This review critically
debates the graphene as a prime candidate for microfluidic devices and their
future applicability towards various practical applications. Finally, the
opportunities and challenges for the future of graphene with respect to their
commercial challenges and sustainability perspectives are discussed.

important role to play in scientific communities. Recently, though, it has also
been argued that various scientific fields seem to be trending towards
conservatism -- the increasing production of what Kuhn (1970) would have called
`normal science'. This paper will explore a possible explanation for this sort
of trend: that the process by which scientific research groups form, grow, and
dissolve might be inherently hostile to high risk science. In particular, I
employ a paradigm developed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016) that treats a
scientific community as a population undergoing selection. As will become
clear, perhaps counter-intuitively this sort of process in some ways promotes
high risk, high reward science. But, as I will point out, high risk high reward
science is, in general, the sort of thing that is hard to repeat. While more
conservative scientists will be able to train students capable of continuing
their successful projects, and so create thriving lineages, successful risky
science may not be the sort of thing one can easily pass on. In such cases, the
structure of scientific communities selects against high risk, high rewards
projects. More generally, this paper makes clear that there are at least two
processes to consider in thinking about how incentives shape scientific
communities -- the process by which individual scientists make choices about
their careers and research, and the selective process governing the formation
of new research groups.

or metrology, occurs on the nano-scale and is therefore subject to large
variation from small, yet significant, perturbations in the manufacturing
environment. An enormous amount of information can be gathered from a single
etch process, a sequence of actions taken to produce an etched wafer from a
blank piece of silicon. Each final wafer, however, is costly to take
measurements from, which limits the number of examples available to train a
predictive model. Part of the significance of this work is the success we saw
from the models despite the limited number of examples. In order to accommodate
the high dimensional process signatures, we isolated important sensor variables
and applied domain-specific summarization on the data using multiple feature
engineering techniques. We used a neural network architecture consisting of the
summarized inputs, a single hidden layer of 4032 units, and an output layer of
one unit. Two different models were learned, corresponding to the metrology
measurements in the dataset, Recess and Remaining Mask. The outputs are related
abstractly and do not form a two dimensional space, thus two separate models
were learned. Our results approach the error tolerance of the microscopic
imaging system. The model can make predictions for a class of etch recipes that
include the correct number of etch steps and plasma reactors with the
appropriate sensors, which are chambers containing an ionized gas that
determine the manufacture environment. Notably, this method is not restricted
to some maximum process length due to the summarization techniques used. This
allows the method to be adapted to new processes that satisfy the
aforementioned requirements. In order to automate semiconductor manufacturing,
models like these will be needed throughout the process to evaluate production
quality.
