the designing of accurate Josephson junction microwave detectors.

synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and synthetic

Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy is introduced to solve this issue. The
proposed learning strategy is driven by three components: a standard supervised
learning loss on labeled synthetic data; an adversarial learning module that
exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data; finally, a
self-teaching strategy applied to unlabeled data. The last component exploits a
region growing framework guided by the segmentation confidence. Furthermore, we
weighted this component on the basis of the class frequencies to enhance the
performance on less common classes. Experimental results prove the
effectiveness of the proposed strategy in adapting a segmentation network
trained on synthetic datasets, like GTA5 and SYNTHIA, to real world datasets
like Cityscapes and Mapillary.

items. Instead, we model the complementarities as proportional to the buyer's
base valuations, and these proportionalities are known market parameters.
  Our goal is to design a simple pricing scheme that, for a single buyer with
proportional complementarities, yields approximately optimal revenue. We define
a new class of mechanisms where some number of items are given away for free,
and the remaining items are sold separately at inflated prices. We find that
the better of such a mechanism and selling the grand bundle earns a
12-approximation to the optimal revenue for pairwise proportional
complementarities. This confirms the intuition that items should not be sold
completely separately in the presence of complementarities.
  In the more general case, a buyer has a maximum of proportional positive
hypergraphic valuations, where a hyperedge in a given hypergraph describes the
boost to the buyer's value for item $i$ given by owning any set of items $T$ in
addition. The maximum-out-degree of such a hypergraph is $d$, and $k$ is the
positive rank of the hypergraph. For valuations given by these parameters, our
simple pricing scheme is an $O(\min\{d,k\})$-approximation.

for accurate covariances beyond the classical Gaussian formula becomes more
acute. Here, I investigate the analytical implementation and impact of
non-Gaussian covariance terms that I previously derived for galaxy clustering.
Braiding covariance is such a class of terms and it gets contribution both from
in-survey and super-survey modes. I present an approximation for braiding
covariance which speeds up the numerical computation. I show that including
braiding covariance is a necessary condition for including other non-Gaussian
terms: the in-survey 2-, 3- and 4-halo covariance, which yield covariance
matrices with negative eigenvalues if considered on their own. I then quantify
the impact on parameter constraints, with forecasts for a Euclid-like survey.
Compared to the Gaussian case, braiding and in-survey covariances significantly
increase the error bars on cosmological parameters, in particular by 50% for w.
The Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) error bars are also affected between 12%
and 39%. Accounting for super-sample covariance (SSC) also increases parameter
errors, by 90% for w and between 7% and 64% for HOD. In total, non-Gaussianity
increases the error bar on w by 120% (between 15% and 80% for other
cosmological parameters), and the error bars on HOD parameters between 17% and
85%. Accounting for the 1-halo trispectrum term on top of SSC is not sufficient
for capturing the full non-Gaussian impact: braiding and the rest of in-survey
covariance have to be accounted for. Finally, I discuss why the inclusion of
non-Gaussianity generally eases up parameter degeneracies, making cosmological
constraints more robust to astrophysical uncertainties. The data and a Python

confirm such hypotheses. Hydrodynamic simulations provide a convincing match to

is a complex convolution of the maximum energy, luminosity, particle drift and
obscuration. Accelerated particles cool down mainly via inverse-Compton,
synchrotron radiation, and photo-pion production. High-energy $\gamma$-rays
interact also with the pool of anisotropic UV photons emitted by both luminous
stars, creating $e^\pm$ pairs and strongly modifying the observed spectrum.
Quick variations of the optical depth are expected along the orbit, due to
changes in shape, position, and gas density of the shocked region. Various CTA
simulations confirm that flux variabilities down to few days timescale could be
detected above 30 GeV. These variations will disentangle the intrinsic particle

renders low-resolution feature maps of the input and the decoder block provides
pixel-wise classification from the feature maps. The proposed model has been
trained over 2000 image data-set and tested against their corresponding
ground-truth provided in the data-set for evaluation. To enable real-time
navigation, we extend our model's predictions interfacing it with the existing
Google APIs evaluating the metrics of the model tuning the hyper-parameters.
The novelty of this approach lies in the integration of existing segNet
architecture with google APIs. This interface makes it handy for assistive
robotic systems. The observed results show that the proposed method is robust
under challenging occlusion conditions due to pre-processing involved and gives
superior performance when compared to the existing methods.

bounds and characterizations on the number of roots of linearized polynomials
of this form \[ ax+b_0x^{\sigma}+b_1x^{\sigma q^n}+b_2x^{\sigma

of a $q^n$-polynomial. Finally, as an applications of the above results, we
present a family of linear sets of the projective line whose points have a
small spectrum of possible weights, containing most of the known families of

power counting arguments. In case of higher derivative theories, the standard

intermediate replacement of high-rank tensor-integrals with symmetrized product
of metric tensors. In this note we present a simple combinatorial solution to

simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to precisely determine
these using individual chemical abundances from a large set of stars, coupled
with some estimate of their ages. Inference is performed via the simple
chemical evolution model Chempy in a Bayesian framework, marginalizing over
each star's specific interstellar medium parameters, including an
element-specific `model error' parameter to account for inadequacies in our
model. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods are used to sample the posterior
function, made possible by replacing Chempy with a trained neural network at
negligible error. The approach is tested using data from both Chempy and the
IllustrisTNG simulation, showing sub-percent agreement between inferred and
true parameters using data from up to 1600 individual stellar abundances. For
IllustrisTNG, strongest constraints are obtained from metal ratios, competitive
with those from other methods including star counts. Analysis using a different
set of nucleosynthetic yields shows that incorrectly assumed yield models can
give non-negligible bias in the derived parameters; this is reduced by our
model errors, which further show how well the yield tables match data. We also
find a significant bias from analyzing only a small set of stars, as is often
done in current analyses. The method can be easily applied to observational
data, giving tight bounds on key galactic parameters from chemical abundances

particular, radio surveys searching for HI absorption inform us on how the AGN
can impact on the cold neutral gas medium within the host galaxy, or the
population of intervening galaxies through the observed line of sight gas
kinematics. We present the results of a HI absorption line survey at $0.4 < z <
1$ towards 34 obscured quasars with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)
commissioning array. We detect three HI absorption lines, with one of these
systems previously unknown. Through optical follow-up for two sources, we find
that in all detections the HI gas is associated with the AGN, and hence that
these AGN are obscured by material within their host galaxies. Most of our
sample are compact, and in addition, are either gigahertz peaked spectrum
(GPS), or steep spectrum (CSS) sources, both thought to represent young or
recently re-triggered radio AGN. The radio spectral energy distribution
classifications for our sample agree with galaxy evolution models in which the
obscured AGN has only recently become active. Our associated HI detection rate
for GPS and compact SS sources matches those of other surveys towards such
sources. We also find shallow and asymmetric HI absorption features, which
agrees with previous findings that the cold neutral medium in compact radio
galaxies is typically kinematically disturbed by the AGN.

galaxies that are actively forming stars at rates of $\sim$8-60 $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. Based on a 500ks Chandra ACIS-I observation we found that the FRII
nucleus hosts a luminous QSO ($L_{2-10keV}=1.3\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
intrinsic and rest-frame) that is obscured by Compton-thick absorption
($N_H=1.5\pm0.6\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). Our Chandra observation, the deepest
so far for a distant FRII within a galaxy overdensity, revealed significant
diffuse X-ray emission within the region covered by the overdensity. In
particular, X-ray emission extending for $\sim$240 kpc is found around the
Eastern lobe of the FRII. Four out of the six MUSE star forming galaxies in the
overdensity are distributed in an arc-like shape at the edge of this diffuse
X-ray emission. The probability of observing by chance four out of the six
$z=1.7$ sources at the edge of the diffuse emission is negligible. In addition,
these four galaxies have the highest specific star formation rates of the MUSE
galaxies in the overdensity and lie above the main sequence of field galaxies
of equal stellar mass at z=1.7. We propose that the diffuse X-rays originate
from an expanding bubble of gas that is shock-heated by the FRII jet, and that
star formation is promoted by the compression of the cold interstellar medium
of the galaxies around the bubble, which may be remarkable evidence of positive
AGN feedback on cosmological scales. [shortened version]

buoyant acceleration through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). When young star
clusters detonate supernovae in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy, they
generate hot, diffuse bubbles that push on the surrounding ISM and evaporate
that ISM into their interiors. As these bubbles reach the scale height of the
ISM, they break out of the disc, rising into the CGM. Once these bubbles break
out, if they have sufficiently high entropy, they will feel an upward
acceleration, owing to a local buoyant force. This upward force will accelerate
these bubbles, driving them to high galactocentric radii, keeping them in the
CGM for $>\Gyr$, even if their initial velocity is much lower than the local
escape velocity. We derive an equation of motion for these entropy-driven winds
that connects the ISM properties, halo mass, and CGM profile of galaxies to the
ultimate evolution of feedback-driven winds. We explore the parameter space of
these equations, and show how this novel framework can explain both
self-consistent simulations of star formation and galactic outflows as well as
the new wealth of observations of CGM kinematics. We show that these
entropy-driven winds can produce long wind recycling times, while still
carrying a significant amount of mass. Comparisons to simulations and
observations show entropy-driven winds convincingly explain the kinematics of
galactic outflows.

geometric phase acquired by an electron in a one-dimensional periodic lattice
as it traverses the Bloch band. Such a geometric phase is useful in
characterizing the topological properties and the electric polarization of the
periodic system. Unfortunately Zak's expression suffers from two flaws: its
value depends upon the choice of origin of the unit cell, and is gauge
dependent. Here we explain that these flaws in Zak's expression arise from the
assumption that the electron's adiabatic motion is cyclic in the sense of
recurrence of the density matrix in course of time evolution. We find through a
careful investigation that the system displays cyclicity in a generalized sense
wherein the physical observables return in the course of evolution. This notion
of generalized cyclicity paves the way for a correct and consistent expression
for the geometric phase in this system, christened as Pancharatnam-Zak phase.
Pancharatnam-Zak geometric phase does not suffer from the flaws inherent in
Zak's expression, and correctly classifies the Bloch bands of the lattice. A
natural filled band extension of the Pancharatnam-Zak phase is also constructed
and studied.

which encodes the properties of the string network. In this paper we analyze
the ability of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to measure this

LISA will be able to probe cosmic strings with tensions $G\mu \gtrsim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-17})$, improving by about $6$ orders of magnitude current
pulsar timing arrays (PTA) constraints, and potentially $3$ orders of magnitude
with respect to expected constraints from next generation PTA observatories. We
include in our analysis possible modifications of the SGWB spectrum due to
different hypotheses regarding cosmic history and the underlying physics of the
string network. These include possible modifications in the SGWB spectrum due
to changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early
Universe, the presence of a non-standard equation of state before the onset of
radiation domination, or changes to the network dynamics due to a string
inter-commutation probability less than unity. In the event of a detection,
LISA's frequency band is well-positioned to probe such cosmic events. Our

deformation. The presence of the subshell closure $Z=40$ makes feasible to
create particle-hole excitations at a moderate excitation energy and,
therefore, likely intruder states could be present in the low-lying spectrum.
In other words, shape coexistence is expected to be a key ingredient to
understand this mass region. The aim of this work is to describe excitation
energies, transition rates, radii, and two-neutron separation energies for the
even-even 94-110Zr nuclei and, moreover, to obtain information about wave
functions and deformation. The interacting boson model with configuration
mixing will be the framework to study the even-even Zr nuclei, considering only
two types of configurations: 0particle-0hole and 2p-2h excitations. On one
hand, the parameters appearing in the Hamiltonian and in the E2 transition
operator are fixed trough a least-squares fit to the whole available
experimental information. On the other hand, once the parameters have been
fixed, the calculations allow to obtain a complete set of observables for the
whole even-even Zr chain of isotopes. Spectra, transition rates, radii,
$\rho^2(E0)$, and two-neutron separation energies have been calculated and a
good agreement with the experimental information has been obtained. Moreover, a
detailed study of the wave function has been conducted and mean-field energy
surfaces and deformation have been computed too. The importance of shape
coexistence has been shown to correctly describe the A~100 mass area for
even-even Zr nuclei. This work confirmed the rather spherical nature of the
ground state of 94-98Zr and its deformed nature for 100-110Zr isotopes. The
sudden onset of deformation in 100Zr is owing to the rapid lowering of a
deformed (intruder) configuration which is high-lying in lighter isotopes.

We formulate RBS as a distributed task between two parties, Alice and Bob, who
share two-mode squeezed-vacuum states. In this protocol, Alice performs local
measurements on her modes, either photon counting or heterodyne. Bob implements
and applies to his modes the LON requested by Alice; at the output of the LON,
Bob performs photon counting, the results of which he sends to Alice via
classical channels. In the ideal situation, when Alice does photon counting,
she obtains from Bob samples from the probability distribution of the RBS
problem, a task that is believed to be classically hard to simulate. When Alice
performs heterodyne measurements, she converts the experiment to a problem that
is classically efficiently simulable, but more importantly, enables her to
characterize a lossy LON on the fly, without Bob's knowing and without changing
anything at Bob's end (this is what we mean by in situ). We introduce and
calculate the fidelity between the joint states shared by Alice and Bob after
the ideal and lossy LONs as a measure of distance between the two LONs. Using
this measure, we obtain an upper bound on the total variation distance between
the ideal probability distribution for the RBS problem and the probability
distribution achieved by a lossy LON. Our method displays the power of the
entanglement of the two-mode squeezed-vacuum states: the entanglement allows
Alice to choose for each run of the experiment between RBS and a simple
characterization protocol based on first-order coherence between complex
amplitudes.

By combining time-resolved two-photon photoemission experiments with
state-of-the-art numerical calculations, an ultrafast ($\lesssim$ 10\,fs)
relaxation due to Hund excitations and related photo-induced in-gap states are
identified. Remarkably, the weight of these in-gap states displays long-lived
coherent THz oscillations up to 2\,ps at low temperature. The frequency of
these oscillations corresponds to the strength of the antiferromagnetic
superexchange interaction in NiO and their lifetime vanishes as the N\'eel
temperature is approached. Numerical simulations of a two-band $t$-$J$ model
reveal that the THz oscillations originate from the interplay between local

strong absorption in HI, NV, and CIV along the background sight-line at higher

we confirm the system contains at least two super-Earths, and either a third

adds to the small sample of low-mass planetary systems with well constrained

radiation field from stars and hot gas on the gas heating and cooling in the
N-body SPH code GASOLINE2. We resimulate three galaxies from the NIHAO project:
one dwarf, one Milky Way-like and one massive spiral, and study what are the
local radiation field effects on various galaxy properties. We also study the
effects of varying the Ultra Violet Background (UVB) model, by running the same
galaxies with two different UVBs. Galaxy properties at $z=0$ like stellar mass,
stellar effective mass radius, HI mass, and radial extent of the HI disc, show
significant changes between the models with and without the local radiation
field, and smaller differences between the two UVB models. The intrinsic effect
of the local radiation field through cosmic time is to increase the equilibrium
temperature at the interface between the galaxies and their circumgalactic
media (CGM), moving this boundary inwards, while leaving relatively unchanged
the gas inflow rate. Consequently, the temperature of the inflow increases when
considering the local radiation sources. This temperature increase is a
function of total galaxy mass, with a median CGM temperature difference of one
order of magnitude for the massive spiral. The local radiation field suppresses
the stellar mass growth by $\sim$20 per cent by $z=0$ for all three galaxies,
while the HI mass is roughly halfed. The differences in the gas phase diagrams,
significantly impact the HI column densities, shifting their peaks in the
distributions towards lower $N_{\rm HI}$.

Model in which naturally small Dirac neutrino masses arise due to existence of
a symmetry which protects neutrino's Diracness. Motivated by this, we consider
an extension of the Standard Model with a second Higgs doublet (2HDM) and three
right-handed neutrinos where lepton number is conserved and, thus, neutrinos
are Dirac particles. In this framework, we identify the most restrictive
texture-zero combinations for the Dirac-neutrino and charged-lepton mass
matrices that lead to masses and mixings compatible with current experimental
data. We then investigate, in a systematic way, which of these combinations can
be realized by Abelian continuous U(1) or discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries.
We conclude that, from the 28 initially possible sets of maximally-restricted
lepton mass matrices, only 5 have a symmetry realization in the 2HDM. For these
cases, one-to-one relations among the Yukawa couplings and the neutrino mass
and mixing parameters are established, and the fermion interactions with the
neutral and charged scalars of the 2HDM are also determined. Consequences for
lepton universality in $\tau$ decays and rare lepton-flavor-violating processes
are also discussed.

measuring the gravitational potential with an atomic clock on-board a
spacecraft on an outbound Solar System orbit, and by comparing the spacecraft's
trajectory with that predicted by General Relativity through the combination of
ranging data and the in-situ measurement (and correction) of non-gravitational
accelerations with an on-board accelerometer. Despite a wealth of new
experiments getting online in the near future, that will bring new knowledge
about the dark sector, it is very unlikely that those science questions will be
closed in the next two decades. More importantly, it is likely that it will be
even more urgent than currently to answer them. Tracking a spacecraft carrying
a clock and an accelerometer as it leaves the Solar System may well be the
easiest and fastest way to directly probe our dark environment.

a measurable map $X \rightarrow \mbox{PO}(n, 1)$ with essentially constant

Milnor-Wood type inequality whose upper bound is given by the modulus of the

in light of recent diffuse X-ray observations. In addition to the spherical
component of isothermal gas ($kT\sim0.3$ keV) in hydrostatic equilibrium with
the Galactic gravitational potential, our model includes a disk-like
non-spherical hot gas component to reproduce the directional dependence of the
observed X-ray emission measure (EM). The total gas mass
($1.2\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) is dominated by the spherical component, and is
consistent with the total baryon mass of the MW expected from the dark matter
mass and the cosmic baryon-to-dark-matter ratio. Our model predicts a mean halo
DM of $43\:\,{\rm pc\:cm^{-3}}$, with a full range of $30$-$245\:\,{\rm
pc\:cm^{-3}}$ over the whole sky. The large scatter seen in the X-ray EM data
implies a $\sim0.2$ dex (rms) fluctuation of the MW halo DM. We provide an
analytic formula to estimate the MW halo DM of our model along any line of

extragalactic sources, in combination with existing DM models of the warm

is designed to achieve higher regression accuracy than unstructured predictors

models, the GCRF model does not scale well with large networks. One of the
approaches consists of performing calculations on factor graphs (if it is
possible) rather than on the full graph, which is more computationally
efficient. The Kronecker product of the graphs appears to be a natural choice
for a graph decomposition. However, this idea is not straightforwardly
applicable for GCRF, since characterizing a Laplacian spectrum of the Kronecker
product of graphs, which GCRF is based on, from spectra of its factor graphs
has remained an open problem. In this paper we apply new estimations for the
Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and achieve high prediction accuracy of
the proposed models, while the computational complexity of the models, compared
to the original GCRF model, is improved from $O(n_{1}^{3}n_{2}^{3})$ to
$O(n_{1}^{3} + n_{2}^{3})$. Furthermore, we study the GCRF model with a
non-Kronecker graph, where the model consists of finding the nearest Kronecker

for HC determination. Based on geometrically obtained globally optimal HC, we
construct HC solutions sequentially according to realistic constraints, so that
we can obtain optimal solution even with non-convex model. For practical

practice, however, VAEs are trained with the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as a
surrogate objective to the intractable marginal data likelihood. This approach
to training yields unstable results, frequently leading to a disastrous local
optimum known as posterior collapse. In this paper, we investigate a simple fix
for posterior collapse which yields surprisingly effective results. The
combination of two known heuristics, previously considered only in isolation,
substantially improves held-out likelihood, reconstruction, and latent

  Counterfactual Data Substitution","Correction to proof in appendix and minor changes",,,,"cs.CL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper treats gender bias latent in word embeddings. Previous mitigation
attempts rely on the operationalisation of gender bias as a projection over a
linear subspace. An alternative approach is Counterfactual Data Augmentation
(CDA), in which a corpus is duplicated and augmented to remove bias, e.g. by
swapping all inherently-gendered words in the copy. We perform an empirical
comparison of these approaches on the English Gigaword and Wikipedia, and find
that whilst both successfully reduce direct bias and perform well in tasks
which quantify embedding quality, CDA variants outperform projection-based
methods at the task of drawing non-biased gender analogies by an average of 19%
across both corpora. We propose two improvements to CDA: Counterfactual Data
Substitution (CDS), a variant of CDA in which potentially biased text is
randomly substituted to avoid duplication, and the Names Intervention, a novel
name-pairing technique that vastly increases the number of words being treated.
CDA/S with the Names Intervention is the only approach which is able to
mitigate indirect gender bias: following debiasing, previously biased words are
significantly less clustered according to gender (cluster purity is reduced by
49%), thus improving on the state-of-the-art for bias mitigation.

critical glycerol concentration of ~7.5 mol %, which is related to the number
of water molecules in the hydration layer around a glycerol molecule. At higher
glycerol concentrations, water molecules dispersed in a glycerol network become
abundant and eventually dominate and four distinct relaxation processes emerge
in the mixtures. The relaxation dynamics and hydration structure in
glycerol-water mixtures are further probed with molecular dynamics simulations,

In addition, we assume the presence of new physics heavy states around the TeV
scale that do not couple to the SM fermions, only to the SM bosonic sector.
However, the mixing between gauge bosons and BSM resonances induces a small
indirect interaction between the BSM sector and the SM fermions. This leads to
an important suppression of the fermionic operators in the low-energy EW
effective theory (bilinear and four-fermion operators) in comparison with the
purely bosonic ones. This naturally explains the strong experimental bounds on
fermionic operators and why these resonances could not be yet detected: even if
energies of the order of the TeV can be reached in present and future
accelerators, their production from initial SM fermions yields a very small
cross section because of this suppression mechanism. On the other hand, they
can leave an imprint in SM boson measurements accessible to future experimental
runs (e.g., the oblique $S$ and $T$ parameters). Finally, we compare our

detection were to host a magnetic field just below their detection limit, the
inferred distribution in strength of these undetected fields would be distinct
from the known distribution in strength of the known magnetic O-type stars.
This indicates that the Initial magnetic (B-)field Function (IBF) is likely
bimodal -- young O-type stars are expected to either have weak/absent magnetic
fields, or strong magnetic fields. We also find that better upper limits, by at
least a factor of 10, would have been necessary to rule out a detection bias as
an explanation for the apparent lack of evolved main-sequence magnetic O-type

that the speed of gravitational waves deviates, ever so slightly, from
luminality on cosmological and other spontaneously Lorentz-breaking

any spin, including Standard Model fields, or from tree level effects from
massive higher spins $s \ge 2$. We show that for the choice of interaction
signs implied by S-matrix and spectral density positivity bounds suggested by
analyticity and causality, the speed of gravitational waves is in general
superluminal at low-energies on NEC preserving backgrounds, meaning
gravitational waves travel faster than allowed by the metric to which photons
and Standard Model fields are minimally coupled. We show that departure of the
speed from unity increases in the IR and argue that the speed inevitably
returns to luminal at high energies as required by Lorentz invariance.
Performing a special tuning of the EFT so that renormalization sensitive
curvature-squared terms are set to zero, we find that finite loop corrections
from Standard Model fields still lead to an epoch dependent modification of the
speed of gravitational waves which is determined by the precise field content
of the lightest particles with masses larger than the Hubble parameter today.
Depending on interpretation, such considerations could potentially have
far-reaching implications on light scalar models, such as axionic or fuzzy cold
dark matter.

various locations (e.g., points-of-interest). Unlike other metrics computed
from only the number of (unique) visits to a location, namely frequency, LE
also captures the diversity of the users' visits, and is thus more accurate
than other metrics. Current solutions for computing LE require full access to
the past visits of users to locations, which poses privacy threats. This paper
discusses, for the first time, the problem of perturbing location entropy for a
set of locations according to differential privacy. The problem is challenging
because removing a single user from the dataset will impact multiple records of
the database; i.e., all the visits made by that user to various locations.
Towards this end, we first derive non-trivial, tight bounds for both local and
global sensitivity of LE, and show that to satisfy $\epsilon$-differential
privacy, a large amount of noise must be introduced, rendering the published
results useless. Hence, we propose a thresholding technique to limit the number
of users' visits, which significantly reduces the perturbation error but
introduces an approximation error. To achieve better utility, we extend the
technique by adopting two weaker notions of privacy: smooth sensitivity
(slightly weaker) and crowd-blending (strictly weaker). Extensive experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed techniques preserve
original data distribution without compromising location privacy.

to motivate the physical processes involved, and then through hydrodynamical,
numerical simulations of an ideal fluid accreting onto a Newtonian gravitating
object. Specifically, we consider axisymmetric, large-scale, small amplitude
deviations in the density field such that the equatorial plane is over dense as
compared to the polar regions. We find that the resulting polar density
gradient dramatically alters the Bondi result and gives rise to steady state
solutions presenting bipolar outflows. As the density contrast increases, more
and more material is ejected from the system, attaining speeds larger than the
local escape velocities for even modest density contrasts. Interestingly,
interior to the outflow region, the flow tends locally towards the Bondi
solution, with a resulting total mass accretion rate through the inner boundary
$choking$ at a value very close to the corresponding Bondi one. Thus, the
numerical experiments performed suggest the appearance of a maximum achievable
accretion rate, with any extra material being ejected, even for very small

decision making in a belief space, over a possibly high-dimensional state
space. Typically, to solve a decision problem, one should identify the optimal
action from a set of candidates, according to some objective. We claim that one
can often generate and solve an analogous yet simplified decision problem,
which can be solved more efficiently. A wise simplification method can lead to
the same action selection, or one for which the maximal loss in optimality can
be guaranteed. Furthermore, such simplification is separated from the state
inference and does not compromise its accuracy, as the selected action would
finally be applied on the original state. First, we present the concept for
general decision problems and provide a theoretical framework for a coherent
formulation of the approach. We then practically apply these ideas to decision
problems in the belief space, which can be simplified by considering a sparse
approximation of their initial belief. The scalable belief sparsification
algorithm we provide is able to yield solutions which are guaranteed to be
consistent with the original problem. We demonstrate the benefits of the
approach in the solution of a realistic active-SLAM problem and manage to

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) because it requires observations at different

identified using populations of GRBs with reported redshifts. For example, the
Amati correlation relates $E_{peak}$ of the spectrum when modeled with a Band
function and the total energy emitted $E_{iso}$ in a time integrated analysis.
A multiple-component scenario has been proposed in order to explain GRBs
spectra, and in this context when a fine-time spectral analysis is performed a
correlation between the non-thermal component's peak energy and the luminosity
($E_{peak,i} - L_i$) appears. This correlation is also used to infer distances
to GRBs. In this work we present a sample of bright GRBs and apply these
empirical correlations to constrain the pseudo-redshift of the selected burst

demand learning (EDL)-based prediction solution in which a charging station
provider (CSP) gathers information from all charging stations (CSs) and then
performs the EDL algorithm to predict the energy demand for the considered
area. However, this approach requires frequent data sharing between the CSs and
the CSP, thereby driving communication overhead and privacy issues for the EVs
and CSs. To address this problem, we propose a federated energy demand learning

revealing real datasets. Specifically, the CSs only need to send their trained
models to the CSP for processing. In this case, we can significantly reduce the
communication overhead and effectively protect data privacy for the EV users.
To further improve the effectiveness of the FEDL, we then introduce a novel
clustering-based EDL approach for EV networks by grouping the CSs into clusters
before applying the EDL algorithms. Through experimental results, we show that
our proposed approaches can improve the accuracy of energy demand prediction up

minimizes the transmission outage probability. Our examination shows that the

constraints. Here, we introduce a systematic way of enforcing nonlinear
analytic constraints in neural networks via constraints in the architecture or
the loss function. Applied to convective processes for climate modeling,
architectural constraints enforce conservation laws to within machine precision
without degrading performance. Enforcing constraints also reduces errors in the
subsets of the outputs most impacted by the constraints.

  Partitioning Help?","Accepted in IEEE Globecom 2019. 6 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the effect of bandwidth partitioning (BWP) on the
reliability and delay performance in infrastructureless wireless networks. The
reliability performance is characterized by the density of concurrent
transmissions that satisfy a certain reliability (outage) constraint and the
delay performance by so-called local delay, defined as the average number of
time slots required to successfully transmit a packet. We concentrate on the
ultrareliable regime where the target outage probability is close to 0. BWP has
two conflicting effects: while the interference is reduced as the concurrent
transmissions are divided over multiple frequency bands, the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) requirement is increased due to smaller
allocated bandwidth if the data rate is to be kept constant. Instead, if the
SIR requirement is to be kept the same, BWP reduces the data rate and in turn
increases the local delay. For these two approaches with adaptive and fixed SIR
requirements, we derive closed-form expressions of the local delay and the
maximum density of reliable transmissions in the ultrareliable regime. Our
analysis shows that, in the ultrareliable regime, BWP leads to the
reliability-delay tradeoff.

$U(\mathfrak{g})$-module whose associated variety is the given orbital variety)
of these minimal orbital varieties, and he also classified those minimal
highest weight modules whose annihilator ideals are completely prime. In this

functions consisting of three terms: (i) a continuously differentiable term,
(ii) a simple convex term, and (iii) a concave and continuous term. First, by
extending randomized CD to nonsmooth nonconvex settings, we develop a
coordinate subgradient method that randomly updates block-coordinate variables
by using block composite subgradient mapping. This method converges
asymptotically to critical points with proven sublinear convergence rate for
certain optimality measures. Second, we develop a randomly permuted CD method
with two alternating steps: linearizing the concave part and cycling through
variables. We prove asymptotic convergence to critical points and sublinear
complexity rate for objectives with both smooth and concave parts. Third, we
extend accelerated coordinate descent (ACD) to nonsmooth and nonconvex
optimization to develop a novel randomized proximal DC algorithm whereby we
solve the subproblem inexactly by ACD. Convergence is guaranteed with at most a
few number of ACD iterations for each DC subproblem, and convergence complexity
is established for identification of some approximate critical points. Fourth,
we further develop the third method to minimize certain ill-conditioned
nonconvex functions: weakly convex functions with high Lipschitz constant to
negative curvature ratios. We show that, under specific criteria, the ACD-based
randomized method has superior complexity compared to conventional gradient
methods. Finally, an empirical study on sparsity-inducing learning models
demonstrates that CD methods are superior to gradient-based methods for certain

produce responses that lack relevance, diversity, and in many cases coherence.
These shortcomings stem from the limited ability of common training objectives
to directly express these properties as well as their interplay with training
datasets and model architectures. Toward addressing these problems, this paper
proposes bootstrapping a dialogue response generator with an adversarially
trained discriminator. The method involves training a neural generator in both
autoregressive and traditional teacher-forcing modes, with the maximum
likelihood loss of the auto-regressive outputs weighted by the score from a
metric-based discriminator model. The discriminator input is a mixture of
ground truth labels, the teacher-forcing outputs of the generator, and
distractors sampled from the dataset, thereby allowing for richer feedback on
the autoregressive outputs of the generator. To improve the calibration of the
discriminator output, we also bootstrap the discriminator with the matching of
the intermediate features of the ground truth and the generator's
autoregressive output. We explore different sampling and adversarial policy
optimization strategies during training in order to understand how to encourage
response diversity without sacrificing relevance. Our experiments shows that
adversarial bootstrapping is effective at addressing exposure bias, leading to
improvement in response relevance and coherence. The improvement is
demonstrated with the state-of-the-art results on the Movie and Ubuntu dialogue
datasets with respect to human evaluations and BLUE, ROGUE, and distinct n-gram

by the combined effect of magnetic field and grating, are observed in the
graphene grating system for the first time. In addition, the near-zero modes
can be greatly enhanced by the combined effect grating and magnetic field,
rendering graphene devices promising for thermal communication at ultra-low

region of heat transfer, no matter for any twisted angle between gratings. The
combined effect of grating and magnetic field is investigated simultaneously.
By changing the strength of magnetic field, the positions and intensities of

grating action (graphene filling factors and twisted angles) with a higher

the modulation ability of twist can be tuned by the magnetic field at different

report issues, including bugs, feature requests, enhancement suggestions, etc.
Different information, however, is gathered from users when issues are reported
on different ITSs, which presents considerable challenges for issue
classification tools to work effectively across the ITSs. Besides, bugs often
take higher priority when it comes to classifying the issues, while existing
approaches to issue classification seldom focus on distinguishing bugs and the
other non-bug issues, leading to suboptimal accuracy in bug identification.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to automatically
identify bug-reporting issues across various ITSs. The approach implements the
k-NN algorithm to detect and correct misclassifications in data extracted from
the ITSs, and trains an attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory
(ABLSTM) network using a dataset of over 1.2 million labelled issues to
identify bug reports. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach achieved
an F-measure of 85.6\% in distinguishing bugs and other issues, significantly
outperforming the other benchmark and state-of-the-art approaches examined in
the experiment.

revolutionized the Internet of Things, and resulted in increased realization of
smart homes, personalization and home automation through voice commands. The
introduction of VCDs in IoT is expected to give emergence of new subfield of
IoT, called Multimedia of Thing (MoT). These VCDs can be exploited in IoT
driven environment to generate various spoofing attacks including the replays.
Replay attacks are generated through replaying the recorded audio of legitimate
human speaker with the intent of deceiving the VCDs having speaker verification
system. The connectivity among the VCDs can easily be exploited in IoT driven
environment to generate a chain of replay attacks (multi-order replay attacks).
Existing spoofing detection datasets like ASVspoof and ReMASC contain only the
first-order replay recordings against the bonafide audio samples. These
datasets can not offer evaluation of the anti-spoofing algorithms capable of
detecting the multi-order replay attacks. Additionally, these datasets do not
capture the characteristics of microphone arrays, which is an important
characteristic of modern VCDs. We need a diverse replay spoofing detection
corpus that consists of multi-order replay recordings against the bonafide
voice samples. This paper presents a novel voice spoofing detection corpus
(VSDC) to evaluate the performance of multi-order replay anti-spoofing methods.
The proposed VSDC consists of first and second-order-replay samples against the
bonafide audio recordings. Additionally, the proposed VSDC can also be used to
evaluate the performance of speaker verification systems as our corpus includes
the audio samples of fifteen different speakers. To the best of our knowledge,

integral part of the encoding and decoding process, where transforms provide
compact representations for the signals of interest. This paper introduces a
class of transforms called graph-based transforms (GBTs) for video compression,
and proposes two different techniques to design GBTs. In the first technique,
we formulate an optimization problem to learn graphs from data and provide
solutions for optimal separable and nonseparable GBT designs, called GL-GBTs.
The optimality of the proposed GL-GBTs is also theoretically analyzed based on
Gaussian-Markov random field (GMRF) models for intra and inter predicted block
signals. The second technique develops edge-adaptive GBTs (EA-GBTs) in order to
flexibly adapt transforms to block signals with image edges (discontinuities).
The advantages of EA-GBTs are both theoretically and empirically demonstrated.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transforms can
significantly outperform the traditional Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT).

genome sequences are available for the study of human genetics. Genome-wide
association studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide
polymorphisms and traits such as major human diseases. However, the statistical
power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants is
limited. To address the challenge, rare and low-frequency variants are often
grouped into a gene or pathway level, and the effects of multiple variants
evaluated based on collapsing methods. The sequential kernel association test
(SKAT) is one of the most effective collapsing methods. SKAT utilizes the
kernel matrix. The size of the kernel matrix is O(n^2), where the sample size
is n, so that the calculation of the data using the kernel method requires a
long time. As the sample sizes of human genetic studies increase, the
computational time is getting more and more problematic. In the present paper,
the genotype value decomposition method is proposed for the handling the
sequential kernel in a short period of time. The method can be referred to as
genotype value decomposition. In the present paper, it is shown that the
genetic relationship matrix and Identity by State (IBS) matrix can be obtained
using the genotype value vectors. By using this method, the SKAT can be
conducted with time complexity O(n). The proposed method enables to conduct
SKAT for samples of human genetics.

for charged topological black holes (TBHs) with massive gravitons (within the

behavior and nature of possible phase transition(s) crucially depend on the
specific choice of ensemble, and, in order to gain more insight into
criticality in the massive gravity framework, we perform our analysis in both
the canonical (fixed charge, $Q$) and the grand canonical (fixed potential,
$\Phi$) ensembles. It is shown that, for charged TBHs in the grand canonical
ensemble, the van der Waals (vdW) phase transition could take place in $d \ge
5$, the reentrant phase transition (RPT) in $d \ge 6$ and the analogue of
triple point in $d \ge 7$ which are different from the results of canonical
ensemble. In the canonical ensemble, the vdW phase transition is observed in $d

associated with the triple point in $d \ge 6$. In this regard, the appearance
of grand canonical $P-V$ criticality and the associated phase transition(s) in
black holes with various topologies depend on the effective topological factor
$k_{\rm{eff}}^{\rm{(GC)}} \equiv {[k + {m_g^2}c_0^2{c_2} - 2({d_3}/{d_2}){\Phi

controversial over 120 years after the pioneering work of Lorentz. We give a
simple but rigorous treatment of the subject at the textbook level that
explains the apparent paradoxes that are much discussed in the literature on
the subject. We first derive the equation of motion of a charged particle from
conservation of energy and momentum, which includes the self-force term. We
then show that this theory is unstable if charged particles are pointlike: the
energy is unbounded from below, and charged particles self-accelerate
(`over-react') due to their negative `bare' mass. This theory clearly does not
describe our world, but we show that these instabilities are absent if the
particle has a finite size larger than its classical radius. For such
finite-size charged particles, the effects of radiation reaction can be
computed in a systematic expansion in the size of the particle. The leading
term in this expansion is the reduced-order Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion,
which has no stability problems. We also discuss the apparent paradox that a
particle with constant acceleration radiates, but does not suffer radiation
reaction (`under-reaction'). Along the way, we introduce the ideas of
renormalization and effective theories, which are important in many areas of
modern theoretical physics. We hope that this will be a useful addition to the
literature that will remove some of the air of mystery and paradox surrounding

subtraction is performed to enhance the completeness for close companions. The
completeness is estimated to be high $(>90\%)$ even for the faintest companions
of interest. The number of physical companions is estimated by subtracting a
background density from the number density of projected companions. We divide
all the companions into three groups (faint, intermediate and bright) according
to their fluxes. A control sample of galaxies is constructed to have similar
redshift distribution and stellar mass range as the quasar sample using the

galaxies have similar numbers of faint and bright companions, while quasars
show a $3.7\sigma$ deficit of intermediate companions compared to galaxies. The
numbers of companions in all three groups do not show strong evolution with
redshift, and the number of intermediate companions around quasars decreases
with quasar luminosity. Assuming that merger-triggered quasars have entered the
final coalescence stage during which individual companions are no longer
detectable at large separations, our result is consistent with a picture in
which a significant fraction of quasars is triggered by mergers.

  2019",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charging demands of electric vehicles (EVs) are sharply increasing due to the
rapid development of EVs. Hence, reliable and convenient quick charge stations
are required to respond to the needs of EV drivers. Due to the uncertainty of
EV charging loads, load forecasting becomes vital for the operation of quick
charge stations to formulate the day-ahead plan. In this paper, based on trip
chain theory and EV user behaviour, an EV charging load forecasting model is
established for quick charge station operators. This model is capable of
forecasting the charging demand of a city-located quick charge station during
the next day, where the Monte-Carlo simulation method is applied. Furthermore,
based on the forecasting model, a day-ahead profit-oriented operation strategy
for such stations is derived. The simulation results support the effectiveness
of this forecasting model and the operation strategy. The conclusions of this
paper are as follows: 1) The charging load forecasting model ensures operators
to grasp the feature of the charging load of the next day. 2) The revenue of
the quick charge station can be dramatically increased by applying the proposed
day-head operation strategy.

zero and nonzero elements of a sparse parameter vector of a stochastic dynamic
system under feedback control, for which the current input may depend on the
past inputs and outputs, system noises as well as exogenous dithers. First, a
sparse parameter identification algorithm is introduced based on L2 norm with
L1 regularization, where the adaptive weights are adopted in the optimization
variables of L1 term. Second, estimates generated by the algorithm are shown to
have both set and parameter convergence. That is, sets of the zero and nonzero
elements in the parameter can be correctly identified with probability one
using a finite number of observations, and estimates of the nonzero elements
converge to the true values almost surely. Third, it is shown that the results
are applicable to a large number of applications, including variable selection,
open-loop identification, and closed-loop control of stochastic systems.
Finally, numerical examples are given to support the theoretical analysis.

exists a constant $C>0$ depending only on the fibered cone such that for any

(\psi)$ is bounded from above by $C/|\chi(S)|$. We also obtain a moral
connection between $\ell_{\mathcal{C}} (\psi)$ and the normal generating

to obtain a continuous extension of normalized asymptotic translation lengths

for normalized entropy has been answered affirmatively by Fried and the
question for normalized asymptotic translation length on the arc complex in the
fully punctured case has been answered negatively by Strenner. We show that
such an extension in the case of the curve complex does not exist in general by
explicit computation for sequences in the fibered cone of the magic manifold.

clean energy applications such as conversion of H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ into

cost-effective materials able to catalyze the chemical reactions of interest
when exposed to visible light are scarce due to the stringent electronic
conditions that they must satisfy. Chemical and nanostructuring approaches are
capable of improving the catalytic performance of known photoactive compounds
however the complexity of the synthesized nanomaterials and sophistication of
the employed methods make systematic design of photocatalysts difficult. Here,
we show by means of first-principles simulation methods that application of
biaxial stress, $\eta$, on semiconductor oxide thin films can modify their
optoelectronic and catalytic properties in a significant and predictable
manner. In particular, we show that upon moderate tensile strains CeO$_{2}$ and
TiO$_{2}$ thin films become suitable materials for photocatalytic conversion of
H$_{2}$O into H$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$ into CH$_{4}$ under sunlight. The band gap
shifts induced by $\eta$ are reproduced qualitatively by a simple analytical
model that depends only on structural and dielectric susceptibility changes.
Thus, epitaxial strain represents a promising route for methodical screening
and rational design of photocatalytic materials.

biased classifier, hence past work recommends enforcing group-based fairness
metrics in addition to maximizing accuracy. However, doing so exposes the
classifier to another kind of bias called infra-marginality. This refers to
individual-level bias where some individuals/subgroups can be worse off than
under simply optimizing for accuracy. For instance, a classifier implementing
race-based parity may significantly disadvantage women of the advantaged race.
To quantify this bias, we propose a general notion of $\eta$-infra-marginality
that can be used to evaluate the extent of this bias. We prove theoretically
that, unlike other fairness metrics, infra-marginality does not have a
trade-off with accuracy: high accuracy directly leads to low infra-marginality.
This observation is confirmed through empirical analysis on multiple simulated
and real-world datasets. Further, we find that maximizing group fairness often
increases infra-marginality, suggesting the consideration of both group-level
fairness and individual-level infra-marginality. However, measuring
infra-marginality requires knowledge of the true distribution of
individual-level outcomes correctly and explicitly. We propose a practical
method to measure infra-marginality, and a simple algorithm to maximize
group-wise accuracy and avoid infra-marginality.

resembling the Omori-Utsu and the inverse Omori laws in the primary and the
tertiary creep regimes, respectively. Distribution of the creep lifetime obeys
the log-normal distribution, and the average creep lifetime decays in a
scale-free manner with the increasing stress. The above results are in good
agreement with experiments. Additionally, the mean avalanche size as a function
of temperature exhibits a series of jumps, and finite-size scaling implies the
existence of phase transitions.

interaction has to be accounted for, which leads to state-space explosion.
Stateless model checking battles this problem by exploring traces rather than
states of the program. As there are exponentially many traces, dynamic
partial-order reduction (DPOR) techniques are used to partition the trace space
into equivalence classes, and explore a few representatives from each class.
The standard equivalence that underlies most DPOR techniques is the
happens-before equivalence, however recent works have spawned a vivid interest
towards coarser equivalences. The efficiency of such approaches is a product of
two parameters: (i) the size of the partitioning induced by the equivalence,
and (ii) the time spent by the exploration algorithm in each class of the
partitioning.
  In this work, we present a new equivalence, called value-happens-before and
show that it has two appealing features. First, value-happens-before is always
at least as coarse as the happens-before equivalence, and can be even
exponentially coarser. Second, the value-happens-before partitioning is
efficiently explorable when the number of threads is bounded. We present an
algorithm called value-centric DPOR (VCDPOR), which explores the underlying
partitioning using polynomial time per class. Finally, we perform an
experimental evaluation of VCDPOR on various benchmarks, and compare it against
other state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that value-happens-before
typically induces a significant reduction in the size of the underlying
partitioning, which leads to a considerable reduction in the running time for
exploring the whole partitioning.

therefore no free parameters are left, as this perturbed layer is known to have

strategies that account for people's likely behaviour both before and during a

range of bushfire evacuation scenarios. However, the ABM should reflect the
diversity of possible human responses in a given community. The
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive model captures behaviour in a compact
representation that is understandable by domain experts. Within a BDI-ABM
simulation, individual BDI agents can be assigned profiles that determine their
likely behaviour. Over a population of agents their collective behaviour will
characterise the community response. These profiles are drawn from existing
human behaviour research and consultation with emergency services personnel and
capture the expected behaviours of identified groups in the population, both

can then be formed, and evacuation scenarios within the simulation can be used
to explore the possible impact of population structure on outcomes. It is hoped
that this will give an improved understanding of the risks associated with
evacuation, and lead to tailored evacuation plans for each community to help

with various scattering mechanisms, the obtained free energy functional can be
used for systems with spin-triplet pairing such as superfluid $^3$He and

we introduce the elements and a model for the resiliency of distributed DNN
inference. Inspired by the concept of residual connections in DNNs, we

deepFogGuard's design to provide resiliency. Next, our extensive experiments

because many questions require reasoning and thus have real-valued answers
which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image. In this
work, we aim to bridge this gap between existing datasets and real-world plots.
Specifically, we propose PlotQA with 28.9 million question-answer pairs over
224,377 plots on data from real-world sources and questions based on
crowd-sourced question templates. Further, 80.76% of the out-of-vocabulary

Analysis of existing models on PlotQA reveals that they cannot deal with OOV

not surprising given that these models were not designed for such questions. As
a step towards a more holistic model which can address fixed vocabulary as well

by choosing the answer from a fixed vocabulary or by extracting it from a
predicted bounding box in the plot, while other questions are answered with a
table question-answering engine which is fed with a structured table generated

quench-induced tunneling dynamics depends crucially on the interspecies
interaction strength and the presence of entanglement inherent in the system.
In particular, for weak couplings the impurity performs a rather irregular
tunneling process in the double well. Increasing the interspecies coupling it
is possible to control the response of the impurity which undergoes a delayed
tunneling while the majority species effectively acts as a material barrier.
For very strong interspecies interaction strengths the impurity exhibits a
self-trapping behaviour. We showcase that a similar tunneling dynamics takes
place for two weakly interacting impurities and identify its underlying
transport mechanisms in terms of pair and single-particle tunneling processes.

radiate more strongly when they are synchronized, and that if there are $N$
dipoles, the overall emitted intensity scales with $N^2$. In atomic physics,
such an enhanced radiative property appears when coherence among two-level
identical atoms is established, and is well-known as ""superradiance""
\cite{Dicke:1954aa}. In superfluorescence (SF), atomic coherence develops via a
self-organisation process stemming from the common radiated field, starting
from a incoherently prepared population inversion \cite{Bonifacio:1975aa}.
First demonstrated in a gas \cite{Skribanowitz:1973} and later in condensed
matter systems \cite{Florian:1984}, its potential is currently being
investigated in the fields of ultranarrow linewidth laser development for
fundamental tests in physics
\cite{Meiser:2009,Meiser:2010,Bohnet:2012aa,Norcia:2016, Norcia:2018}, and for
the development of devices enabling entangled multi-photon quantum light
sources \cite{Raino:2018aa,Angerer:2018aa}.
  A barely developed aspect in superradiance is related to the properties of
the dipole array that generates the pulsed radiation field. In this work we
establish the experimental conditions for formation of a macroscopic dipole via
superfluorescence, involving the remarkable number of $4\times10^{12}$ atoms.
Even though rapidly evolving in time, it represents a flexible test-bed in
quantum optics. Self-driven atom dynamics, without the mediation of cavity QED
nor quantum dots or quantum well structures, is observed in a
cryogenically-cooled rare-earth doped material. We present clear evidence of a
decay rate that is enhanced by more than 1-million times compared to that of
independently emitting atoms. We thoroughly resolve the dynamics by directly
measuring the intensity of the emitted radiation as a function of time.

covariance. Their semiclassical counterparts are Poisson homogeneous spaces,
which are quotient manifolds of Lie groups $M=G/H$ equipped with an additional
Poisson structure $\pi$ which is compatible with a Poisson-Lie structure $\Pi$
on $G$. Since the infinitesimal version of $\Pi$ defines a unique Lie bialgebra
structure $\delta$ on the Lie algebra $\frak g=\mbox{Lie}(G)$, we exploit the
idea of Lie bialgebra duality in order to study the notion of complementary
dual homogeneous space $M^\perp=G^\ast/H^\perp$ of a given homogeneous space
$M$ with respect to a coisotropic Lie bialgebra. Then, by considering the
natural notions of reductive and symmetric homogeneous spaces, we extend these
concepts to $M^\perp$ thus showing that an even richer duality framework
between $M$ and $M^\perp$ arises from them. In order to analyse physical
implications of these notions, the case of $M$ being a Minkowski or (Anti-) de
Sitter Poisson homogeneous spacetime is fully studied, and the corresponding
complementary dual reductive and symmetric spaces $M^\perp$ are explicitly
constructed in the case of the well-known $\kappa$-deformation, where the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is introduced as an explicit parameter in order
to describe all Lorentzian spaces simultaneously. In particular, the fact that
$M^\perp$ is a reductive space is shown to provide a natural condition for the
representation theory of the quantum analogue of $M$ that ensures the existence
of physically meaningful uncertainty relations between the noncommutative
spacetime coordinates. Finally, despite these dual spaces $M^\perp$ are not
endowed in general with a $G^\ast$-invariant metric, we show that their
geometry can be described by making use of $K$-structures.

fragmentation of clumps into cores is a fundamental step to understand how
stars and stellar clusters form. We aim to establish a statistical view of
clump fragmentation at sub-parsec scales based on a large sample of massive
clumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. We used the APEX/SABOCA camera at 350
$\mu$m to image clumps at a resolution of 8.$''$5. The majority of the sample
consists of massive clumps that are weak or in absorption at 24 $\mu$m. We
resolve rich filamentary structures and identify the population of compact
sources. We use association with mid-infrared 22-24 $\mu$m and 70 $\mu$m point
sources to pin down the star formation activity of the cores. We then
statistically assess their physical properties, and the fragmentation
characteristics of massive clumps. We find a moderate correlation between the
clump fragmentation levels with the clump gas density and the predicted number
of fragments with pure Jeans fragmentation scenario; we find a strong
correlation between the mass of the most massive fragment and the total clump
mass, suggesting that the self-gravity may play an important role in the
clumps' small scale structure formation. We identify 27 massive quiescent cores
with $M_{\rm core}>100$ M$_{\odot}$ within 5 kpc; these are massive enough to
be self-gravitating but do not yet show any sign of star-formation. This sample
comprises, therefore, promising candidates of massive pre-stellar cores, or
deeply embedded high-mass protostars.

synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only
poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in
sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons
alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the network's
activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory
neurons shifts the network dynamic towards the stable regime. The decrease in
sensitivity to small perturbations to time varying input can be considered as
an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the
network performance can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here
implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses.
By analysing the stability of the linearized network dynamics, we explain how
homeostasis can simultaneously maintain the network's firing rate and
sensitivity to small perturbations.

exosphere by plasma sputtering. The cold Jovian plasma is simulated with a 3D
plasma-planetary interaction hybrid model, which produces 2D surface
precipitation maps for magnetospheric H+ , O+ , O++ , and S++ . For the hot
Jovian plasma, we assume isotropic precipitation onto the complete spherical
surface. Two scenarios are investigated: One where no ionospheric shielding
takes place and accordingly full plasma penetration is implemented ('no
ionosphere' scenario), and one where an ionosphere lets virtually none of the
cold plasma but all of the hot plasma reach Callisto's surface ('ionosphere'
scenario). In the 3D exosphere model, neutral particles are sputtered from the
surface and followed on their individual trajectories. The 3D density profiles
show that whereas in the 'no ionosphere' scenario the ram direction is favored,
the 'ionosphere' scenario produces almost uniform density profiles. In
addition, the density profiles in the 'ionosphere' scenario are reduced by a
factor of ~2.5 with respect to the 'no ionosphere' scenario. We find that the
Neutral gas and Ion Mass spectrometer, which is part of the Particle
Environment Package on board the JUICE mission, will be able to detect the
different sputter populations from Callisto's icy surface and the major sputter
populations from Callisto's non-icy surface. The chemical composition of
Callisto's exosphere can be directly linked to the chemical composition of its
surface, and will offer us information not only on Callisto's formation
scenario but also on the building blocks of the Jupiter system.

  Assisted Multi-user MIMO Systems","6 pages, 6 figures, published on WCSP 2019","2019 11th Int. Conf. Wireless Commun. Signal Process. (WCSP), Oct.
  2019","10.1109/WCSP.2019.8928065",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising solution to
enhance wireless information transmissions by adaptively controlling
prorogation environment. Recently, the brand-new concept of utilizing IRS to
implement a passive transmitter attracts researchers' attention since it
potentially realizes low-complexity and hardware-efficient transmitters of
multiple-input single/multiple-output (MISO/MIMO) systems. In this paper we
investigate the problem of precoder design for a low-resolution IRS-based
transmitter to implement multi-user MISO/MIMO wireless communications.
Particularly, the IRS modulates information symbols by varying the phases of
its reflecting elements and transmits them to $K$ single-antenna or
multi-antenna users. We first aim to design the symbol-level precoder for IRS
to realize the modulation and minimize the maximum symbol-error-rate (SER) of
single-antenna receivers. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, we first
relax the low-resolution phase-shift constraint and solve this problem by
Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Then, the low-resolution
symbol-level precoding vector is obtained by direct quantization. Considering
the large quantization error for 1-bit resolution case, the branch-and-bound
method is utilized to solve the 1-bit resolution symbol-level precoding vector.
For multi-antenna receivers, we propose to iteratively design the symbol-level
precoder and combiner by decomposing the original large-scale optimization

at nuclear reactors: the smallest neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ was
determined with high precision and the emitted antineutrino spectrum was
measured at unprecedented resolution. However, two anomalies, the first one
related to the absolute flux and the second one to the spectral shape, have yet
to be solved. The flux anomaly is known as the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly and
could be caused by the existence of a light sterile neutrino eigenstate
participating in the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. Introducing a sterile
state implies the presence of a fourth mass eigenstate, while global fits
favour oscillation parameters around $\sin^{2}(2\theta)=0.09$ and $\Delta
m^{2}=1.8\textrm{eV}^{2}$.
  The STEREO experiment was built to finally solve this puzzle. It is one of
the first running experiments built to search for eV sterile neutrinos and
takes data since end of 2016 at ILL Grenoble, France. At a short baseline of 10
metres, it measures the antineutrino flux and spectrum emitted by a compact
research reactor. The segmentation of the detector in six target cells allows
for independent measurements of the neutrino spectrum at multiple baselines. An
active-sterile flavour oscillation could be unambiguously detected, as it
distorts the spectral shape of each cell's measurement differently.
  This contribution gives an overview on the STEREO experiment, along with
details on the detector design, detection principle and the current status of
data analysis.

obtained by CALIFA. We derived the bar rotation rate as the ratio between the
corotation and bar radii. Thirteen out of 29 galaxies, which were
morphologically classified as SABs from a visual inspection, do not actually
host a bar component or their central elongated component is not in rigid
rotation. We successfully derived the bar pattern speed in 16 objects. Two of
them host an ultrafast bar. Using the bar strength to differentiate weak and
strong bars, we found that the SABs host shorter bars with smaller corotation
radii than their strongly barred counterparts. Weak and strong bars have
similar bar pattern speeds and rotation rates, which are all consistent with
being fast. We did not observe any difference between the bulge prominence in
SAB and SB galaxies, whereas nearly all the weak bars reside in the disc inner
parts, contrary to strong bars. We ruled out that the bar weakening is only
related to the bulge prominence and that the formation of weak bars is
triggered by the tidal interaction with a companion. Our observational results
suggest that weak bars may be evolved systems exchanging less angular momentum

showing the existence of variants of the so-called Riemann's non-differentiable

mapping rules being generated by a mapping language such as RML. First, MapSDI
pre-processes the sources based on semantic information extracted from mapping
rules, by performing basic database operators; it projects out required
attributes, eliminates duplicates, and selects relevant entries. All these
operators are defined based on the knowledge encoded by the mapping rules which
will be then used by the semantification engine (or RDFizer) to produce a
knowledge graph. We have empirically studied the impact of MapSDI on existing
RDFizers, and observed that knowledge graph creation time can be reduced on

characteristics of both patients and the health condition of interest must be
balanced across providers for a fair comparison. This is unlikely to be
feasible within observational data, as patient population characteristics may
vary geographically and patient care may vary by characteristics of the health
condition. We simulated data for patients and providers, based on a previously
utilized real-world dataset, and separately considered both binary and
continuous covariate-effects at the upper level. Multilevel latent class (MLC)
modelling is proposed to partition a prediction focus at the patient level
(accommodating casemix) and a causal inference focus at the provider level. The
MLC model recovered a range of simulated Trust-level effects. Median recovered
values were almost identical to simulated values for the binary Trust-level
covariate, and we observed successful recovery of the continuous Trust-level
covariate with at least 3 latent Trust classes. Credible intervals widen as the
error variance increases. The MLC approach successfully partitioned modelling
for prediction and for causal inference, addressing the potential conflict
between these two distinct analytical strategies. This improves upon strategies
which only adjust for differential selection. Patient-level variation and
measurement uncertainty are accommodated within the latent classes.

traditionally been led by 3GPP. However, the emergence of RAN slicing has
introduced new aspects that fall outside 3GPP scope. Among them, network
virtualization enables the particularization of multiple RAN behaviors over a
common physical infrastructure. Using Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) that
comprise customized radio functionalities, each virtualized RAN, denominated
RAN slice, could meet its specific requirements. Although 3GPP specifies the
description model to manage RAN slices, it can neither particularize the
behavior of a RAN slice nor leverage the NFV descriptors to define how its VNFs
can accommodate its spatial and temporal traffic demands. In this article, we
propose a description model that harmonizes 3GPP and ETSI-NFV viewpoints to
manage RAN slices. The proposed model enables the translation of RAN slice
requirements into customized virtualized radio functionalities defined through
NFV descriptors. To clarify this proposal, we provide an example where three
RAN slices with disruptive requirements are described following our solution.

First, the data-augmentation strategies (cropping, warping, etc.) distort the
composition of a photograph and affect the performance. Secondly, the CNN
features, in principle, are translation-invariant and appearance-dependent. But
some geometric properties important for aesthetics, e.g. the Rule of Thirds

novel input representation which is geometry-sensitive, position-cognizant and
appearance-invariant. We further introduce a two-column CNN architecture that

scalar configuration. Consequently, the exterior space-time is changed, and an
external scalar field appears, which subsequently triggers a scalarization of
its companion. The dynamical interplay produces a gravitational scalar
counterpart of tensor gravitational waves. In this paper, we resort to
scalar-tensor theory and demonstrate that the gravitational scalar counterpart
from double neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) become

from convergence of external scalar fields, plays the role of gravitational
scalar counterpart in scalarized DNS binary, and the appearance of a
mass-dimensional constant in Higgs-like gravitational scalar potential is
responsible for a massive gravitational scalar counterpart with mass of order
of Planck scale; (ii) a dipolar gravitational scalar radiated field, resulting
from different binding energy of NS and WD, plays the role of gravitational

{\beta} Gem (K0 III), {\mu} Leo (K2 III), and {\alpha} Tau (K5 III). It is
notable that around all three stars the giant planets have been found. Our
results are compared with published high-precision data for benchmark stars
included in the Gaia project. Very good agreement was obtained for all three
giants with these data for the basic parameters Teff, logg, and M. Special
attention was devoted to analysis of the Fe I lines which are the basis of a
simultaneous determination of the metallicity index [Fe/H] and microturbulent
parameter Vt. The equivalent widths W of the Fe I lines are automatically
measured from published spectra for the benchmark stars. An analysis of Fe I
lines from the list of ""golden lines"" selected in a study of benchmark stars
led to the conclusion that the excitation potential El of the low level of the
lines plays an substantial role in determining [Fe/H] and Vt. It is shown that
in the case of the early K-giants {\beta} Gem and {\mu} Leo for lines in the
range of W from 100 to 300 m{\AA} there is a dependence of the [Fe/H] and Vt
values on El. It is shown that a correct accounting for it leads an ambiguity
in the determination of [Fe/H] and Vt for {\beta} Gem and {\mu} Leo. In the
case of the coolest K-giant {\alpha} Tau (Aldebaran) with a temperature Teff =
3920K, this effect seems to be less pronounced. Recommendations are given for
the Fe I lines selection for [Fe/H] and Vt determination. It is sonfirmed for
the example of the three stars studied here that the non-LTE effects in the Fe
I lines for the K-giants with normal metallicity are very minor, so they cannot
be the reason of the revealed ambiguity in [Fe/H] and Vt values. The low ratios
of the carbon 12C/13C and oxygen 16O/17O isotopes confirm that all three giants
passed the phase of deep convective mixing.

$m$-equivariance, $m\geq1$. Our result is threefold. Firstly, we construct a
pseudoconformal blow-up solution $u$ with given asymptotic profile $z^{\ast}$:
\[
\Big[u(t,r)-\frac{1}{|t|}Q\Big(\frac{r}{|t|}\Big)e^{-i\frac{r^{2}}{4|t|}}\Big]e^{im\theta}\to
z^{\ast}\qquad\text{in }H^{1} \] as $t\to0^{-}$, where $Q(r)e^{im\theta}$ is a
static solution. Secondly, we show that such blow-up solutions are unique in a
suitable class. Lastly, we exhibit an instability mechanism of $u$. We
construct a continuous family of solutions $u^{(\eta)}$, $0\leq\eta\ll1$, such
that $u^{(0)}=u$ and for $\eta>0$, $u^{(\eta)}$ is a global scattering solution
exhibiting a rotational instability as $\eta\to0^{+}$: $u^{(\eta)}$ takes an
abrupt spatial rotation by the angle \[ \Big(\frac{m+1}{m}\Big)\pi \] on the
time interval $|t|\lesssim\eta$.
  We are inspired by works in the $L^{2}$-critical NLS. In the seminal work of
Bourgain and Wang (1997), they constructed such pseudoconformal blow-up
solutions. Merle, Rapha\""el, and Szeftel (2013) showed an instability of
Bourgain-Wang solutions. Although CSS shares many features with NLS, there are
essential differences and obstacles over NLS. To name a few, the soliton
profile to CSS shows a slow decay $r^{-(m+2)}$, CSS has nonlocal nonlinearities
responsible for strong long-range interactions, and the instability mechanism
of CSS is completely different from that of NLS. Here, the phase rotation is
the main source of the instability. On the other hand, the self-dual structure
of CSS is our sponsor to overcome these obstacles. We exploited the
self-duality in many places such as the linearization, spectral properties, and
construction of modified profiles.

  We propose two distinct approaches for extra supervision of end-to-end person

state-of-the-art knowledge distillation in object detection. We employ this to
supervise the detector of our person search model at various levels using a
specialized detector. The second approach is new, simple and yet considerably
more effective. This distills knowledge from a teacher re-identification
technique via a pre-computed look-up table of ID features. It relaxes the
learning of identification features and allows the student to focus on the
detection task. This procedure not only helps fixing the sub-optimal detector
training in the joint optimization and simultaneously improving the person
search, but also closes the performance gap between the teacher and the student
for model compression in this case. Overall, we demonstrate significant
improvements for two recent state-of-the-art methods using our proposed

trading patterns can indicate inefficiencies or economic dependencies in trade
networks, cycles in food webs can identify fragile dependencies in ecosystems,
and cycles in financial transaction networks can be an indication of money
laundering. Identifying such interesting cycles, which can also be constrained
to contain a given set of query nodes, although not extensively studied, is
thus a problem of considerable importance. In this paper, we introduce the
problem of discovering interesting cycles in graphs. We first address the
problem of quantifying the extent to which a given cycle is interesting for a
particular analyst. We then show that finding cycles according to this
interestingness measure is related to the longest cycle and maximum mean-weight
cycle problems (in the unconstrained setting) and to the maximum Steiner cycle
and maximum mean Steiner cycle problems (in the constrained setting). A
complexity analysis shows that finding interesting cycles is NP-hard, and is
NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor in the unconstrained setting,
and within a factor polynomial in the input size for the constrained setting.
The latter inapproximability result implies a similar result for the maximum
Steiner cycle and maximum mean Steiner cycle problems. Motivated by these
hardness results, we propose a number of efficient heuristic algorithms. We
verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate their
practical utility on two real-world use cases: a food web and an international
trade-network dataset.

degree of gland formation within histology images. To do this, it is important
to consider the overall tissue micro-environment by assessing the cell-level
information along with the morphology of the gland. However, current automated
methods for CRC grading typically utilise small image patches and therefore
fail to incorporate the entire tissue micro-architecture for grading purposes.
To overcome the challenges of CRC grading, we present a novel cell-graph
convolutional neural network (CGC-Net) that converts each large histology image
into a graph, where each node is represented by a nucleus within the original
image and cellular interactions are denoted as edges between these nodes
according to node similarity. The CGC-Net utilises nuclear appearance features
in addition to the spatial location of nodes to further boost the performance
of the algorithm. To enable nodes to fuse multi-scale information, we introduce
Adaptive GraphSage, which is a graph convolution technique that combines
multi-level features in a data-driven way. Furthermore, to deal with redundancy
in the graph, we propose a sampling technique that removes nodes in areas of
dense nuclear activity. We show that modeling the image as a graph enables us
to effectively consider a much larger image (around 16$\times$ larger) than
traditional patch-based approaches and model the complex structure of the
tissue micro-environment. We construct cell graphs with an average of over
3,000 nodes on a large CRC histology image dataset and report state-of-the-art
results as compared to recent patch-based as well as contextual patch-based

of Majorana vector-spinors that can be mixed into a pair of charged spin-$3/2$
gravitini. The action for $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA is invariant under
$SO(1,3)\times U(1)$ gauge transformations, and under local SUSY. We present a
geometric action that involves two ""inhomogeneous"" parts: an orthosymplectic
$OSp(4\vert 2)$ gauge-invariant action of the Yang-Mills type, and a
supplementary action invariant under purely bosonic $SO(2,3)\times U(1)\sim
Sp(4)\times SO(2)$ sector of $OSp(4\vert 2)$, that needs to be added for
consistency. This action reduces to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA after gauge fixing,
for which we use a constrained auxiliary field in the manner of Stelle and
West. Canonical deformation is performed by using the Seiberg-Witten approach
to noncommutative (NC) gauge field theory with the Moyal product. The
NC-deformed action is expanded in powers of the deformation parameter
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ up to the first order. We show that $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA has
non-vanishing linear NC correction in the physical gauge, originating from the
additional, purely bosonic action. For comparison, simple $N=1$ Poinacar\'{e}
SUGRA can be obtained in the same manner, directly from an $OSp(4\vert 1)$
gauge-invariant action. The first non-vanishing NC correction is quadratic in
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and therefore exceedingly difficult to calculate. Under
Wigner-In\""{o}n\""{u} (WI) contraction, $N=2$ AdS superalgebra reduces to $N=2$
Poincar\'{e} superalgebra, and it is not clear whether this relation holds
after canonical deformation. We present the linear NC correction to $N=2$

has, so far, come from indirect signatures. In this work, we investigate the
topological input of twisted flux tube emergence directly by studying helicity
and winding fluxes. In magnetohydrodynamic simulations with domains spanning
from the top of the convection zone to the lower corona, we simulate the
emergence of twisted flux tubes with a range of different initial field
strengths. One important feature of this work is the inclusion of a
convectively-unstable layer beneath the photosphere. We find approximately
self-similar behaviour in the helicity input for the different field strengths
considered. As the tubes rise and reach the photosphere, there is a strong
input of negative helicity since we consider left-handed twisted tubes. This
phase is then followed by a reduction of the negative input and, for low
initial field strengths, a net positive helicity input. This phase corresponds
to the growing influence of convection on the field and the development of
serpentine field structures during emergence. The winding flux can be used to
detect when the twisted cores of the tubes reach the photosphere, giving clear
information about the input of topologically complex magnetic field into the
solar atmosphere. In short, the helicity and winding fluxes can provide much
information about how a magnetic field emerges that is not directly available
from other sources, such as magnetograms. In evaulating the helicity content of
these simualtions we test numerous means for creating synthetic magnetograms,
including methods which acount for both the evolving geometry and the finite
extent of the photosphere. Whilst the general qualitative behaviours are same
in each case, the different forms of averaging do affect the helicity and
winding inputs quantitatively.

Universe. Many different theories about this dark matter exist, but most
probably it is made of a new kind of fundamental particle that has to be
massive, stable, electrically neutral, and having only weak interaction with
standard matter (weakly interacting massive particles). In principle, those
particles could produce gamma rays by their annihilation or decay. Therefore, a
Gamma-ray signal from a dark matter origin would provide one of the clearest
and most concluding evidences for dark matter. High resolution cosmological
N-body simulations have shown that dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way halo
may developed in the Universe. Those subhalos could pop-up in gamma-ray surveys
as unidentified sources. In this paper we present H.E.S.S. observations of
unidentified sources selected from Fermi-LAT catalogs. These sources fulfill
main features which would characterize a dark matter subhalo, namely, having no
obvious counterpart at other wavelengths and being steady hard sources.

capillary description with the cubic-plus-association equation of state to
study the thermodynamic stability of droplets, bubbles and films of water at
358 K in a cylindrically symmetric pore. The equilibrium structure depends
strongly on the size of the pore and whether the pore is closed or connected to
a particle reservoir. A new methodology is presented to analyze the
thermodynamic stability of films, where the integral that describes the total
energy of the system is approximated by a quadrature rule. We show that, for
large pores, the thermodynamic stability limit of adsorbed droplets and bubbles
in both open and closed pores is governed by their mechanical stability, which
is closely linked to the pore shape. This is also the case for a film in a
closed pore. In open pores, the film is chemically unstable except for very low
film-phase contact angles and for a limited range in external pressure. This
result emphasizes the need to invoke a complete thermodynamic stability
analysis, and not restrict the discussion to mechanical stability. A common
feature for most of the heterogeneous structures examined is the appearance of
regions where the structure is metastable with respect to a pore filled with a
homogeneous fluid. In the closed pores, these regions grow considerably in size
when the pores become smaller. [...] Complete phase diagrams are presented that
compare all the investigated structures. In open pores at equilibrium, the most
stable structure is either the homogeneous phase or adsorbed droplets and
bubbles, depending on the type of phase in the external reservoir. Smaller
pores allow for droplets and bubbles to adsorb for a larger span in pressure.
In closed pores, most of the investigated configurations can occur depending on
the total density, the contact angle and the pore shape. [...]

non-monotonic dependence of the frequency of eigenoscillations on energy. Near
the extremum, where the dispersion of the eigenfrequency is zero, the system
regains certain characteristics of a linear resonator, albeit at large

several models launch successful explosions, either by the standard supernova
mechanism based on neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities or by
magnetorotational processes. It is, however, quite common for the PNS to
collapse to a black hole (BH) within a few seconds. Others might produce
proto-magnetar-driven explosions. We explore several ways to describe the
different explosion mechanisms. The competition between the timescales for
advection of gas through the gain layer and heating by neutrinos provides an
approximate explanation for models with insignificant magnetic fields. The
fidelity of this explosion criterion in the case of rapid rotation can be
improved by accounting for the strong deviations from spherical symmetry and
mixing between pole and equator. We furthermore study an alternative
description including the ram pressure of the gas falling through the shock.
Magnetically driven explosions tend to arise from a strongly magnetised region
around the polar axis. In these cases, the onset of the explosion corresponds
to the equality between the advection timescale and the timescale for the
propagation of Alfv\'en waves through the gain layer.

intersection $X_1,\cdot \ldots \cdot,X_r$ in a complex manifold, satisfying
certain transversality conditions. As applications we obtain a

L\^e classes of the $X_i$.

algorithm for partitioning the stars in our sample into groups (i.e., clusters)
that are associated with the various molecular clouds of the complex, and
derive the distance and spatial velocity of individual stars and their
corresponding molecular clouds. Results: We show that the molecular clouds are
located at different distances and confirm the existence of important depth
effects in this region reported in previous studies. For example, we find that
the L 1495 molecular cloud is located at $d=129.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ pc, while the
filamentary structure connected to it (in the plane of the sky) is at
$d=160.0^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ pc. We report B 215 and L 1558 as the closest

25 pc and the relative motion of the subgroups is on the order of a few km/s.
We find no clear evidence for expansion (or contraction) of the Taurus complex,
but signs of the potential effects of a global rotation. Finally, we compare
the radial velocity of the stars with the velocity of the underlying $^{13}$CO
molecular gas and report a mean difference of $0.04\pm0.12$ km/s (with r.m.s.
of 0.63 km/s) confirming that the stars and the gas are tightly coupled.

for data integration problems. Some methods directly use pre-trained embeddings

always be an appropriate choice for enterprise datasets with custom vocabulary.
Other methods adapt techniques from natural language processing to obtain
embeddings for the enterprise's relational data. However, this approach blindly
treats a tuple as a sentence, thus losing a large amount of contextual
information present in the tuple.
  We propose algorithms for obtaining local embeddings that are effective for
data integration tasks on relational databases. We make four major
contributions. First, we describe a compact graph-based representation that
allows the specification of a rich set of relationships inherent in the
relational world. Second, we propose how to derive sentences from such a graph
that effectively ""describe"" the similarity across elements (tokens, attributes,
rows) in the two datasets. The embeddings are learned based on such sentences.
Third, we propose effective optimization to improve the quality of the learned
embeddings and the performance of integration tasks. Finally, we propose a
diverse collection of criteria to evaluate relational embeddings and perform an
extensive set of experiments validating them against multiple baseline methods.
Our experiments show that our framework, EmbDI, produces meaningful results for
data integration tasks such as schema matching and entity resolution both in
supervised and unsupervised settings.

contraction can be carried out effectively, relevant conditions are introduced
to divide all continuous optimization problems into three categories: (i)
logarithmic time contractible, (ii) polynomial time contractible, or (iii)
noncontractible. For every problem from the first two categories, there exists
a contraction sequence that converges to the set of all global minimizers with
linear convergence; for any problem from the last category, we discuss possible
troubles caused by contraction. Finally, a practical algorithm is proposed with
high probability bounds for convergence rate and complexity. It is shown that
the contractibility contributes to practical applications and can also be seen
as a complement to smoothness for distinguishing the optimization problems that

reconstruction. Methods: We modeled the MRI reconstruction problem with Bayes's
theorem, following the recently proposed PixelCNN++ method. The image
reconstruction from incomplete k-space measurement was obtained by maximizing
the posterior possibility. A generative network was utilized as the image
prior, which was computationally tractable, and the k-space data fidelity was
enforced by using an equality constraint. The stochastic backpropagation was
utilized to calculate the descent gradient in the process of maximum a
posterior, and a projected subgradient method was used to impose the equality
constraint. In contrast to the other deep learning reconstruction methods, the
proposed one used the likelihood of prior as the training loss and the
objective function in reconstruction to improve the image quality. Results: The
proposed method showed an improved performance in preserving image details and
reducing aliasing artifacts, compared with GRAPPA, $\ell_1$-ESPRiT, and MODL, a
state-of-the-art deep learning reconstruction method. The proposed method
generally achieved more than 5 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement for
compressed sensing and parallel imaging reconstructions compared with the other
methods. Conclusion: The Bayesian inference significantly improved the
reconstruction performance, compared with the conventional $\ell_1$-sparsity
prior in compressed sensing reconstruction tasks. More importantly, the
proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most MRI
reconstruction scenarios.

transform, the theory has been merely non-existent, despite the large number of

demonstrate that compressed sensing with Walsh samples, as long as the sampling
strategy is highly structured and follows the structured sparsity of the

Lyapunov exponents that are remarkably stable under the variation of the
steptime and lattice size. Furthermore, it reaches such stability faster than
other characteristic quantities such as energy and dissipation rate. These
results remain even if the steptime is made arbitrarily small. A discrepancy is
also resolved between previous measurements of the dependence on the Reynolds
number of the Lyapunov exponent. The signal produced by different variables in
the steady state is analyzed and the self decorrelation time is used to
determine the run time needed in the simulations to obtain proper statistics
for each variable. Finally, a brief analysis on MHD flows is also presented,

order to detect credit card frauds. However, most studies consider credit card
transactions as isolated events and not as a sequence of transactions. In this
framework, we model a sequence of credit card transactions from three different
perspectives, namely (i) The sequence contains or doesn't contain a fraud (ii)
The sequence is obtained by fixing the card-holder or the payment terminal
(iii) It is a sequence of spent amount or of elapsed time between the current
and previous transactions. Combinations of the three binary perspectives give
eight sets of sequences from the (training) set of transactions. Each one of
these sequences is modelled with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Each HMM
associates a likelihood to a transaction given its sequence of previous
transactions. These likelihoods are used as additional features in a Random
Forest classifier for fraud detection. Our multiple perspectives HMM-based
approach offers automated feature engineering to model temporal correlations so
as to improve the effectiveness of the classification task and allows for an
increase in the detection of fraudulent transactions when combined with the
state of the art expert based feature engineering strategy for credit card
fraud detection. In extension to previous works, we show that this approach
goes beyond ecommerce transactions and provides a robust feature engineering
over different datasets, hyperparameters and classifiers. Moreover, we compare
strategies to deal with structural missing values.

eigenspace of size $r \ll n$, where $n$ is the underlying problem dimension.
For example, spectral clustering and PCA both require the computation of the
leading $r$-dimensional subspace. Often, this process is repeated over time due
to the possible temporal nature of the data; e.g., graphs representing
relations in a social network may change over time, and feature vectors may be
added, removed or updated in a dataset. Therefore, it is important to
efficiently carry out the computations involved to keep up with frequent
changes in the underlying data and also to dynamically determine a reasonable
size for the subspace of interest. We present a complete computational pipeline
for efficiently updating spectral embeddings in a variety of contexts. Our
basic approach is to ""seed"" iterative methods for eigenproblems with the most
recent subspace estimate to significantly reduce the computations involved, in
contrast with a na\""ive approach which recomputes the subspace of interest from
scratch at every step. In this setting, we provide various bounds on the number
of iterations common eigensolvers need to perform in order to update the
extremal eigenspace to a sufficient tolerance. We also incorporate a criterion

mechanism that we referred to as the Controlled Loosening-up (CLuP) for

remarkable features and one of them, the \emph{computational complexity}, we
discuss in more details in this paper. As was explained in
\cite{Stojnicclupint19}, the CLuP is an iterative procedure where each
iteration amounts to solving a simple quadratic program. This clearly implies
that the key contributing factor to its overall computational complexity is the
number of iterations needed to achieve a required precision. As was also hinted
in \cite{Stojnicclupint19}, that number seems to be fairly low and in some of
the most interesting scenarios often not even larger than $10$. Here we provide
a Random Duality Theory based careful analysis that indeed indicates that a

performance. A solid set of results obtained through numerical experiments is

problem of zero current condition for ionic flows through membrane channels
with a simple profile of permanent charges.
  For ionic mixtures of multiple ion species, under equal diffusion constant
condition, Eisenberg, et al [{\em Nonlinearity {\bf 28} (2015), 103-128}]
derived a system of two equations for determining the reversal potential and an
equation for the reversal permanent charge. The equal diffusion constant
condition is significantly degenerate from physical points of view. For unequal
diffusion coefficients, the analysis becomes extremely challenging. This work
will focus only on two ion species, one positively charged (cation) and one
negatively charged (anion), with two arbitrary diffusion coefficients.
Dependence of reversal potential on channel geometry and diffusion coefficients
has been investigated experimentally, numerically, and analytically in simple
setups, in many works. In this paper, we identify two governing equations for
the zero current, which enable one to mathematically analyze how the reversal
potential depends on the channel structure and diffusion coefficients. In
particular, we are able to show, with a number of concrete results, that the
possible different diffusion constants indeed make significant differences. The
inclusion of channel structures is also far beyond the situation where the
Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation might be applicable. A comparison of our
result with the GHK equation is provided. The dual problem of reversal
permanent charges is briefly discussed too.

researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning
paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while
preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still
an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as
ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder
that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data.
Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same
scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a
self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during
training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce selfsupervision, we
leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric
supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors.
As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus
is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative
evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised

proteins identified some 'stylized facts' which contradict conventional wisdom
that increasing either the spatial distance between the electrodes or the
temperature suppresses conductance exponentially. These include nearly
temperature independent conductance over the protein in the 30-300K range,
distance independent conductance within a single-protein in the 1-10 nm range
and an anomalously large conductance in the 0.1-10 nS range. In this paper we
develop a generalization of the low temperature Landauer formula which can
account for the joint effects of tunneling and decoherence and can explain
these new experimental findings. We use novel approximations which greatly
simplify the mathematical treatment and allow us to calculate the conductance
in terms of a handful macroscopic parameters instead of the myriads of
microscopic parameters describing the details of an atomic level quantum
chemical computation. The new approach makes it possible to get predictions for
the outcomes of new experiments without relying solely on high performance
computing and can distinguish important and unimportant details of the protein
structures from the point of view of transport properties.

provide a unique source of information on the mechanical properties of a
subduction zone during the preparation of large earthquakes. Despite increasing
detection of these events in recent years, their source mechanisms are still
poorly characterised, and the relation between their magnitude and size remains
controversial. Here, we present the source characterisation of more than 10,000
low-frequency earthquakes that occurred during tremor sequences in 2012-2016
along the Nankai subduction zone in western Shikoku, Japan. We show that the
seismic moment versus corner frequency scaling for these events is compatible
with an inverse of the cube law, as widely observed for regular earthquakes.
Our result is thus consistent with shear rupture as the source mechanism for
low-frequency earthquakes, and suggests that they obey to a similar physics of
regular earthquakes, with self-similar rupture process and constant stress
drop. Furthermore, when investigating the dependence of the stress drop value
on the rupture speed, we found that low-frequency earthquakes might propagate
at lower rupture velocity than regular earthquakes, releasing smaller stress
drop.

With Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we reconstruct the surface brightness and magnetic

~550 G relatively toroidal magnetic field.
  We find that V410 Tau features a weak level of surface differential rotation
between the equator and pole ~5 times weaker than the solar differential
rotation. The spectropolarimetric data exhibit intrinsic variability, beyond
differential rotation, which points towards a dynamo-generated field rather
than a fossil field. Long-term variations in the photometric data suggest that
spots appear at increasing latitudes over the span of our dataset, implying
that, if V410 Tau has a magnetic cycle, it would have a period of more than 8
years.

the stellar activity jitter, modeled either from our Doppler maps or using
Gaussian Process Regression. Thus filtered, our RVs exclude the presence of a
hot Jupiter-mass companion below ~0.1 au, which is suggestive that hot Jupiter
formation may be inhibited by the early depletion of the circumstellar disc,

various features extracted from news articles. Secondly, given a pair of users
and their interaction history, we predict if their future engagement will
result in a conflict. We fuse textual and network-based features together using
a support vector machine which achieves an AUC of 0.89. Moreover, we implement
a graph convolutional model which exploits engagement histories of users to
predict whether a pair of users who never met each other before will have a
conflicting interaction, with an AUC of 0.69.

\cite{Stojnicclupint19} is a generic concept that can be utilized to solve a
large class of problems in polynomial time. Since it relies in its core on an
iterative procedure, the key to its excellent performance lies in a typically
very small number of iterations needed to execute the entire algorithm. In a
separate paper \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19}, we presented a detailed complexity
analysis that indeed confirms the relatively small number of iterations. Since
both papers, \cite{Stojnicclupint19} and \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19} are the
introductory papers on the topic we made sure to limit the initial discussion
just to the core of the algorithm and consequently focused only on the
algorithm's most basic version. On numerous occasions though, we emphasized
that various improvements and further upgrades are possible. In this paper we
present a first step in this direction and discuss a very simple upgrade that
can be introduced on top of the basic CLuP mechanism. It relates to the
starting of the CLuP and suggests the well-known so-called polytope-relaxation
heuristic (see, e.g. \cite{StojnicBBSD05,StojnicBBSD08}) as the starting point.
We refer to this variant of CLuP as the CLuP-plt and proceed with the
presentation of its complexity analysis. As in \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19}, a
particular \textbf{\emph{complexity analysis per iteration level}} type of
complexity analysis is chosen and presented through the algorithm's application
on the well-known MIMO ML detection problem. As expected, the analysis confirms
that CLuP-plt performs even better than the original CLuP. In some of the most
interesting regimes it often achieves within the \textbf{\emph{first three
iterations}} an excellent performance. We also complement the theoretical
findings with a solid set of numerical experiments.

aspect ratio equal to 2/3 is `optimal' in the sense that the maximally random

$\phi_{\rm MRJ} \simeq 0.73$. This value is only a few percent lower than
$\phi_{\rm DKP} = 0.76210\dots$, the packing fraction of the corresponding
densest-known crystalline (degenerate) packings. By exploiting the appreciably
reduced propensity that a system of such optimal lenses has to positionally and
orientationally order, disordered packings of them are progressively generated
by a Monte Carlo method-based procedure from the dilute equilibrium isotropic
fluid phase to the dense nonequilibrium MRJ state. This allows one to closely
monitor how the (micro)structure of these packings changes in the process of
formation of the MRJ state. The gradual changes undergone by the many
structural descriptors calculated can coherently and consistently be traced
back to the gradual increase in contacts between the hard particles until the
isostatic mean value of 10 contact neighbors per lens is reached at the
effectively hyperuniform MRJ state. Compared to the MRJ state of hard spheres,
the MRJ state of such optimal lenses is denser (less porous), more disordered,
and rattler-free. This set of characteristics makes them good glass formers. It
is possible that this conclusion may also hold for other hard convex uniaxial

growing concerns regarding privacy risks stemming from the high resolution
measurements. This has given rise to privacy protection techniques that
physically alter the consumer's energy load profile, masking private
information by using localised devices, e.g. batteries or flexible loads.
Meanwhile, there has also been increasing interest in aggregating the
distributed energy resources (DERs) of residential consumers to provide
services to the grid. In this paper, we propose an online distributed algorithm
to aggregate the DERs of privacy-conscious consumers to provide services to the
grid, whilst preserving their privacy. Results show that the optimisation
solution from the distributed method converges to one close to the optimum
computed using an ideal centralised solution method, balancing between grid
service provision, consumer preferences and privacy protection. More
importantly, the distributed method preserves consumer privacy, and does not
require high-bandwidth two-way communications infrastructure.

  of the Intelligent Data Analysis Journal, in early 2020",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) comprises tools and algorithms that allow
querying multidimensional databases. It is based on the multidimensional model,
where data can be seen as a cube such that each cell contains one or more
measures that can be aggregated along dimensions. In a Big Data scenario,
traditional data warehousing and OLAP operations are clearly not sufficient to
address current data analysis requirements, for example, social network
analysis. Furthermore, OLAP operations and models can expand the possibilities
of graph analysis beyond the traditional graph-based computation. Nevertheless,
there is not much work on the problem of taking OLAP analysis to the graph data
model. This paper proposes a formal multidimensional model for graph analysis,
that considers the basic graph data, and also background information in the
form of dimension hierarchies. The graphs in this model are node- and
edge-labelled directed multi-hypergraphs, called graphoids, which can be
defined at several different levels of granularity using the dimensions
associated with them. Operations analogous to the ones used in typical OLAP
over cubes are defined over graphoids. The paper presents a formal definition
of the graphoid model for OLAP, proves that the typical OLAP operations on
cubes can be expressed over the graphoid model, and shows that the classic data
cube model is a particular case of the graphoid data model. Finally, a case
study supports the claim that, for many kinds of OLAP-like analysis on graphs,
the graphoid model works better than the typical relational OLAP alternative,
and for the classic OLAP queries, it remains competitive.

asymptotically approaches zero at large interatomic distances. A general
procedure for constructing this modification is outlined and its relation to
the linear correction is elaborated. To benchmark this procedure, we examine
the melting phase transition and several equilibrium properties of nanosystems
made of silver, gold, and titanium. The simulations performed with the modified
potential predict higher bulk melting temperatures of the metals and agree
better with experimental values as compared to the original EAM-type potential.
Our results show that the modification works well for metals with both cubic

illustrative case study but the modification proposed is general and can be
applied to other widely-used potentials of the EAM type.

consists of a sphere with an internal moving material point (actuator); this
illustrates \emph{the recoil locomotion}. The second robot represents a sphere
moving along a thin rigid rod, this is aimed at illustrating \emph{the
deformational locomotion}. The latter appears since this motion of a sphere can
be seen as a `soliton' deformation, moving along the rod. The equations of
motion for both robots are the same, while the intervals of variables are
different. The first robot was introduced by \cite{Saffman}, who also wrote
that he was unable to find any exact solution for the deformational locomotion:
our paper fills this gap. Some previous papers emphasize that, in the cases of
locomotion, the deformations must be not axisymmetric. We consider only
axisymmetric examples, which expands the range of the involved possibilities.
The simple construction of presented robots allows us to operate with the exact
solutions only, which can play a `reference' role. Our aim is to analyse the
main notions and terminology, used in this high-impact research area.

optimisation. Quasi-Newton methods have had an enormous impact on deterministic
optimisation problems because they afford rapid convergence and computationally
attractive algorithms. In essence, this is achieved by learning the
second-order (Hessian) information based on observing first-order gradients. We
extend these ideas to the stochastic setting by employing a highly flexible
model for the Hessian and infer its value based on observing noisy gradients.
In addition, we propose a stochastic counterpart to standard line-search
procedures and demonstrate the utility of this combination on maximum
likelihood identification for general nonlinear state space models.

multiple heterogeneous robots with monotone submodular objective functions. One
of the significant challenges with the large-scale decentralised task
allocation problem is the NP-hardness for computation and communication. This
paper proposes a decentralised Decreasing Threshold Task Allocation (DTTA)
algorithm that enables parallel allocation by leveraging a decreasing threshold
to handle the NP-hardness. Then DTTA is upgraded to a more practical version
Lazy Decreasing Threshold Task Allocation (LDTTA) by combining a variant of
Lazy strategy. DTTA and LDTTA can release both computational and communicating
burden for multiple robots in a decentralised network while providing an
optimality bound of solution quality. To examine the performance of the
proposed algorithms, this paper models a multi-target surveillance scenario and
conducts Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation results reveal that the proposed
algorithms achieve similar function values but consume much less running time
and consensus steps compared with benchmark decentralised task allocation
algorithms.

MPI_Bcast() when using the local filesystem. Furthermore, since the security

either astrophysical (stars destroy lithium after BBN), nuclear (reactions
destroy lithium during BBN), or cosmological, i.e. new physics beyond the
standard BBN is responsible for destroying lithium. Here, we overview a variety
of possible cosmological solutions, and their shortcomings. On the one hand, we
examine the possibility of physical processes that modify the velocity
distribution of particles from the usually assumed Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics. A physical justification for this is an inhomogeneous spatial
distribution of domains of primordial magnetic field strength as a means to
reduce the primordial lithium abundance. Another possibility is that scattering
with the mildly relativistic electrons in the background plasma alters the
baryon distribution to one resembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution. We show that
neither of these possibilities can adequately resolve the lithium problem. A
number of alternate hybrid models are discussed including a mix of neutrino
degeneracy, unified dark matter, axion cooling, and the presence of decaying

to Hawking radiation calculations. Using some assumptions, one can then
estimate the natural widths of these states. As can be seen from a classical
paper by Bekenstein and Mukhanov, the ratio between width and spacing of
nonspinning black hole states approaches a small constant, which seems to
confirm the claim. However, we find that, including the effect of black hole
spin, the natural widths increase. To properly address any claim about
astrophysical black holes, one should examine the spinning case, as real black
holes spin. Thus, the word spinning is key to the question of whether or not
black holes should have an observable spectrum in nature. Our results suggest
that it should be possible to distinguish between any scenarios for which the
answer to this question is yes. However, for all of the commonly discussed
scenarios, our answer is almost certainly no.

optimization is objective perturbation. This technique augments a given
optimization problem (e.g. deriving from an ERM problem) with a random linear
term, and then exactly solves it. However, to date, analyses of this approach
crucially rely on the convexity and smoothness of the objective function,
limiting its generality. We give two algorithms that extend this approach
substantially. The first algorithm requires nothing except boundedness of the
loss function, and operates over a discrete domain. Its privacy and accuracy
guarantees hold even without assuming convexity. This gives an oracle-efficient
optimization algorithm over arbitrary discrete domains that is comparable in
its generality to the exponential mechanism. The second algorithm operates over
a continuous domain and requires only that the loss function be bounded and
Lipschitz in its continuous parameter. Its privacy analysis does not require
convexity. Its accuracy analysis does require convexity, but does not require
second order conditions like smoothness. Even without convexity, this algorithm
can be generically used as an oracle-efficient optimization algorithm, with
accuracy evaluated empirically. We complement our theoretical results with an
empirical evaluation of the non-convex case, in which we use an integer program
solver as our optimization oracle. We find that for the problem of learning
linear classifiers, directly optimizing for 0/1 loss using our approach can
out-perform the more standard approach of privately optimizing a
convex-surrogate loss function on the Adult dataset.

observe different variables with data from a domain in which the distinct
variable sets might well be related. This sort of fragmentation sometimes
occurs in molecular biology, whether in studies of RNA expression or studies of
protein interaction, and it is common in the social sciences. Models are built
on the diverse data sets, but combining them can provide a more unified account
of the causal processes in the domain. On the other hand, this problem is made
challenging by the fact that a variable in one data set may influence variables
in another although neither data set contains all of the variables involved.
Several authors have proposed using conditional independence properties of
fragmentary (marginal) data collections to form unified causal explanations
when it is assumed that the data have a common causal explanation but cannot be
merged to form a unified dataset. These methods typically return a large number
of alternative causal models. The first part of the thesis shows that marginal
datasets contain extra information that can be used to reduce the number of
possible models, in some cases yielding a unique model.

$m=O(c\,\lambda\,\varepsilon^{-2}\text{poly}\log1/\varepsilon\delta)$ rows,
which preserves the norm $\|Mx\|_2=(1\pm\varepsilon)\|x\|_2$ of all $x$ in any
given $\lambda$ dimensional subspace of $ R^d$ with probability at least
$1-\delta$. This matrix can be applied to tensors $x^{(1)}\otimes\dots\otimes
x^{(c)}\in R^{d^c}$ in $O(c\, m \min\{d,m\})$ time -- hence the name ""Tensor
Sketch"". (Here $x\otimes y = \text{asvec}(xy^T) = [x_1y_1,
x_1y_2,\dots,x_1y_m,x_2y_1,\dots,x_ny_m]\in R^{nm}$.)
  This improves upon earlier Tensor Sketch constructions by Pagh and Pham~[TOCT
2013, SIGKDD 2013] and Avron et al.~[NIPS 2014] which require
$m=\Omega(3^c\lambda^2\delta^{-1})$ rows for the same guarantees. The factors
of $\lambda$, $\varepsilon^{-2}$ and $\log1/\delta$ can all be shown to be
necessary making our sketch optimal up to log factors.
  With another construction we get $\lambda$ times more rows $m=\tilde
O(c\,\lambda^2\,\varepsilon^{-2}(\log1/\delta)^3)$, but the matrix can be
applied to any vector $x^{(1)}\otimes\dots\otimes x^{(c)}\in R^{d^c}$ in just
$\tilde O(c\, (d+m))$ time. This matches the application time of Tensor Sketch
while still improving the exponential dependencies in $c$ and $\log1/\delta$.
  Technically, we show two main lemmas: (1) For many Johnson Lindenstrauss (JL)
constructions, if $Q,Q'\in R^{m\times d}$ are independent JL matrices, the
element-wise product $Qx \circ Q'y$ equals $M(x\otimes y)$ for some $M\in
R^{m\times d^2}$ which is itself a JL matrix. (2) If $M^{(i)}\in R^{m\times
md}$ are independent JL matrices, then $M^{(1)}(x \otimes (M^{(2)}y \otimes
\dots)) = M(x\otimes y\otimes \dots)$ for some $M\in R^{m\times d^c}$ which is
itself a JL matrix. Combining these two results give an efficient sketch for
tensors of any size.

The key idea is to iteratively improve a correction to a nominal model of the

simulations with the learned correction to more accurately predict the behavior
of a given soft object. Space-time optimization is employed to identify gentle
control forces with which we extract necessary data for model inference and to
finally encapsulate the material correction into a compact parametric form.
Furthermore, a patch based position constraint is proposed to tackle the
challenge of handling incomplete and noisy observations arising in real-world

synthetic examples, as well with data captured from real world homogeneous
elastic objects.

current and previous information. However, the exploration of different
importance levels of different elements within an input vector is always
ignored. We propose a simple yet effective Element-wise-Attention Gate
(EleAttG), which can be easily added to an RNN block (e.g. all RNN neurons in
an RNN layer), to empower the RNN neurons to have attentiveness capability. For
an RNN block, an EleAttG is used for adaptively modulating the input by
assigning different levels of importance, i.e., attention, to each
element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN block equipped with an
EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Instead of modulating the input as a whole, the
EleAttG modulates the input at fine granularity, i.e., element-wise, and the
modulation is content adaptive. The proposed EleAttG, as an additional
fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN structures, e.g.,
standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EleAtt-RNN by applying it to
different tasks including the action recognition, from both skeleton-based data

Experiments show that adding attentiveness through EleAttGs to RNN blocks
significantly improves the power of RNNs.

Kuznetsov et al. (1994) to investigate the effect of nonlinear interactions
between tumour and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment, whereby immune
cells may induce tumour cell death, and tumour cells may inactivate immune
cells. Exploiting a separation of timescales in the model, we use the method of
matched asymptotics to derive a new two-dimensional, long-timescale,
approximation of the full model, which differs from the quasi-steady-state
approximation introduced by Kuznetsov et al. (1994), but is validated against
numerical solutions of the full model. Through a phase-plane analysis, we show
that our reduced model is excitable, a feature not traditionally associated
with tumour-immune dynamics. Through a systematic parameter sensitivity
analysis, we demonstrate that excitability generates complex bifurcating
dynamics in the model. These are consistent with a variety of clinically
observed phenomena, and suggest that excitability may underpin tumour-immune
interactions. The model exhibits the three stages of immunoediting -
elimination, equilibrium, and escape, via stable steady states with different
tumour cell concentrations. Such heterogeneity in tumour cell numbers can stem
from variability in initial conditions and/or model parameters that control the
properties of the immune system and its response to the tumour. We identify
different biophysical parameter targets that could be manipulated with
immunotherapy in order to control tumour size, and we find that preferred
strategies may differ between patients depending on the strength of their
immune systems, as determined by patient-specific values of associated model

difficult, as the discriminative features are inherently hard to identify and
interpret. We address this by presenting the ""Illuminated Decision Tree""
approach, in which we use a neural network trained on the task as a feature
extractor, then learn a decision tree based on these features, and provide
Lucid visualizations for each node in the tree. We demonstrate our approach
with several examples, showing how this approach could be useful both in model
development and debugging, and when explaining model outputs to non-experts.

cascading failures, which make it challenging to assess the attack
vulnerability of power grids. In this Brief, we define the $K$-link attack
problem and study the attack vulnerability of power grids under cascading
failures. Particularly, we propose a link centrality measure based on both
topological and electrical properties of power grids. According to this
centrality, we propose a greedy attack algorithm and an optimal attack
algorithm. Simulation results on standard IEEE bus test data show that the
optimal attack is better than the greedy attack and the traditional PSO-based
attack in fracturing power grids. Moreover, the greedy attack has smaller
computational complexity than the optimal attack and the PSO-based attack with
an adequate attack efficiency. Our work helps to understand the vulnerability
of power grids and provides some clues for securing power grids.

is violated in the presence of gravity with space-time translational gauge
symmetry in inertial frames. For a light ray, an eikonal equation with
effective metric tensors is derived in the geometric-optics limit. Under these
conditions, the angle of the deflection of light by the sun is calculated to be
$\d \phi \approx 1.75''$ in inertial frames without requiring a gauge condition
such as $\p_\mu A^\mu=0$. In contrast, if the theory is $U_1$ gauge invariant,
one can impose the gauge condition $\p_\mu A^\mu=0$ in the derivation of the
eikonal equation. In this case, one obtains a slightly different effective
metric tensor and a different angle of deflection $\d \phi \approx 1.52''$.
However, because the precision of experiments in the last century using optical
frequencies has been no better than (10 $-$ 20)\% due to large systematic
errors, one cannot unambiguously rule out the result $\d \phi \approx 1.52'$.
It is hoped that the precision of these data can be improved in order to test
Yang-Mills gravity.

importance of individuals and their interactions in real-world complex systems.
Several graph theoretical measures have been introduced to access importance of
the individual in systems represented by networks. Particularly, eigenvector
centrality (EC) measure has been very popular due to its ability in measuring
importance of the nodes based on not only number of interactions they acquire
but also particular structural positions they have in the networks.
Furthermore, the presence of certain structural features, such as the existence
of high degree nodes in a network is recognized to induce localization
transition of the principal eigenvector (PEV) of the network's adjacency
matrix. Localization of PEV has been shown to cause difficulties in assigning
centrality weights to the nodes based on the EC. We revisit PEV localization
and its relation with failure of EC problem, and by using simple model networks
demonstrate that in addition to the localization of the PEV, the delocalization
of PEV may also create difficulties for using EC as a measure to rank the
nodes. Our investigation while providing fundamental insight to the relation
between PEV localization and centrality of nodes in networks, suggests that for
the networks having delocalized PEVs, it is better to use degree centrality
measure to rank the nodes.

fluorescence microscopy to localize the nucleus inside the quantitative phase
map of the cell, as well as for measuring the nucleus radii. As verified
offline by both 3-D confocal fluorescence microscopy and by 2-D fluorescence
microscopy while rotating the cells during flow, the nucleus of cells in
suspension that are not during division can be assumed to be an ellipsoid. The
entire shape of a cell in suspension can be assumed to be a sphere. Then, the
cell and nucleus 3-D shapes can be evaluated based on their in-plain radii
available from the 2-D phase and fluorescent measurements, respectively.
Finally, the nucleus integral refractive index profile is calculated. We
demonstrate the new technique on cancer cells, obtaining nucleus refractive
index values that are lower than those of the cytoplasm, coinciding with recent
findings. We believe that the proposed technique has the potential to be used
for flow cytometry, where full 3-D refractive index tomography is too slow to
be implemented during flow.

  Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations","Accepted at MMSports 2019 (Workshop of ACM Multimedia 2019)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The chances to win a football match can be significantly increased if the
right tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is well
anticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a team
of game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is done
manually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools to
support the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the main
tasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2. In this paper,
we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizes
the team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on single
match situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a more
detailed analysis. A detailed analysis of individual match situations depending
on ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, a
visual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a match
segment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1) the
complexity of the task and 2) the usefulness of the visualization of single
situations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approach
outperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, our
approach gives insights about the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 to
describe team formations.
