thin film solar cells are due in particular to the large diffusion length of
photocarriers. The mechanism behind this property and its dependence on the
various anions and cations in the LHP material composition are still an active
topic of debate. Here, we apply ultrabroadband terahertz spectroscopy with a
time resolution < 200 fs to probe the early carrier mobility dynamics of
photoexcited perovskite samples of different chemical compositions. An increase
in the carrier mobility with time constants in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 ps is
observed for different LHPs, in which the signal amplitude is larger at shorter
excitation wavelengths. This feature is assigned to the relaxation of hot
carriers from low-curvature regions of the band structure to the bottom of the
valley, where their effective mass accounts for the maximum mobility. The
dependence of the mobility dynamics on the initial photogenerated carrier
population shows that carrier cooling competes with a dynamic screening effect
associated with polaron formation and relaxation. A kinetic model that
considers all competing processes is proposed. Simulations based on this model
allow us to fit the experimental data well and evidence a composition
dependence of the dynamic screening lifetime.

Benefits are measured in terms of relative reputation that users receives from

Costs relate to the effort to login, to maintain the profile, etc. and are

entry and exit of users over time. Intuitively, one would expect that higher
costs lead to more users leaving and hence to a less robust OSN. We demonstrate
that an optimal cost level exists, which maximizes both the performance of the
OSN, measured by means of the long-term average benefit of its users, and the
robustness of the OSN, measured by means of the life-time of the core of the

corresponding depth map from a given single RGB image. Recent deep learning
models have been proposed to predict the depth from the image by learning the
alignment of deep features between the RGB image and the depth domains. In this
paper, we present a novel approach, named Structure-Attentioned Memory Network,
to more effectively transfer domain features for monocular depth estimation by
taking into account the common structure regularities (e.g., repetitive
structure patterns, planar surfaces, symmetries) in domain adaptation. To this
end, we introduce a new Structure-Oriented Memory (SOM) module to learn and
memorize the structure-specific information between RGB image domain and the
depth domain. More specifically, in the SOM module, we develop a Memorable Bank
of Filters (MBF) unit to learn a set of filters that memorize the
structure-aware image-depth residual pattern, and also an Attention Guided
Controller (AGC) unit to control the filter selection in the MBF given image
features queries. Given the query image feature, the trained SOM module is able
to adaptively select the best customized filters for cross-domain feature
transferring with an optimal structural disparity between image and depth. In
summary, we focus on addressing this structure-specific domain adaption
challenge by proposing a novel end-to-end multi-scale memorable network for
monocular depth estimation. The experiments show that our proposed model
demonstrates the superior performance compared to the existing supervised
monocular depth estimation approaches on the challenging KITTI and NYU Depth V2

  Methods: Scrutinize the astrometric and photometric data (from Hipparcos and

  Results: A star cluster of about 100 members is discovered, nicely centered
on $\beta$~Lyrae in 5 dimensions. There are clear indications that the newly
discovered cluster belongs to a larger old (extinct) star formation complex,

remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) attracts increasing attention in the
remote sensing field. In general, existing retrieval methods can be regarded as
visual-based retrieval approaches which search and return a set of similar
images from a database to a given query image. Although retrieval methods have
achieved great success, there is still a question that needs to be responded
to: Can we obtain the accurate semantic labels of the returned similar images
to further help analyzing and processing imagery? Inspired by the above
question, in this paper, we redefine the image retrieval problem as visual and
semantic retrieval of images. Specifically, we propose a novel deep hashing
convolutional neural network (DHCNN) to simultaneously retrieve the similar
images and classify their semantic labels in a unified framework. In more
detail, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract
high-dimensional deep features. Then, a hash layer is perfectly inserted into
the network to transfer the deep features into compact hash codes. In addition,
a fully connected layer with a softmax function is performed on hash layer to
generate class distribution. Finally, a loss function is elaborately designed
to simultaneously consider the label loss of each image and similarity loss of
pairs of images. Experimental results on two remote sensing datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-art retrieval and
classification performance.

the phase speed of a wave relative to the mean flow matches a natural internal

similar to that of a classical critical layer, characterized by the secular
growth of flow perturbations over a region of decreasing width. By using
matched asymptotic expansions, we construct a nonlinear baroclinic critical
layer theory to study how the flow perturbation evolves once they enter the
nonlinear regime. A key feature of the theory is that, because the location of
the baroclinic critical layer is determined by the streamwise wavenumber, the
nonlinear dynamics filters out harmonics and the modification to the mean flow
controls the evolution. At late times, we show that the vorticity begins to
focus into yet smaller regions whose width decreases exponentially with time,

create a drifting coherent structure. Jet-like defects in the mean horizontal
velocity are the main outcome of the critical-layer dynamics.

stochasticity in turn leads to disalignments of the coarse-grained fields at
smaller scales thus they average to weaker fields at larger scales upon
coarse-graining. The field's resistance against tanglement by the turbulence
may lead at some point to its sudden slippage through the fluid, decreasing the
stochasticity and increasing the energy density. Thus the maxima (minima) of
magnetic stochasticity are expected to approximately coincide with the minima
(maxima) of energy density, occurrence of which corresponds to slippage of the
magnetic field through the fluid. Field-fluid slippage, on the other hand, has
been already found to be intimately related to magnetic reconnection. In this
paper, we test these theoretical predictions numerically using a homogeneous,
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Apart from expected small
scale deviations, possibly due to e.g., intermittency and strong field
annihilation, the theoretically predicted global relationship between
stochasticity and magnetic energy is observed in different sub-volumes of the
simulation box. This may indicate ubiquitous local field-fluid slippage and
small scale reconnection events in MHD turbulence. We also show that the
maximum magnetic stochasticity, i.e., \partial_t S(t)=0 & \partial^2_t S(t)<0,
leads to sudden increases in kinetic stochasticity level which may correspond
to fluid jets driven by the reconnecting field lines, i.e., reconnection. This
suggests a new mathematical approach to the reconnection problem.

NGC 628. We combine the HST LEGUS database of over 1000 stellar clusters in NGC
628 with ALMA Cycle 4 millimeter/submillimeter observations of the cold dust
continuum that span ~15 square kpc including the nuclear region and western
portions of the galaxy's disk. The resolution -- 1.1"" or approximately 50 pc at
the distance of NGC 628 -- allows us to constrain the spatial variations in the
slope of the millimeter dust continuum as a function of the ages and masses of
the nearby stellar clusters. Our results indicate an excess of dust emission in
the millimeter assuming a typical cold dust model for a normal star-forming
galaxy, but little correlation of the dust continuum slope with stellar cluster
age or mass. For the depth and spatial coverage of these observations, we
cannot substantiate the millimeter/submillimeter excess arising from the
processing of dust grains by the local interstellar radiation field. We detect
a bright unknown source in NGC 628 in ALMA bands 4 and 7 with no counterparts
at other wavelengths from ancillary data. We speculate this is possibly a dust
obscured supernova.

First two authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A core capability of intelligent systems is the ability to quickly learn new
tasks by drawing on prior experience. Gradient (or optimization) based
meta-learning has recently emerged as an effective approach for few-shot
learning. In this formulation, meta-parameters are learned in the outer loop,
while task-specific models are learned in the inner-loop, by using only a small
amount of data from the current task. A key challenge in scaling these
approaches is the need to differentiate through the inner loop learning
process, which can impose considerable computational and memory burdens. By
drawing upon implicit differentiation, we develop the implicit MAML algorithm,
which depends only on the solution to the inner level optimization and not the
path taken by the inner loop optimizer. This effectively decouples the
meta-gradient computation from the choice of inner loop optimizer. As a result,
our approach is agnostic to the choice of inner loop optimizer and can
gracefully handle many gradient steps without vanishing gradients or memory
constraints. Theoretically, we prove that implicit MAML can compute accurate
meta-gradients with a memory footprint that is, up to small constant factors,
no more than that which is required to compute a single inner loop gradient and
at no overall increase in the total computational cost. Experimentally, we show
that these benefits of implicit MAML translate into empirical gains on few-shot
image recognition benchmarks.

describe natural interference patterns. As an illustrative example of
contemporary interest, we consider astrophysical plasma lensing of coherent
sources like pulsars and fast radio bursts in radioastronomy. Plasma lenses are
known to occur near the source, in the interstellar medium, as well as in the
solar wind and the earth's ionosphere. Such lensing is strongest at long
wavelengths hence it is generally important to go beyond geometric optics and
into the full wave optics regime. Our computational method is a spinoff of new
techniques two of us, and our collaborators, have developed for defining and
performing Lorentzian path integrals. Cauchy's theorem allows one to transform
a computationally fragile and expensive, highly oscillatory integral into an
exactly equivalent sum of absolutely and rapidly convergent integrals which can
be evaluated in polynomial time. We require only that it is possible to
analytically continue the lensing phase, expressed in the integrated
coordinates, into the complex domain. We give a first-principles derivation of
the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral, starting from Feynman's path integral for a
massless particle in a refractive medium. We then demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method by computing the interference patterns of Thom's caustic
catastrophes, both in their ""normal forms"" and within a variety of more
realistic, local lens models, over all wavelengths. Our numerical method,
implemented in a freely downloadable code, provides a fast, accurate tool for
modeling interference patterns in radioastronomy and other fields of physics.

$b\geq 0$, making it likelier to repeat the step again in the future. A

microwave background photons at $z\sim 17$. This requires that the spin
temperature of HI be coupled to the kinetic temperature of the gas at this $z$
through the scattering of Ly-$\alpha$ photons emitted by massive stars. To
explain the experimental result, star formation needs to be sufficiently
efficient at $z\sim 17$ and this can be used to constrain models in which
small-scale structure formation is suppressed (DMF models), either due to dark
matter free-streaming or non-standard inflationary dynamics. We combine
simulations of structure formation with a simple recipe for star formation to
investigate whether these models emit enough Ly-$\alpha$ photons to reproduce
the experimental signal for reasonable values of the star formation efficiency,
$f_\star$. We find that a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) model with mass
$m_\mathrm{WDM}\sim 4.3\,\mathrm{keV}$ is consistent with the timing of the
signal for $f_\star\lesssim 2\%$. The exponential growth of structure around
$z\sim 17$ in such a model naturally generates a sharp onset of the absorption.
A warmer model with $m_\mathrm{WDM}\sim 3\,\mathrm{keV}$ requires a higher star
formation efficiency, $f_\star\sim 6\%$, which is a factor of few above
predictions of current star formation models and observations of satellites in
the Milky Way. However, uncertainties in the process of star formation at these
$z$ do not allow to derive strong constrains on such models using 21-cm

antiferromagnetically coupled quantum spin-1 dimers, which are stacked in the
triangular lattice geometry forming a bilayer. Low-energy properties of this
model is described by an $\mathcal{S}=1$ hard-core bosonic degrees of freedom
defined on each dimer-bond, where the singlet and triplet states of the
dimerized spins are interpreted as the vacuum and the occupancy of boson,
respectively. The number of bosons per dimer and the magnetic and density
fluctuations of bosons are controlled by the inter-dimer Heisenberg
interactions. In a solid phase where each dimer hosts one boson and the
inter-dimer interaction is weak, a conventional spin nematic phase is realized
by the pair-fluctuation of bosons. Larger inter-dimer interaction favors Bose
Einstein condensates (BEC) carrying quadrupolar moments. Among them, we find
one exotic phase where the quadrupoles develop a spatially modulated structure
on the top of a uniform BEC, interpreted in the original dimerized spin-1 model
as coexistent $p$-type nematic and 120$^\circ$-magnetic correlations. This may
explain an intriguing nonmagnetic phase found in Ba$_{3}$ZnRu$_{2}$O$_{9}$.

structural features of complex materials. The characterization of amorphous
materials is especially challenging because their lack of long-range order
makes it difficult to define structural metrics. In this work, we apply deep
learning algorithms to accurately classify amorphous materials and characterize
their structural features. Specifically, we show that convolutional neural
networks and message passing neural networks can classify two-dimensional
liquids and liquid-cooled glasses from molecular dynamics simulations with
greater than 0.98 AUC, with no a priori assumptions about local particle
relationships, even when the liquids and glasses are prepared at the same
inherent structure energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that message passing
neural networks surpass convolutional neural networks in this context in both
accuracy and interpretability. We extract a clear interpretation of how message
passing neural networks evaluate liquid and glass structures by using a
self-attention mechanism. Using this interpretation, we derive three novel
structural metrics that accurately characterize glass formation. The methods
presented here provide us with a procedure to identify important structural
features in materials that could be missed by standard techniques and give us a
unique insight into how these neural networks process data.

choices of eccentricities and semi-major axes. Using these results, we can
predict which precisions and lattice constants allow for a detection of the

magnetic moment is particularly interesting since it is equal to the magnetic
moment of the charm quark. The measurements of the magnetic moments of other
charm baryons, such as $\Xi_c$, allow to perform detailed spectroscopy studies.
The magnetic moment of the $\Lambda_c$ can be determined using radiative
charmonium decay and the present results show a tension with majority of
theoretical predictions. As recently pointed out, the magnetic moment of the
charm baryons can be directly measured using bent-crystal experiments at LHC.
The possibility of precisely measure the magnetic moments of charm baryons
needs precise measurement of their polarisation and weak decay parameters. In
this paper, we revisit the formalism of the angular analysis needed for these
measurements and make a detailed evaluation of initial polarisation of
deflected $\Lambda_c$ baryons as a function of crystal orientation. We found a
special orientation of the crystal that gives the opportunity to measure the
$\Lambda_c$ dimensionless electric dipole moment almost with the same precision
as its $g$-factor, which is more than an order of magnitude more efficient than
suggested before. In conclusion, we stress the importance to perform precise
measurements of initial polarisation and weak decay parameters of $\Lambda_c$

Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$, an analysis of the electronic structure, orbital
components, Fermi surfaces and band topology could be helpful to understand the
mechanism of its superconductivity. Based on the first-principles calculations,
we find that Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ states contribute the largest Fermi surface.
$Ln~5d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states form an electron pocket at $\Gamma$, while $5d_{xy}$
states form a relatively bigger electron pocket at A. These Fermi surfaces and
symmetry characteristics can be reproduced by our two-band model, which
consists of two elementary band representations: $B_{1g}@1a~\oplus~A_{1g}@1b$.
We find that there is a band inversion near A, giving rise to a pair of Dirac
points along A--M below the Fermi level once including spin-orbit coupling.
Furthermore, we have performed the LDA+Gutzwiller calculations to treat the
strong correlation effect of Ni 3d orbitals. In particular, the bandwidth of
$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ has been renormalized largely. After the renormalization of the
correlated bands, the Ni $3d_{xy}$ states and the Dirac points become very
close to the Fermi level. Thus, a hole pocket at A could be introduced by hole
doping, which may be related to the observed sign change of Hall coefficient.
By introducing an additional Ni $3d_{xy}$ orbital, the hole-pocket band and the
band inversion can be captured in our modified model. Besides, the nontrivial
band topology in the ferromagnetic two-layer compound La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ is
discussed and the band inversion is associated with Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and La

fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only
between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows
simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. Arepo is a
massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the Message Passing Interface
(MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical work-load and memory
balancing scheme to allow optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The
employed parallelization algorithms of Arepo are deterministic and produce
binary-identical results when re-run on the same machine and with the same
number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is
included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of
galaxy formation. Arepo also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive
test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to
scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is
extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new
scientific users.

an out-of-equilibrium, feeble connection to the hotter standard model (SM)

renormalizable, the colder sector undergoes an extended phase of non-adiabatic
evolution largely independent of initial conditions, which we dub ""leak-in."" We
discuss the leak-in phase in generality, and establish the general properties
of dark matter that freezes out from a radiation bath undergoing such a leak-in

out-of-equilibrium B-L vector portal interaction with a minimal hidden sector.
We discuss the interplay between leak-in and freezein processes in this theory

both sightlines at distance ~ 480 kpc. The absorption strength associated with
the groups is higher than what has been reported for more isolated galaxies of
comparable mass and impact parameters. We do not find evidence for widespread
cool gas giving rise to strong absorption within these groups. Combining these
results with the distribution of neutral and ionised gas seen in emission in
lower-redshift groups, we conclude that gravitational interactions in the group

boosting the cross section of cool gas and leading to the high fraction of
strong MgII absorbers that we detect.

transforming it into ""invisible"" planetesimals. We performed a one-dimensional

of 'changing-look' active galactic nuclei (AGN), if we can establish that these
two black hole accretion phenomena are analogous. Previously, studies of the
correlation between the UV-to-X-ray spectral index alpha_OX and Eddington ratio
using single-epoch observations of changing-look AGN samples have revealed
possible similarities to the spectral evolution of outbursting X-ray binaries.
However, direct comparisons using multi-epoch UV/X-ray light curves of
individual changing-look AGN undergoing dramatic changes in Eddington ratio
have been scarce. Here, we use published Swift UV/X-ray light curves of two
changing-look AGN (NGC 2617 and ZTF18aajupnt) to examine the evolution of their
alpha_OX values during outburst. We show that the combination of these two
changing-look AGN can trace out the predicted spectral evolution from X-ray
binary outbursts, including the inversion in the evolution of alpha_OX as a
function of Eddington ratio. We suggest that the spectral softening that is
observed to occur below a critical Eddington ratio in both AGN and X-ray
binaries is due to reprocessing of Comptonized X-ray emission by the accretion
disk, based on the X-ray to UV reverberation lags previously observed in NGC
2617. Our results suggest that the physical processes causing the changing-look
AGN phenomenon are similar to those in X-ray binary outbursts.

radioactive process can produce barium ions or atoms in xenon at significant
rates. In xenon gas, the barium daughter most likely survives as a dication. An
approach under development by the NEXT collaboration involves transporting this
ion from the active medium onto a coated transparent plane supporting a
barium-sensitive fluorescent dye, monitored via fluorescence microscopy. Upon
exposure to a barium dication, the dye will begin fluorescing, which, when
correlated with the detection of a double electron signal at the anode, would
confirm double beta decay.Our results have shown that a single barium ion can
be resolved via Single Molecule Fluorescent Imaging (SMFI). The next challenge

of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images,
there exists a large variety of steganography techniques. Some are more complex
than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Many
applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information. This
paper intends to give an overview of image steganography, it's usage and
techniques, basically, to store the confidential information within images such
as details of working strategy, secret missions, criminal and confidential
information in various organizations that work for the national security such
as army, police, FBI, secret service etc. We develop a desktop application that

as this practice tries to address two difficult and inherently different
problems at the same time: identifying true blending pixels inside the trimap
region, and estimate accurate alpha values for them. We propose AdaMatting, a
new end-to-end matting framework that disentangles this problem into two
sub-tasks: trimap adaptation and alpha estimation. Trimap adaptation is a
pixel-wise classification problem that infers the global structure of the input
image by identifying definite foreground, background, and semi-transparent
image regions. Alpha estimation is a regression problem that calculates the
opacity value of each blended pixel. Our method separately handles these two
sub-tasks within a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Extensive
experiments show that AdaMatting has additional structure awareness and trimap
fault-tolerance. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Adobe

and timing properties through the initial hard state of the outburst. We show
that the inner accretion disc, as measured by relativistic reflection, remains
steady throughout this period of the outburst. Nevertheless, subtle spectral
variability is observed, which is well explained by a change in coronal
geometry. However, characteristic features of the temporal variability -
low-frequency roll-over and QPO frequency - increase drastically in frequency,
as the outburst proceeds. This suggests that the variability timescales are
governed by coronal conditions rather than solely by the inner disc radius. We
also find a strong correlation between X-ray luminosity and coronal

effective radius and a non-thermal electron fraction of ~20%.

the signal is too weak to detect in individual galaxies, we analyze the
feasibility of its statistical detection via stacking CMB data on many galaxies
for which the spin orientation can be estimated spectroscopically. We use an
""optimistic"" model, in which fully ionized atmospheres contain the cosmic
baryon fraction and spin at the halo's circular velocity $v_{\rm circ}$, and a
more realistic model, based on hydrodynamical simulations, with multi-phase
atmospheres spinning at a fraction of $v_{\rm circ}$. We incorporate realistic
noise estimates into our analysis.
  Using low-redshift galaxy properties from the MaNGA spectroscopic survey
(with median halo mass of $6.6\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$), and CMB data quality
from Planck, we find that a $3\sigma$ detection would require a few$\times
10^4$ galaxies, even in the optimistic model. This is too high for current
surveys, but upcoming higher-angular resolution CMB experiments will
significantly reduce the requirements: stacking CMB data on galaxy spins in a
$\sim10$ deg$^2$ can rule out the optimistic models, and $\approx$350 deg$^2$
will suffice for a $3\sigma$ detection with ACT.
  As a proof-of-concept, we stacked Planck data on the position of

hole shadows using the Majumdar-Papapetrou static binary black hole (or
di-hole) solution. It is shown that the propagation of null geodesics on this
spacetime background is a natural example of chaotic scattering. We demonstrate
that the binary black hole shadows exhibit a self-similar fractal structure
akin to the Cantor set. Next, we use techniques from the field of non-linear
dynamics to quantify these fractal structures in binary black hole shadows.
Using a recently developed numerical algorithm, called the merging method, we
demonstrate that parts of the Majumdar-Papapetrou di-hole shadow may possess
the Wada property. We then study the existence, stability and phenomenology of
circular photon orbits in stationary axisymmetric four-dimensional spacetimes.
We employ a Hamiltonian formalism to describe the null geodesics of the
Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou geometry. Using the Einstein-Maxwell equations, we
demonstrate that generic stable photon orbits are forbidden in pure vacuum, but
may arise in electrovacuum. Finally, we apply a higher-order geometric optics
formalism to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves on Kerr
spacetime. Using the symmetries of Kerr spacetime, we construct a complex null
tetrad which is parallel-propagated along null geodesics; we introduce a system
of transport equations to calculate certain Newman-Penrose quantities along
rays; we derive generalised power series solutions to these transport equations
through sub-leading order in the neighbourhood of caustic points; and we
introduce a practical method to evolve the transport equations beyond caustic

X-ray spectrum is ultra-soft and can be described by accretion disc emission
with luminosity proportional to the fourth power of the disc temperature during
long-term evolution. Here we report observations of X-ray quasi-periodic
eruptions from the nucleus of GSN 069 over the course of 54 days, 2018 December

orders of magnitude with event duration of just over 1 hour and recurrence time

5x10$^{42}$ ergs per second. The warm phase has a temperature of about 120 eV,

repeated linear-quadratic games. We experimentally benchmark our algorithm in

been used extensively to constrain the sites of nucleosynthesis with
sophisticated libraries of stellar evolution and stellar yields. The metal
mixing included in these models is usually highly simplified, although it is
likely to be a significant driver of abundance evolution. In this work we use
high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how metals from
individual enrichment events with varying source energies $E_{\rm ej}$ mix
throughout the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a low-mass ($M_{\rm
gas}=2\times 10^{6}$~M$_{\odot}$), low-metallicity, isolated dwarf galaxy.
These events correspond to the characteristic energies of both common and
exotic astrophysical sites of nucleosynthesis, including: asymptotic giant
branch winds ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{46}$~erg), neutron star-neutron star mergers
($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{49}$~erg), supernovae ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{51}$~erg),
and hypernovae ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{52}$~erg). We find the mixing timescales
for individual enrichment sources in our dwarf galaxy to be long
(100~Myr--1~Gyr), with a clear trend of increasing homogeneity for the more
energetic events. Given these timescales, we conclude that the spatial
distribution and frequency of events are important drivers of abundance
homogeneity on large scales; rare, low $E_{\rm ej}$ events should be
characterized by particularly broad abundance distributions. The source energy
$E_{\rm ej}$ also correlates with the fraction of metals ejected in galactic
winds, ranging anywhere from 60\% at the lowest energy to 95\% for hypernovae.
We conclude by examining how the radial position, local ISM density, and global
star formation rate influence these results.

For a given observable fact in an image (e.g. the balloon's color), we generate
a set of logically consistent question-answer (QA) pairs (e.g. Is the balloon
red?) and also collect a human-annotated set of common-sense based consistent
QA pairs (e.g. Is the balloon the same color as tomato sauce?). Further, we

which Varuna has a simple triaxial shape, assuming that the main effect comes
from the change of the aspect angle as seen from Earth, due to Varuna's orbital
motion in the 19-year time span. The best fits to the data correspond to a
family of solutions with axial ratios b/a between 0.56 and 0.60. This
constrains the pole orientation in two different ranges of solutions presented

detected changes in the overall shape of the rotational light-curve over

divide a spherical surface into equal-area cells. The method is based on
dividing a sphere into latitudinal rings of near-constant width with further
splitting each ring into equal-area cells. It is simple in construction and
use, and provides more uniform width of the latitudinal rings than other
methods of equal-area pixelization of a spherical surface. The new method
provides a rectangular grid cells with the latitude- and longitude-oriented
boundaries, near-square cells in the equatorial rings, and the closest to
uniform width of the latitudinal rings as compared with other equal-area
isolatitudinal grids. The binned data is easy to visualize and interpret in
terms of the longitude-latitude rectangular coordinate system, natural for
astronomy and geodesy. Grids with arbitrary number of rings and, consequently,
wide and theoretically unlimited range of cell size can be built by the
proposed method. Comparison with other methods used in astronomical research
showed the advantages of the new approach in sense of uniformity of the ring
width, a wider range of grid resolution, and simplicity of use.

Machine learning models, including neural networks, are able to represent a
wide range of distributions and build optimized mappings between a large number
of inputs and sub-grid forcings. Recent research on machine learning
parameterizations has focused only on deterministic parameterizations. In this
study, we develop a stochastic parameterization using the generative

parameterization is trained and evaluated on output from the Lorenz '96 model,
which is a common baseline model for evaluating both parameterization and data
assimilation techniques. We evaluate different ways of characterizing the input
noise for the model and perform model runs with the GAN parameterization at
weather and climate timescales. Some of the GAN configurations perform better
than a baseline bespoke parameterization at both timescales, and the networks
closely reproduce the spatio-temporal correlations and regimes of the Lorenz

the passengers are positioned at the same origin location (e.g. an airport),
and each have a different destination. One of the major issues in a shared ride
is fairly splitting of the ride cost among the passengers.
  In this paper we use the Shapley value, which is one of the most significant

a shared ride. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario there exists a
fixed priority order in which the passengers are dropped-off (e.g. elderly,

value in this setting. Our results are also applicable for efficient
computation of the Shapley value in routing games.

largest variations occur on the clump-to-clump scale, echoing similar recent

complex multiscale media possessing multi-continuum background. As an effort to
handle this obstacle, model reduction is employed. In \cite{rh2},
homogenization was nicely applied, to find effective coefficients and
homogenized equations (for fluid flow pressures) of a dual-continuum system,
with new convection terms and negative interaction coefficients. However, some
degree of multiscale still remains. This motivates us to propose the
generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM), which is coupled with
the dual-continuum homogenized equations, toward speeding up the simulation,
improving the accuracy as well as clearly representing the interactions between
the dual continua. In our paper, globally, each continuum is viewed as a system
and connected to the other throughout the domain. We take into consideration
the flow transfers between the dual continua and within each continuum itself.
Such multiscale flow dynamics are modeled by the GMsFEM, which systematically
generates either uncoupled or coupled multiscale basis (to carry the local
characteristics to the global ones), via establishing local snapshots and
spectral decomposition in the snapshot space. As a result, we will work with a
system of two equations coupled with some interaction terms, and each equation
describes one of the dual continua on the fine grid. Convergence analysis of
the proposed GMsFEM is accompanied with the numerical results, which support
the favorable outcomes.

data yield upper limits except for harmonic systems where they are exact.
Problems arise at diffusive systems and the presence of conformational
transitions. Covariance-based methods, for instance, can considerably
overestimate entropy when atomic positions change and cause large, but
irrelevant spatial variances. Here we propose a method called Spectrally
Resolved Estimation (SRE) for entropy, energy and free energy which is based on
the spectral density of vibrations and is inspired by the quasi-harmonic ansatz
in solid-state physics. It (a) yields, in contrast with other methods, a lower
limit of entropy and an upper limit of free energy, is (b) not corrupted by
diffusion, (c) assigns entropic contributions to spectral features and thus
reveals the localization and the type of motion underlying these contributions.
The spatial extent of conformational transitions has no influence. The method
applies to systems of finite volume and is exact for harmonic systems. The
exchange of solvent molecules is characteristic of biological macromolecules.
Here SRE opens an avenue to the entropy and free energy of partially diffusive
systems like proteins. It also enables studying channels, pumps, and enzymes
which often contain several internal, functional water molecules that can swap
position. The assignment to particular motions can be done by normal modes or
local mode analysis including visualization by band-pass filtering. Thus, SRE
provides insight into the origin of configurational entropy and is expected to
support the rational design of molecules from prodrugs up to engineered
proteins. This technical report demonstrates how thermodynamic quantities are
gained and analyzed for small molecules by evaluation of spectra computed by
quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulation.

characterize the tip effects on the wake dynamics. This study focuses on the
development of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing, and discuss flow
structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far field wake.
Vorticity is introduced into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional
manner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form
the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is
spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects
extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three
dimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings, the wake remains stable
due to the strong downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio
allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high
angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops.
For higher-aspect-ratio wings, the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding
process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the
mid-span region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip
vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the
unsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is
related to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical
elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag
forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high
angles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge
near the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis
performed here reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the
separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force
distributions.

tell that the main and least model-dependent constraint on such possible

that leads to contradiction with data on cosmic gamma-rays. We present our
attempts to possibly avoid gamma-ray constraint. They concern peculiarities of
both space distribution of DM and their physics. The latter involves
complications of decay/annihilation modes of DM, modifications of Lagrangian of
DM-ordinary matter interaction, and inclusion of mode with identical fermions
in final state. In this way, no possibilities to suppress were found except,
possibly, mode with identical fermions. While the case of spatial distribution
variation allows achieving consistency between different data. Also we consider
stable form of dark matter which can interact with baryons. We show which
constraint such DM candidate can get from damping effect in plasma during large

important tool to achieve high spectral efficiency in wireless communications.
Its use brings to the communications system an increase in performance in terms
of capacity and reliability. Recently one of the main communications
architectures that makes use of antenna arrays is the Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. MIMO technology has been applied in antenna
arrays composed of elements in the order of tens to hundreds. In this way, it
is necessary to use the structure of compact antennas that offer all the
necessary robustness to the applied project. In this context, it is important
to revisit the concepts of mutual coupling and impedance matching among antenna
elements in an array. This paper proposes and evaluates three strategies of
joint decoupling and impedance matching networks(DMN) for antenna arrays. The
first method called DMN with Lumped Elements (DMN-LE) performs the decoupling
and impedance matching steps with capacitors and inductors. The second method
is called the Ring Hybrid (DMN-RH). It is utilizes a microstrip line in the
ring form. With this approach is achieved first the decoupling followed by
impedance matching steps. The third method is called Networkless Decoupling and
Matching (NDM). It brings a concept of decoupling without the presence of a
network itself. A comparison of the methods is performed both analytically and
via computer simulations. We conclude that the third method, networkless one,
is an interesting new alternative approach.

Satellite galaxies with stellar masses in the range
$9<\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<10$ are found to be $\sim 0.05 \, \mathrm{dex}$ higher
in metallicity than centrals of similar stellar mass. Within the low-mass
satellite population, we find that the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity
depends most strongly on the stellar mass of the galaxy that is central to the
halo, though there is no obvious difference in the metallicity gradients. At
fixed total stellar mass, the satellites of high mass ($M_{*}>10^{10.5} \,
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) centrals are $\sim 0.1 \, \mathrm{dex}$ more metal rich
than satellites of low-mass ($M_{*} < 10^{10} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) centrals,
controlling for local stellar mass surface density and gas fraction. Fitting a
gas-regulator model to the spaxel data, we are able to account for variations
in the local gas fraction, stellar mass surface density and local escape
velocity-dependent outflows. We find that the best explanation for the
metallicity differences is the variation in the average metallicity of accreted
gas between different environments that depends on the stellar mass of the
dominant galaxies in each halo. This is interpreted as evidence for the
exchange of enriched gas between galaxies in dense environments that is
predicted by recent simulations.

Careful attention to the background is necessary for this spectral analysis. We
find that a blackbody + power-law model is a decent fit, suggestive of a
relatively strong B field and synchrotron radiation, as in a normal young
pulsar, though the thermal luminosity would be unusually high for young
pulsars. Among realistic NS atmosphere models, a carbon atmosphere with B =
10^12 G best fits the observed X-ray spectra. Comparing its unusually high
thermal luminosity (L_{bol} = 1.1^{+1.6}_{-0.5}*10^34 ergs/s) to other NSs, we
find that its luminosity can be explained by the decay of an initially strong
magnetic field (as in magnetars or high B-field pulsars) or by slower cooling
after the supernova explosion. The nature of the NS in this SNR (and of others
in the Magellanic Clouds) could be nicely confirmed by an X-ray telescope with

contingent upon processing a large number of spikes over a long period.
Nevertheless, the switching power of SNN hardware accelerators is proportional
to the number of spikes processed while the length of spike trains limits
throughput and static power efficiency. This paper presents the first study on
developing temporal compression to significantly boost throughput and reduce
energy dissipation of digital hardware SNN accelerators while being applicable

low-cost input spike compression units, novel input-and-output-weighted spiking

time compression ratios. Our compression architectures can be transparently
applied to any given pre-designed SNNs employing either rate or temporal codes

dynamic pricing on managed lanes with multiple access locations and
heterogeneity in travelers' value of time, origin, and destination. This
framework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins
and destinations, multiple access locations to the managed lane, en route
diversion of travelers, partial observability of the sensor readings, and
stochastic demand and observations. The problem is formulated as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and policy gradient methods are used
to determine tolls as a function of real-time observations. Tolls are modeled
as continuous and stochastic variables, and are determined using a feedforward
neural network. The method is compared against a feedback control method used
for dynamic pricing. We show that Deep-RL is effective in learning toll
policies for maximizing revenue, minimizing total system travel time, and other
joint weighted objectives, when tested on real-world transportation networks.
The Deep-RL toll policies outperform the feedback control heuristic for the
revenue maximization objective by generating revenues up to 9.5% higher than
the heuristic and for the objective minimizing total system travel time (TSTT)
by generating TSTT up to 10.4% lower than the heuristic. We also propose reward
shaping methods for the POMDP to overcome the undesired behavior of toll
policies, like the jam-and-harvest behavior of revenue-maximizing policies.
Additionally, we test transferability of the algorithm trained on one set of
inputs for new input distributions and offer recommendations on real-time
implementations of Deep-RL algorithms. The source code for our experiments is

importance of taking various issues related to power network into account while
designing a practical P2P trading scheme. To do so, a simple mechanism is
developed for energy trading among prosumers without considering any network
constraints, as done by many existing studies. Once the trading parameters,
such as the energy traded by each prosumer in the P2P market and the price per
unit of energy are determined, the developed scheme is tested on a low-voltage
(LV) network model to check its feasibility of deployment in a real P2P
network. It is shown that although the considered trading scheme is
economically beneficial to the participating prosumers compared to the existing
incentive mechanisms (such as feed-in-tariff), it could be unfit for real
deployment due to violating bus voltage limits during multiple P2P trading
executed simultaneously. Further, the grid operator may experience financial
losses for compensating the losses during P2P transactions.

neighborhood, focusing on separations of $0.01<s/{pc}<1$. Using data from Gaia
DR2, we define kinematic sub-populations via the systems' tangential
velocities, i.e., disk-like ($v_{\perp, tot}<40$km/s), intermediate
($v_{\perp,tot}=(40-85)$km/s), and halo-like ($v_{\perp,tot}>85$km/s) samples,
presuming that these velocity cuts represent a rough ordering in the binaries'
age and metallicity. Through stringent cuts on astrometric precision, we can
obtain pure binary samples with thousands of binaries in each sample. For all
three populations, the distribution of binary separations extends smoothly to
1pc, displaying neither strong truncation nor bimodality. Fitting a
smoothly-broken power law for the separation distribution, we find that its
slope at separations $s=10^{2.5-4}$AU is the same for all sub-populations,
$p(s)\propto s^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma\sim-1.54$. However, the logarithmic
slope of $p(s)$ steepens at $s \gtrsim 10^4$AU. We find some evidences that the
degree of steepening increases with the binaries' age, with a slope-change of
only $\Delta\gamma\sim0.5$ for disk-like stars, but $\Delta\gamma>1$ for
halo-like stars. This trend is contrary to what might be expected if steepening
at wide separations were due to gravitational perturbations by molecular clouds
or stars, which would preferentially disrupt disk binaries. If we were to
interpret steepening at $s\gtrsim 10^4$AU as a consequence of disruption by
massive halo objects, we would have to invoke a MACHO population inconsistent
with other constraints. As a more plausible alternative, we propose a simple
model to predict the separation distribution of wide binaries formed in
dissolving star clusters. This model generically predicts $\gamma\sim-1.5$ as
observed, with steepening at larger separations due to the finite size of
binaries' birth clusters.

Suppose that the base classifiers' outputs are noisy or communicated over noisy

We show that this degradation can be effectively reduced by allocating more
system resources for more important base classifiers. We formulate resource
optimization problems in terms of importance metrics for boosting. Moreover, we
show that the optimized noisy boosting classifiers can be more robust than
bagging for the noise during inference (test stage). We provide numerical

have enough discriminative power, whilst a weaker one is poorly representative
of some classes of decision makers. In particular, we focus on the class of

representative of the time required to observe an exoplanet transit. After
selecting multiple sub-regions with a size of 10x10 pixels and compensating for
a gain change caused by our warm detector control electronics for the selected
sub-regions, we found that the photometric precision was limited to 26.3ppm at
high co-added signal levels due to a gain variation caused by our warm detector
control electronics. The photometric precision was improved up to 12.8ppm after
correcting for the gain drift. We also translated the photometric precision to
the expected spectro-photometric precision, assuming that an optimized
densified pupil spectrograph is used in transit observations. We found that the
spectro-photometric precision of an optimized densified pupil spectrograph when
used in transit observations is expected to be improved by the square root of
the number of pixels per a spectral resolution element. At the high co-added

by a factor of 1.3 than the ideal performance that was limited by the Poisson
noise and readout noise. The systematic noise hidden behind the simulated

test case at least. If the test suite passes on the original program and still
passes after the extreme transformation, the transformation is said to be
undetected, and the test suite needs to be improved. In this work we propose a
technique to automatically determine which of the following three reasons
prevent the detection of the extreme transformation is : the test inputs are
not sufficient to infect the state of the program; the infection does not
propagate to the test cases; the test cases have a weak oracle that does not
observe the infection. We have developed Reneri, a tool that observes the
program under test and the test suite in order to determine runtime differences
between test runs on the original and the transformed method. The observations
gathered during the analysis are processed by Reneri to suggest possible
improvements to the developers. We evaluate Reneri on 15 projects and a total
of 312 undetected extreme transformations. The tool is able to generate a
suggestion for each each undetected transformation. For 63% of the cases, the
existing test cases can infect the program state, meaning that undetected
transformations are mostly due to observability and weak oracle issues.
Interviews with developers confirm the relevance of the suggested improvements
and experiments with state of the art automatic test generation tools indicate
that no tool can improve the existing test suites to fix all undetected
transformations.

investigate the inference performance of these two common approaches on both
mobile devices and public clouds, using popular convolutional neural networks.
Our measurement study suggests the need for both on-device and cloud-based
inferences for supporting mobile applications. In particular, newer mobile
devices is able to run mobile-optimized CNN models in reasonable time. However,
for older mobile devices or to use more complex CNN models, mobile applications
should opt in for cloud-based inference. We further demonstrate that variable

support efficient cloud-based inference, we propose a CNN model selection
algorithm called CNNSelect that dynamically selects the most appropriate CNN

SLAs and execution time budgets that are caused by variable mobile
environments. The key idea of CNNSelect is to make inference speed and accuracy
trade-offs at runtime using a set of CNN models. We demonstrated that CNNSelect

in this range.
  In the positive direction, we enlarge the list of explicit tensors
potentially useful for Strassen's laser method, introducing a skew-symmetric
version of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor, $T_{skewcw,q}$. For $q = 2$, the
Kronecker square of this tensor coincides with the $3\times 3$ determinant
polynomial, $\det_3 \in \mathbb{C}^9\otimes \mathbb{C}^9\otimes \mathbb{C}^9$,
regarded as a tensor. We show that this tensor could potentially be used to
show that the exponent of matrix multiplication is two.
  We determine new upper bounds for the (Waring) rank and the (Waring) border
rank of $\det_3$, exhibiting a strict submultiplicative behaviour for
$T_{skewcw,2}$ which is promising for the laser method.
  We establish general results regarding border ranks of Kronecker powers of
tensors, and make a detailed study of Kronecker squares of tensors in
$\mathbb{C}^3\otimes \mathbb{C}^3\otimes \mathbb{C}^3$.

the estimation of local observables does not require the preparation of the

the observables can be estimated. This can potentially reduce circuit size and
number of qubits for the computation of physical properties of the states.
Moreover, we show that the effect of noise decreases along the computation. Our

  Presentation",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vision-based grasping systems typically adopt an open-loop execution of a
planned grasp. This policy can fail due to many reasons, including ubiquitous
calibration error. Recovery from a failed grasp is further complicated by
visual occlusion, as the hand is usually occluding the vision sensor as it
attempts another open-loop regrasp. This work presents MAT, a tactile
closed-loop method capable of realizing grasps provided by a coarse initial
positioning of the hand above an object. Our algorithm is a deep reinforcement
learning (RL) policy optimized through the clipped surrogate objective within a
maximum entropy RL framework to balance exploitation and exploration. The
method utilizes tactile and proprioceptive information to act through both fine
finger motions and larger regrasp movements to execute stable grasps. A novel
curriculum of action motion magnitude makes learning more tractable and helps
turn common failure cases into successes. Careful selection of features that
exhibit small sim-to-real gaps enables this tactile grasping policy, trained
purely in simulation, to transfer well to real world environments without the
need for additional learning. Experimentally, this methodology improves over a
vision-only grasp success rate substantially on a multi-fingered robot hand.
When this methodology is used to realize grasps from coarse initial positions
provided by a vision-only planner, the system is made dramatically more robust
to calibration errors in the camera-robot transform.

visible spectroscopic survey. The spectra were obtained from August 2013 to
March 2018 at Lowell Observatory's Discovery Channel 4.3 meter telescope, and
both Gemini North and South facilities. In total, 210 NEOs have been observed
and taxonomically classified. Our taxonomic distribution shows significant
variations with respect to surveys of larger objects. We suspect these to be
due to a dependence of Main Belt source regions on object size. Compared to
previous surveys of larger objects (Binzel et al. 2019, 2004; Perna et al.
2018), we report a lower fraction of S+Q-complex asteroids of 43.8 $\pm$ 4.6%.
We associate this decrease with a lack of Phocaea family members at very small
size. We also report higher fractions of X-complex and A-type asteroids of 23.8
$\pm$ 3.3% and 3.8 $\pm$ 1.3% respectively due to an increase of Hungaria
family objects at small size. We find a strong correlation between the Q/S

close encounters with Venus playing a major role in turning asteroids from S to
Q-type. This hypothesis is supported by a similar correlation between the Q/S

participate in the shifts of the complementary variables of a pointer. While
the real part represents the value of an observable in the limit of zero
measurement strength, the imaginary one is regarded as the back-action due to
the measurement with a post-selection, which has an influence on the
post-selection probability. In this paper I give a case in which a real part
could also appear as such a back-action in a post-selection probability on an
equal footing with an imaginary one. It is also shown that both of the real and
imaginary parts can be inferred by observing the probability in practice, which
has an advantage that an additional system of a pointer is not needed.

define the inexact AUC, which is our extension of the area under the ROC curve

so that the smooth approximation of the inexact AUC increases while anomaly
scores for non-anomalous instances become low. We model the anomaly score
function by a neural network-based unsupervised anomaly detection method, e.g.,
autoencoders. The proposed method performs well even when only a small number
of inexact labels are available by incorporating an unsupervised anomaly
detection mechanism with inexact AUC maximization. Using various datasets, we
experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method improves the anomaly

referential information for weakly supervised object localization with only
image-level annotations. However, the most discriminative regions usually
conceal the other parts of the object, thereby impeding entire object
recognition and localization. To tackle this problem, the Dual-attention
Focused Module (DFM) is proposed to enhance object localization performance.
Specifically, we present a dual attention module for information fusion,
consisting of a position branch and a channel one. In each branch, the input
feature map is deduced into an enhancement map and a mask map, thereby
highlighting the most discriminative parts or hiding them. For the position
mask map, we introduce a focused matrix to enhance it, which utilizes the
principle that the pixels of an object are continuous. Between these two
branches, the enhancement map is integrated with the mask map, aiming at
partially compensating the lost information and diversifies the features. With
the dual-attention module and focused matrix, the entire object region could be
precisely recognized with implicit information. We demonstrate outperforming
results of DFM in experiments. In particular, DFM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in localization accuracy in ILSVRC 2016 and CUB-200-2011.

Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type variational inequalities. In the case where the

significant results indicating referee decisions are impacted by attendance,

The prescribed formation is a general one which can be any geometric pattern,

a distributed controller is proposed based on the idea of decoupled design. One

We study perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) for this game with equilibrium

difficulty arises from the fact that players need to construct estimates on
other players' estimate on $V$, which in turn would imply that an infinite

mathematical object, e.g., a ball, can be continuously deformed, without

not continuous anymore, the initial topology will consequently change giving
rise to a topologically distinct object, e.g., a torus. This simple concept in
general topology may be employed in the study of physical systems described by
fields. Instead of continuously deforming objects, we can take a continuously
evolving field, with an appropriately defined topology, such that the topology
remains unchanged in time unless the system undergoes an important physical
change, e.g., a transition to a different energy state. For instance, a sudden
change in the magnetic topology in an energetically relaxing plasma, a process
called reconnection, strongly affects the dynamics, e.g., it is involved in
launching solar flares and generating large scale magnetic fields in
astrophysical objects. In this topological formalism, the magnetic topology in
a plasma can spontaneously change due to the presence of dissipative terms in
the induction equation which break its time symmetry. We define a topology for
the vector field $\bf F$ in the phase space $(\bf x, F)$. As for scalar fields
represented by a perfect fluid, e.g., the inhomogeneous inflaton or Higgs
fields, the fluid velocity $\bf u$ defines the corresponding topology. The
vector field topology in its corresponding phase space $(\bf x, F)$ will be
preserved in time if certain conditions including time reversal invariance are
satisfied by the field and its governing differential equation.

Although Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in video
classification, recent research shows adding imperceptible perturbations to
clean videos can make the well-trained models output wrong labels with high
confidence. In this paper, we propose an effective defense framework to
characterize and defend adversarial videos. The proposed method contains two
phases: (1) adversarial video detection using temporal consistency between
adjacent frames, and (2) adversarial perturbation reduction via denoisers in
the spatial and temporal domains respectively. Specifically, because of the
linear nature of DNNs, the imperceptible perturbations will enlarge with the
increasing of DNNs depth, which leads to the inconsistency of DNNs output
between adjacent frames. However, the benign video frames often have the same
outputs with their neighbor frames owing to the slight changes. Based on this
observation, we can distinguish between adversarial videos and benign videos.
After that, we utilize different defense strategies against different attacks.
We propose the temporal defense, which reconstructs the polluted frames with
their temporally neighbor clean frames, to deal with the adversarial videos
with sparse polluted frames. For the videos with dense polluted frames, we use
an efficient adversarial denoiser to process each frame in the spatial domain,
and thus purify the perturbations (we call it as spatial defense). A series of
experiments conducted on the UCF-101 dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness of video classifiers against
adversarial attacks.

novelty in our model is to eliminate the commonly used notion of lanes and

that individual vehicle motions can still be modeled. We name this a
Density/Capacity View (DCV) of the link capacity and how vehicles utilize it

this model is exhibiting both passing and blocking regimes (analogous to
multi-lane or single-lane) depending on the set scalar parameter for capacity.
We show the model has linear local (platoon) and string stability. Also, we
perform numerical simulations and show evidence for non-linear stability. Our
traffic flow model is represented by a nonlinear differential equation which we

are needed to search for the target and rearrange cluttered objects around it
to enable effective grasps. We propose to solve the problem by formulating a
deep learning approach in a critic-policy format. The target-oriented motion
critic, which maps both visual observations and target information to the
expected future rewards of pushing and grasping motion primitives, is learned
via deep Q-learning. We divide the problem into two subtasks, and two policies
are proposed to tackle each of them, by combining the critic predictions and
relevant domain knowledge. A Bayesian-based policy accounting for past action
experience performs pushing to search for the target; once the target is found,
a classifier-based policy coordinates target-oriented pushing and grasping to
grasp the target in clutter. The motion critic and the classifier are trained
in a self-supervised manner through robot-environment interactions. Our system
achieves a 93% and 87% task success rate on each of the two subtasks in

autonomous vehicles make better decisions on the road, the assume-guarantee

applicability of our framework.

Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from complex continuous distributions. However, a
fundamental limitation of HMC is that it can not be applied to distributions
with mixed discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose mixed
HMC (M-HMC) as a general framework to address this limitation. M-HMC is a novel
family of MCMC algorithms that evolves the discrete and continuous variables in
tandem, allowing more frequent updates of discrete variables while maintaining
HMC's ability to suppress random-walk behavior. We establish M-HMC's
theoretical properties, and present an efficient implementation with Laplace
momentum that introduces minimal overhead compared to existing HMC methods. The
superior performances of M-HMC over existing methods are demonstrated with
numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), variable selection in

radius $\thetae$ (close solution), while the other solution has a separation
greater than $\thetae$ (wide solution). From the Bayesian analysis with the

the location of the source lying in the far disk behind the bulge, we find that
the planet is a super-Jupiter with a mass of $4.4^{+3.0}_{-2.0}~M_{\rm J}$ and

approximate Bayesian inference for models with intractable likelihood
functions. However, they can be computationally demanding. Bayesian synthetic
likelihood (BSL) is a popular such method that approximates the likelihood
function of the summary statistic with a known, tractable distribution --
typically Gaussian -- and then performs statistical inference using standard
likelihood-based techniques. However, as the number of summary statistics
grows, the number of model simulations required to accurately estimate the
covariance matrix for this likelihood rapidly increases. This poses significant
challenge for the application of BSL, especially in cases where model
simulation is expensive. In this article we propose whitening BSL (wBSL) -- an
efficient BSL method that uses approximate whitening transformations to
decorrelate the summary statistics at each algorithm iteration. We show
empirically that this can reduce the number of model simulations required to
implement BSL by more than an order of magnitude, without much loss of
accuracy. We explore a range of whitening procedures and demonstrate the
performance of wBSL on a range of simulated and real modelling scenarios from
ecology and biology.

estimation of the power dissipated by nonlinear oscillations of bubbles.
Pioneering work of Louisnard \cite{1} meticulously derived the nonlinear energy
terms for viscous and thermal damping; however, radiation damping arising from
the compressibility of the liquid was neglected. Jamshidi $\&$ Brenner \cite{2}
have considered the effects of the compressibility of the liquid and showed
that damping due to radiation becomes the most significant factor at pressures
above the blake threshold. Despite the improvement in their formulation;
however, the radiation damping term estimates non-physical values for some
frequency and pressure regions including near resonance oscillations. Thus, the
new terms arising from the compressibility of the liquid needs critical
assessment. In this work, we provide critical corrections to the present
formulations. Importance of the new corrections are highlighted by the
scattering to damping ratio (STDR). We then introduce a unifying parameter to
assess the efficacy of applications; this parameter is defined as the

numbers. To facilitate controller design, we present an efficient modelling
approach in which we utilise the resolvent operator to recast the linearised
Navier-Stokes equations into an input-output form from which frequency
responses can be computed. The difficulty of applying modern control design
techniques to complex, high-dimensional flow systems is thus overcome by using
low-order models identified from these frequency responses. The low-order
models are used to design optimal control laws using $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$
loop shaping. Two distinct control arrangements are considered, both of which
employ a single-input and a single-output. In the first control arrangement, a
velocity sensor located in the wake drives a pair of body forces near the
cylinder. Complete suppression of shedding is observed up to a Reynolds number
of $Re=110$. Due to the convective nature of vortex shedding and the
corresponding time delays, we observe a fundamental trade-off: the sensor
should be close enough to the cylinder to avoid any excessive time lag, but it
should be kept sufficiently far from the cylinder to measure any unstable modes
developing downstream. It is found that these two conflicting requirements
become more difficult to satisfy for larger Reynolds numbers. In the second
control arrangement, we consider a practical setup with a body-mounted force
sensor and an actuator that oscillates the cylinder according to the lift
measurement. It is shown that the system is stabilised only up to $Re=100$, and
we demonstrate why the performance of the resulting feedback controllers
deteriorates much more rapidly with increasing Reynolds number. The challenges
of designing robust controllers for each control setup are also analysed and

galaxy's light has hamstrung the understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs).
Half a century ago, using the ""effective half-light radii"" $R_e$ from de
Vaucouleurs' $R^{1/4}$ model, S\'ersic reported that bright ETGs follow the
relation $\mathfrak{M}_B\propto2.5\log R_e$; and consequently one has that
$\langle\mu\rangle_e\propto2.5\log R_e$ and $\mu_e\propto2.5\log R_e$, where
$\mu_e$ and $\langle\mu\rangle_e$ are the effective surface brightness at $R_e$
and the mean effective surface brightness within $R_e$, respectively. S\'ersic
additionally observed an apparent transition which led him to advocate for a
division between what he called dwarf and giant ETGs; a belief frequently
restated to occur at $\mathfrak{M}_B\approx-18$ mag or S\'ersic $n\approx 2.5$.
Here, the location of this false dichotomy is shown to change by more than 3
mag simply depending on the arbitrary percentage of light used to quantify a
galaxy's size, voiding claims for different formation physics operating on ETGs
brighter and fainter than $\mathfrak{M}_B\approx-18$ mag. This is of further
importance because quantities such as dynamical mass $\sigma^2R/G$,
gravitational binding energy $GM^2/R$, acceleration $GM/R^2$, and the
""Fundamental Plane"" depend systematically on the arbitrary percentage of light

foreground-background imbalance, heuristic sampling methods are always
necessary, which either re-sample a subset of all training samples (hard
sampling methods, \eg biased sampling, OHEM), or use all training samples but
re-weight them discriminatively (soft sampling methods, \eg Focal Loss, GHM).
In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such hard/soft sampling methods
for training accurate deep object detectors. While previous studies have shown
that training detectors without heuristic sampling methods would significantly
degrade accuracy, we reveal that this degradation comes from an unreasonable
classification gradient magnitude caused by the imbalance, rather than a lack
of re-sampling/re-weighting. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a simple
yet effective \emph{Sampling-Free} mechanism to achieve a reasonable
classification gradient magnitude by initialization and loss scaling. Unlike
heuristic sampling methods with multiple hyperparameters, our Sampling-Free
mechanism is fully data diagnostic, without laborious hyperparameters
searching. We verify the effectiveness of our method in training anchor-based
and anchor-free object detectors, where our method always achieves higher
detection accuracy than heuristic sampling methods on COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets. Our Sampling-Free mechanism provides a new perspective to address the
foreground-background imbalance. Our code is released at

  Inertial Measurement Units","Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), to appear",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel inertial-aided localization approach by fusing
information from multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) and exteroceptive
sensors. IMU is a low-cost motion sensor which provides measurements on angular
velocity and gravity compensated linear acceleration of a moving platform, and
widely used in modern localization systems. To date, most existing
inertial-aided localization methods exploit only one single IMU. While the
single-IMU localization yields acceptable accuracy and robustness for different
use cases, the overall performance can be further improved by using multiple
IMUs. To this end, we propose a lightweight and accurate algorithm for fusing
measurements from multiple IMUs and exteroceptive sensors, which is able to
obtain noticeable performance gain without incurring additional computational
cost. To achieve this, we first probabilistically map measurements from all
IMUs onto a virtual IMU. This step is performed by stochastic estimation with
least-square estimators and probabilistic marginalization of inter-IMU
rotational accelerations. Subsequently, the propagation model for both state
and error state of the virtual IMU is also derived, which enables the use of
the classical filter-based or optimization-based sensor fusion algorithms for
localization. Finally, results from both simulation and real-world tests are
provided, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing
algorithms by noticeable margins.

such, language models have been investigated for incorporation with NMT. In
prior investigations, two models have been used: a translation model and a
language model. The translation model's predictions are weighted by the
language model with a hand-crafted ratio in advance. However, these approaches
fail to adopt the language model weighting with regard to the translation
history. In another line of approach, language model prediction is incorporated
into the translation model by jointly considering source and target
information. However, this line of approach is limited because it largely
ignores the adequacy of the translation output.
  Accordingly, this work employs two mechanisms, the translation model and the
language model, with an attentive architecture to the language model as an
auxiliary element of the translation model. Compared with previous work in
English--Japanese machine translation using a language model, the experimental
results obtained with the proposed Dynamic Fusion mechanism improve BLEU and
Rank-based Intuitive Bilingual Evaluation Scores (RIBES) scores. Additionally,
in the analyses of the attention and predictivity of the language model, the

workloads running on data centers today, but it is rarely executed alone.
Instead, to reduce costs, computing resources are consolidated and shared by
different applications. In this scenario, elasticity and proper load balancing
are vital to maximize efficiency, fairness, and utilization. Currently, most
distributed training frameworks do not support the aforementioned properties. A
few exceptions that do support elasticity, imitate generic distributed
frameworks and use micro-tasks. In this paper we illustrate that micro-tasks
are problematic for machine learning applications, because they require a high
degree of parallelism which hinders the convergence of distributed training at
a pure algorithmic level (i.e., ignoring overheads and scalability
limitations). To address this, we propose Chicle, a new elastic distributed
training framework which exploits the nature of machine learning algorithms to
implement elasticity and load balancing without micro-tasks. We use Chicle to
train deep neural network as well as generalized linear models, and show that
Chicle achieves performance competitive with state of the art rigid frameworks,

and control problems in Cyber-Physical Systems among which many are
safety-critical, e.g., chemical plants, robotics, autonomous vehicles. Despite
the significant benefits brought by ML techniques, they also raise additional
safety issues because 1) most expressive and powerful ML models are not
transparent and behave as a black box and 2) the training data which plays a
crucial role in ML safety is usually incomplete. An important technique to
achieve safety for ML models is ""Safe Fail"", i.e., a model selects a reject
option and applies the backup solution, a traditional controller or a human
operator for example, when it has low confidence in a prediction.
  Data-driven models produced by ML algorithms learn from training data, and
hence they are only as good as the examples they have learnt. As pointed in
[17], ML models work well in the ""training space"" (i.e., feature space with
sufficient training data), but they could not extrapolate beyond the training
space. As observed in many previous studies, a feature space that lacks
training data generally has a much higher error rate than the one that contains
sufficient training samples [31]. Therefore, it is essential to identify the
training space and avoid extrapolating beyond the training space. In this
paper, we propose an efficient Feature Space Partitioning Tree (FSPT) to
address this problem. Using experiments, we also show that, a strong
relationship exists between model performance and FSPT score.

inequalities have been extensively studied in the context of neutrino
oscillations. However these analyses are performed under the assumption of
standard model (SM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work we study new
physics effects on $l_1$-norm based measure of quantum coherence which
quantifies the quantumness embedded in the system and is also intrinsically
related to various measures of quantum correlations. Moreover, it is considered
to be a resource theoretical tool which can be utilized in quantum algorithms
and quantum channel discrimination. The new physics effects are incorporated in
a model independent way by using the effective Lagrangian for the neutral
current non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). Bounds on the NSI parameters
are extracted from a recent global analysis of oscillation experiments
including COHERENT (coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment) data. In
the context of upcoming DUNE experimental setup, we find that the most
favourable combination of LMA-Light sector of $\theta_{12}$ (i.e.,
$\theta_{12}< 45^o$) with normal mass ordering decreases the coherence in the
system in comparison to the SM prediction for all values of neutrino energy E
and CP violating phase $\delta$ (except in the narrow region around E ~ 2 GeV).
On the other hand, a large enhancement in the value of coherence parameter in
the entire $(E-\delta)$ plane is possible for the dark octant of $\theta_{12}$
($\theta_{12}> 45^o$) with inverted ordering. For almost all values of CP
violating phase, the enhancement is more protuberant in the region around E ~ 4
GeV where maximum neutrino flux is expected in the DUNE experiment. Therefore
for the normal mass ordering, the SM interaction provides favourable conditions
for quantum information tasks while the NSI favours inverted ordering scenario
for such tasks.

provide the first theoretical guarantees on Agghoo, ensuring that it can be
used safely: Agghoo performs at worst like the hold-out when the risk is
convex. The same holds true in classification with the 0-1 risk, with an
additional constant factor. For the hold-out, oracle inequalities are known for
bounded losses, as in binary classification. We show that similar results can
be proved, under appropriate assumptions, for other risk-minimization problems.
In particular, we obtain an oracle inequality for regularized kernel regression
with a Lip-schitz loss, without requiring that the Y variable or the regressors
be bounded. Numerical experiments show that aggregation brings a significant
improvement over the hold-out and that Agghoo is competitive with

the achievable region of this model from the literature, and then we design a
polar coding scheme that achieves the stronger one. In the proposed scheme, the
encoding uses polar-based Marton's coding, where one inner-layer must be
reliably decoded by both legitimate receivers, and each receiver must decode
its own corresponding outer-layer. Due to the non-degradedness condition of the
broadcast channel, the encoder builds a chaining construction that induces
bidirectional dependencies between adjacent blocks. Indeed, these dependencies
can occur between different encoding layers of different blocks. The use of two
secret-keys, whose length are negligible in terms of rate, are required to
prove that the polar code satisfies the strong secrecy condition.

Considering problems that exhibit singularities in the solution, an adaptive

task especially if only quadrilateral/hexahedral elements are deployed and
consequently the hanging nodes problem is encountered. These element types,
are, however, favored in computational mechanics due to the improved accuracy
compared to triangular/tetrahedral elements. Therefore, we propose a compatible
transition element - xNy-element - which provides the capability of coupling
different element types. The adjacent elements can exhibit different element
sizes, shape function types, and polynomial orders. Thus, it is possible to
combine independently refined h- and p-meshes. The approach is based on the

facilities, but gradually covered according to, e.g., the distance to the open
facilities. Moreover, customers are not served by a single facility, but by a
collection of them, which jointly serve them. In this paper we study the
recently introduced multiple gradual cover location problem (MGCLP). The MGCLP
addresses both of the issues described above.
  We provide four different mixed-integer programming formulations for the
MGCLP, all of them exploiting the submodularity of the objective function and
developed a branch-and-cut framework based one these formulations. The
framework is further enhanced by starting and primal heuristics and
initialization procedures.
  The computational results show that our approach allows to effectively
address different sets of instances. We provide optimal solution values for 13
instances from literature, where the optimal solution was not known, and
additionally provide improved solution values for seven instances. Many of
these instances can be solved within a minute. We also analyze the dependence
of the solution-structure on instance-characteristics.

repeatedly plays the Colonel Blotto game against several adversaries. At each
stage, the learner distributes her budget of resources on a fixed number of
battlefields to maximize the aggregate value of battlefields she wins; each
battlefield being won if there is no adversary that has higher allocation. We
focus on the bandit feedback setting. We first show that it can be modeled as a
path planning problem. It is then possible to use the classical COMBAND
algorithm to guarantee a sub-linear regret in terms of time horizon, but this
entails two fundamental challenges: (i) the computation is inefficient due to
the huge size of the action set, and (ii) the standard exploration distribution
leads to a loose guarantee in practice. To address the first, we construct a
modified algorithm that can be efficiently implemented by applying a dynamic
programming technique called weight pushing; for the second, we propose methods
optimizing the exploration distribution to improve the regret bound. Finally,
we implement our proposed algorithm and perform numerical experiments that show

end, this paper proposes a 360$^\circ$ image-based SOD dataset that contains
500 high-resolution equirectangular images. We collect the representative
equirectangular images from five mainstream 360$^\circ$ video datasets and
manually annotate all objects and regions over these images with precise masks
with a free-viewpoint way. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first public
available dataset for salient object detection on 360$^\circ$ scenes. By
observing this dataset, we find that distortion from projection, large-scale
complex scene and small salient objects are the most prominent characteristics.
Inspired by these foundings, this paper proposes a baseline model for SOD on
equirectangular images. In the proposed approach, we construct a
distortion-adaptive module to deal with the distortion caused by the
equirectangular projection. In addition, a multi-scale contextual integration
block is introduced to perceive and distinguish the rich scenes and objects in
omnidirectional scenes. The whole network is organized in a progressively
manner with deep supervision. Experimental results show the proposed baseline
approach outperforms the top-performanced state-of-the-art methods on

baseline approach and other methods on 360$^\circ$ SOD dataset show the
proposed dataset is very challenging, which also validate the usefulness of the

SPECT radiomics features against changes in imaging settings including

  Methods: Four scanners were used to acquire SPECT scans of a cardiac phantom
with 5mCi of 99mTc. The effects of different image acquisition and
reconstruction settings including the Number of View, View Matrix Size,
attenuation correction, image reconstruction algorithm, number of iterations,
number of subsets, type of filter, full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
Gaussian filter, Butterworth filter order, and Butterworth filter cut-off were
studied. In total 5263 different images were reconstructed. Eighty-seven
radiomic features including first, second, and high order textures were
extracted from images. To assess reproducibility and repeatability the
coefficient of variation (COV) was used for each image feature over the
different imaging settings.
  Result: IDMN and IDN features from GLCM, RP from GLRLM, ZE from GLSZM, and DE
from GLDM feature sets were the only features that were the most reproducible
(COV < 5) against changes in all imaging settings. In addition, the IDMN
feature from GLCM, LALGLE, SALGLE and LGLZE from GLSZM, and SDLGLE from GLDM
feature sets were the features that were less reproducible (COV>20 ) against
changes in all imaging settings. Matrix size has the greatest impact on feature
variability as most of features are not repeatable and 82.76 of them had
(COV>20 ).
  Conclusion: Repeatability and reproducibility of SPECT radiomics texture
features in different imaging settings is feature-dependent, and different
image acquisitions and reconstructions have different effects on radiomics
texture features. Low COV radiomics features could be consider for further
clinical studies.

for gas flows covering a wide range of flow regimes. A particular challenge for
kinetic schemes is whether they can capture the correct hydrodynamic behaviors
of the system in the continuum regime (i.e., as the Knudsen number $\epsilon\ll
1$ ) without enforcing kinetic scale resolution. At the current stage, {the
main approach to analyze such a property is the asymptotic preserving (AP)
concept, which aims to show whether a kinetic scheme reduces to a solver for
the hydrodynamic equations as $\epsilon \to 0$, such as the shock capturing
scheme for the Euler equations. However, the detailed asymptotic properties of
the kinetic scheme are indistinguishable when $\epsilon$ is small but finite
under the AP framework}. In order to distinguish different characteristics of
kinetic schemes, in this paper we introduce the concept of unified preserving
(UP) aiming at assessing asmyptotic orders of a kinetic scheme by employing the
modified equation approach and Chapman-Enskon analysis. It is shown that the UP
properties of a kinetic scheme generally depend on the spatial/temporal
accuracy and closely on the inter-connections among the three scales (kinetic
scale, numerical scale, and hydrodynamic scale) and their corresponding coupled
dynamics. Specifically, the numerical resolution and specific discretization of
particle transport and collision determine the flow physics of the scheme in
different regimes, especially in the near continuum limit. As two examples, the
UP methodology is applied to analyze the discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme
and a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in their asymptotic
behaviors in the continuum limit.

extremely low continuum flux reveals a host of soft X-ray emission lines from
photoionised gas. The simultaneous UV flux drop suggests that the variability
is intrinsic to the source, and we confirm this with broad-band X-ray
spectroscopy. The dominance of the soft X-ray lines at low energies and distant
reflection at high energies is therefore due to the respective emission regions
being located far enough from the X-ray source that they have not yet seen the
flux drop. Between the two XMM-Newton spectra, taken 6 months apart, the
emission line ratio in the Ovii triplet changes drastically. We attribute this
change to a drop in the ionisation of intervening warm absorption, which means
that the absorber must cover a large fraction of the line emitting region, and
extend much further from the black hole than previously assumed. The HST
spectrum, taken in 2018, shows that new absorption features have appeared on
the blue wings of Ciii*, Ly{\alpha}, Nv, Siiv and Civ, likely due to absorbing

qualitative analysis of hidden state visualizations provides additional
insights into BERT's reasoning process. Our results show that the
transformations within BERT go through phases that are related to traditional

that fine-tuning has little impact on the models' semantic abilities and that
prediction errors can be recognized in the vector representations of even early

demonstrated unprecedented improvement over classical techniques. However, most
crop mapping studies are limited to same-year crop mapping in which the present
year's labeled data is used to predict the same year's crop map. Classification
accuracies of these methods degrade considerably in cross-year mapping.
Cross-year crop mapping is more useful as it allows the prediction of the
following years' crop maps using previously labeled data. We propose Vector
Dynamic Time Warping (VDTW), a novel multi-year classification approach based
on warping of angular distances between phenological vectors. The results prove
that the proposed VDTW method is robust to temporal and spectral variations
compensating for different farming practices, climate and atmospheric effects,
and measurement errors between years. We also describe a method for determining
the most discriminative time window that allows high classification accuracies
with limited data. We carried out tests of our approach with Landsat 8
time-series imagery from years 2013 to 2016 for classification of corn and
cotton in the Harran Plain, and corn, cotton, and soybean in the Bismil Plain
of Southeastern Turkey. In addition, we tested VDTW corn and soybean in Kansas,
the US for 2017 and 2018 with the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel data. The VDTW
method achieved 99.85% and 99.74% overall accuracies for the same and cross
years, respectively with fewer training samples compared to other
state-of-the-art approaches, i.e. spectral angle mapper (SAM), dynamic time
warping (DTW), time-weighted DTW (TWDTW), random forest (RF), support vector
machine (SVM) and deep long short-term memory (LSTM) methods. The proposed
method could be expanded for other crop types and/or geographical areas.

different layers, we propose dynamic learning of graphs and node features
jointly in GCNNs. In particular, we cast the graph optimization problem as
distance metric learning to capture pairwise similarities of features in each

metric matrix into a low-dimensional matrix, which converts graph learning to
the optimization of a low-dimensional matrix for efficient implementation.

A
striking feature is the existence of robust and chiral wave propagations that
have potential applications in many fields. A common way to realize such wave
patterns is to utilize Dirac points which carry topological indices and is
supported by the symmetries of the media. In this work, we investigate these
phenomena in photonic media. Starting with Maxwell's equations with a honeycomb
material weight as well as the nonlinear Kerr effect, we first prove the
existence of Dirac points in the dispersion surfaces of transverse electric and
magnetic Maxwell operators under very general assumptions of the material
weight. Our assumptions on the material weight are almost the minimal
requirements to ensure the existence of Dirac points in a general hexagonal
photonic crystal. We then derive the associated wave packet dynamics in the
scenario where the honeycomb structure is weakly modulated. It turns out the
reduced envelope equation is generally a two-dimensional nonlinear Dirac
equation with a spatially varying mass. By studying the reduced envelope
equation with a domain-wall-like mass term, we realize the subtle wave motions
which are chiral and immune to local defects. The underlying mechanism is the
existence of topologically protected linear line modes, also referred to as
edge states. However, we show that these robust linear modes do not survive
with nonlinearity. We demonstrate the existence of nonlinear line modes, which
can propagate in the nonlinear media based on high-accuracy numerical
computations. Moreover, we also report a new type of nonlinear modes which are
localized in both directions.

origin has been much debated recently without any clear conclusion. Resolving
the nature of the Arcturus stream can provide clues to the formation history of
the Milky Way and its stellar populations. The space velocities, angular
momenta and actions for a sample of more than 5.8 million stars, composed from
Gaia DR2, are analysed with a wavelet transform. The kinematic characteristics
of each identified group is used to select possible members of the groups from
the GALAH and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys to further study and constrain their
chemical properties. In the velocity and angular momentum spaces the already
known Sirius, Pleiades, Hyades, Hercules, AF06, Arcturus and KFR08 streams are
clearly identified. The Hercules stream appears to be a mixture of thin and
thick disk stars. The Arcturus stream, as well as the AF06 and KFR08 streams,
are low-velocity and low-angular momentum structures with chemical compositions
similar to the thick disk. These three groups extend further from the Galactic
plane compared to the Hercules stream. The detections of all the groups were
spaced by approximately 20-30 km/s in azimuthal velocity. A wide spread of
chemical abundances within the Arcturus stream indicates that the group is not
a dissolved open cluster. Instead the Arcturus stream, together with the AF06
and KFR08 streams, are more likely to be part of a phase-space wave, that could
have been caused by an ancient merger event. This conclusion is based on that
the different structures are detected in steps of 20-30 km/s in azimuthal
velocity, that the kinematic and chemical features are different from what is
expected for bar-originated structures, and that the lower-velocity streams
extend further from the disk than bar-originated structures.

regrettably not been the case with animal faces. There exists significant room

animal faces. Among many transformative impacts, such a technology will foster
better and cheaper animal healthcare, and further advance animal psychology
understanding.
  We believe the underlying research progress is mainly obstructed by the lack
of an adequately annotated dataset of animal faces, covering a wide spectrum of
animal species. To this end, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical annotated
dataset of animal faces, featuring 21.9K faces from 334 diverse species and 21
animal orders across biological taxonomy. These faces are captured
`in-the-wild' conditions and are consistently annotated with 9 landmarks on key
facial features. The proposed dataset is structured and scalable by design; its
development underwent four systematic stages involving rigorous, manual
annotation effort of over 6K man-hours. We benchmark it for face alignment
using the existing art under novel problem settings. Results showcase its
challenging nature, unique attributes and present definite prospects for novel,
adaptive, and generalized face-oriented CV algorithms. We further benchmark the
dataset for face detection and fine-grained recognition tasks, to demonstrate
multi-task applications and room for improvement. Experiments indicate that
this dataset will push the algorithmic advancements across many related CV
tasks and encourage the development of novel systems for animal facial
behaviour monitoring. We will make the dataset publicly available.

an indicator of stellar populations younger than 200 Myr. In this work, we
provide a new method to determine H:K, and apply it to spectra taken of cluster
galaxies in Abell~3888. Although H:K is on average systematically lower for the
cluster than for a wider field sample, we show that H:K does not have a simple
relationship with other indices such as the equivalent widths of H$\delta$ and
[OII]. Moreover, strongly inverted galaxies with H:K>1.1 have no preferred
location within the cluster and are only slightly lower in their velocity
dispersions around the cluster compared to strongly emitting [OII] galaxies.
Our results indicate that selecting galaxies on H:K inversion results in a
heterogeneous sample formed via a mixture of pathways that likely includes, but
may not be limited to, merging spiral galaxies, and quiescent galaxies
accreting lower mass, gas rich companions. In concert with other selection
criteria, H:K can provide a means to select a more `pure' passive sample or to
aid in the selection of highly star-forming galaxies, especially where other
spectral line indicators such as H$\alpha$ may not have been observed.

displaying particular abundance variations. The different populations within a
GC can be well distinguished following their position in the pseudo two-colors
diagrams, also referred to as ""chromosome maps"". These maps are constructed
using optical and near-UV photometry available from the Hubble Space Telescope

populations in the chromosome maps is hampered by the fact that HST photometry
and elemental abundances are both available only for a limited number of stars.
The spectra collected as part of the MUSE survey of globular clusters provide a
spectroscopic counterpart to the HST photometric catalogs covering the central
regions of GCs. In this paper, we use the MUSE spectra of 1115 red giant branch
(RGB) stars in NGC 2808 to characterize the abundance variations seen in the
multiple populations of this cluster. We use the chromosome map of NGC 2808 to
divide the RGB stars into their respective populations. We then combine the
spectra of all stars belonging to a given population, resulting in one high
signal-to-noise ratio spectrum representative of each population. Variations in
the spectral lines of O, Na, Mg, and Al are clearly detected among four of the
populations. In order to quantify these variations, we measured equivalent
width differences and created synthetic populations spectra that were used to
determine abundance variations with respect to the primordial population of the
cluster. Our results are in good agreement with the values expected from
previous studies based on high-resolution spectroscopy. We do not see any
significant variations in the spectral lines of Ca, K, and Ba. We also do not
detect abundance variations among the stars belonging to the primordial

studies. Our goals are 1) to apply Zeeman broadening modelling to T Tauri stars
with high-resolution data, 2) to expand the sample of stars with measured
surface magnetic field strengths, 3) to investigate possible rotational or
long-term magnetic variability by comparing spectral time series of given
targets, and 4) to compare the magnetic field modulus <B> tracing small-scale
magnetic fields to those of large-scale magnetic fields derived by Stokes V
Zeeman Doppler Imaging. We modelled the Zeeman broadening of magnetically
sensitive spectral lines in the near-IR K-band from high-resolution spectra by
using magnetic spectrum synthesis based on realistic model atmospheres and by
using different descriptions of the surface magnetic field. We developped a
Bayesian framework that selects the complexity of the magnetic field
prescription based on the information contained in the data. We obtain
individual magnetic field measurements for each star in our sample using four
different models. We find that the Bayesian Model 4 performs best in the range
of magnetic fields measured on the sample (from 1.5 kG to 4.4 kG). We do not
detect a strong rotational variation of <B> with a mean peak-to-peak variation
of 0.3 kG. Our confidence intervals are of the same order of magnitude, which
suggests that the Zeeman broadening is produced by a small-scale magnetic field
homogeneously distributed over stellar surfaces. A comparison of our results
with mean large-scale magnetic field measurements from Stokes V ZDI show
different fractions of mean field strength being recovered, from 25-42% for
relatively simple poloidal axisymmetric field topologies to 2-11% for more

modelling of asteroseismic data from stars exhibiting either gravity-mode or

responsible for the production, mixing, and segregation of chemical elements.
In this work we validate against model data an analytical expression for the
period spacing that will facilitate the inference of the properties of stellar
cores, including the detection and characterisation of buoyancy glitches
(strong chemical gradients). This asymptotically-based analytical expression is
tested both in models with and without buoyancy glitches. It does not assume
that glitches are small and, consequently, predicts non-sinusoidal
glitch-induced period-spacing variations, as often seen in model and real data.
We show that the glitch position and width inferred from the fitting of the
analytical expression to model data consisting of pure gravity modes are in
close agreement (typically better than 7$\%$ relative difference) with the
properties measured directly from the stellar models. In the case of fitting
mixed-mode model data, the same expression is shown to reproduce well the
numerical results, when the glitch properties are known a priori. In addition,
the fits performed to mixed-mode model data reveal a frequency dependence of
the coupling coefficient, $q$, for a moderate-luminosity red-giant-branch model
star. Finally, we find that fitting the analytical expression to the mixed-mode
period spacings may provide a way to infer the frequencies of the pure acoustic
dipole modes that would exist if no coupling took place between acoustic and

metallicity and a high fraction of Be stars which makes it a privileged
laboratory to study stellar evolution.
  We aim to improve the determination of the cluster parameters and study the
Be phenomenon. Our objective is also to characterise its seven evolved stars by
deriving their atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances.
  We performed a complete analysis combining for the first time $ubvy$
photometry with spectroscopy as well as $Gaia$ Data Release 2. We obtained
spectra with classification purposes for 76 stars and high-resolution
spectroscopy for an in-depth analysis of the blue and red evolved stars. We
identify a new red supergiant and 145 B-type likely members within a radius of
18.7$\pm$1.2 arcmin, which implies an initial mass,
$M_{\textrm{cl}}\approx$5200 M$_{\odot}$. We find a distance of 2.5$\pm$0.2 kpc
for NGC 2345, placing it at $R_{\textrm{GC}}$=10.2$\pm$0.2 kpc. Isochrone
fitting supports an age of 56$\pm$13 Ma, implying masses around 6.5 M$_{\odot}$
for the supergiants. A high fraction of Be stars ($\approx$10$\%$) is found.
From the spectral analysis we estimate for the cluster an average
$v_{\textrm{rad}}$=$+58.6\pm0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ and a low metallicity,
[Fe/H]=$-$0.28$\pm$0.07. We also have determined chemical abundances for Li, O,
Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Rb, Y, and Ba for the evolved stars. The chemical
composition of the cluster is consistent with that of the Galactic thin disc.
One of the K supergiants, S50, is a Li-rich star, presenting an
A(Li)$\approx$2.1. An overabundance of Ba is found, supporting the enhanced
$s$-process.
  NGC 2345 has a low metallicity for its Galactocentric distance, comparable to
typical LMC stars. It is massive enough to serve as a testbed for theoretical
evolutionary models for massive intermediate-mass stars.

radiation hydrodynamics. The system couples the fluid dynamic evolution
equations with the radiative heat transfer. The coupled system is solved by the
gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for the compressible viscous and heat conducting flow
and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for the non-equilibrium radiative
transfer, together with the momentum and energy exchange between these two
phases. For the radiative transfer, due to the possible large variation of
fluid opacity in different regions, the transport of photons in the flow system
is simulated by the multiscale UGKS, which is capable of naturally capturing
the transport process from the free streaming to the diffusive
propagation.Since both GKS and UGKS are finite volume methods,all unknowns are
defined inside each control volume and are discretized consistently for the
hydrodynamic and radiative variables. For the coupled system, the scheme has
the asymptotical preserving (AP) property, such as recovering the equilibrium
diffusion limit for the radiation hydrodynamic equations in the optically thick
region, where the cell size is not limited by photon's mean free path. A few
test cases, such as radiative shock wave problems, are used to validate the
current approach.

electric dipole transitions in the electronic shell. In the absence of
radiation, and if the axion frequency matches a dipole transition, it can
promote the electron into the excited state. The excitation events can be
detected, for example, via subsequent uorescence or photoionization. Here we
calculate the rates of such transitions. For a single light atom and an axion
Compton frequency resonant with a transition energy corresponding to 1 eV, the
rate is on the order of 10^(-22) per year, so a macroscopic atomic sample would
be needed. A fundamental challenge is discriminating against background
processes that may lead to the excitation of the same electric dipole
transition. The ways to enhance the signals to potentially observable levels
exceeding backgrounds and to search for axions in an extended frequency range

confidences with an adaptive linear combination. As bounding box regression can
facilitate a region proposal learning to approach its regression target with
high objectness during training, deep objectness representation learned from
bottom-up evidences can be gradually distilled into CNN by optimization. We
explore different adaptive training curves for BU/TD objectness, and show that
the proposed WSOD^2 can achieve state-of-the-art results.

provide scalable algorithms for large finite-state systems, as well as for
infinite-state systems with finite quotient. Consider parity games on graphs

rich literature of explicit algorithms for parity games, the main results for

studied quantity only in discrete, irregularly distributed points in time. The
stochastic process used by physicists to describe this kind of variables is the
Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW). Despite the popularity of this type of
stochastic processes and strong empirical motivation, models with a long-term
memory within the sequence of time intervals between observations are missing.
Here, we fill this gap by introducing a new family of CTRWs. The memory is
introduced to the model by the assumption that many consecutive time intervals
can be the same. Surprisingly, in this process we can observe a slowly decaying
nonlinear autocorrelation function without a fat-tailed distribution of time
intervals. Our model applied to high-frequency stock market data can
successfully describe the slope of decay of nonlinear autocorrelation function
of stock market returns. The model achieves this result with no dependence

semigroups by considering the special class consisting of those all of whose
finitely generated closed subsemigroups are countable, which are said to be
locally countable. We also call locally countable a pseudovariety V (of finite
semigroups) for which all pro-V semigroups are locally countable. We
investigate operations preserving local countability of pseudovarieties and
show that, in contrast with local finiteness, several natural operations do not
preserve it. We also investigate the relationship of a finitely generated
profinite semigroup being countable with every element being expressable in
terms of the generators using multiplication and the idempotent (omega) power.
The two properties turn out to be equivalent if there are only countably many
group elements, gathered in finitely many regular J-classes. We also show that
the pseudovariety generated by all finite ordered monoids satisfying the
inequality $1\le x^n$ is locally countable if and only if $n=1$.

firstly edge maps of young faces are extracted, a CycleGAN-based network is
adopted to transfer them into edge maps of old faces, then another
pix2pixHD-based network is adopted to transfer the synthesized edge maps,
concatenated with identity information, into old faces. In this way, our method
can generate more realistic transfered images, simultaneously ensuring that
face identity information be preserved well, and the apparent age of the

that our method is feasible for face age translation.

\emph{Arakelov Geo\-me\-try and Diophantine Applications}, in June 2017. They
constitute an introduction to the study of Euclidean lattices and of their
invariants defined in terms of theta series.
  Recall that Euclidean lattice is defined as a pair $\bar{E}:= (E, \Vert
.\Vert)$ where $E$ is some free $\mathbb{Z}$-module of finite rank $E$ and
$\Vert. \Vert$ is some Euclidean norm on the real vector space $E_\mathbb{R} :=
E \otimes \mathbb{R}$. The most basic of these invariants is the non-negative
real number: $$h^0_\theta(\bar{E}) := \log \sum_{v \in E} e^{- \pi \Vert v
\Vert^2}.$$
  In these notes, we explain how such invariants naturally arise when one
investigates basic questions concerning classical invariants of Euclidean
lattices, such as their successive minima, their covering radius, or the number
of lattice points in balls of a given radius.
  We notably discuss their significance from the perspective of Arakelov
geometry and of the analogy between number fields and function fields, their
role (discovered by Banaszczyk) in the derivation of optimal transference
estimates, and their interpretation in terms of the formalism of statistical
thermodynamics.
  These notes have been primarily written for an audience of arithmetic
geometers, but should also be suited to a wider circle of mathematicians and
theoretical physicists with some interest in Euclidean lattices or in the
mathematical foundations of statistical physics.

orbits are under study. All options have LISA-like formations, that is the
triangular formation is 60 deg inclined to the orbit plane. For AMIGO, the
first-generation time delay interferometry is good enough for the laser
frequency noise suppression. We also investigate for each options of orbits

circle). We present robust numerical methods for the solution of Vlasov-like
hyperbolic equations coupled to Poisson-like elliptic equations in such
geometries. We describe a semi-Lagrangian advection solver that employs a novel
set of coordinates, named pseudo-Cartesian coordinates, to integrate the
characteristic equations in the whole domain, including the pole, and a finite
element elliptic solver based on globally $C^1$ smooth splines (Toshniwal et
al., 2017). The two solvers are tested both independently and on a coupled
model, namely the 2D guiding-center model for magnetized plasmas, equivalent to
a vorticity model for incompressible inviscid Euler fluids. The numerical
methods presented show high-order convergence in the space discretization
parameters, uniformly across the computational domain, without effects of order
reduction due to the singularity. Dedicated tests show that the numerical
techniques described can be applied straightforwardly also in the presence of
point charges (equivalently, point-like vortices), within the context of
particle-in-cell methods.

particular within energy constrained, embedded environments. In order to
address these implementation challenges, a broad spectrum of new customized and
heterogeneous hardware architectures have emerged, often accompanied with
co-designed algorithms to extract maximum benefit out of the hardware.
Furthermore, numerous optimization techniques are being explored for neural
networks to reduce compute and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy.
This results in an abundance of algorithmic and architectural choices, some of
which fit specific use cases better than others.
  For system level designers, there is currently no good way to compare the
variety of hardware, algorithm and optimization options. While there are many
benchmarking efforts in this field, they cover only subsections of the embedded
design space. None of the existing benchmarks support essential algorithmic
optimizations such as quantization, an important technique to stay on chip, or
specialized heterogeneous hardware architectures. We propose a novel benchmark
suite, QuTiBench, that addresses this need. QuTiBench is a novel multi-tiered
benchmarking methodology that supports algorithmic optimizations such as

segment localization. Sliding window based methods use predefined search window
sizes, which suffer from redundant computation, while existing anchor-based
approaches fail to yield precise localization. We address this issue by
proposing an end-to-end boundary-aware model, which uses a lightweight branch
to predict semantic boundaries corresponding to the given linguistic

contextual information by explicitly modeling the relationship between the
current element and its neighbors. The most confident segments are subsequently
selected based on both anchor and boundary predictions at the testing stage.

dynamical, physical and chemical evolution of the media in which they are
present. Thanks to facilities such as ALMA and in the future the SKA, their
thermal emission in the (sub)mm to cm has become a convenient way to trace
grain properties. Our aim is to understand the influence of the grain
composition and size distribution on the shape of their SED in dense ISM
regions such as molecular clouds, prestellar cores, YSOs and protoplanetary
discs. Starting from the optical constants defined in the THEMIS model for
amorphous hydrogenated carbon and silicate grains in addition to water ice, we
define 6 material mixtures representative of the expected dust composition in
dense ISM regions. The optical properties of 0.01 micron to 10 cm grains are
then calculated with effective medium and Mie theories. The corresponding SEDs
are calculated for isolated clouds either externally heated by the ISRF alone
or in addition to an internal source. The 3 main outcomes of this study are as
follows. First, the dust mass absorption coefficient strongly depends on both
its composition and size distribution potentially leading to errors in dust
mass estimates by factors up to 3 and 20, respectively. Second, it appears
almost impossible to retrieve the grain composition from the (sub)mm to cm SED
shape alone as its spectral index for lambda > 3 mm does not depend on
composition. Third, using the true dust opacity spectral index to estimate
grain sizes may lead to erroneous findings as the observed spectral index can
be highly modified by the dust temperature distribution along the
line-of-sight, which depends on the specific heating source and on the geometry
of the studied region. Based on the interpretation of only the spectral shape
of (sub)mm to cm SEDs, the determination of the dust masses, compositions and
sizes are highly uncertain.

called ""Gated Propagation Network (GPN)"", learns to propagate messages between
prototypes of different classes on the graph, so that learning the prototype of
each class benefits from the data of other related classes. In GPN, an
attention mechanism aggregates messages from neighboring classes of each class,
with a gate choosing between the aggregated message and the message from the
class itself. We train GPN on a sequence of tasks from many-shot to few shot
generated by subgraph sampling. During training, it is able to reuse and update
previously achieved prototypes from the memory in a life-long learning cycle.

mathematicians. Unfortunately, in proof assistants based on type theory,
equality is appallingly syntactic and, as a result, exploiting equivalences is
cumbersome at best. Parametricity and univalence are two major concepts that
have been explored to transport programs and proofs across type equivalences,
but they fall short of achieving seamless, automatic transport. This work first
clarifies the limitations of these two concepts in isolation, and then devises
a fruitful marriage between both. The resulting concept, univalent
parametricity, is an heterogeneous extension of parametricity strengthened with
univalence that fully realizes programming and proving modulo equivalences. In
addition to the theory of univalent parametricity, we present a lightweight
framework implemented in Coq that allows the user to transparently transfer
definitions and theorems for a type to an equivalent one, as if they were
equal. For instance, this makes it possible to conveniently switch between an
easy-to-reason-about representation and a computationally-efficient
representation, as soon as they are proven equivalent. The combination of
parametricity and univalence supports transport \`a la carte: basic univalent
transport, which stems from a type equivalence, can be complemented with
additional proofs of equivalences between functions over these types, in order
to be able to lift more programs and proofs, as well as to yield more efficient
terms. We illustrate the use of univalent parametricity on several examples,

near-identity coordinate transformations constructed as polynomial transforms.
These are well-defined transformations composed of a finite number of terms

XMM-Newton observations of I Zw 1 in 2015 reveal the presence of a broad and
blueshifted P-Cygni iron K profile, as observed through a blue-shifted
absorption trough at 9 keV and a broad excess of emission at 7 keV in the X-ray
spectra. The profile can be well fitted with a wide angle accretion disk wind,
with an outflow velocity of at least $-0.25c$. In this respect, I Zw 1 may be
an analogous to the prototype fast wind detected in the QSO, PDS 456, while its
overall mass outflow rate is scaled down by a factor $\times50$ due to its
lower black hole mass. The mechanical power of the fast wind in I Zw 1 is
constrained to within $5-15$% of Eddington, while its momentum rate is of the
order unity. Upper-limits placed on the energetics of any molecular outflow,
from its CO profile measured by IRAM, appear to rule out the presence of a
powerful, large scale, energy conserving wind in this AGN. We consider whether
I Zw 1 may be similar to a number of other AGN, such as PDS 456, where the
large scale galactic outflow is much weaker than what is anticipated from

  Prediction: An Extended Replication Study","Conducting a major revision based on the feedback from the Empirical
  Software Engineering Journal",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: The effectiveness of data selection approaches in improving the
performance of cross project defect prediction(CPDP) has been shown in multiple
previous studies. Beside that, replication studies play an important role in
the support of any valid study. Repeating a study using the same or different
subjects can lead to better understandings of the nature of the problem.
  Objective: We use an iterative dataset selection (IDS) approach to generate
training datasets and evaluate them on a set of randomly created validation
datasets in the context of CPDP while considering a higher range of flexibility
which makes the approach more feasible in practice.
  Method: We replicate an earlier study and present some insights into the
achieved results while pointing out some of the shortcomings of the original
study. Using the lessons learned, we propose to use an alternative
training/validation dataset generation approaches which not only is more
feasible in practice, but also achieves slightly better performances. We
compare the results of our experiments to those from scenarios A, B, C and D
from the original study.
  Results:Our experiments reveal that IDS is heavily recall based. The average
recall performance for all test sets is 0.933 which is significantly higher
than that from the replicated method. This in turn comes with a loss in
precision. IDS has the lowest precision among the compared scenarios that use
Decision Table learner. IDS however, achieves comparable or better F-measure
performances. IDS achieves higher mean, median and min F-measure values while
being more stable generally, in comparison with the replicated method.
  Conclusions: We conclude that datasets obtained from iterative/search-based
approaches is a promising way to tackle CPDP. Especially, the performance
increase in terms of both time and performance encourages further investigation
of our approach.

LazyBum, a system that can be considered a lazy version of the recently

Hall monolayers into a van-der-Waals layered crystal typically leads to a
(0;001) weak topological phase, which does not protect the existence of surface
states on the (001) surface. Unexpectedly, recent angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy experiments revealed the presence of surface states dispersing
over large areas of the 001-surface Brillouin zone of jacutingaite single

spin-orbit interactions. Here, we extend the two-dimensional Kane-Mele model to
bulk jacutingaite and unveil the microscopic origin of the gapped nodal line

Wannier functions, we identify a large non-trivial second nearest-layer hopping
term that breaks the standard paradigm of weak topological insulators.
Complemented by this term, the predictions of the Kane-Mele model are in

generic sets of observables. For this reason the literature on exact
measurement uncertainty regions is focused on symmetric sets of observables,
where the symmetries are used to simplify the calculation. We provide a
framework to systematically exploit available symmetries, formulated in terms
of covariance, to simplify problems of measurement uncertainty. Our key result
is that for a wide range figures of merit the optimal compatible approximations
of covariant target observables are themselves covariant. This substantially
simplifies the problem of determining measurement uncertainty regions for cases
where it applies, since the space of covariant observables is typically much
smaller than that of all observables. An intermediate result, which may be
applicable more broadly, is the existence and characterisation of a
covariantisation map, mapping observables to covariant observables. Our
formulation is applicable to finite outcome observables on separable Hilbert
spaces. We conjecture that the restriction of finite outcomes may be lifted,
and explore some of the features a generalisation must have. We demonstrate the
theorem by deriving measurement uncertainty regions for three mutually

generally considered to be gravitational waves of spiral binary stars, thus
confirming the general theory of relativity. Here we present a universal method
for signal wave spectrum analysis, introducing the true conclusions of
numerical calculation and image analysis of GW150914 signal wave. Firstly,
numerical calculation results of GW150914 signal wave frequency change rate
obey the com quantization law which needs to be accurately described by
integers, and there is an irreconcilable difference between the results and the
generalized relativistic frequency equation of the gravitational wave.
Secondly, the assignment of the frequency and frequency change rate of GW10914
signal wave to the generalized relativistic frequency equation of gravitational
wave constructs a non-linear equation group about the mass of wave source, and
the computer image solution shows that the equation group has no GW10914 signal
wave solution. Thirdly, it is not unique to calculate the chirp mass of the
wave source from the different frequencies and change rates of the numerical
relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal wave, and the numerical
relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal wave deviates too far from the
original waveform actually. Other LIGO signal waveforms do not have obvious
characteristics of gravitational frequency variation of spiral binary stars and
lack precise data, so they cannot be used for numerical analysis and image
solution. Therefore, the generalized relativistic frequency equation of
gravitational wave has not been verified by LIGO signal wave up to now. Does
this mean that the gravitational wave signals from some spiral binaries that
may be detected in future obey the same com quantization law? The answer
remains unclear.

structures and, since these methods rely on atlas-to-scan alignment, they may
take long processing times. Recently, methods deploying solutions based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are making the direct analysis of
out-of-the-scanner data feasible. However, current CNN-based solutions
partition the test volume into 2D or 3D patches, which are processed
independently. This entails a loss of global contextual information thereby
negatively impacting the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we design and
test an optimised end-to-end CNN architecture that makes the exploitation of
global spatial information computationally tractable, allowing to process a
whole MRI volume at once. We adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy by
exploiting a large dataset composed by 947 out-of-the-scanner (3 Tesla

different aspects of the world in order to use their language correctly (Sapir,

expressed in a language. Saying ""I am happy"" in English, does not encode any
additional knowledge of the speaker that uttered the sentence. However, many
other languages do have grammatical gender systems and so such knowledge would
be encoded. In order to correctly translate such a sentence into, say, French,
the inherent gender information needs to be retained/recovered. The same
sentence would become either ""Je suis heureux"", for a male speaker or ""Je suis
heureuse"" for a female one. Apart from morphological agreement, demographic
factors (gender, age, etc.) also influence our use of language in terms of word
choices or even on the level of syntactic constructions (Tannen, 1991;
Pennebaker et al., 2003). We integrate gender information into NMT systems. Our
contribution is two-fold: (1) the compilation of large datasets with speaker
information for 20 language pairs, and (2) a simple set of experiments that
incorporate gender information into NMT for multiple language pairs. Our
experiments show that adding a gender feature to an NMT system significantly
improves the translation quality for some language pairs.

proton-neutron pairing modes in the presence of nuclear deformation. The
schematic Hamiltonians that are used contain a quadrupole-quadrupole
interaction as well as isoscalar (T=0) and isovector (T=1) pairing
interactions, but differ in the single particle energies. The objective of the
work is to observe the behavior of GT transitions in different isoscalar and
isovector pairing scenarios, together with the corresponding energy spectra and
rotational properties of the parent and daughter nuclei (42Ca -> 42Sc, 44Ca ->
44Sc, 46Ti -> 46V, 48Ti -> 48V). We also treat the rotational properties of
44Ti and 48Cr. All results are compared with experimental data. The results
obtained from our models depend on the different scenarios that arise, whether
for N = Z or N neq Z nuclei. In the latter case, the presence of an attractive
isoscalar pairing interaction imposes a 1+ ground state in odd-odd nuclei,
contrary to observations for some of the nuclei considered, and it is necessary
to suppress that pairing mode when considering such nuclei. The effect of
varying the strength parameters for the two pairing modes is found to exhibit
different but systematic effects on energy spectra and on GT transition

containing all information about the measurable physical properties, is the

dynamics can be exactly formulated in terms of the quantum effective action,
the solution is in general beyond capabilities of classical computers. In this
work, we present a strategy to determine the non-equilibrium quantum effective
action using analog quantum simulators, and demonstrate our method
experimentally with a quasi one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium.
Building on spatially resolved snapshots of the spin degree of freedom, we
infer the quantum effective action up to fourth order in an expansion in
one-particle irreducible correlation functions at equal times. We uncover a
strong suppression of the irreducible four-vertex emerging at low momenta,
which solves the problem of dynamics in the highly occupied regime far from
equilibrium where perturbative descriptions fail. Similar behaviour in this
non-pertubative regime has been proposed in the context of early-universe
cosmology. Our work constitutes a new realm of large-scale analog quantum

scale with many participants whilst preserving the privacy of their datasets.
Standard federated learning techniques are vulnerable to Byzantine failures,
biased local datasets, and poisoning attacks. In this paper we introduce
Adaptive Federated Averaging, a novel algorithm for robust federated learning
that is designed to detect failures, attacks, and bad updates provided by
participants in a collaborative model. We propose a Hidden Markov Model to
model and learn the quality of model updates provided by each participant
during training. In contrast to existing robust federated learning schemes, we
propose a robust aggregation rule that detects and discards bad or malicious
local model updates at each training iteration. This includes a mechanism that
blocks unwanted participants, which also increases the computational and
communication efficiency. Our experimental evaluation on 4 real datasets show
that our algorithm is significantly more robust to faulty, noisy and malicious
participants, whilst being computationally more efficient than other
state-of-the-art robust federated learning methods such as Multi-KRUM and
coordinate-wise median.

  Constellations?",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many satellite operators are planning to deploy NGSO systems for broadband
communication services in the Ku-, Ka-, and V-band, where some of them have
already launched. Consequently, new challenges are expected for inter-system
satellite coexistence due to the increased interference level and the
complexity of the interactions resulting from the heterogeneity of the
constellations. This is especially relevant for the Ku-band, where the NGSO
systems are most diverse and existing GSO systems, which often support critical
services, must be protected from interference. It is thus imperative to
evaluate the impact of mutual inter-system interference, the efficiency of the
basic interference mitigation techniques, and whether regulatory intervention
is needed for the new systems. We conduct an extensive study of inter-satellite
coexistence in the Ku-band, where we consider all recently proposed NGSO and
some selected GSO systems. Our throughput degradation results suggest that
existing spectrum regulation may be insufficient to ensure GSO protection from
NGSO interference, especially due to the high transmit power of the LEO Kepler
satellites. This also results in strong interference towards other NGSO
systems, where traditional interference mitigation techniques like look-aside
may perform poorly. Specifically, look-aside can be beneficial for large
constellations, but detrimental for small constellations. Furthermore, we
confirm that band-splitting among satellite operators significantly degrades
throughput, also for the Ku-band. Our results overall show that the complexity
of the inter-satellite interactions for new NGSO systems is too high to be
managed via simple interference mitigation techniques. This means that more
sophisticated engineering solutions, and potentially even more strict
regulatory requirements, will be needed to ensure coexistence in emerging,
dense NGSO deployments.

actually the infimum, as is the case for both the topological and
measure-theoretic entropies in the classical situation when the time parameter
is $\mathbb Z$. As a consequence, tree shift entropy becomes somewhat easier to
work with. For example, the statement that the topological entropy of a tree
shift defined by a one-dimensional subshift dominates the topological entropy
of the latter can now be extended from shifts of finite type to arbitrary
subshifts. Adapting to trees the strip method already used to approximate the
hard square constant on $\mathbb Z^2$, we show that the entropy of the hard
square tree shift on the regular $k$-tree increases with $k$, in contrast to
the case of $\mathbb Z^k$. We prove that the strip entropy approximations
increase strictly to the entropy of the golden mean tree shift for
$k=2,\dots,8$ and propose that this holds for all $k \geq 2$. We study the
dynamics of the map of the simplex that advances the vector of ratios of symbol
counts as the width of the approximating strip is increased, providing a fairly
complete description for the golden mean subshift on the $k$-tree for all $k$.
This map provides an efficient numerical method for approximating the entropies
of tree shifts defined by nearest neighbor restrictions. Finally, we show that
counting configurations over certain other patterns besides the natural finite
subtrees yields the same value of entropy for tree SFT's.

paramount importance for the development of near-term technologies that operate
under realistic conditions. Capturing the complete multi-time statistics
defining a stochastic process lies at the heart of any proper treatment of
memory effects. In this thesis, using a novel framework for the
characterisation of quantum stochastic processes, we first solve the long
standing question of unambiguously describing the memory length of a quantum
processes. This is achieved by constructing a quantum Markov order condition
that naturally generalises its classical counterpart for the quantification of
finite-length memory effects. As measurements are inherently invasive in
quantum mechanics, one has no choice but to define Markov order with respect to
the interrogating instruments that are used to probe the process at hand:
different memory effects are exhibited depending on how one addresses the
system, in contrast to the standard classical setting. We then fully
characterise the structural constraints imposed on quantum processes with
finite Markov order, shedding light on a variety of memory effects that can
arise through various examples. Lastly, we introduce an instrument-specific
notion of memory strength that allows for a meaningful quantification of the
temporal correlations between the history and the future of a process for a
given choice of experimental intervention. These findings are directly relevant
to both characterising and exploiting memory effects that persist for a finite
duration. In particular, immediate applications range from developing efficient
compression and recovery schemes for the description of quantum processes with
memory to designing coherent control protocols that efficiently perform
information-theoretic tasks, amongst a plethora of others.

is beneficial for the network to restore the 3D pose of weakly labeled
real-world datasets with the aid of 2D annotations and depth images. While in

Recently, numerical simulations of interacting vortex models have demonstrated
this behavior only near fractional $f$. A fine-grid vortex model is introduced,
which allows to consider both the cases of fractional and integer $f$. The
critical behavior is determined from a scaling analysis of the current-voltage

(PT) to model end-user decision making that deviates from expected utility
theory (EUT), we formulate user association with SPs as a multiple leader
Stackelberg game where each SP offers a bid to each user that includes a data
rate with a certain probabilistic service guarantee and at a given price, while
the user chooses the best offer among multiple such bids. We show that when
users underweight the advertised service guarantees of the SPs (a behavior
observed under uncertainty), the rejection rate of the bids increases
dramatically which in turn decreases the SPs utilities and service rates. To
overcome this, we propose a two-stage learning-based optimized bidding
framework for SPs. In the first stage, we use a support vector machine (SVM)
learning algorithm to predict users' binary decisions (accept/reject bids), and
then in the second stage we cast the utility-optimized bidding problem as a

the measurement process is potentially harmful, needs to be rapid, or is
uneconomical. In such cases, information from previous longitudinal scans of

significantly fewer updating measurements. Our work is based on longitudinal
data acquisition scenarios where we wish to study new changes that evolve
within an object over time, such as in repeated scanning for disease
monitoring, or in tomography-guided surgical procedures. While this is easily
feasible when measurements are acquired from a large number of projection
views, it is challenging when the number of views is limited. If the goal is to
track the changes while simultaneously reducing sub-sampling artefacts, we
propose (1) acquiring measurements from a small number of views and using a
global unweighted prior-based reconstruction. If the goal is to observe details
of new changes, we propose (2) acquiring measurements from a moderate number of
views and using a more involved reconstruction routine. We show that in the
latter case, a weighted technique is necessary in order to prevent the prior
from adversely affecting the reconstruction of new structures that are absent
in any of the earlier scans. The reconstruction of new regions is safeguarded
from the bias of the prior by computing regional weights that moderate the
local influence of the priors. We are thus able to effectively reconstruct both
the old and the new structures in the test. In addition to testing on simulated
data, we have validated the efficacy of our method on real tomographic data.

this study is to suggest a new concept of technology with a systemic-purposeful
perspective for technology analysis. Technology here is a complex system of
artifact, made and_or used by living systems, that is composed of more than one
entity or sub-system and a relationship that holds between each entity and at
least one other entity in the system, selected considering practical, technical
and_or economic characteristics to satisfy needs, achieve goals and_or solve
problems of users for purposes of adaptation and_or survival in environment.
Technology T changes current modes of cognition and action to enable makers
and_or users to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with
consequential environmental threats. Technology, as a complex system, is formed
by different elements given by incremental and radical innovations.
Technological change generates the progress from a system T1 to T2, T3, etc.
driven by changes of technological trajectories and technological paradigms.
Several examples illustrate here these concepts and a simple model with a
preliminary empirical analysis shows how to operationalize the suggested
definition of technology. Overall, then, the role of adaptation (i.e.

emotion classification, i.e. assigning an image with a dominant discrete

subtlety of emotions. In this paper, we study the fine-grained regression
problem of visual emotions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Specifically, we develop a Polarity-consistent Deep Attention Network (PDANet),
a novel network architecture that integrates attention into a CNN with an
emotion polarity constraint. First, we propose to incorporate both spatial and
channel-wise attentions into a CNN for visual emotion regression, which jointly
considers the local spatial connectivity patterns along each channel and the
interdependency between different channels. Second, we design a novel
regression loss, i.e. polarity-consistent regression (PCR) loss, based on the
weakly supervised emotion polarity to guide the attention generation. By
optimizing the PCR loss, PDANet can generate a polarity preserved attention map
and thus improve the emotion regression performance. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the IAPS, NAPS, and EMOTIC datasets, and the results demonstrate
that the proposed PDANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large
margin for fine-grained visual emotion regression. Our source code is released

attractive for a variety of applications including communications and sensing.
For accelerating a research and development work, one often desires to use
off-the-shelf components to build an FPE with a required transmission profile
for a particular application. Usually, multistage FPEs are designed with equal
lengths of cavities followed by determination of the required reflectivities
for realizing a desired transmission profile. As seen in previous works,
fabricated reflectors are usually slightly different from the designed ones
leading to departure from the desired transmission profile of the FPE. Here, we
show a novel digital synthesis of multistage etalons with off-the-shelf

to equal cavity lengths, unequal lengths of cavities provide more number of
poles in the $z$-domain to achieve a desired multicavity FPE transmission
response. For given reflectivities and by determining correct unequal lengths
of cavities with our synthesis technique, we demonstrate a design example of
increasing the FSR followed by its experimental validation. This work is
generalizable to ring resonators, mirrored, and fiber Bragg grating based

observations of a system, given a distribution of observational noise. The
existence of such trajectories is a desirable property of any forecast model.
Gradient descent of indeterminism is a well-established technique for finding
shadowing trajectories in low-dimensional analytical systems. Here we apply it
to the thermally-driven rotating annulus, a laboratory experiment intermediate
in model complexity and physical idealisation between analytical systems and
global, comprehensive atmospheric models. We work in the perfect model scenario
using the MORALS model to generate a sequence of noisy observations in a
chaotic flow regime. We demonstrate that the gradient descent technique
recovers a pseudo-orbit of model states significantly closer to a model
trajectory than the initial sequence. Gradient-free descent is used, where the
adjoint model is set to $\lambda$I in the absence of a full adjoint model. The
indeterminism of the pseudo-orbit falls by two orders of magnitude during the
descent, but we find that the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the
initial, true, model trajectory reaches a minimum and then diverges from truth.
We attribute this to the use of the $\lambda$-adjoint, which is well suited to
noise reduction but not to finely-tuned convergence towards a model trajectory.
We find that $\lambda=0.25$ gives optimal results, and that candidate model
trajectories begun from this pseudo-orbit shadow the observations for up to 80
s, about the length of the longest timescale of the system, and similar to
expected shadowing times based on the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the
truth. There is great potential for using this method with real laboratory
data.

(behaving as standard nucleus with density distribution described with
canonical RMS radius r = $r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}}$ with $r_0$ = 1.2 fm), and the
{\bf ""core""} of the halo nucleus, which surprisingly, does not follow the
standard density distribution with the above RMS radius. In fact the core has
the structure of a tennis-ball (bubble) like nucleus, with a ""hole"" at the
centre of the density distribution. This novel interpretation of the fusion
experiment provides an unambigous support to an almost two decades old model
(Abbas, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 16 (2001) 755), of the halo nuclei. This Quantum
Chromodyanamics based model, succeeds in identifyng all known halo nuclei and
makes clear-cut and unique predictions for new and heavier halo nuclei. This
model supports the existence of tennis-ball (bubble) like core, of even the
giant-neutron halo nuclei. This should prove beneficial to the
experimentalists, to go forward more confidently, in their study of exotic
nuclei.

building blocks for constructing data analyses. When carefully calibrated,
these analyses simultaneously guarantee privacy of the individuals contributing
their data, and accuracy of their results for inferring useful properties about
the population. The compositional nature of differential privacy has motivated
the design and implementation of several programming languages aimed at helping
a data analyst in programming differentially private analyses. However, most of
the programming languages for differential privacy proposed so far provide
support for reasoning about privacy but not for reasoning about the accuracy of
data analyses. To overcome this limitation, in this work we present DPella, a
programming framework providing data analysts with support for reasoning about
privacy, accuracy and their trade-offs. The distinguishing feature of DPella is
a novel component which statically tracks the accuracy of different data
analyses. In order to make tighter accuracy estimations, this component
leverages taint analysis for automatically inferring statistical independence
of the different noise quantities added for guaranteeing privacy. We show the
flexibility of our approach by not only implementing classical counting queries
(e.g., CDFs) but also by analyzing hierarchical counting queries (like those
done by Census Bureaus), where accuracy have different constraints per level
and data analysts should figure out the best manner to calibrate privacy to
meet the accuracy requirements.

is replaced by a linear term plus a correction term, where the correction term
is put under control by an auxiliary variable. The proposed scheme incorporates
a pressure-correction type strategy into the gPAV procedure, and it satisfies a
discrete energy stability property. The scheme entails the computation of two
copies of the velocity and pressure within a time step, by solving an
individual de-coupled linear equation for each of these field variables. Upon
discretization the pressure linear system involves a constant coefficient
matrix that can be pre-computed, while the velocity linear system involves a
coefficient matrix that is updated periodically, once every $k_0$ time steps in
the current work, where $k_0$ is a user-specified integer. The auxiliary
variable, being a scalar-valued number, is computed by a well-defined explicit
formula, which guarantees the positivity of its computed values. It is observed
that the current method can produce accurate simulation results at large (or
fairly large) time step sizes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The impact of the periodic coefficient-matrix update on the overall cost of the
method is observed to be small in typical numerical simulations. Several flow

total of energy generation. Meanwhile, there are tremendous efforts to decrease
the reliance on fossil fuel energies which opens the venue for increasing the
usage of alternative resources such as nuclear energy. Many countries (e.g.
Egypt) are planning to meet increasing electricity demands by increasing both
renewable (especially wind energy) and nuclear energies contributions in
electricity generation. In the planning phase of siting both new Wind Farms
(WFs) and Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), many benefits and challenges exist. An
important aspect taken into consideration during the NPP siting is the
existence of ultimate heat sink which is sea water in most cases. That is why
most NPPs are sited on sea coasts. On the other hand, during WF siting, the
main influential aspect is the existence of good wind resources. Many coastal
areas around the world fulfill this requirement for WF siting. Coupling both
NPPs and WFs in one site or nearby has many benefits and obstacles as well. In
this thesis, based on international experience and literature reviews, the
benefits and obstacles of this coupling/adjacency are studied and evaluated.
Various case studies are carried out to verify the coupling/adjacency concept.

Large Eddy Simulation is carried out in air without heating to study the
development of the turbulent flow. The CFD code used is TrioCFD, a code
developed by the CEA. For validation purpose, the simulation is carried out in
the experimental setup configuration: a closed-loop wind tunnel called TRANSAT.
Two horizontal plates, separated by 0.05 m, are put in the airflow to represent
the amplifier plates. Turbulent boundary layers develop from the plates edges.
Numerically, the entrance flow is a homogeneous planar flow with a constant
velocity at 10 m/s. The results of this Large Eddy Simulation are presented in
this paper as a study of the development of the turbulent boundary layers
created by the plates.

  k-Spaced Amino Acid Pairs with Deep Neural Network","Accepted for oral presentation at 19th 2019 IEEE International

indispensable for the species living in extreme cold weather. These proteins
bind to the ice crystals, hindering their growth into large ice lattice that
could cause physical damage. There are variety of AFPs found in numerous
organisms and due to the heterogeneous sequence characteristics, AFPs are found
to demonstrate a high degree of diversity, which makes their prediction a
challenging task. Herein, we propose a machine learning framework to deal with
this vigorous and diverse prediction problem using the manifolding learning
through composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs. We propose to use the deep
neural network with skipped connection and ReLU non-linearity to learn the
non-linear mapping of protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed
antifreeze protein prediction method called AFP-CKSAAP has shown to outperform
the contemporary methods, achieving excellent prediction scores on standard
dataset. The main evaluater for the performance of the proposed method in this
study is Youden's index whose high value is dependent on both sensitivity and
specificity. In particular, AFP-CKSAAP yields a Youden's index value of 0.82 on
the independent dataset, which is better than previous methods.

without an agreed resolution to many questions. The measurement problem, wave
function collapse and entangled states are mired in complexity and the
difficulty of even agreeing on a definition of a measurement. This paper
explores a completely different aspect of quantum mechanics, the physical
mechanism for phonon quantization, to gain insights into quantum mechanics that
may help address the broader questions.
