over-actuated systems with actuator saturation. The proposed method does not
require uncertainty estimation or a persistent excitation assumption. Using the
element-wise non-symmetric projection algorithm, the adaptive parameters are
restricted to satisfy certain optimality conditions leading to overall closed
loop system stability. Furthermore, a sliding mode controller with a
time-varying sliding surface, working in tandem with the adaptive control
allocation, is proposed to guarantee the outer loop stability and reference
tracking in the presence of control allocation errors and disturbances.
Simulation results are provided, where the Aerodata Model in Research
Environment is used as an over-actuated system with actuator saturation, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

nucleation temperature. There is also a dependence on the time evolution of the
bubble nucleation rate. The gravitational wave peak power and frequency are in
good agreement with published numerical simulations, where bubbles are
nucleated simultaneously. Agreement is particularly good for detonations, but
the total power for deflagrations is predicted higher than numerical

gravitational waves at a longer wavelength than simultaneous nucleation. We
present an improved fit for the predicted gravitational wave power spectrum in
the form of a double broken power law, where the two breaks in the slope happen
at wavenumber corresponding to the mean bubble separation and the thickness of

the difference of the phase boundary speed from the speed of sound.

Typically, the initial velocities of the two colliding objects are specified,

unknown variables. One can write the equation for conservation of momentum, and
either the equation for conservation of energy for the perfectly elastic case,

characterisation. But this cannot be achieved without a careful analysis of the
host star parameters. The system of HD219134 hosts two transiting exoplanets
and at least two additional non-transiting exoplanets. We used the VEGA/CHARA
interferometer to measure the angular diameter of HD219134, leading to a
stellar radius of $R_{\star}=0.726\pm0.014 R_{\odot}$. We also derived the
stellar density from the transits light curves ($\rho_{\star}=1.82\pm0.19
\rho_{\odot}$), which finally gives a direct estimate of the mass
($M_{\star}=0.696\pm0.078 M_{\odot}$) with a correlation of 0.46 between
$R_{\star}$ and $M_{\star}$. This new mass is smaller than that derived from
the C2kSMO stellar evolutionary model, which provides a mass range of
0.755$-$0.810 ($\pm 0.040$) $M_{\odot}$. This allows us to infer the mass,
radius and density of the two transiting exoplanets of the system. We then use
an inference model to obtain the internal parameters of these two transiting
exoplanets. Moreover, we find that planet $b$ and $c$ have smaller radii than
previously estimated ($1.500\pm0.057$ and $1.415\pm0.049 R_{\oplus}$,
respectively); this clearly puts these planets out of the gap in the
exoplanetary radii distribution and validates their super-Earth nature. Planet
$b$ is more massive than planet $c$, but possibly less dense. We investigate
whether this could be caused by partial melting of the mantle and find that
tidal heating due to non-zero eccentricity of planet $b$ may be powerful
enough. The system of HD219134 constitutes a very valuable benchmark for both
stellar physics and exoplanetary science. The direct determination of the
stellar density, radius and mass should be more extensively applied to provide
accurate exoplanets properties and calibrate stellar models.

$\sigma_{\text ess}$ of Schr\""odinger operators on graphs. Especially we focus
on generalizing characterizations which are given in terms of the concept of
right limits. Intuitively the set of right limits of a Schr\""odinger operator
$H$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ includes the limit operators which are obtained by
a sequence of left-shifts (moving away to infinity) of $H$. One
characterization, which is known for such operators is that $\sigma_{\text
ess}(H)$ is equal to the union over the spectra of right limits of $H$.
Additionally, the essential spectrum equals to the union over the sets of
""eigenvalues"" corresponding to bounded eigenfunctions of the right limits of
$H$. The first characterization above (and its generalization to
$\mathbb{Z}^n$) is essentially due to a work by Last-Simon from 2006. In this
work we study the possibility of generalizing these characterizations of
$\sigma_{ess}(H)$ to Schr\""odinger operators on graphs. The work is composed of
the following chapters:
  Chapter 1. An overview, including the setting and the proposed generalization
of the concept of right limits to general graphs.
  Chapter 2. On extending the original Last-Simon argument for the proof of the

interventions that address health disparities (inequities). They ask how
disparities in outcomes may change under hypothetical intervention. Through
study design and assumptions, they can rule out alternate explanations such as
confounding, selection-bias, and measurement error, thereby identifying
potential targets for intervention. Unfortunately, the literature on causal
decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns
that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and
practical value. This paper addresses these concerns by explicitly considering
what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for
(so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgements these choices
convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health
services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize
decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets,
to reflect equity choices, while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable
covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions. For these general formulae, we
provide weighting-based estimators based on adaptations of
ratio-of-mediator-probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting. We discuss when
these estimators reduce to already used estimators under certain equity value
judgements, and a novel adaptation under other judgements.

Clarke exobelt detectability more difficult than previous estimates. We also
consider practical dynamical issues for exobelts, confirming that synchronously
orbiting belts are dynamically unstable around planets in the habitable zones
of M stars, and determining the maximum quasi-stable belt size in these
situations. Using simulations for both G and M stars, we conclude that to have
an even marginally detectable impact on transit light curves, exobelts must be
substantially denser than previous estimates. We also estimate collision rates
for the required satellite densities assuming random orbits, and find they
would present significant monitoring and guidance challenges. If detectable
belts exist, they would require some (possibly high) degree of ordering to
avoid collisions, and must be actively maintained or they will dissipate on
relatively short astronomical timescales. We conclude that detectable exobelts
are likely to be rare, and have extremely low prospects for detection by
transit monitoring from both current and upcoming missions.

power is summable with respect to the uniform measure over the Levi-Civita

based upon the Lebesgue measure. Nevertheless, they lack some properties of the
$L^p$ spaces: for instance, the $\mathcal{L}^p$ spaces are not complete with
respect to the $p$-norm. This motivates the study of the completions of the
$\mathcal{L}^p$ spaces with respect to strong convergence, denoted by
$\mathcal{L}_s^p$. It turns out that the $\mathcal{L}_s^p$ spaces are Banach

results, these spaces are still not rich enough to represent every real
continuous function. For this reason, we settle upon the representation of real
measurable functions as sequences of measurable functions in $\mathcal{R}$ that
weakly converge in measure. We also define a duality between measurable
functions and representatives of continuous functions. This duality enables the
study of some measurable functions that represent real distributions. We focus

step and the consensus step in a distributed optimization framework. The key
motivation for optimize then agree is to guarantee that the disagreement
between the estimates of the agents during every iteration of the distributed
optimization algorithm remains under any apriori specified tolerance; existing
algorithms do not provide such a guarantee which is required in many practical
scenarios. In this method, each agent during each iteration maintains an
estimate of the optimal solution and, utilizes its locally available gradient
information along with a finite-time approximate consensus protocol to move
towards the optimal solution (hence the name Gradient-Consensus algorithm). We
establish that the proposed algorithm has a global R-linear rate of convergence
if the aggregate function $f$ is strongly convex and Lipschitz differentiable.
We also show that under the relaxed assumption of $f_i$'s being convex and
Lipschitz differentiable, the objective function error residual decreases at a
Q-linear rate (in terms of the number of gradient computation steps) until it
reaches a small value, which can be managed using the tolerance value specified
on the finite-time approximate consensus protocol; no existing method in the
literature has such strong convergence guarantees when $f_i$ are not
necessarily strongly convex functions. The communication overhead for the
improved guarantees on meeting constraints and better convergence of our
algorithm is $O(k\log k)$ iterates in comparison to $O(k)$ of the traditional
algorithms. Further, we numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm by solving a distributed logistic regression problem.

aspects of these new algorithms are poorly understood, especially for
structured parameters. To develop statistical inference in this case, we
propose a class of generalized regularized dual averaging (gRDA) algorithms
with constant step size, which improves RDA (Xiao, 2010; Flammarion and Bach,
2017). Weak convergence of gRDA trajectories are studied, and as a consequence,
for the first time in the literature, the asymptotic distributions for online
l1 penalized problems become available. These general results apply to both
convex and non-convex differentiable loss functions, and in particular, recover
the existing regret bound for convex losses (Nemirovski et al., 2009). As
important applications, statistical inferential theory on online sparse linear
regression and online sparse principal component analysis are developed, and
are supported by extensive numerical analysis. Interestingly, when gRDA is
properly tuned, support recovery and central limiting distribution (with mean
zero) hold simultaneously in the online setting, which is in contrast with the
biased central limiting distribution of batch Lasso (Knight and Fu, 2000).
Technical devices, including weak convergence of stochastic mirror descent, are
developed as by-products with independent interest. Preliminary empirical
analysis of modern image data shows that learning very sparse deep neural
networks by gRDA does not necessarily sacrifice testing accuracy.

restrictions on the corresponding Mueller matrices associated to the said

328-334 (2000)], the demonstration was incomplete. In this paper, the set of
two necessary and sufficient conditions for a Mueller matrix to represent a
passive medium are determined and demonstrated on the basis of its arbitrary
decomposition as a convex combination of nondepolarizing and passive pure
Mueller matrices. The procedure followed to solve the problem provides also an
appropriate framework to identify the Mueller matrix that, among the family of
proportional passive Mueller matrices, exhibits the maximal physically
achievable intensity transmittance. Beyond the theoretical interest on the
rigorous characterization of passivity, the results obtained, when applied to
absolute Mueller polarimetry, also provide a criterion to discard those
experimentally measured Mueller matrices that do not satisfy the passivity

winds of the massive stars in the Orion OB associations. The formation history
and current structure of the superbubble are still poorly understood. It
possibly consists of a combination of nested shells along the line of sight. We
have investigated the composite structure of the Eridanus side of the
superbubble in the light of a new decomposition of the atomic and molecular
gas. We used HI and CO emission lines to separate coherent gas shells in space
and velocity, and we studied their relation to the warm ionised gas probed in
H$\alpha$ emission, to the hot plasma emitting X-rays, and to the magnetic
fields traced by dust polarised emission. We also constrained the relative
distances to the clouds using dust reddening maps and X-ray absorption. We used
the dust polarisation data to estimate the plane-of-sky components of the
magnetic field in several clouds and along the outer rim of the superbubble.
Our gas decomposition has revealed several shells inside the superbubble that
span distances from about 150 pc to 250 pc. One of these shells forms a nearly
complete ring filled with hot plasma. Other shells likely correspond to the
layers of swept-up gas that is compressed behind the expanding outer shock
wave. We used the gas and magnetic-field data downstream of the shock to derive
a shock expansion velocity close to 20 km/s. Taking the X-ray absorption by the
gas into account, we find that the pressure of the hot plasma inside the
superbubble exceeds that in the Local Bubble. It comprises a mix of hotter (3-9
MK) and cooler (0.3-1.2 MK) gas along the lines of sight. The magnetic field
along the western and southern rims and in the approaching wall of the
superbubble appears to be shaped and compressed by the ongoing expansion. We
find plane-of-sky magnetic strengths ranging from 3 to 15 $\mu$G along the rim.

reveal remarkable semiconductor properties, are the subject of active
experimental research.Recently it has been shown experimentally that quantum
yield in MoS2 and WSe2 monoatomic layers can reach values close to unity when
electrostatic doping makes them intrinsic semiconductors. However, the
available theoretical description does not give an understanding of the
physical mechanisms underlying in the gate voltage control of quantum
yield.This work is an attempt to propose a consistent semi-phenomenological
theory of photo-induced charge carriers relaxation in 2D-TMDs, which allows
obtaining an analytical dependence of the quantum yield on the voltage applied
to the FET gate. We consider a standard experimental situation, when the 2D-TMD
monolayer and the metal gate are plates of a flat capacitor, and the capacitor
charge is proportional to the gate voltage. The dependences of the TMD
monolayers quantum yield on the gate voltage and the carrier generation rate
have been calculated for the cases of the prevailing recombination of free
electrons and holes (radiative and non-radiative Auger recombination) and
recombination of excitons (radiative and Auger recombination). In both cases
analytical expressions were derived for the dependence of quantum yield on the
gate voltage and photo-induced carriers generation rate at a fixed gate
voltage. Quantitative agreement with experiment allows concluding about the
relevance of the proposed theoretical model for the description of carriers
photo-generation and recombination in 2D-TMD monolayers. Obtained results
demonstrate the possibilities of 2D-TMD quantum yield control by the gate
voltage and indicate that 2D-TMDs are promising candidates for modern
optoelectronics devices.

(RA) because RA in a sample (e.g., stool) can be considered as an approximation
of RA in an entire ecosystem (e.g., gut). However, inference on RA suffers from
the fact that RA are calculated by dividing absolute abundances (AA) over the
common denominator (CD), the summation of all AA (i.e., library size). Because
of that, perturbation in one taxon will result in a change in the CD and thus
cause false changes in RA of all other taxa, and those false changes could lead
to false positive/negative findings. We propose a novel analysis approach
(IFAA) to make robust inference on AA of an ecosystem that can circumvent the
issues induced by the CD problem and compositional structure of RA. IFAA can
also address the confounding effect of library size and handle zero-inflated
data structures. IFAA identifies microbial taxa associated with the covariates
in Phase one and estimates the association parameters by employing an
independent reference taxon in Phase two. Two real data applications are
presented and extensive simulations show that IFAA outperforms other
established existing approaches by a big margin in the presence of confounding

Low-Density-Parity Check (LDPC) and Reed Solomon (RS) encoding schemes in
battling and correcting the burst error caused by the clipping distortion
occurred due to the dynamic range constraints in an Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based Visible Light Communication (VLC). The
unipolar conversion applied to the output of the multiplexer in this system
results in a clipping noise which distorts the data symbols on the subcarriers
in OFDM block. Considering that such distortion impacts the data symbol on each
subcarrier differently, RS and LDP are used to encode the data block before
being modulated for mapping the OFDM block. In order to control the extreme
value of the output of the multiplexer, the transmitter applies puncturing to
the generated codeword before mapping OFDM subcarriers, leaving the
corresponding subcarriers of the punctured symbols empty. This will lead to the
reduction of clipping events in the optical front-end and will mitigate the
impact of nonlinear distortion on the modulated symbols for the occupied
subcarriers. The redundancy in the codeword generated by the encoder is used
not only to control the clipping probability by shortening the number of active
subcarriers but also for the reconstruction of the original codeword and
correction of the errors caused by channel noise. This work investigates the
ability of LDCP and RS encoders in battling the effects of clipping noise in
the frequency domain and compares their performances in improving the bit error

more flexibility to accommodate abrupt market changes, e.g. financial crisis,
we extend classic OGARCH model by incorporating a two-state Markov

recurrent systemic regime shifts. Empirical results show that this
generalization resolves the problem of excessive persistency effectively and
greatly enhances OGARCH's ability to adapt to sudden market breaks while
preserving OGARCH's most attractive features such as dimension reduction and
multi-step ahead forecasting. By constructing a global minimum variance

derive a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the multivariate $\ell_1$-median with

concentrates around its true value at $n^{-1/2}$-rate and its credible sets
have asymptotically correct frequentist coverage. In particular, asymptotic
normality results for the empirical multivariate median with general
$\ell_p$-norm is also derived in the course of the proof which extends the
results from the case $p=2$ in the literature to a general $p$. The technique
involves approximating the posterior Dirichlet process by a Bayesian bootstrap
process and deriving a conditional Donsker theorem. We also obtain analogous
results for an affine equivariant version of the multivariate $\ell_1$-median

results are extended to a joint distribution of multivariate quantiles. The
accuracy of the asymptotic result is confirmed by a simulation study. We also

thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the
question of how recorded activity relates to the theoretical models of
computations underlying performance. In the context of decision making in
rodents, patterns of functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical
neurons, as well as broadly distributed choice information in both excitatory
and inhibitory populations, were recently reported [1]. The straightforward
interpretation of these data suggests a mechanism relying on specific patterns
of anatomical connectivity to achieve selective pools of inhibitory as well as
excitatory neurons. We investigate an alternative mechanism for the emergence
of these experimental observations using a computational approach. We find that
a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates
single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and
indistinguishable excitatory and inhibitory readout weight distributions, as
observed in recorded neural populations. Further, we make the readily
verifiable experimental predictions that, for this type of evidence
accumulation task, there are no anatomically defined sub-populations of neurons
representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes
with the details of the task. This work suggests that distributed stimulus
selectivity and patterns of functional organization in population codes could
be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.

depend sensitively on a few pivotal components. Using the information geometry

pivotal components to which coarse-grained, or aggregate, properties are
sensitive. As an example, we introduce our approach on a reduced toy model with
a median voter who always votes in the majority. The sensitivity of
majority-minority divisions to changing voter behaviour pinpoints the unique
role of the median. More generally, the sensitivity identifies pivotal
components that precisely determine collective outcomes generated by a complex
network of interactions. Using perturbations to target pivotal components in
the models, we analyse datasets from political voting, finance and Twitter.
Across these systems, we find remarkable variety, from systems dominated by a
median-like component to those whose components behave more equally. In the
context of political institutions such as courts or legislatures, our
methodology can help describe how changes in voters map to new collective
voting outcomes. For economic indices, differing system response reflects
varying fiscal conditions across time. Thus, our information-geometric approach
provides a principled, quantitative framework that may help assess the
robustness of collective outcomes to targeted perturbation and compare social

system handles data operations by intercepting POSIX calls, memory-mapping the
underlying file, and serving the read and overwrites using processor loads and

phenomena opening up intriguing opportunities for practical applications in
biology, medicine, chemistry and photonics. Here we study, theoretically and
experimentally, the response of pancake-shaped liquid drops supported by a
solid plate that vertically vibrates at a single, low acoustic range frequency.
When the vibration amplitudes are small, the primary response of the drop is
harmonic at the frequency of the vibration. However, as the amplitude
increases, the half-frequency subharmonic Faraday waves are excited
parametrically on the drop surface. We develop a simple hydrodynamic model of a
one-dimensional liquid drop to analytically determine the amplitudes of the
harmonic and the first superharmonic components of the linear response of the
drop. In the nonlinear regime, our numerical analysis reveals an intriguing
cascade of instabilities leading to the onset of subharmonic Faraday waves,
their modulation instability and chaotic regimes with broadband power spectra.
We show that the nonlinear response is highly sensitive to the ratio of the
drop size and Faraday wavelength. The primary bifurcation of the harmonic waves
is shown to be dominated by a period-doubling bifurcation, when the drop height
is comparable with the width of the viscous boundary layer. Experimental
results conducted using low-viscosity ethanol and high-viscocity canola oil
drops vibrated at 70 Hz are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of

benchmarks on natural images with only an accuracy metric end up pushing the
models to exploit the dataset biases and cannot provide any interpretable
justification, which severally hinders advances in high-level question
answering. In this work, we propose a new HVQR benchmark for evaluating
explainable and high-order visual question reasoning ability with three
distinguishable merits: 1) the questions often contain one or two relationship
triplets, which requires the model to have the ability of multistep reasoning
to predict plausible answers; 2) we provide an explicit evaluation on a
multistep reasoning process that is constructed with image scene graphs and
commonsense knowledge bases; and 3) each relationship triplet in a large-scale
knowledge base only appears once among all questions, which poses challenges
for existing networks that often attempt to overfit the knowledge base that
already appears in the training set and enforces the models to handle unseen
questions and knowledge fact usage. We also propose a new knowledge-routed
modular network (KM-net) that incorporates the multistep reasoning process over
a large knowledge base into visual question reasoning. An extensive dataset
analysis and comparisons with existing models on the HVQR benchmark show that
our benchmark provides explainable evaluations, comprehensive reasoning

IGCIP can improve hearing outcomes for CI recipients. However, the sensitivity

that the population structure is homogeneous, meaning all individuals have the
same number of interaction partners, or that the social good is of one
particular type. Here, we explore general evolutionary dynamics for arbitrary
spatial structures and social goods. We find that heterogeneous networks,
wherein some individuals have many more interaction partners than others, can
enhance the evolution of prosocial behaviors. However, they often accumulate
most of the benefits in the hands of a few highly-connected individuals, while
many others receive low or negative payoff. Surprisingly, selection can favor
producers of social goods even if the total costs exceed the total benefits. In
summary, heterogeneous structures have the ability to strongly promote the
emergence of prosocial behaviors, but they also create the possibility of
generating large inequality.

Here, we investigate in more detail how this broken translation invariance
manifests itself. This allows to disentangle artificial broken translation
invariance effects from the genuine strongly correlated effects captured by
CDMFT. We report artificial density waves taking the shape of the
cluster---cluster density waves---in all our zero temperature CDMFT solutions,
including pair density waves in the superconducting state. We discuss the
limitations of periodization regarding this phenomenon, and we present
mean-field density-wave models that reproduce CDMFT results at low energy in
the superconducting state. We then discuss how these artificial density waves
help the agreement of CDMFT with high temperature superconducting cuprates
regarding the low-energy spectrum, in particular for subgap structures observed
in tunnelling microscopy. We relate these subgap structures to nodal and
anti-nodal gaps in our results, similar to those observed in photoemission

be a key ingredient to explain some features of the low-energy underdoped

learning to a great degree. While effective for relatively short-term time
integration, when long time integration of the time-dependent PDEs is sought,
the time-space domain may become arbitrarily large and hence training of the
neural network may become prohibitively expensive. To this end, we develop a
parareal physics-informed neural network (PPINN), hence decomposing a long-time
problem into many independent short-time problems supervised by an
inexpensive/fast coarse-grained (CG) solver. In particular, the serial CG
solver is designed to provide approximate predictions of the solution at
discrete times, while initiate many fine PINNs simultaneously to correct the
solution iteratively. There is a two-fold benefit from training PINNs with
small-data sets rather than working on a large-data set directly, i.e.,
training of individual PINNs with small-data is much faster, while training the
fine PINNs can be readily parallelized. Consequently, compared to the original
PINN approach, the proposed PPINN approach may achieve a significant speedup
for long-time integration of PDEs, assuming that the CG solver is fast and can
provide reasonable predictions of the solution, hence aiding the PPINN solution
to converge in just a few iterations. To investigate the PPINN performance on
solving time-dependent PDEs, we first apply the PPINN to solve the Burgers
equation, and subsequently we apply the PPINN to solve a two-dimensional
nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation. Our results demonstrate that PPINNs
converge in a couple of iterations with significant speed-ups proportional to
the number of time-subdomains employed.

methods for training robust models to defend against adversarial examples.
However, adversarially trained models often lack adversarially robust
generalization on unseen testing data. Recent works show that adversarially
trained models are more biased towards global structure features. Instead, in
this work, we would like to investigate the relationship between the
generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, as the
robust local features generalize well for unseen shape variation. To learn the
robust local features, we develop a Random Block Shuffle (RBS) transformation
to break up the global structure features on normal adversarial examples. We
continue to propose a new approach called Robust Local Features for Adversarial
Training (RLFAT), which first learns the robust local features by adversarial
training on the RBS-transformed adversarial examples, and then transfers the
robust local features into the training of normal adversarial examples. To
demonstrate the generality of our argument, we implement RLFAT in currently
state-of-the-art adversarial training frameworks. Extensive experiments on
STL-10, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that RLFAT significantly improves both the
adversarially robust generalization and the standard generalization of
adversarial training. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models capture more
local features of the object on the images, aligning better with human

extrapolation techniques produce non-smooth transitions from the true surface

Feathering and Thin Plate Spline approaches both yielded smooth transitions.

models that output calibrated probability estimates---those representative of

that popular recalibration methods like Platt scaling and temperature scaling
are (i) less calibrated than reported, and (ii) current techniques cannot
estimate how miscalibrated they are. An alternative method, histogram binning,
has measurable calibration error but is sample inefficient---it requires
$O(B/\epsilon^2)$ samples, compared to $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for scaling methods,
where $B$ is the number of distinct probabilities the model can output. To get
the best of both worlds, we introduce the scaling-binning calibrator, which
first fits a parametric function to reduce variance and then bins the function
values to actually ensure calibration. This requires only $O(1/\epsilon^2 + B)$
samples. Next, we show that we can estimate a model's calibration error more
accurately using an estimator from the meteorological community---or
equivalently measure its calibration error with fewer samples ($O(\sqrt{B})$
instead of $O(B)$). We validate our approach with multiclass calibration
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where we obtain a 35% lower calibration
error than histogram binning and, unlike scaling methods, guarantees on true
calibration. In these experiments, we also estimate the calibration error and
ECE more accurately than the commonly used plugin estimators. We implement all

recent papers have shown that simpler, properly tuned models are at least

the case for text generation from structured and unstructured data. We consider
neural table-to-text generation and neural question generation (NQG) tasks for
text generation from structured and unstructured data, respectively.
Table-to-text generation aims to generate a description based on a given table,
and NQG is the task of generating a question from a given passage where the
generated question can be answered by a certain sub-span of the passage using
NN models. Experimental results demonstrate that a basic attention-based
seq2seq model trained with the exponential moving average technique achieves
the state of the art in both tasks. Code is available at

annotating real world data is time-consuming and expensive, enabling robots to

system for self-supervised 6D object pose estimation. Starting from modules
trained in simulation, our system is able to label real world images with
accurate 6D object poses for self-supervised learning. In addition, the robot
interacts with objects in the environment to change the object configuration by
grasping or pushing objects. In this way, our system is able to continuously
collect data and improve its pose estimation modules. We show that the
self-supervised learning improves object segmentation and 6D pose estimation
performance, and consequently enables the system to grasp objects more
reliably. A video showing the experiments can be found at

varying embedding delay time is investigated experimentally and theoretically.
High resolution maps of the entropy difference is observed over the range of
the injection-feedback parameter space. We also clarify an inverse relationship
between the entropy rate and time delay signature of laser chaos over a wide
range of parameters. Compared to the original chaos, the time delay signature
is suppressed up to 95% with the minimum of 0.015 via frequency-band extractor,
and the experiment agrees well with the theory. Our system provides a
commendable entropy evaluation and source for physical random number

Starting as a classical zero frequency ion fluid instability it saturates
quasi-linearly at very low magnetic level, while forming elongated magnetic
bubbles which trap the electron component to perform an adiabatic bounce motion
along the magnetic field. {Further evolution of the mirror mode towards a
stationary state is determined by the bouncing trapped electrons which interact
with the thermal level of ion sound waves, generate attractive wake potentials
which give rise to formation of electron pairs in the lowest-energy singlet
state of two combined electrons. Pairing takes preferentially place near the
bounce-mirror points where the pairs become spatially locked with all their
energy in the gyration. The resulting large anisotropy of pairs enters the
mirror growth rate in the quasi-linearly stable mirror mode. It breaks the
quasilinear stability and causes further growth. Pressure balance is either
restored by dissipation of the pairs and their anisotropy or inflow of plasma
from the environment. In the first case new pairs will continuously form until
equilibrium is reached. In the final state the fraction of pairs can be
estimated. This process is open to experimental verification. To our knowledge
it is the only process where in high temperature plasma pairing may occur and

However, such manual assessment requires the detection of thousands of strut
points within the stent. This is a challenging, tedious, and time-consuming
task because the strut points usually appear as small, irregular shaped objects

shear counterintuitively acts as a jamming mechanism. Moreover, at the brink of
this transition, a thickening material exhibits fluctuations that extend both
spatially and temporally. Despite recent extensive research, the origins of
such spatiotemporal fluctuations remain unidentified. Here, we investigate
large fluctuations in DST by using versatile tools of stochastic
thermodynamics. We discover a non-equilibrium dichotomy in the underlying
mechanisms that give rise to large fluctuations and demonstrate that this
dichotomy is a manifestation of novel collective behaviors across the
transition. We then reveal the origin of spatiotemporal fluctuations in the

thermodynamics tools in investigating non-equilibrium phase transitions, and
demonstrates that these transitions are accompanied by simple dichotomies. We

velocity distribution function in a plasma becomes non-local and the electrons
can be described by a single global distribution function . This is also the
regime required for non-local collisonless (stochastic) heating in oscillating
and spatially inhomogeneous electric fields. Solution of the Boltzmann equation
under these conditions requires usually computationally involving
multi-dimensional PIC/MC simulations. The necessity of multi-dimensional
simulation arises mainly from the complicated time and space dependence of the
collisionless electron heating process. Here it is shown that a time, volume,
und solid angle averaged Fokker-Planck operator for the interaction of
electrons with an external field can replace the local Ohmic heating operator
resulting from a two-term approximation of the Boltzmann equation. This allows
consistent treatment of collisional as well as collisonless heating. This
operator combined with the dissipative operators for interaction with neutrals,
as resulting from the two-term approximation, plus an additional operator for
surface losses provide altogether a kinetic description for the determination
of the global static and isotropic distribution function of the system. The new
operators are relatively easy to integrate in classical local Boltzmann solvers
and allow for a fast calculation of the distribution function. As an example,
an operator describing non-local collisionless as well as collisional heating
in inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) is derived. The resulting distribution
function can then be used to calculate rates and moments in a fluid model of
the plasma, similarly to the common practice in the local and highly
collisional case. A certain limitation of the above concept is the necessity of
using pre-defined field structures.

sometimes suffer from failures and errors in locomotion, like unevenly

that go unnoticed by the odometry of the robot. Other factors that influence
the locomotion performance of the robot, like the weight and distribution of
the payload, the terrain over which the robot is driving or the battery charge
could not be compensated for by the PID speed or position controller of the
robot, because of the physical limits of the system. Traditional planning
systems are oblivious to those problems and may thus plan unfeasible
trajectories. Also, the path following modules oblivious to those problems will
generate sub-optimal motion patterns, if they can get to the goal at all.
  In this paper, we present an adaptive path planning algorithm that is
tolerant to such degraded locomotion conditions. We do this by constantly
observing the executed motions of the robot via simultaneously localization and
mapping (SLAM). From the executed path and the given motion commands, we
constantly on the fly collect and cluster motion primitives (MP), which are in
turn used for planning. Therefore the robot can automatically detect and adapt
to different locomotion conditions and reflect those in the planned paths.

the localization of query images. However, in environments with drastically
varying conditions (e.g. illumination changes, seasons, occlusion, dynamic

challenging problem. In this paper, a novel domain-invariant feature learning
method (DIFL) is proposed based on ComboGAN, a multi-domain image translation
network architecture. By introducing a feature consistency loss (FCL) between
the encoded features of the original image and translated image in another
domain, we are able to train the encoders to generate domain-invariant features

query image is first encoded using the encoder belonging to the query domain to
obtain a domain-invariant feature vector. We then preform retrieval by
selecting the database image with the most similar domain-invariant feature
vector. We validate the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset, where we
outperform state-of-the-art learning-based descriptors in retrieval-based
localization for high and medium precision scenarios.

have observed a significant enhancement in its saturation magnetization (Ms)

from those results, here, we aim to explore its magnetocaloric properties near
the Tc. The magnetic entropy change shows a positive anomaly at 1252 K.
Magnetic entropy change increases linearly with the magnetic field, and a large
value of ~15 J/Kg-K is detected under a moderate field of 14 kOe. It leads to a
net relative cooling power of 89 J/Kg for the magnetic field change of 14 kOe.
To confirm the nature of magnetic phase transition, a detailed study of its
magnetization is performed. The Arrott plot and nature of the universal curve
conclude that FM to PM phase transition in the present system is of

Markov chain Monte Carlo optimisation algorithm in which we assume a Sersic
profile for single-component models and a combination of a Sersic bulge and
near-exponential disc (0.5 < n < 1.5) for double-component models. We
investigate the effect of bulges on the atomic hydrogen (HI) content in
galaxies by revisiting the HI-to-stellar mass scaling relations with the
bulge-to-total ratio measured in the ProFit decompositions. We show that, at
both fixed total and disc stellar mass, more bulge-dominated galaxies have
systematically lower HI masses, implying that bulge-dominated galaxies with
large HI reservoirs are rare in the local Universe. We see similar trends when
separating galaxies by a bulge-to-total ratio based either on luminosity or
stellar mass, however, the trends are more evident with luminosity.
Importantly, when controlling for both stellar mass and star formation rate,
the separation of atomic gas content reduces to within 0.3 dex between galaxies
of different bulge-to-total ratios. Our findings suggest that the presence of a
photometric bulge has little effect on the global HI gas reservoirs of local
galaxies.

this paper we extend the labels by minimising the constrained discrete
$p$-Dirichlet energy. Under suitable conditions the discrete problem can be
connected, in the large data limit, with the minimiser of a weighted continuum
$p$-Dirichlet energy with the same constraints. We take advantage of this
connection by designing numerical schemes that first estimate the density of
the data and then apply PDE methods, such as pseudo-spectral methods, to solve
the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. We prove that our scheme is
consistent in the large data limit for two methods of density estimation:
kernel density estimation and spline kernel density estimation.

aiming to recover a low dimensional structure, namely a manifold, underlying
the high dimensional data. Recovering the manifold requires the noise to be of
certain concentration. Existing methods address this problem by constructing an
approximated manifold based on the tangent space estimation at each sample
point. Although theoretical convergence for these methods is guaranteed, either
the samples are noiseless or the noise is bounded. However, if the noise is
unbounded, which is a common scenario, the tangent space estimation at the
noisy samples will be blurred. Fitting a manifold from the blurred tangent
space might increase the inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new
manifold-fitting method, by which the output manifold is constructed by
directly estimating the tangent spaces at the projected points on the
underlying manifold, rather than at the sample points, to decrease the error
caused by the noise. Assuming the noise is unbounded, our new method provides
theoretical convergence in high probability, in terms of the upper bound of the
distance between the estimated and underlying manifold. The smoothness of the
estimated manifold is also evaluated by bounding the supremum of twice
difference above. Numerical simulations are provided to validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of our method over other
relevant manifold fitting methods. Finally, our method is applied to real data
examples.

The original mean-variance framework is appealing because it is very efficient
from a computational point of view. However, it also has one well-established
failing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial
point of view. Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real
alternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact
that most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life
although they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that
they can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of
assets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable
to manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets. However, the emergence
and the rapid development of robo-advisors means that we need to rethink
portfolio optimization and go beyond the traditional mean-variance optimization
approach. Another industry has faced similar issues concerning large-scale
optimization problems. Machine learning has long been associated with linear
and logistic regression models. Again, the reason was the inability of
optimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems.
Nevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the
development and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced
impressive results. The goal of this paper is to show how portfolio allocation
can benefit from the development of these large-scale optimization algorithms.
Not all of these algorithms are useful in our case, but four of them are
essential when solving complex portfolio optimization problems. These four
algorithms are the coordinate descent, the alternating direction method of
multipliers, the proximal gradient method and the Dykstra's algorithm.

structure and non-Hermitian skin effect, without analogs in their static or
Hermitian counterparts. In this work we investigate the exceptional
band-touching points in the Floquet quasi-energy bands, the topological
characterization of such exceptions points and the Floquet non-Hermitian skin
effect (FNHSE). Specifically, we exploit the simplicity of periodically
quenched two-band systems in one dimension or two dimensions to analytically
obtain the Floquet effective Hamiltonian as well as locations of the many
exceptional points possessed by the Floquet bulk bands. Two different types of
topological winding numbers are used to characterize the topological features.
Bulk-edge correspondence (BBC) is naturally found to break down due to FNHSE,
which can be drastically different among different bulk states. Remarkably,
given the simple nature of our model systems, recovering the BBC is doable in
practice only for certain parameter regime where a low-order truncation of the
characteristic polynomial (which determines the Floquet band structure) becomes
feasible. Furthermore, irrespective of which parameter regime we work with, we
find a number of intriguing aspects of Floquet topological zero modes and $\pi$
modes. For example, under the open boundary condition zero edge modes and $\pi$
edge modes can individually coalesce and localize at two different boundaries.
These anomalous edge states can also switch their accumulation boundaries when
certain system parameter is tuned. These results indicate that non-Hermitian
Floquet topological phases, though more challenging to understand than their
Hermitian counterparts, can be extremely rich in the presence of FNHSE.

selection of operations during training with a schedule. Technically, an
architecture or a cell is represented as a directed graph. Our SDAS gradually
fixes the operations on the edges in the graph in a progressive and scheduled
manner, as opposed to a one-step decision of operations for all the edges once
the training completes in existing DAS, which may make the architecture
brittle. Moreover, we enlarge the search space of SDAS particularly for video
recognition by devising several unique operations to encode spatio-temporal
dynamics and demonstrate the impact in affecting the architecture search of
SDAS. Extensive experiments of architecture learning are conducted on CIFAR10,
Kinetics10, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, and superior results are reported when
comparing to DAS method. More remarkably, the search by our SDAS is around
2-fold faster than DAS. When transferring the learnt cells on CIFAR10 and

autonomous driving, augmented reality and robotics. In particular, we propose a
two step procedure. During the first step we train a convolutional neural

corresponding local coordinates for each instance of a static object (e.g. a
building). During the second step we obtain scene coordinates by combining
object center coordinates and local coordinates and use them to perform 6-DoF

time-consuming to collect and annotate large-scale training sets. 2) It usually

  Lattices",,,,,"math.CO cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Whitney numbers of the first kind of combinatorial geometries.
The first part of the paper is devoted to general results relating the
M\""{o}bius functions of nested atomistic lattices, extending some classical
theorems in combinatorics. We then specialize our results to restriction
geometries, i.e., to sublattices $\mathcal{L}(A)$ of the lattice of subspaces
of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear space, say $X$, generated by a set of projective
points $A \subseteq X$. In this context, we introduce the notion of subspace
distribution, and show that partial knowledge of the latter is equivalent to
partial knowledge of the Whitney numbers of $\mathcal{L}(A)$. This refines a
classical result by Dowling.
  The most interesting applications of our results are to be seen in the theory
of higher-weight Dowling lattices (HWDLs), to which we dovote the second and
most substantive part of the paper. These combinatorial geometries were
introduced by Dowling in 1971 in connection with fundamental problems in coding
theory, and further studied, among others, by Zaslavsky, Bonin, Kung, Brini,
and Games. To date, still very little is known about these lattices. In
particular, the techniques to compute their Whitney numbers have not been
discovered yet. In this paper, we bring forward the theory of HWDLs, computing
their Whitney numbers for new infinite families of parameters. Moreover, we
show that the second Whitney numbers of HWDLs are polynomials in the underlying
field size $q$, whose coefficients are expressions involving the Bernoulli
numbers. This reveals a new link between combinatorics, coding theory, and
number theory. We also study the asymptotics of the Whitney numbers of HWDLs as
the field size grows, giving upper bounds and exact estimates in some cases. In
passing, we obtain new results on the density functions of error-correcting
codes.

Microresonators fabricated in planar structures such as silicon nitride (Si3N4)
allow for dispersion engineering and the possibility to monolithically
integrate the microcomb with other photonic devices. However, the relatively
large refractive index contrast and the tight optical confinement required for
dispersion engineering make it challenging to attain Si3N4 microresonators with
Qs > 10 000 000 using standard subtractive processing methods. In this work, we
achieve ultra-smooth Si3N4 microresonators featuring mean intrinsic Qs around
11 million. The cross-section geometry can be precisely engineered in the
telecommunications band to achieve either normal or anomalous dispersion, and
we demonstrate the generation of mode-locked dark-pulse Kerr combs as well as
soliton microcombs. Such high-Qs allow us to generate soliton microcombs with
photodetectable repetition rates, demonstrated here for the first time in Si3N4
microresonators fabricated using a subtractive processing method. These results
enhance the possibilities for co-integration of microcombs with
high-performance photonic devices, such as narrow-linewidth external-cavity
diode lasers, ultra-narrow filters and demultiplexers.

transition is changed to a fluctuational region in the phase diagram that
reveals two types of critical behaviors. These are regimes of Dicke model (with

show both in simulations and with ex vivo measurements that resolutions close

the correlators of the corresponding primary operators in the chiral half of

(iii) the non-abelian Toda theory where the Liouville field is dual to the

that a consistent restriction to rigid AdS$_2$ background requires a non-zero

Liouville potential from its familiar flat-space form. We show that the
Liouville scalar and its fermionic partner are dual to the chiral half of the

  2019",,,,"cs.DS cs.CL cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of recognizing regular languages in a variant of the
streaming model of computation, called the sliding window model. In this model,
we are given a size of the sliding window $n$ and a stream of symbols. At each
time instant, we must decide whether the suffix of length $n$ of the current
stream (""the active window"") belongs to a given regular language.
  Recent works showed that the space complexity of an optimal deterministic
sliding window algorithm for this problem is either constant, logarithmic or
linear in the window size $n$ and provided natural language theoretic
characterizations of the space complexity classes. Subsequently, those results
were extended to randomized algorithms to show that any such algorithm admits
either constant, double logarithmic, logarithmic or linear space complexity.
  In this work, we make an important step forward and combine the sliding
window model with the property testing setting, which results in
ultra-efficient algorithms for all regular languages. Informally, a sliding
window property tester must accept the active window if it belongs to the
language and reject it if it is far from the language. We consider
deterministic and randomized sliding window property testers with one-sided and
two-sided errors. In particular, we show that for any regular language, there
is a deterministic sliding window property tester that uses logarithmic space
and a randomized sliding window property tester with two-sided error that uses
constant space.

field of research in recent years. This is because periodic signals bring us
information about the processes occurring near the innermost regions of
blazars, which are mostly inaccessible to our direct view. Such signals provide
insights into some of the extreme conditions that take place in the vicinity of
supermassive black holes that lead to the launch of the relativistic jets. In
addition, studies of characteristic timescales in blazar light curves shed
light on some of the challenging issues in blazar physics that includes
disk-jet connection, strong gravity near fast rotating supermassive black holes
and release of gravitational waves from binary supermassive black hole systems.
However, a number of issues associated with the search quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) in blazar e.g., red-noise dominance, modest significance of
the detection, periodic modulation lasting for only a couple of cycles and
their transient nature, make it difficult to estimate the true significance of
the detection. Consequently, it also becomes difficult to make meaningful
inferences about the nature of the on-going processes. In this proceedings,
results of study focused on searching QPOs in a number of blazar

parts is a valuable but challenging task. In this particular scenario, it is
impractical to utilize keypoints or other texture information because most of
them are not actual features of the target but the reflections of surroundings.
Moreover, the similarity of color also poses a challenge in segmentation. In
this article, we propose to divide the pose estimation process into three
stages: object detection, features detection and pose optimization. A
convolutional neural network was utilized to perform object detection.
Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour
information for estimating pose. Since conventional contour-based methods are
inapplicable to clustered metal parts due to the difficulties in segmentation,
we use the dense discrete points along the metal part edges as semantic
keypoints for contour detection. Afterward, we exploit both keypoint
information and CAD model to calculate the 6D pose of each object in view. A
typical implementation of deep learning methods not only requires a large
amount of training data, but also relies on intensive human labor for labeling
the datasets. Therefore, we propose an approach to generate datasets and label
them automatically. Despite not using any real-world photos for training, a
series of experiments showed that the algorithm built on synthetic data perform
well in the real environment.

infinite-dimensional system so that the closed-loop system satisfies a
fading-memory property and achieves the setpoint tracking of a given reference
signal. More specifically, this paper is concerned with the Proportional
Integral (PI) regulation control of the left Neumann trace of a one-dimensional
reaction-diffusion equation with a delayed right Dirichlet boundary control. In
this setting, the studied reaction-diffusion equation might be either open-loop
stable or unstable. The proposed control strategy goes as follows. First, a
finite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the
original infinite-dimensional system is obtained via spectral decomposition.
The truncated model is then augmented by an integral component on the tracking
error of the left Neumann trace. After resorting to the Artstein transformation
to handle the control input delay, the PI controller is designed by pole
shifting. Stability of the resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system,
consisting of the original reaction-diffusion equation with the PI controller,
is then established thanks to an adequate Lyapunov function. In the case of a
time-varying reference input and a time-varying distributed disturbance, our
stability result takes the form of an exponential Input-to-State Stability
(ISS) estimate with fading memory. Finally, another exponential ISS estimate
with fading memory is established for the tracking performance of the reference
signal by the system output. In particular, these results assess the setpoint
regulation of the left Neumann trace in the presence of distributed
perturbations that converge to a steady-state value and with a time-derivative
that converges to zero. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the
efficiency of our control strategy.

logistics optimisation. Starting from a headquarter multiple tours are to be
executed simultaneously by groups of harvesting units (HUs) and support units
(SUs) to first harvest biomass from multiple agricultural fields, before
supplying the biomass to multiple biogas plants (BPs) via shuttling SUs. This
problem is relevant on a larger scale in particular for contractors. This
problem is complex since there are three interconnected optimisation levels:
(i) the assignment of BPs to tours and the ordering of BPs assigned to each
tour, (ii) the assignment of fields to BPs and the ordering of fields assigned
to each BP, and (iii) determining the number of HUs and SUs assigned to each
tour, whereby different HUs and SUs may in general have different working rates
and loading capacities. Problem modeling and a solution method are discussed.
For the latter, a GPU-accelerated heuristic search algorithm is proposed. For
the former, an optimisation criterion minimising both total accumulated path
length and the maximum completion time over all harvesters tours, an embedded
local minimisation for the assignment of SUs to tours, and demand fulfilment
constraints for BPs are discussed. In stochastic simulation experiments it is
found that permitting unconstrained assignment of any available field that a
contractor services to any available BP, independent of their ownerships, is
crucial (i) to attain maximum path length savings, and (ii) also to best
balance and minimise uniform completion times over all harvesters tours such
that weather-dependent harvesting windows can be exploited optimally.

formulated as a control problem for Zakai equation, whose solution is the
unnormalized conditional probability distribution of the state of the system.
Zakai equation is a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. Therefore, the problem
to be solved is similar to that met in Mean Field Control theory. Since Mean
Field Control theory is much posterior to the development of Stochastic Control
with partial information, the tools, techniques, and concepts obtained in the
last decade, for Mean Field Games and Mean field type Control theory, have not
been used for the control of Zakai equation. Our objective is to connect the
two theories. We get the power of new tools, and we get new insights for the
problem of stochastic control with partial information. For mean field theory,
we get new interesting applications, but also new problems. Indeed, Mean Field
Control Theory leads to very complex equations, like the Master equation, which
is a nonlinear infinite dimensional P.D.E., for which general theorems are
hardly available, although active research in this direction is performed.
Direct methods are useful to obtain regularity results. We will develop in
detail the LQ regulator problem, but since we cannot just consider the Gaussian
case, well-known results, such as the separation principle is not available. An
important result is available in the literature, due to A. Makowsky. It
describes the solution of Zakai equation for linear systems with general
initial condition (non-gaussian). We show that the separation principle can be
extended for quadratic pay-off functionals, but the Kalman filter is much more
complex than in the gaussian case. Finally we compare our work to the work of
E. Bandini et al. and we show that the example E. Bandini et al. provided does
not cover ours. Our system remains nonlinear in their setting.

one out of $M$ original files from $N$ severs, i.e., each individual server
learns nothing about the file that the user is requesting. Usually, the $M$
files are replicated or encoded by a maximum distance separable (MDS) code and
then stored across the $N$ servers. Compared to mere replication, MDS coded
servers can significantly reduce the storage overhead. Particularly, PIR from
minimum storage regenerating (MSR) coded servers can simultaneously reduce the
repair bandwidth when repairing failed servers. Existing PIR schemes from MSR
coded servers either require large sub-packetization levels or are not
capacity-achieving. In this paper, a PIR protocol from MDS array codes is
proposed, subsuming PIR from MSR coded servers as a special case. Particularly,
the case of non-colluding, honest-but-curious servers is considered. The
retrieval rate of the new PIR protocol achieves the capacity of PIR from
MDS/MSR coded servers. By choosing different MDS array codes, the new PIR
protocol can have some advantages when compared with existing protocols, e.g.,
1) small sub-packetization, 2) (near-) optimal repair bandwidth, 3)
implementable over the binary field $\mathbf{F}_2$.

reap the benefits of EVs' flexibility in the literature almost exclusively
consider charging stations as active players exploiting the EVs' flexibility.
Such stations are seen as static loads able to provide flexibility only when
EVs are connected to them. However, this standpoint suffers from two major
issues. First, the charging stations need to anticipate some important
parameters of the incoming EVs, e.g. time of arrival and departure,
state-of-energy of the EV's battery at arrival and the required state-of-energy
at its departure. Second, it observes the EVs only when they are connected to
these charging stations, thus overlooking the arbitrage and charging
opportunities when the EVs are connected to other charging stations. This paper
proposes a new viewpoint, where EVs are observed as dynamic movable storage
systems which can provide flexibility at any charging station. The paper
defines both systems, the existing one, where the flexibility is viewed from
the standpoint of charging stations, and the proposed one, where the
flexibility is viewed from the EVs' standpoint.

space, can be statistically predicted from pertinent environmental conditions.
To this end we adapted a deep learning generative model in order to establish
the relationship between the environmental conditions and the view of
landscapes from the Sentinel-2 satellite. We trained a conditional generative
adversarial network to generate multispectral imagery given a set of climatic,
terrain and anthropogenic predictors. The generated imagery of the landscapes
share many characteristics with the real one. Results based on landscape patch
metrics, indicative of landscape composition and structure, show that the
proposed generative model creates landscapes that are more similar to the
targets than the baseline models while overall reflectance and vegetation cover
are predicted better. We demonstrate that for many purposes the generated
landscapes behave as real with immediate application for global change studies.
We envision the application of machine learning as a tool to forecast the
effects of climate change on the spatial features of landscapes, while we

around 50 K [P. Foury-Leylekian et al. Phys. Rev. B 84, 195134 (2011)], which
allow a separation of the properties of defects inside the chains from the
magnetic response of the spin chains. Indeed, continuous wave ESR measurements
performed over a wide temperature range evidence the evolution of the spin
dynamics from being governed by the spins in the chains at elevated
temperatures to a low-temperature regime which is dominated by defects within
the spin-dimerized chains. Such defects polarize the antiferromagnetically
coupled spins in their vicinity, thereby leading to a finite local alternating
magnetization around the defect site which can be described in terms of a
soliton, i.e. a spin 1/2 quasiparticle built of many correlated spins, pinned
to the defect. In addition, contributions of triplon excitations of the
spin-dimerized state to the ESR response below the transition temperature were
observed which provides a spectroscopic estimate for the spin-gap of the
studied systems. Moreover, details of spin dynamics deep in the spin-Peierls
phase were investigated by pulse ESR experiments which revealed
Rabi-oscillations as signatures of coherent spin dynamics. From a comparison of
the characteristic damping times of the Rabi oscillations with measurements of
the spin relaxation times by means of primary-echo decay and CPMG methods it
becomes evident that inhomogeneities in local magnetic fields strongly
contribute to the soliton decoherence.

speech quality. Such systems usually comprise a network converting
linguistic/phonetic features sequence to an acoustic features sequence,
cascaded with a neural vocoder. The generated speech prosody (i.e. phoneme
durations, pitch and loudness) is implicitly present in the acoustic features,
being mixed with spectral information. Although the speech sounds natural, its
prosody realization is randomly chosen and cannot be easily altered. The
prosody control becomes an even more difficult task if no prosodic labeling is
present in the training data. Recently, much progress has been achieved in
unsupervised speaking style learning and generation, however human inspection
is still required after the training for discovery and interpretation of the
speaking styles learned by the system. In this work we introduce a fully
automatic method that makes the system aware of the prosody and enables
sentence-wise speaking pace and expressiveness control on a continuous scale.
While being useful by itself in many applications, the proposed prosody control
can also improve the overall quality and expressiveness of the synthesized
speech, as demonstrated by subjective listening evaluations. We also propose a
novel augmented attention mechanism, that facilitates better pace control
sensitivity and faster attention convergence.

analysis and estimation of both deterministic and random data on graphs. The
fundamental ideas related to graph signals are introduced through a simple and
intuitive, yet illustrative and general enough case study of multisensor
temperature field estimation. The concept of systems on graph is defined using
graph signal shift operators, which generalize the corresponding principles
from traditional learning systems. At the core of the spectral domain
representation of graph signals and systems is the Graph Discrete Fourier
Transform (GDFT). The spectral domain representations are then used as the
basis to introduce graph signal filtering concepts and address their design,
including Chebyshev polynomial approximation series. Ideas related to the
sampling of graph signals are presented and further linked with compressive
sensing. Localized graph signal analysis in the joint vertex-spectral domain is
referred to as the vertex-frequency analysis, since it can be considered as an
extension of classical time-frequency analysis to the graph domain of a signal.
Important topics related to the local graph Fourier transform (LGFT) are
covered, together with its various forms including the graph spectral and
vertex domain windows and the inversion conditions and relations. A link
between the LGFT with spectral varying window and the spectral graph wavelet
transform (SGWT) is also established. Realizations of the LGFT and SGWT using
polynomial (Chebyshev) approximations of the spectral functions are further

forefront of current research in condensed matter physics. Here we try to
clarify some subtleties in studying topological behaviors of interacting Weyl
semimetals. It is well-known that there exist two topological invariants
defined to identify their topological character. One is the many-body Chern
number, which can be directly linked to the Hall conductivity and thus to the
two-particle correlations. The other is the topological index constructed from
the single-particle Green's functions. Because the information of Green's
functions is easier to be achieved than the many-body wavefunctions, usually
only the latter is employed in the literature. However, the approach based on
the single-particle Green's function can break down in the strongly correlated
phase. For illustration, an exactly solvable two-orbital model with
momentum-local two-body interactions is discussed, in which both topological
invariants can be calculated analytically. We find that the topological index
calculated from the Green's function formalism can be nonzero even for a
non-topological strongly correlated phase with vanishing many-body Chern
number. In addition, we stress that the physical surface states implied by
nonzero many-body Chern numbers should be the edge modes of particle-hole
collective excitations, rather than those of quasiparticle nature derived from
the Green's function formalism. Our observations thus demonstrate the
limitation of the validity of Green's function formalism in the investigations
of interacting topological materials.

samples from large, labelled datasets. Animals do not learn this way. An
enviable characteristic of animal learning is `episodic' learning - the ability
to memorise a specific experience as a composition of existing concepts, after
just one experience, without provided labels. The new knowledge can then be
used to distinguish between similar experiences, to generalise between classes,
and to selectively consolidate to long-term memory. The Hippocampus is known to
be vital to these abilities. AHA is a biologically-plausible computational
model of the Hippocampus. Unlike most machine learning models, AHA is trained
without external labels and uses only local credit assignment. We demonstrate
AHA in a superset of the Omniglot one-shot classification benchmark. The
extended benchmark covers a wider range of known hippocampal functions by
testing pattern separation, completion, and recall of original input. These
functions are all performed within a single configuration of the computational

ultrasound imaging, this burden is significant, especially when striving for
low-cost systems, and has motivated the development of high-resolution and
high-contrast adaptive beamforming methods. Here we show that deep neural

governed by Gaussian fixed point at shorter distance and entering a plateau at
larger distance whose height decays as $L^{-d_c/2}({\rm ln}L)^{\hat{p}}$ with

finite-volume matrix elements, computed using numerical lattice QCD, to the
corresponding infinite-volume observables. As the formalism is complicated, it
is important to provide non-trivial checks on the final results and also to
explore limiting cases in which more straightforward predications may be
extracted. In this work we provide examples on both fronts. First, we show
that, in the case of a conserved vector current, the formalism ensures that the
finite-volume matrix element of the conserved charge is volume-independent and
equal to the total charge of the two-particle state. Second, we study the
implications for a two-particle bound state. We demonstrate that the
infinite-volume limit reproduces the expected matrix element and derive the
leading finite-volume corrections to this result for a scalar current. Finally,
we provide numerical estimates for the expected size of volume effects in
future lattice QCD calculations of the deuteron's scalar charge. We find that
these effects completely dominate the infinite-volume result for realistic
lattice volumes and that applying the present formalism, to analytically remove
an infinite-series of leading volume corrections, is crucial to reliably
extract the infinite-volume charge of the state.

evolution, we analysed the 2015 outburst using Swift data and three Nustar
observations. Besides the canonical hard and soft spectral states, we
identified the rarely observed intermediate state. This was witnessed by the
appeareance of the accretion disk emission in the spectrum (at $kT_{\rm disk}$
$\sim$0.7 keV) and the simultaneous cooling of the hot corona. In addition, we
also unveiled a hard tail above 30 keV in this state. In the hard state, a
thermal Comptonization model with two seed photons populations ($kT_{\rm
s,1}\sim 1.5$ keV and $kT_{\rm s,2}\sim 0.4$ keV, respectively) and a hot
Comptonising plasma, represents the physically best motivated scenario to
describe the data. We also estimated a reflection fraction below 20% in all
states, while no constraints on the inclination and only lower limits on the
inner disk radius could be inferred. Finally, we studied a number of type-I
X-ray bursts displayed from the source, one of them at the Eddington limit
(observed with JEM-X). Their characteristics, combined with the clocked
behaviour observed during the intermediate state, point out H/He composition
for the accreted material, which makes unlikely the helium dwarf nature for the
companion.

robot-assisted surgery. However, accurate segmentation of cataract surgical
instruments is still a challenge due to specular reflection and class imbalance

cataract surgical instrument. A new attention module is designed to learn
discriminative features and address the specular reflection issue. It captures
global context and encodes semantic dependencies to emphasize key semantic
features, boosting the feature representation. This attention module has very
few parameters, which helps to save memory. Thus, it can be flexibly plugged
into other networks. Besides, a hybrid loss is introduced to train our network
for addressing the class imbalance issue, which merges cross entropy and
logarithms of Dice loss. A new dataset named Cata7 is constructed to evaluate
our network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cataract surgical
instrument dataset for semantic segmentation. Based on this dataset, RAUNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance 97.71% mean Dice and 95.62% mean IOU.

these hierarchies can be achieved via the decoupling of building block
attributes from structure during assembly. Here, we demonstrate both geometric
and interaction decoupling in pre-assembled colloidal structures of cube-like
particles with rounded edges. Through computer simulations and experiments, we
show that compressing a small number of such cubes in spherical confinement
results in clusters with highly reproducible structures that can be used as
mesoscale building blocks to form the next level of structural hierarchy. These
clusters demonstrate geometric decoupling between particle shape and cluster
structure; namely, for clusters of up to nine particles, the colloidal
superballs pack consistently like spheres, despite the presence of shape
anisotropy and facets in the cubic-like particles. We confirm that cluster
structure is also decoupled from inter-particle interaction, showing that the
same structures arise from the spherical confinement of both non-magnetic and
magnetic colloidal cubes with strong dipolar interactions. To highlight the
potential of these superball clusters for hierarchical assembly, we
demonstrate, using computer simulations, that clusters of six to nine particles
can self-assemble into high-order structures that differ from those of
similarly shaped particles without pre-assembly. These results demonstrate
decoupling for anisotropic building blocks that can be further exploited for
hierarchical materials development.

lack of `time-of-day' diversity within real, labeled datasets. There have been
impressive advances in the realm of image to image translation in transferring
previously unseen visual effects into a dataset, specifically in day to night

framework, called Shadow Transfer, that can relight complex outdoor scenes by
transferring realistic shadow, shading, and other lighting effects onto a

options for compressing and optimizing deep models. On the one hand, in many
real-world applications, we face the data imbalance challenge, i.e. when the
number of labeled instances of one class considerably outweighs the number of
labeled instances of the other class. On the other hand, applications may pose
a class imbalance problem, i.e. higher number of false positives produced when

that some classes are more important for the application than others, e.g.
detection problems in medical and surveillance domains. Motivated by the

deep model compression technique, which keeps the number of false negatives of
the compressed model close to the one of the original model at the price of
increasing the number of false positives if necessary. Our experimental

phenomenon, dubbed as band splitting with vanishing spin polarizations (BSVSP),
in which, as usual, SOC splits the energy bands in nonmagnetic
non-centrosymmetric systems; surprisingly, however, both split bands show no
net spin polarization along certain high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone.
In order to rationalize this phenomenon, we propose a new classification of

first-principles simulations, we demonstrate that BSVSP can take place in both
symmorphic (e.g., bulk GaAs) and non-symmorphic systems (e.g., two dimensional

the relaxation time. In particular, the creation of correlations between remote

to global structure, including distant small perturbations to the potential. In
what sense are quasinormal modes a property of the resulting black hole? We
explore this question for the linearized perturbation equation with two

We show that over short time scales the evolution is governed by the

physics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with
appropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large
amounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning)
techniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in

multi-line analysis of the velocity components of the gas in the jet
acceleration zone. We analyzed the GIARPS-TNG spectra of six objects in the

Thanks to the combined high-spectral resolution (R=50000-115000) and wide
spectral coverage (~400-2400 nm) we observed several O, S+, N, N+, and Fe+
forbidden lines spanning a large range of excitation and ionization conditions.
In four objects (DG Tau, HN Tau, DO Tau, RW Aur A), temperature (T_e), electron
and total density (n_e, n_H), and fractional ionization (x_e) were derived as a
function of velocity through an excitation and ionization model. The abundance
of gaseous iron, X(Fe), a probe of the dust content in the jet, was derived in
selected velocity channels. The physical parameters vary smoothly with
velocity, suggesting a common origin for the different kinematic components. In
DG Tau and HN Tau, T_e, x_e, and X(Fe) increase with velocity (roughly from
6000 K, 0.05, 10% X(Fe)_sun to 15000 K, 0.6, 90% X(Fe)_sun). This trend is in
agreement with disk-wind models in which the jet is launched from regions of
the disk at different radii. In DO Tau and RW Aur A, we infer x_e < 0.1, n_H
~10^6-7 cm^-3, and X(Fe) <~ X(Fe)_sun at all velocities. These findings are
tentatively explained by the formation of these jets from dense regions inside
the inner, gaseous disk, or as a consequence of their high degree of
collimation.

dust-gas chemistry in our AGB outflow chemical kinetics model, including both
dust-gas interactions and grain-surface chemistry. The dust is assumed to have
formed in the inner region, and follows an interstellar-like dust-size
distribution. Using radiative transfer modelling, we obtain dust temperature
profiles for different dust types in an O-rich and a C-rich outflow. We
calculate a grid of models, sampling different outflow densities, drift
velocities between the dust and gas, and dust types. Dust-gas chemistry can
significantly affect the gas-phase composition, depleting parent and daughter
species and increasing the abundance of certain daughter species via
grain-surface formation followed by desorption/sputtering. Its influence
depends on four factors: outflow density, dust temperature, initial
composition, and drift velocity. The largest effects are for higher density
outflows with cold dust and O-rich parent species, as these species generally
have a larger binding energy. At drift velocities larger than $\sim 10$ km
s$^{-1}$, ice mantles undergo sputtering; however, they are not fully
destroyed. Models with dust-gas chemistry can better reproduce the observed
depletion of species in O-rich outflows. When including colder dust in the
C-rich outflows and adjusting the binding energy of CS, the depletion in C-rich
outflows is also better reproduced. To best interpret high-resolution molecular
line observations from AGB outflows, dust-gas interactions are needed in

independent of the neutrino mass, growing at the scale of the large

present such local dielectric measurements obtained by triplet state solvation

dust formation in AGN accretion disk winds. The winds considered herein are
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds driven off the entire accretion disk domain
that extends from the BH vicinity to the radius of BH influence, of order of 1
to 100 pc depending on the mass of the resident BH. Our results indicate that
these winds provide conditions conducive to the formation of significant
amounts of dust, especially for objects accreting close to their Eddington
limit, making AGN a significant source of dust in the universe, especially for
luminous quasars. Our models justify the importance of a r to the power -1
density law in the winds for efficient formation and survival of dust grains.
The dust production rate scales linearly with the mass of the central BH and
varies as a power law of index between 2 to 2.5 with the dimensionless mass
accretion rate. The resultant distribution of the dense dusty gas resembles a
toroidal shape, with high column density and optical depths along the
equatorial viewing angles, in agreement with the AGN unification picture.

the bounded-error randomized query complexity of $f$. Thus, the BCW simulation
has an extra $O(\log n)$ factor appearing that is absent in classical
simulation. A natural question is if this factor can be avoided. H{\o}yer and
de Wolf (STACS'02) showed that for the Set-Disjointness function, this can be
reduced to $c^{\log^* n}$ for some constant $c$, and subsequently Aaronson and
Ambainis (FOCS'03) showed that this factor can be made a constant. That is, the
quantum communication complexity of the Set-Disjointness function (which is
$\mathsf{NOR}_n \circ \wedge$) is $O(Q(\mathsf{NOR}_n))$.
  Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we show that when $ \bullet = \oplus$, then
the extra $\log n$ factor in the BCW simulation is unavoidable. In other words,
we exhibit a total function $F : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ such that $Q^{cc}(F

mass is a great challenge for planetesimal-driven core accretion models because
the core growth rates far from the star are low. Here we model the growth and
migration of single protoplanets that accrete planetesimals and gas. We
integrated the core growth rate using fits in the literature to $N$-body
simulations, which provide the efficiency of accreting the planetesimals that a
protoplanet migrates through. We take into account three constraints from the
solar system and from protoplanetary discs: (1) the masses of the terrestrial
planets and the comet reservoirs in Neptune's scattered disc and the Oort cloud
are consistent with a primordial planetesimal population of a few Earth masses
per AU, (2) evidence from the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt indicates that
the characteristic planetesimal diameter is 100 km, and (3) observations of
protoplanetary discs indicate that the dust is stirred by weak turbulence; this
gas turbulence also excites the inclinations of planetesimals. Our nominal
model built on these constraints results in maximum protoplanet masses of $0.1$
Earth masses. Ignoring constraint (1) above, we show that even a planetesimal
population of 1,000 Earth masses, corresponding to 50 Earth masses per AU,
fails to produce cold gas giants (although it successfully forms hot and warm
gas giants). We conclude that a massive planetesimal reservoir is in itself
insufficient to produce cold gas giants. The formation of cold gas giants by
planetesimal accretion additionally requires that planetesimals are small and
that the turbulent stirring is very weak, thereby violating all three above
constraints.

most $r$ apart. We study edge isoperimetric inequalities for this graph.
Harper, Bernstein, Lindsey and Hart proved a best-possible edge isoperimetric
inequality for this graph in the case $r=1$. For each $r \geq 2$, we obtain an
edge isoperimetric inequality for $Q_n^r$; our inequality is tight up to a
constant factor depending only upon $r$. Our techniques also yield an edge
isoperimetric inequality for the `Kleitman-West graph' (the graph whose
vertices are all the $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, where two
$k$-element sets have an edge between them if they have symmetric difference of
size two); this inequality is sharp up to a factor of $2+o(1)$ for sets of size
${n -s \choose k-s}$, where $k=o(n)$ and $s \in \mathbb{N}$.

a measure of the rate at which background field intensity decreases with height
over the flux rope or erupting structure. In the real observations, the
critical height of the background field is unknown, so a typical value of
$n_{c}=1.5$ is adopted from the numerical studies. In this study, we determined
the $n_c$ of 10 prominence eruptions (PEs). The prominence height in 3D is
derived from two-perspective observations of \textit{Solar Dynamics
Observatory} and \textit{Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory}. Synoptic
maps of photospheric radial magnetic field are used to construct the background
field in the corona. During the eruption, the height-time curve of the sample
events exhibits the slow and fast-rise phases and is fitted with the
linear-cum-exponential model. From this model, the onset height of fast-rise
motion is determined and is considered as the critical height for the onset of
the torus-instability because the erupting structure is allowed to expand
exponentially provided there is no strapping background field. Corresponding to
the critical height, the $n_c$ values of our sample events are varied to be in
the range of 0.8-1.3. Additionally, the kinematic analysis suggests that the
acceleration of PEs associated with flares are significantly enhanced compared
to flare-less PEs. We found that the flare magnetic reconnection is the
dominant contributor than the torus-instability to the acceleration process

coupling strength (equivalent to the harmonic oscillator frequency) and leads
to flat Landau Level (LL) spectra and therefore to infinite degeneracy of
either the positive or the negative helicity states depending on the sign of

the model in four dimensions, we demonstrate that the infinite degeneracy of

representations of $SO(4,2)$, i.e. the {\it doubletons}. The degeneracy in the
opposite helicity branch is finite, but can still be explained exploiting the
complex conjugate {\it doubleton} representations. Subsequently, the analysis
is generalized to $d$ dimensions, distinguishing the cases of odd and even $d$.

distribution. Based on these two theories, we further study the solution
without net electric charge and then for charged solution. For charge parameter
$k \rightarrow 0$, the charged solution reduces to neutral one. Our

Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit for such compact objects. We analyze the
static stability criterion of the Einstein clusters for both charged and
uncharged case, and the stability of such compact objects is enhanced by the
presence some net electric charge. Finally, we compare our solution for pure
general relativity. As a result, we concluded that the Einstein cluster
solution do exist in pure GR, however, physically unfit to mimic compact stars.
We have also extend our findings by assuming the diagonal or off-diagonal
tetrad and specific case of $f(T)$. In such models, Einstein's cluster
solutions do exist however can't mimic the properties of a compact star.

for automated vehicle following using wireless communication in addition to

headway (CTH) spacing policies have prevailed in research; namely, vehicle
interspacing grows with the speed. While constant distance headway (CDH)
spacing policies provide superior potential to increase traffic capacity than
CTH, a major drawback is a smaller safety margin at high velocities and string
stability cannot be achieved using a one-vehicle look-ahead communication. The
hypothesis of this work is to apply CDH only in few driving situations, when
traffic throughput is of highest importance and safety requirements can be met
due to comparably low velocities. As the most relevant situations where CDH
could be applied, we identify starting platoons at signalized intersections. In
this paper, we illustrate this idea. Specifically, we compare CTH with CDH
regarding its potential to increase the capacity of traffic lights. Starting
with the elementary situation of single traffic lights we expand our scope to
whole traffic networks including several thousand vehicles in simulation. Using

sensor-augmented system that generates ABR video streaming algorithms with the
assistance of various kinds of inherent sensor data that are used to pilot
UAVs. By incorporating the inherent sensor data with network observations,
SA-ABR trains a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to extract salient
features from the flight state information and automatically learn an ABR
algorithm to adapt to the varying UAV channel capacity through the training
process. SA-ABR does not rely on any assumptions or models about UAV's flight
states or the environment, but instead, it makes decisions by exploiting
temporal properties of past throughput through the long short-term memory
(LSTM) to adapt itself to a wide range of highly dynamic environments. We have
implemented SA-ABR in a commercial UAV and evaluated it in the wild. We compare
SA-ABR with a variety of existing state-of-the-art ABR algorithms, and the
results show that our system outperforms the best known existing ABR algorithm
by 21.4% in terms of the average quality of experience (QoE) reward.

equations with a convolution-type nonlocality in space is considered. A
semi-discrete numerical method based on both a uniform space discretization and

The method is proved to be uniformly convergent as the mesh size goes to zero.
The order of convergence for the discretization error is linear or quadratic
depending on the smoothness of the convolution kernel. The discrete problem
defined on the whole spatial domain is then truncated to a finite domain.
Restricting the problem to a finite domain introduces a localization error and
it is proved that this localization error stays below a given threshold if the
finite domain is large enough. For two particular kernel functions, the
numerical examples concerning solitary wave solutions illustrate the expected
accuracy of the method. Our class of nonlocal wave equations includes the

performance analysis of a NOMA-based cooperative relaying system (CRS) in an
underlay spectrum sharing scenario, considering a peak interference constraint
(PIC), where the peak interference inflicted by the secondary (unlicensed)
network on the primary-user (licensed) receiver (PU-Rx) should be less than a
predetermined threshold. In the proposed system the relay and the
secondary-user receiver (SU-Rx) are equipped with multiple receive antennas and
apply selection combining (SC), where the antenna with highest instantaneous
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, and maximal-ratio combining (MRC), for
signal reception. Closed-form expressions are derived for the average
achievable rate and outage probabilities for SS-based CRS-NOMA. These results
show that for large values of peak interference power, the SS-based CRS-NOMA
outperforms the CRS with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms
of spectral efficiency. The effect of the interference channel on the system
performance is also discussed, and in particular, it is shown that the
interference channel between the secondary-user transmitter (SU-Tx) and the
PU-Rx has a more severe effect on the average achievable rate as compared to
that between the relay and the PU-Rx. A close agreement between the analytical

compared to concurrent processes such as their rearrangement due to fluid
motion. In the present model, this is achieved by tuning the interface energy
as a free parameter. The model is validated by a number of benchmark tests.
First, stability of a two dimensional bubble is investigated by the
Young-Laplace law for different values of the interface energy. Then, the
coalescence of two bubbles is simulated until the system reaches equilibrium
with a circular shape. To address the major capability of the present model for
the formation of foam structure, the bubble coalescence is simulated for
various values of interface energy in order to slow down the merging process.
These simulations are repeated in the presence of a rotational flow to
highlight the fact that the model allows to suppress the coalescence process

popularity. This theory purports to be a modified gravity theory with a
non-conserved energy-momentum tensor ({\rm EMT}) and an unusual non-minimal
coupling between matter and geometry. The present work looks for the evolution
of homogeneous spherical perturbations within the Universe in the context of
Rastall gravity. Using the spherical Top-Hat collapse model we seek for exact
solutions in linear regime for density contrast of dark matter (\rm DM) and
dark energy ({\rm DE}). We find that the Rastall parameter affects crucially
the dynamics of density contrasts for {\rm DM} and {\rm DE} and the fate of
spherical collapse is different in comparison to the case of general relativity
({\rm GR}). Numerical solutions for perturbation equations in non-linear regime
reveal that {\rm DE} perturbations could amplify the rate of growth of {\rm DM}
perturbations depending on the values of Rastall parameter.

text content such as newspaper opinion articles. Obtaining long text data and
annotations at sufficient scale for training is difficult, but it is relatively
easy to extract political polarity from tweets through their authorship. We
train on tweets and perform inference on articles. Universal sentence encoders
and other existing methods that aim to address this domain-adaptation scenario
deliver inaccurate and inconsistent predictions on articles, which we show is
due to a difference in opinion concentration between tweets and articles. We
propose a two-step classification scheme that uses a neutral detector trained
on tweets to remove neutral sentences from articles in order to align opinion
concentration and therefore improve accuracy on that domain. Our implementation
is available for public use at https://knowbias.ml.

  CNNs","Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a CNN based technique that aggregates feature maps from its
multiple layers that can localize abnormalities with greater details as well as
predict pathology under consideration. Existing class activation mapping (CAM)
techniques extract feature maps from either the final layer or a single
intermediate layer to create the discriminative maps and then interpolate to
upsample to the original image resolution. In this case, the subject specific
localization is coarse and is unable to capture subtle abnormalities. To
mitigate this, our method builds a novel CNN based discriminative localization
model that we call high resolution CAM (HR-CAM), which accounts for layers from
each resolution, therefore facilitating a comprehensive map that can delineate
the pathology for each subject by combining low-level, intermediate as well as
high-level features from the CNN. Moreover, our model directly provides the
discriminative map in the resolution of the original image facilitating finer
delineation of abnormalities. We demonstrate the working of our model on a
simulated abnormalities data where we illustrate how the model captures finer
details in the final discriminative maps as compared to current techniques. We
then apply this technique: (1) to classify ependymomas from grade IV
glioblastoma on T1-weighted contrast enhanced (T1-CE) MRI and (2) to predict
Parkinson's disease from neuromelanin sensitive MRI. In all these cases we
demonstrate that our model not only predicts pathologies with high accuracies,
but also creates clinically interpretable subject specific high resolution
discriminative localizations. Overall, the technique can be generalized to any
CNN and carries high relevance in a clinical setting.

experimental OH-PLIF images into corresponding three-component planar PIV
fields in the closed domain of a premixed swirl combustor. The task is carried
out with a fully convolutional network, which is a type of convolutional neural
network (CNN) used in many applications in machine learning, alongside an
existing experimental dataset which consists of simultaneous OH-PLIF and PIV
measurements in both attached and detached flame regimes. Two types of models
are compared: 1) a global CNN which is trained using images from the entire
domain, and 2) a set of local CNNs, which are trained only on individual
sections of the domain. The locally trained models show improvement in creating
mappings in the detached regime over the global models. A comparison between
model performance in attached and detached regimes shows that the CNNs are much
more accurate across the board in creating velocity fields for attached flames.
Inclusion of time history in the PLIF input resulted in small noticeable
improvement on average, which could imply a greater physical role of
instantaneous spatial correlations in the decoding process over temporal
dependencies from the perspective of the CNN. Additionally, the performance of
local models trained to produce mappings in one section of the domain is tested
on other, unexplored sections of the domain. Interestingly, local CNN
performance on unseen domain regions revealed the models' ability to utilize
symmetry and antisymmetry in the velocity field. Ultimately, this work shows
the powerful ability of the CNN to decode the three-dimensional PIV fields from
input OH-PLIF images, providing a potential groundwork for a very useful tool
for experimental configurations in which accessibility of forms of simultaneous
measurements are limited.

indexes into crash-consistent indexes for persistent memory (PM). The main
insight behind Recipe is that isolation provided by a certain class of
concurrent in-memory indexes can be translated with small changes to
crash-consistency when the same index is used in PM. We present a set of
conditions that enable the identification of this class of DRAM indexes, and
the actions to be taken to convert each index to be persistent. Based on these
conditions and conversion actions, we modify five different DRAM indexes based
on B+ trees, tries, radix trees, and hash tables to their crash-consistent PM
counterparts. The effort involved in this conversion is minimal, requiring
30-200 lines of code. We evaluated the converted PM indexes on Intel DC
Persistent Memory, and found that they outperform state-of-the-art,
hand-crafted PM indexes in multi-threaded workloads by up-to 5.2x. For example,
we built P-CLHT, our PM implementation of the CLHT hash table by modifying only
30 LOC. When running YCSB workloads, P-CLHT performs up to 2.4x better than
Cacheline-Conscious Extendible Hashing (CCEH), the state-of-the-art PM hash
table.

new algorithm for exact pair-splitting. By using dealer probability caching
methods and revising the method for recursively generating possible player

by five orders of magnitude. The resulting algorithm was used to calculate the
first exact and complete pair splitting results for a single deck game. The
exact results were compared to prior approximate theories for resplitting. The
prior theories are accurate for many calculations, but inaccurate for
resplitting tens. A new approximation method was developed that is accurate for
all resplitting calculations.

initial superfluid density imbalance leads to randomisation of the dynamics and
generation of turbulence, namely, the formation of a quasi-1D dispersive shock
consisting of a train of grey solitons that eventually breakup into chains of
distinct quantised vortices of alternating vorticity followed by random
turbulent flow. The Josephson junction barrier allows us to create two
turbulent regimes: acoustic turbulence on one side and vortex turbulence on the
other. Throughout the dynamics, a key mechanism for mixing these two regimes is
the transmission of vortex dipoles through the barrier: we analyse this
scattering process in terms of the barrier parameters, sound emission and
vortex annihilation. Finally, we discuss how the vortex turbulence evolves for
long times, presenting the optimal configurations for the density imbalance and
barrier height in order to create the desired turbulent regimes which last as
long as possible.

The underlying concept is to disable the entropy source at high temperature to

government agencies. Effective detection mechanisms and countermeasures against
such malicious designs can only be developed when there is a deep understanding
of how hardware Trojans can be built in practice, in particular Trojans
specifically designed to avoid detection. In this work, we present a mechanism
to introduce an extremely stealthy hardware Trojan into cryptographic
primitives equipped with provably-secure first-order side-channel
countermeasures. Once the Trojan is triggered, the malicious design exhibits
exploitable side-channel leakage, leading to successful key recovery attacks.
Generally, such a Trojan requires neither addition nor removal of any logic
which makes it extremely hard to detect. On ASICs, it can be inserted by subtle
manipulations at the sub-transistor level and on FPGAs by changing the routing
of particular signals, leading to \textbf{zero} logic overhead. The underlying
concept is based on modifying a securely-masked hardware implementation in such
a way that running the device at a particular clock frequency violates one of
its essential properties, leading to exploitable leakage. We apply our
technique to a Threshold Implementation of the PRESENT block cipher realized in
two different CMOS technologies, and show that triggering the Trojan makes the
ASIC prototypes vulnerable.

evidence is embodied in \textit{this} data and concerns the hypotheses of

property of the statistical analysis and sampling procedure. It is shown using
simple examples that local evidence and global error rates can be, and should
be, considered together when making inferences. Power analysis for experimental
design for hypothesis testing are explained, along with the more locally
focussed expected P-values. Issues relating to multiple testing, HARKing, and
P-hacking are explained, and it is shown that, in many situation, their effects
on local evidence and global error rates are in conflict, a conflict that can
always be overcome by a fresh dataset from replication of key experiments.
Statistics is complicated, and so is science. There is no singular right way to
do either, and universally acceptable compromises may not exist. Statistics
offers a wide array of tools for assisting with scientific inference by
calibrating uncertainty, but statistical inference is not a substitute for
scientific inference. P-values are useful indices of evidence and deserve their
place in the statistical toolbox of basic pharmacologists.

consumer behaviors are guessed according to this analysis. Nevertheless, these
are invalid in real life. And this inconsistencey are examined by behavioral
economics and neuroeconomics. Behavioral economics claims that people can
behave what they are not expected since people can be irrational, their
willpower is limited and altruistic behaviors can be seen and they can give
more value to what they own. As a result of these, consumer behaviors become
more different than that of economic theory. In addition to behavioral
economics, neuroeconomics also examines consumer behaviors more differently
than mainstream economic theory. It emphasizes the people using prefrontial
cortex of the brain are more rational than the people using hippocampus of the
brain. Therefore, people can make illogical choices compared to economic
theory. In these cases, levying taxes such as personal income tax or value
added tax can be ineffective or effective. In other words, the effect becomes
ambigious. Hence,the hypothesis that if government desires to levy personal
income tax or value added tax, it makes a detailed research in terms of
productivity of taxes forms the fundamental of this study.
