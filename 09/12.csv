gallery images come from the same domain, we propose a more common but
challenging setup where the query images are collected under a new unseen

images of Amsterdam from the Mapillary dataset (source domain) and historical
images of the same city from Beeldbank dataset (target domain). We tailored an
age-invariant feature learning CNN that can focus on domain invariant objects
and learn to match images based on a weakly supervised ranking loss. We propose
an attention aggregation module that is robust to domain discrepancy between
the train and the test data. Further, a multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy
(MK-MMD) domain adaptation loss is adopted to improve the cross-domain ranking
performance. Both attention and adaptation modules are unsupervised while the
ranking loss uses weak supervision. Visual inspection shows that the attention
module focuses on built forms while the dramatically changing environment are
less weighed. Our proposed CNN achieves state of the art results (99% accuracy)

improvements have been made on this task during the last years, the
state-of-the-art systems do not explicitly take into account the recursive
nature of language. Instead of only treating the text as a plain sequence of
words, we incorporate a linguistically-inspired way to recognize entities based
on syntax and tree structures. Our model exploits syntactic relationships among
words using a Tree-LSTM guided by dependency trees. Then, we enhance these
features by applying relative and global attention mechanisms. On the one hand,
the relative attention detects the most informative words in the sentence with
respect to the word being evaluated. On the other hand, the global attention
spots the most relevant words in the sequence. Lastly, we linearly project the
weighted vectors into the tagging space so that a conditional random field
classifier predicts the entity labels. Our findings show that the model detects
words that disclose the entity types based on their syntactic roles in a
sentence (e.g., verbs such as speak and write are attended when the entity type
is PERSON, whereas meet and travel strongly relate to LOCATION). We confirm our
findings and establish a new state of the art on two datasets.

effects in atom-field systems which cannot be seen in traditional perturbative
treatments invoking compromising assumptions such as the Born-Markov, rotating
wave or Fermi Golden rule. We consider an atom whose internal degrees of
freedom are modeled by a harmonic oscillator, bilinearly coupled to a scalar
quantum field, representing one of the two polarizations of an electromagnetic
field. Because the whole system is Gaussian we can solve this problem exactly.
Using the open quantum system conceptual framework and the influence functional
formalism we derive the dynamics of the reduced density matrix for the atom
which enables the calculation of atomic transition probability and other
relevant physical quantities. Finding an exact solution to this problem has the
distinct advantage of enabling one to capture fully the strong coupling regime
and discover interesting effects such as spontaneous ground state excitation
which is unfathomable in perturbative treatments. The conventional description
of atomic-optical activities is predicated on the assumption that the state of
the total atom-field system is a product state of the atomic excitations and
the photon number states, an assumption which is valid only for vanishingly
weak coupling. The correct energy eigenfunctions to use should be that of the
Hamiltonian of the combined atom-field system. Other features associated with
finite to strong coupling effects such as resonance peak broadening and
transition from a gapped to a gapless spectrum can all be understood from this
perspective. Finally, to put the issues in a proper perspective we take the
perturbative limit of the exact results and compare them with those from
conventional TDPT. This enables one to pin-point where the deficiencies of TDPT
lie as one removes the ultra-weak coupling assumption.

Waveform Inversion (FWI) by allowing for wave equation errors during wavefield
reconstruction to match the data from the first iteration. Then, the wavespeeds
are updated from the wavefields by minimizing the source residuals. Performing
these two tasks in alternating mode breaks down the nonlinear FWI as a sequence
of two linear subproblems, relaying on the bilinearity of the wave equation. We
solve this biconvex optimization with the alternating-direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to cancel out efficiently the data and source residuals in
iterations and stabilize the parameter estimation with appropriate
regularizations. Here, we extend WRI to viscoacoustic media for attenuation
imaging. Attenuation reconstruction is challenging because of the small imprint
of attenuation in the data and the cross-talks with velocities. To address
these issues, we recast the multivariate viscoacoustic WRI as a triconvex
optimization and update wavefields, squared slowness, and attenuation factor in
alternating mode at each WRI iteration. This requires to linearize the
attenuation-estimation subproblem via an approximated trilinear viscoacoustic
wave equation. The iterative defect correction embedded in ADMM corrects the
errors generated by this linearization, while the operator splitting allows us
to tailor $\ell{1}$ regularization to each parameter class. A toy numerical
example shows that these strategies mitigate cross-talk artifacts and noise
from the attenuation reconstruction. A more realistic synthetic example
representative of the North Sea validates the method.

systems, there is a series of vortex type of spin texture along the Fermi
surface induced by Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. Such spin
textures are rarely found in magnetic insulators, since there had been no
systematic ways to control the kinetics of its quasi-particle called magnon
using a magnetic field or spacially asymmetric exchange couplings. Here, we
propose a general framework to explore such spin textures in arbitrary
insulating antiferromagnets. We introduce an analytical method to transform any
complicated Hamiltonian to the simple representation based on pseudo-spin
degrees of freedom. The direction of the pseudo-spin on a Bloch sphere
describes the degree of contributions from the two magnetic sublattices to the
spin moment carried by the magnon. The momentum dependent fictitious ""Zeeman
field"" determines the direction of the pseudo-spin and thus becomes the control
parameter of the spin texture, which is explicitly described by the original
model parameters. The framework enabled us to clarify the uncovered aspect of
the Kitaev interaction, and further provides a tool to easily design or explore
materials with intriguing magnetic properties. Since these spin textures can be
a source of a pure spin current, the Kitaev materials $A_{2}$PrO$_{3}$ ($A$

optimality at the edge of chaos is associated with the highest information
transfer between input and output at this point similar to that of the logistic

accretion disks around young stellar objects is still not entirely understood,
which is why spectrally and spatially resolved observations are needed.
Recently, the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) has carried
out long-baseline observations towards a handful of sources, revealing
connections between outflows and the inner regions of disks.
  Aims. Here we aim to determine the small-scale kinematic and morphological
properties of the outflow from the isolated protostar B335 for which no
Keplerian disk has, so far, been observed on scales down to 10 au.
  Methods. We use ALMA in its longest-baseline configuration to observe
emission from CO isotopologs, SiO, SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH. The proximity of B335
provides a resolution of ~3 au (0.03''). We also combine our long-baseline data
with archival data to produce a high-fidelity image covering scales up to 700
au (7'').
  Results. $^{12}$CO has a X-shaped morphology with arms ~50 au in width that
we associate with the walls of an outflow cavity, similar to what is observed
on larger scales. Long-baseline continuum emission is confined to <7 au of the
protostar, while short-baseline continuum emission follows the $^{12}$CO
outflow and cavity walls. Methanol is detected within ~30 au of the protostar.
SiO is also detected in the vicinity of the protostar, but extended along the
outflow.
  Conclusions. The $^{12}$CO outflow shows no clear signs of rotation at
distances $\gtrsim$30 au from the protostar. SiO traces the protostellar jet on
small scales, but without obvious rotation. CH$_3$OH and SO$_2$ trace a region
<16 au in diameter, centred on the continuum peak, which is clearly rotating.
Using episodic, high-velocity, $^{12}$CO features, we estimate the launching
radius of the outflow to be <0.1 au and dynamical timescales on the order of a
few years.

imposes challenges on memory profiling and efficient data migration.
  We present Sentinel, a runtime system that automatically optimizes data
migration (i.e., data management) on HM to achieve performance similar to that
on the fast memory-only system with a much smaller capacity of fast memory. To
achieve this,Sentinel exploits domain knowledge about deep learning to adopt a
custom approach for data management. Sentinel leverages workload repeatability
to break the dilemma between profiling accuracy and overhead; It enables
profiling and data migration at the granularity of data objects (not pages), by
controlling memory allocation. This method bridges the semantic gap between
operating system and applications. By associating data objects with the DNN
topology, Sentinel avoids unnecessary data movement and proactively triggers
data movement. Using only 20% of peak memory consumption of DNN models as fast
memory size, Sentinel achieves the same or comparable performance (at most 8%
performance difference) to that of the fast memory-only system on common DNN
models; Sentinel also consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art solution by
18%.

process. We name it ""many-body echo"" because the underlying physics is closely
related to the spin echo effect in nuclear magnetic resonance systems. We
consider a periodical modulation of the interaction strength in a weakly
interacting Bose condensate, which resonantly excites quasi-particles from the
condensate. A dramatic phenomenon is that, after pausing the interaction
modulation for half a period and then continuing on with the same modulation,
nearly all the excited quasi-particles in the resonance modes will be absorbed
back into the condensate. During the intermediate half period, the free
evolution introduces a $\pi$ phase, which plays a role reminiscent of that
played by the $\pi$-pulse in the spin echo. Comparing our protocol with another
one implemented by the Chicago group in a recent experiment, we find that ours
is more effective at reversing the many-body process. The difference between
these two schemes manifests the physical effect of the micro-motion in the
Floquet theory. Our scheme can be generalised to other periodically driven
many-body systems.

on the generalization ability of automated image analysis algorithms. This
article proposes a new framework that normalizes the stain style for
cytopathological images through a stain removal module and a multi-stage domain
adversarial style reconstruction module. We convert colorful images into
grayscale images with a color-encoding mask. Using the mask, reconstructed
images retain their basic color without red and blue mixing, which is important
for cytopathological image interpretation. The style reconstruction module
consists of per-pixel regression with intradomain adversarial learning,
inter-domain adversarial learning, and optional task-based refining. Per-pixel
regression with intradomain adversarial learning establishes the generative
network from the decolorized input to the reconstructed output. The interdomain
adversarial learning further reduces the difference in stain style. The
generation network can be optimized by combining it with the task network.
Experimental results show that the proposed techniques help to optimize the
generation network. The average accuracy increases from 75.41% to 84.79% after
the intra-domain adversarial learning, and to 87.00% after interdomain
adversarial learning. Under the guidance of the task network, the average
accuracy rate reaches 89.58%. The proposed method achieves unsupervised stain
normalization of cytopathological images, while preserving the cell structure,
texture structure, and cell color properties of the image. This method
overcomes the problem of generalizing the task models between different stain
styles of cytopathological images.

systems and, to a lesser degree, subharmonic oscillations in periodically
driven systems have been both thoroughly investigated, including their relation
with thermodynamic cost and noise. We perform a systematic study of
oscillations in a third class of nonequilibrium systems: feedback driven
systems. In particular, we use the apparatus of stochastic thermodynamics to
investigate the role of noise and thermodynamic cost in feedback driven
oscillations. For a simple two-state model that displays oscillations, we
analyze the relation between precision and dissipation, revealing that
oscillations can remain coherent for an indefinite time in a finite system with
thermal fluctuations in a limit of diverging thermodynamic cost. We consider
oscillations in a more complex system with several degrees of freedom, an Ising
model driven by feedback between the magnetization and the external field. This
feedback driven system can display subharmonic oscillations similar to the ones
observed in time-crystals. We illustrate the second law for feedback driven
systems that display oscillations. For the Ising model, the oscillating
dissipated heat can be negative. However, when we consider the total entropy
that also includes an informational term related to measurements, the
oscillating total entropy change is always positive. We also study the
finite-size scaling of the dissipated heat, providing evidence for the
existence of a first-order phase transition for certain parameter regimes.

describes the dynamics of the long-wavelength and slow-time fluctuations of an
underlying microscopic theory. In this work we extend the relativistic
hydrodynamics to third order in the gradient expansion for neutral fluids in a
general curved spacetime of $d$ dimensions. We find 58 new transport
coefficients, 19 due to third-order scalar corrections and 39 due to tensorial
corrections. In the particular case of a conformal fluid, the number of new
transport coefficients is reduced to 19, all of them due to third-order
tensorial corrections. The dispersion relations of linear fluctuations in the
third-order relativistic hydrodynamics is obtained, both in the rest frame of
the fluid and in a general moving frame. As an application we obtain some of
the transport coefficients of a relativistic conformal fluid in three
dimensions by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. These transport coefficients
are extracted from the dispersion relations of the linear fluctuations. The
gravity dual of the fluctuations in this conformal fluid is described by the
gravitational perturbations of four-dimensional anti-de Sitter black branes,
which are solutions of the Einstein equations with a negative cosmological
constant. To find the hydrodynamic quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar

all honest nodes need to stay in the same view for a sufficiently long time.
This requires \emph{view synchronization}, a requisite of BFT that we extract

  Existing approaches for Byzantine view synchronization incur quadratic
communication (in $n$, the number of parties). A cascade of $O(n)$ view changes
may thus result in $O(n^3)$ communication complexity. This paper presents a new
Byzantine view synchronization algorithm named Cogsworth, that has
optimistically linear communication complexity and constant latency. Faced with
benign failures, Cogsworth has expected linear communication and constant

transfer from the molecular constituents to collective twist of the assembly,
the effect of which frustrates the lateral assembly and can select equilibrium,
finite diameters of bundles. In this article, the thermodynamics of
twisted-bundle assembly is analyzed to understand if chirality transfer is
necessary for self-limitation, or instead, if spontaneously-twisting, achiral
bundles also exhibit self-limited assembly. A generalized description is
invoked for the elastic costs imposed by twist for bundles of various states of
intra-bundle order from nematic to crystalline, as well as a generic mechanism
for generating twist, classified both by {\it chirality} but also the {\it
twist susceptibility} of inter-filament alignment. The theory provides a
comprehensive set of predictions for the equilibrium twist and size of bundles

sc_7\left((n+2)p^{2k}-2\right)=sc_7(n)\cdot
\left(1+\frac{p^{k+1}-p}{p-1}-\frac{p^k-1}{p-1}.\left(\frac{-D_n}{p}\right)\right),

  circuit QED",,"Phys. Rev. A 101, 033801 (2020)","10.1103/PhysRevA.101.033801",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interaction between superconducting qubits and one-dimensional microwave
transmission lines has been studied experimentally and theoretically in the
past two decades. In this work, we investigate the spontaneous emission of an
initially excited artificial atom which is capacitively coupled to a
semi-infinite transmission line, shorted at one end. This configuration can be
viewed as an atom in front of a mirror. The distance between the atom and the
mirror introduces a time-delay in the system, which we take into account fully.
When the delay time equals an integer number of atom oscillation periods, the
atom converges into a dark state after an initial decay period. The dark state
is an effect of destructive interference between the reflected part of the
field and the part directly emitted by the atom. Based on circuit quantization,
we derive linearized equations of motion for the system and use these for a
semiclassical analysis of the transient dynamics. We also make a rigorous
connection to the quantum optics system-reservoir approach and compare these
two methods to describe the dynamics. We find that both approaches are
equivalent for transmission lines with a low characteristic impedance, while
they differ when this impedance is higher than the typical impedance of the
superconducting artificial atom.

amplitude analysis of $B^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ decays, based on a data
sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3 \; {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of
$pp$ collisions recorded with the LHCb detector. A large $CP$ asymmetry is
observed in the decay amplitude involving the tensor $f_2(1270)$ resonance, and
in addition significant $CP$ violation is found in the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ S-wave at
low invariant mass. The presence of $CP$ violation related to interference
between the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ S-wave and the P-wave $B^+ \to \rho(770)^0 \pi^+$
amplitude is also established; this causes large local asymmetries but cancels
when integrated over the phase space of the decay. The results provide both
qualitative and quantitative new insights into $CP$-violation effects in
hadronic $B$ decays.

an integrated luminosity of $3 \text{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions recorded with
the LHCb detector. The most challenging aspect of the analysis is the
description of the behaviour of the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ S-wave contribution, which is
achieved by using three complementary approaches based on the isobar model, the
K-matrix formalism, and a quasi-model-independent procedure. Additional
resonant contributions for all three methods are described using a common
isobar model, and include the $\rho(770)^0$, $\omega(782)$ and $\rho(1450)^0$
resonances in the $\pi^+\pi^-$ P-wave, the $f_2(1270)$ resonance in the
$\pi^+\pi^-$ D-wave, and the $\rho_3(1690)^0$ resonance in the $\pi^+\pi^-$
F-wave. Significant $C\!P$-violation effects are observed in both S- and
D-waves, as well as in the interference between the S- and P-waves. The results
from all three approaches agree and provide new insight into the dynamics and
the origin of $C\!P$-violation effects in $B^+ \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$

to model the ionospheric behavior we performed a year-round intercomparison

produced by several referent analysis centers,resulting in mean biases lower
than 1 TEC units (TECU). Also, the evalua-tion of our products against direct

the structure of proteins and other macromolecular complexes at near-atomic
resolution. In single particle cryo-EM, the central problem is to reconstruct
the three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule from $10^{4-7}$ noisy and
randomly oriented two-dimensional projections. However, the imaged protein
complexes may exhibit structural variability, which complicates reconstruction
and is typically addressed using discrete clustering approaches that fail to
capture the full range of protein dynamics. Here, we introduce a novel method
for cryo-EM reconstruction that extends naturally to modeling continuous
generative factors of structural heterogeneity. This method encodes structures
in Fourier space using coordinate-based deep neural networks, and trains these
networks from unlabeled 2D cryo-EM images by combining exact inference over
image orientation with variational inference for structural heterogeneity. We
demonstrate that the proposed method, termed cryoDRGN, can perform ab initio
reconstruction of 3D protein complexes from simulated and real 2D cryo-EM image
data. To our knowledge, cryoDRGN is the first neural network-based approach for
cryo-EM reconstruction and the first end-to-end method for directly
reconstructing continuous ensembles of protein structures from cryo-EM images.

therefore no atmospheric spectral signatures have so far been detected.
Super-Earths -- planets lighter than ten M$_\oplus$ -- around later-type stars

in Adaptive Optics (AO) systems, since they introduce bias errors between real
wavefronts propagating to the science detectors and those measured by the
Wavefront Sensor (WFS). This is especially true when the AO system is coupled
to a coronagraph instrument intended for the discovery and characterization of
extra-solar planets, because useful planet signals could be mistaken with
residual speckles generated by NCPA. Therefore, compensating for those errors
is of prime importance and is already the scope of a few theoretical studies
and experimental validations on-sky. This communication presents the conceptual
optical design of a pseudo-interferometer arrangement suitable to accurate NCPA
calibration, based on two WFS cooperating in real-time. The concept is
applicable to both classical imaging and spectroscopy assisted by AO, and to
high-contrast coronagraphs searching for habitable extra-solar planets.
Practical aspects are discussed, such as the choice of WFS and coronagraph
types, or specific requirements on additional hardware components, e.g.

we demonstrate that a dynamic, fast flavor oscillation wave can develop
spontaneously in a one-dimensional (1D) neutrino gas when the angular
distributions of the electron neutrino and antineutrino cross each other.
Unlike the 2D stationary models which are plagued with small-scale flavor
structures, the fast flavor oscillation waves remain coherent in the dynamic 1D
model in both the position and momentum spaces of the neutrino. The electron
lepton number is redistributed and transported in space as the flavor

the same class are closer than examples from different classes. It can be cast
as an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of
triplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the
tremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for
DML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a
mini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet
constraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot
capture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings
sub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a
classification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML
tasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis
shows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each
class has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several
local clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses.
Therefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with
multiple centers for each class. Compared with conventional deep metric
learning algorithms, optimizing SoftTriple loss can learn the embeddings
without the sampling phase by mildly increasing the size of the last fully
connected layer. Experiments on the benchmark fine-grained data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function. Code is available

(electronic gain) to amplify the brightness of captured data. However, this in
turn amplifies the noise, arising from read, shot, and defective pixel sources.
In the raw domain, read and shot noise are effectively modelled using Gaussian
and Poisson distributions respectively, whereas defective pixels can be modeled
with impulsive noise. In extreme low light imaging, noise removal becomes a
critical challenge to produce a high quality, detailed image with low noise. In
this paper, we propose a multi-task deep neural network called Noise
Decomposition (NODE) that explicitly and separately estimates defective pixel
noise, in conjunction with Gaussian and Poisson noise, to denoise an extreme
low light image. Our network is purposely designed to work with raw data, for
which the noise is more easily modeled before going through non-linear
transformations in the image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluation show the proposed method to be more effective at
denoising real raw images than state-of-the-art techniques.

obtained by adding matter to both sides of an irreducible duality. The

radio emission is confined within 3"" (i.e., within the spectroscopic fibre or
~<5kpc at the median redshift), there is twice the chance of observing broad [O

topological theta angle in three dimensions, we find that steepest descent
cycles do not permit us to distinguish between contributions to the
path-integral coming from (would-be) different topological sectors, for example
a vortex from a vortex/anti-vortex. The second problem we analyse is the
truncation of all perturbative expansions. Although the partition function can
be written as a transseries expansion of perturbative plus non-perturbative

each perturbative expansion around trivial and non-trivial saddles truncates
suggesting that normal resurgence analysis cannot be directly applied. The
first problem is solved by complexifying the squashing parameter, which can be
thought of as introducing a chemical potential for the global $U(1)$ rotation
symmetry, or equivalently an omega deformation. This effectively introduces a
hidden ""topological angle"" into the theory and the path integral can be now
decomposed into a sum over different topological sectors via Picard-Lefschetz
theory. The second problem is solved by deforming the matter content making
manifest the Cheshire Cat resurgence structure of the supersymmetric theory,
allowing us to reconstruct non-perturbative information from perturbative data

for first-order resonances to treat higher-order resonances by exploiting a
surprising near-symmetry of the full, non-integrable Hamiltonians of
higher-order resonances. Whereas past works have frequently relied on truncated
disturbing function expansions to derive integrable approximations to resonant

to accurately capture the dynamics of both first- and higher-order resonances
for eccentricities up to orbit-crossing. I demonstrate that predictions of the
new integrable model agree well with numerical integrations of resonant planet

eccentricities. I show that the secular dynamics are governed by conservation
of an AMD-like quantity.
  I also demonstrate that secular frequencies depend on planets' resonant
libration amplitude and this generally gives rise to a secular resonance inside
the mean motion resonance at large libration amplitudes. Outside of the secular
resonance the long-term dynamics are characterized small adiabatic modulations
of the resonant motion while inside the secular resonance planets can
experience large variations of the resonant trajectory over secular timescales.

using photometric data in the 22-850micron range. We derive the total dust
mass, temperature T and emissivity index beta of the galaxies through the
fitting of their spectral energy distribution (SED) using a single modified
black-body model (SMBB). We apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach that reduces
the known degeneracy between T and beta. Applying the hierarchical approach,
the strength of the T-beta anti-correlation is reduced from a Pearson
correlation coefficient R=-0.79 to R=-0.52. For the JINGLE galaxies we measure
dust temperatures in the range 17-30 K and dust emissivity indices beta in the
range 0.6-2.2. We compare the SMBB model with the broken emissivity modified
black-body (BMBB) and the two modified black-bodies (TMBB) models. The results
derived with the SMBB and TMBB are in good agreement, thus applying the SMBB,
which comes with fewer free parameters, does not penalize the measurement of
the cold dust properties in the JINGLE sample. We investigate the relation
between T and beta and other global galaxy properties in the JINGLE and
Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) sample. We find that beta correlates with the
stellar mass surface density (R=0.62) and anti-correlates with the HI mass
fraction (M(HI)/M*, R=-0.65), whereas the dust temperature correlates strongly
with the SFR normalized by the dust mass (R=0.73). These relations can be used
to estimate T and beta in galaxies with insufficient photometric data available
to measure them directly through SED fitting.

and has resisted a general analytic solution for centuries. Various
implementations of perturbation theory provide solutions in portions of
parameter space, but only where hierarchies of masses or separations exist.
Numerical integrations show that bound, non-hierarchical triples of Newtonian
point particles will almost always disintegrate into a single escaping star and
a stable, bound binary, but the chaotic nature of the three-body problem
prevents the derivation of tractable analytic formulae deterministically
mapping initial conditions to final outcomes. However, chaos also motivates the
assumption of ergodicity, suggesting that the distribution of outcomes is
uniform across the accessible phase volume. Here, we use the ergodic hypothesis
to derive a complete statistical solution to the non-hierarchical three-body
problem, one which provides closed-form distributions of outcomes (e.g. binary
orbital elements) given the conserved integrals of motion. We compare our
outcome distributions to large ensembles of numerical three-body integrations,
and find good agreement, so long as we restrict ourselves to ""resonant""
encounters (the ~50% of scatterings that undergo chaotic evolution). In
analyzing our scattering experiments, we identify ""scrambles"" (periods in time
where no pairwise binaries exist) as the key dynamical state that ergodicizes a
non-hierarchical triple. The generally super-thermal distributions of survivor
binary eccentricity that we predict have notable applications to many
astrophysical scenarios. For example, non-hierarchical triples produced
dynamically in globular clusters are a primary formation channel for black hole
mergers, but the rates and properties of the resulting gravitational waves
depend on the distribution of post-disintegration eccentricities.

bulk flows. Second, we employ a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique and
consistently reevaluate the full power spectrum likelihood as we scan over
different cosmologies. Our baseline analysis assumes minimal $\Lambda$CDM,
varies the neutrino masses within a reasonably tight range, fixes the
primordial power spectrum tilt, and uses the big bang nucleosynthesis prior on
the physical baryon density $\omega_b$. In this setup, we find the following
late-Universe parameters: Hubble constant $H_0=(67.9\pm 1.1)$

the control of the ribbon width along with passivation and extent of

They are deployed to screen job applicants for the recommendation of products,
people, and content, as well as in medicine (diagnostics and decision aids),
criminal justice, facial recognition, lending and insurance, and the allocation
of public services. The prominence of algorithmic methods has led to concerns
regarding their systematic unfairness in their treatment of those whose
behavior they are predicting. These concerns have found their way into the
popular imagination through news accounts and general interest books. Even when
these algorithms are deployed in domains subject to regulation, it appears that
existing regulation is poorly equipped to deal with this issue. The word
'fairness' in this context is a placeholder for three related equity concerns.
First, such algorithms may systematically discriminate against individuals with
a common ethnicity, religion, or gender, irrespective of whether the relevant
group enjoys legal protections. The second is that these algorithms fail to
treat people as individuals. Third, who gets to decide how algorithms are
designed and deployed. These concerns are present when humans, unaided, make

minimizing the gap between the source and the target domains through refining
the feature generator, in order to learn a better alignment between the two

target-domain features that are divergent from source-domain features. However,
by optimizing via such domain classification discrepancy, ambiguous target
samples that are not smoothly distributed on the low-dimensional data manifold
are often missed. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Contrastively
Smoothed Class Alignment (CoSCA) model, that explicitly incorporates both
intra- and inter-class domain discrepancy to better align ambiguous target
samples with the source domain. CoSCA estimates the underlying label hypothesis
of target samples, and simultaneously adapts their feature representations by
optimizing a proposed contrastive loss. In addition, Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD) is utilized to directly match features between source and target samples
for better global alignment. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CoSCA can outperform state-of-the-art approaches for

discretely at room temperature and investigate their ultrafast temporal
dynamics in size-tunable $Au-WS_{2}$ hybrid nanostructures using femtosecond
pump-probe spectroscopy technique. Furthermore, we attribute that zero detuning
between the excitons and plasmons is achieved at $\sim$7.0 ps along with
transient Rabi-splitting energy exceeding $\sim$250 meV for both the
spin-plexcitons, validating the strong-coupling conditions of polariton
formation. Realization of these novel spin-plexcitons in the metal-TMDs

depends on the degree to which adaptive optics (AO) systems can mitigate
atmospheric turbulence. While modern AO systems typically suffer from
millisecond time lags between wavefront measurement and control, predictive
wavefront control (pWFC) is a means of compensating for those time lags using
previous wavefront measurements, thereby improving the raw contrast in the
post-coronagraphic science focal plane. A method of predictive control based on
Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) has previously been proposed and
demonstrated on Subaru/SCExAO. In this paper we present initial tests of this
method for application to the near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PYWFS)
recently installed in the Keck II AO system. We demonstrate the expected
root-mean-square wavefront error and contrast benefits of pWFC based on
simulations, applying pWFC to on-sky telemetry data saved during commissioning
of the PYWFS. We discuss how the performance varies as different temporal and
spatial scales are included in the computation of the predictive filter. We
further describe the implementation of EOF pWFC within the PYWFS dedicated
real-time controller, and, via daytime testing at the observatory, we
demonstrate the performance of pWFC in real time when pre-computed phase
screens are applied to the deformable mirror.

best S/N value play important roles in Random Forest, while the skewness of the

More than 20 features were selected by their relative scores and then applied
in three ensemble methods. In the Hybrid Ensemble method, we combined Random
Forest and XGBoost with EasyEnsemble. By changing thresholds, we tried to make
a trade-off between Recall and Precision to make them approximately equal and
as high as possible. Experiments on HTRU 1 and HTRU 2 datasets show that the

comparing the separate universe response bias with the clustering bias of

in the halo field and the down-sampled dark matter field. For voids traced by
halos, we identify two different contributions to the bias. The first is due to
the bias of the underlying halo field used to identify voids, while the second
we attribute to the dynamical impact of long-wavelength density perturbations
on void formation and expansion. By measuring these contributions individually,
we demonstrate that their sum is consistent with the total void bias. We also
measure the void profiles in our simulations, and determine their separate

neutrons, which have been liberated from surrounding material. Our computations
are based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model, which
was originally invented long ago to explain the similarity between the dark and
visible cosmological matter densities, i.e. $ \Omega_{\rm dark} \sim
\Omega_{\rm visible}$. In our proposal the annual modulation is shown to be
generated in keV energy range which is consistent with DL observation in
$(1-6)~ {\rm keV}$ range. This keV energy scale in our proposal is mostly
determined by spectral properties of the neutrinos emitted by the AQN dark
matter particles, while the absence of the modulation with energies above 6 keV
is explained by a sharp cutoff in the neutrino's energy spectrum at $\sim 15$
MeV. This proposal can be directly tested by COSINE-100, ANAIS-112, CYGNO and
other similar experiments. It can be also tested by studying the correlations
between the signals from these experiments and the signatures from drastically

longitudinal data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model addresses learning
with regularly spaced time points (i.e., equal temporal intervals). However,
clinical imaging follows patient needs with often heterogeneous, irregular
acquisitions. To model both regular and irregular longitudinal samples, we
generalize the LSTM model with the Distanced LSTM (DLSTM) for temporally varied
acquisitions. The DLSTM includes a Temporal Emphasis Model (TEM) that enables
learning across regularly and irregularly sampled intervals. Briefly, (1) the
time intervals between longitudinal scans are modeled explicitly, (2)
temporally adjustable forget and input gates are introduced for irregular
temporal sampling; and (3) the latest longitudinal scan has an additional
emphasis term. We evaluate the DLSTM framework in three datasets including
simulated data, 1794 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) scans, and 1420
clinically acquired data with heterogeneous and irregular temporal accession.
The experiments on the first two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance on both simulated and regularly sampled datasets (e.g.
improve LSTM from 0.6785 to 0.7085 on F1 score in NLST). In external validation
of clinically and irregularly acquired data, the benchmarks achieved 0.8350

Non-unitarity in the measurement of the three active neutrinos can be due to
the existence of sterile neutrino states. We introduce the concept of the
four-flavor tetrahedron in order to visualize the lack of unitarity in the
astrophysical neutrino three-flavor triangle. We demonstrate that
active-sterile neutrino mixings modify the allowed region of the astrophysical
flavor ratio from the standard case. However, a projection of the four-flavor
tetrahedron has restrictions of phase space similar to the three-flavor
triangle. On the other hand, the initial presence of astrophysical sterile
neutrinos drastically changes the scenario, and it allows an apparent unitarity
violation in the three-flavor triangle space. Using current global fit
constraints including the non-unitarity case, we also illustrate the allowed
astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios. Thus, the measurement of the high-energy
astrophyscal neutrino flavor content allows us to explore sterile neutrinos
independently of the sterile neutrino mass scale. These are topics of
investigation for current and future neutrino telescopes.

energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient
localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive
transient localization typically operate at low-frequency (< a-few-hundred
cm-1), which renders it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this
has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and
reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be extrinsic, being
controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here we report on a

set-theoretic systems, for instance, ZFC, are based on CP. PW is not valid for
infinite sets. In the last two decades, the topic of sizes of infinite sets has
resurfaced again in a number of papers. A question of whether it is possible to
compare the sizes to comply with PW has been risen and researched. Bernard
Bolzano in his 1848 Paradoxes of the Infinite dealt with principles of
introducing infinity into mathematics. He created a theory of infinite
quantities that respects PW and which is based on sums of infinite series. We
extend Bolzano's theory and create a constructive method for determining the
set size of countable sets so that the cardinality of finite sets is preserved
and PW is valid. Our concept is close to the numerosity theory from the
beginning of this century but it is simpler and more intuitive. In the results,
we partly agree with the theory of numerosities. The sizes of countable sets
are uniquely determined, but they are not linearly ordered.

classical long-range interacting systems. Is this also true once quantum
fluctuations have been accounted for? As a test case we study the Hamiltonian
Mean Field (HMF) model for a system of indistinguishable bosons which is
predicted (according to mean-field theory) to undergo a second-order quantum
phase transition at zero temperature. The ordered phase is characterized by a
spontaneously broken $O(2)$ symmetry, which, despite occurring in a
one-dimensional model, is not ruled out by the Mermin-Wagner theorem due to the
presence of long-range interactions. Nevertheless, a spontaneously broken
symmetry implies gapless Goldstone modes whose large fluctuations can restore
broken symmetries. In this work, we study the influence of quantum fluctuations
by projecting the Hamiltonian onto the continuous subspace of symmetry breaking
mean-field states. We find that the energetic cost of gradients in the center
of mass wavefunction inhibit the breaking of the $O(2)$ symmetry, but that the
energetic cost is very small --- scaling as $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$. Nevertheless,
for any finite $N$, no matter how large, this implies that the ground state has
a restored $O(2)$ symmetry. Implications for the finite temperature phases, and
classical limit, of the HMF model are discussed.

fast-photometric mode in order to detect any fast variation of the flux and
correlate them with the optical and X-ray light curves. The optical curve shows
the typical sinusoidal modulation at the orbital period (4.75hr). No flaring or
flickering is found in the optical, neither signs of transitions between active
and passive states. On the contrary, the NIR curve displays a bimodal
behaviour, showing strong flares in the first part of the curve, and an almost
flat trend in the rest. The X-ray curves show a few low/high mode transitions,
but no flaring activity. One of the low/high mode transition is found to happen
at the same time as the emission of an infrared flare. This can be interpreted
as the emission of a jet: the NIR flare could be due to the evolving spectrum
of the jet, which possesses a break frequency that moves from higher (NIR) to
lower (radio) frequencies after the launching, that has to happen at the
low/high mode transition. We also present the cross correlation function
between the optical and near infrared curves. Due to the bimodality of the NIR
curve, we divided it in two parts (flaring and quiet). While the CCF of the
quiet part is found to be flat, the one referring to the flaring part shows a
narrow peak at ~10s, which indicates a delay of the NIR emission with respect
to the optical. This lag can be interpreted as reprocessing of the optical
emission at the light cylinder radius with a stream of matter spiraling around
the system due to a phase of radio-ejection. This strongly supports a different
origin of the NIR flares observed for PSR J1023+0038 with respect to the
optical and X-ray flaring activity reported in other works on the same source.

their physical environment in a predictable time. While multicore platforms
provide incredible computational power and throughput, they also introduce new
sources of unpredictability. Large fluctuations in latency to access data
shared between multiple cores is an important contributor to the overall
execution-time variability. In addition to the temporal unpredictability
introduced by caching, parallel applications with data shared across multiple
cores also pay additional latency overheads due to data coherence. Analyzing
the impact of data coherence on the worst-case execution-time of real-time
applications is challenging because only scarce implementation details are
revealed by manufacturers. This paper presents application level control for
caching data at different levels of the cache hierarchy. The rationale is that
by caching data only in shared cache it is possible to bypass private caches.
The access latency to data present in caches becomes independent of its
coherence state. We discuss the existing architectural support as well as the
required hardware and OS modifications to support the proposed cacheability
control. We evaluate the system on an architectural simulator. We show that the
worst case execution time for a single memory write request is reduced by 52%.

which are chargeless zero-energy emergent quasiparticles. With their
non-Abelian exchange statistics and fractionalization of a single electron
stored nonlocally as a spatially separated MBS, they are particularly suitable
for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. While the main
efforts to realize MBS have focused on one-dimensional systems, the onset of
topological superconductivity requires delicate parameter tuning and geometric
constraints pose significant challenges for their control and demonstration of
non-Abelian statistics. To overcome these challenges, building on recent
experimental advances in planar Josephson junctions (JJs), we propose a MBS
platform of X-shaped JJs. This versatile implementation reveals how external
flux control of the superconducting phase difference can generate and
manipulate multiple MBS pairs to probe non-Abelian statistics. The underlying
topological superconductivity exists over a large parameter space, consistent
with materials used in our fabrication of such X junctions, as an important
step towards scalable topological quantum computing.

on topological congruence metrics that quantify similarity between two
dendrograms and can give a normalised score between 0 and 1. Specifically, this
article describes and tests two metrics the Clade Retention Index (CRI) and the
MASTxCF which is derived from the combined information available from a maximum
agreement subtree and a strict consensus. The two metrics were developed to
study differences between evolutionary trees, but their applications are
multidisciplinary and can be used on hierarchical cluster diagrams derived from
analyses in science, technology, maths or social sciences disciplines. A
comprehensive, but non-exhaustive review of other tree congruence metrics is
provided and nine metrics are further analysed. 1,620 pairwise analyses of
simulated dendrograms (which could be derived from any type of analysis) were
conducted and are compared in Pac-man piechart matrices. Kendalls tau-b is used
to demonstrate the concordance of the different metrics and Spearmans rho
ranked correlations are used to support these findings. The results support the
use of the CRI and MASTxCF as part of a suite of metrics, but it is recommended
that permutation metrics such as SPR distances and weighted metrics are
disregarded for the specific purpose of measuring similarity.

on their behalf) collectively report measurements about the physical world.
This paper focuses on a quality-cost-aware task allocation problem in
multi-attribute social sensing applications. The goal is to identify a task
allocation strategy (i.e., decide when and where to collect sensing data) to
achieve an optimized tradeoff between the data quality and the sensing cost.
While recent progress has been made to tackle similar problems, three important
challenges have not been well addressed: (i) ""online task allocation"": the task
allocation schemes need to respond quickly to the potentially large dynamics of
the measured variables in social sensing; (ii) ""multi-attribute constrained
optimization"": minimizing the overall sensing error given the dependencies and
constraints of multiple attributes of the measured variables is a non-trivial
problem to solve; (iii) ""nonuniform task allocation cost"": the task allocation
cost in social sensing often has a nonuniform distribution which adds
additional complexity to the optimized task allocation problem. This paper
develops a Quality-Cost-Aware Online Task Allocation (QCO-TA) scheme to address
the above challenges using a principled online reinforcement learning
framework. We evaluate the QCO-TA scheme through a real-world social sensing
application and the results show that our scheme significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both sensing accuracy and cost.

data, and none has been reported for Ru. EOS were calculated for both elements
using all-electron atom-in-jellium theory, and cold compression curves were
calculated for the common crystal types using the multi-ion pseudopotential
approach. Previous EOS constructed for these elements used Thomas-Fermi (TF)
theory for the electronic behavior at high temperatures, which neglects
electronic shell structure; the atom-in-jellium EOS exhibited pronounced
features from the excitation of successive electron shells. Otherwise, the EOS
matched surprisingly well, especially considering the lack of experimental data
for Ru. The TF-based EOS for Ru may however be inaccurate in the
multi-terapascal range needed for some high energy density experiments. The
multi-ion calculations predicted that the hexagonal close-packed phase of Ru
remains stable to at least 2.5 TPa and possibly 10 TPa, and that its c/a should
gradually increase to the ideal value. A method was devised to estimate the
variation in Debye temperature from the cold curve, and thus estimate the
ion-thermal EOS without requiring relatively expensive dynamical force
calculations, in a form convenient for adjusting EOS or phase boundaries. The
Debye temperature estimated in this way was similar to the result from
atom-in-jellium calculations. We also predict the high-pressure melt loci of
both elements.

isolated, low-mass (log$M_*/M_\odot\approx7.6$), dwarf irregular galaxy in the
Local Group (LG). We analyze an HST/COS archival spectrum of a quasar sightline
(PHL2525), which is 45 kpc (0.5 virial radius) from WLM and close to the
Magellanic Stream (MS). Along this sightline, two ion absorbers are detected in
Si II, Si III, Si IV, C II, and C IV at velocities of $\sim$-220 km s$^{-1}$
(Component v-220) and $\sim$-150 km s$^{-1}$ (Component v-150). To identify
their origins, we study the position-velocity alignment of the components with
WLM and the nearby MS. Near the Magellanic longitude of PHL2525, the MS-related
neutral and ionized gas moves at $\lesssim-190$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting an MS
origin for Component v-220, but not for Component v-150. Because PHL2525 passes
near WLM and Component v-150 is close to WLM's systemic velocity ($\sim$-132 km
s$^{-1}$), it is likely that Component v-150 arises from the galaxy's CGM. This
results in a total Si mass in WLM's CGM of $M_{\rm Si}^{\rm
CGM}\sim(0.2-1.0)\times10^5~M_\odot$ using assumption from other COS dwarf
studies. Comparing $M_{\rm Si}^{\rm CGM}$ to the total Si mass synthesized in
WLM over its lifetime ($\sim$1.3$\times10^5~M_\odot$), we find $\sim$3% is
locked in stars, $\sim$6% in the ISM, $\sim$15%-77% in the CGM, and the rest
($\sim$14%-76%) is likely lost beyond the virial radius. Our finding resonates
with other COS dwarf galaxy studies and theoretical predictions that low-mass
galaxies can easily lose metals into their CGM due to stellar feedback and
shallow gravitational potential.

quantization program whose aim was to take into account the underlying
four-dimensional diffeomorphism symmetry in the transition from a Lagrangian to
a Hamiltonian formulation of Einstein's theory. They argued that even though
one seemed to destroy the full covariance through the focus on a temporal
foliation of spacetime, this loss was illusory. Early on they convinced
themselves that only the construction of classical invariants could adequately
reflect the fully relativistic absence of physical meaning of spacetime
coordinates. Efforts were made by Bergmann students Newman and Janis to
construct these classical invariants. Then in the late 1950's Bergmann and
Komar proposed a comprehensive program in which classical invariants could be
constructed using the spacetime geometry itself to fix intrinsic spacetime
landmarks. At roughly the same time Dirac formulated a new criterion for
identifying initial phase space variables, one of whose consequences was that
Bergmann himself abandoned the gravitational lapse and shift as canonical
variables. Furthermore, Bergmann in 1962 interpreted the Dirac formalism as
altering the very nature of diffeomorphism symmetry. One class of infinitesimal
diffeomorphism was to be understood as depending on the perpendicular to the
given temporal foliation. Thus even within the Bergmann school program the
preservation of the full four-dimensional symmetry in the Hamiltonian program
became problematic. Indeed, the ADM and associated Wheeler-DeWitt program that
gained and has retained prominence since this time abandoned the full symmetry.
There do remain dissenters - raising the question whether the field of quantum
gravity has witnessed a Renaissance in the ensuing decades - or might the full
four-dimensional symmetry yet be reborn?

popularity for recommendation task, due to the high autocorrelation of user's

recommender systems still solely focus on the short-term interactions within a
single session and completely discard all the other long-term data across
different sessions. While traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods have
many advanced research works on exploring long-term dependency, which show
great value to be explored and exploited in deep learning models. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose ASARS, a novel framework that effectively imports the
temporal dynamics methodology in CF into session-based RNN system in DL, such
that the temporal info can act as scalable weights by a parallel attentional
network. Specifically, we first conduct an extensive data analysis to show the
distribution and importance of such temporal interactions data both within
sessions and across sessions. And then, our ASARS framework promotes two novel
models: (1) an inter-session temporal dynamic model that captures the long-term
user interaction for RNN recommender system. We integrate the time changes in
session RNN and add user preferences as model drifting; and (2) a novel
triangle parallel attention network that enhances the original RNN model by
incorporating time information. Such triangle parallel network is also
specially designed for realizing data argumentation in sequence-to-scalar RNN
architecture, and thus it can be trained very efficiently. Our extensive
experiments on four real datasets from different domains demonstrate the
effectiveness and large improvement of ASARS for personalized recommendation.

propose an insertion strategy that leverages tactile sensing to: 1) safely
probe the box with the grasped object while monitoring incipient slip to
maintain a stable grasp on the object. 2) estimate and correct for residual
position uncertainties to insert the object into a designated gap without
disturbing the environment.
  Our proposed methodology is based on two neural networks that estimate the
error direction and error magnitude, from a stream of tactile imprints,
acquired by two GelSlim fingers, during the insertion process. The system is
trained on four objects with basic geometric shapes, which we show generalizes
to four other common objects. Based on the estimated positional errors, a
heuristic controller iteratively adjusts the position of the object and
eventually inserts it successfully without requiring prior knowledge of the
geometry of the object. The key insight is that dense tactile feedback contains
useful information with respect to the contact interaction between the grasped
object and its environment. We achieve high success rate and show that unknown
objects can be inserted with an average of 6 attempts of the probe-correct
loop. The method's ability to generalize to novel objects makes it a good fit

of 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at
a level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a
detection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved.
Second, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected
based on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal. Once
the input signal is identified as a UAV controller signal, it is classified
using machine learning (ML) techniques. Fifteen statistical features extracted
from the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to
neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features
are selected. The performance of the NCA and five different ML classifiers are
studied for 15 different types of UAV controllers. A classification accuracy of
98.13% is achieved by k-nearest neighbor classifier at 25 dB SNR.
Classification performance is also investigated at different SNR levels and for
a set of 17 UAV controllers which includes two pairs from the same UAV
controller models.

three-fold: (1) to study the nonlinear effects on transient energy growth, (2)
to design a feedback control strategy to prevent this subcritical transition,
and (3) to examine the control mechanisms that enable transition suppression.
We investigate transient energy growth of linear optimal disturbance in plane
Poiseuille flow at a subcritical Reynolds number of $Re=3000$ using linear
analysis and nonlinear simulation. We find that the amplification of the given
initial perturbation is reduced when the nonlinear effect is substantial, with
larger perturbations being less amplified in general. Moreover, we design
linear quadratic optimal controllers to delay transition via wall-normal
blowing and suction actuation at the channel walls. We demonstrate that these
feedback controllers are capable of reducing transient energy growth in the
linear setting. The performance of the same controllers is evaluated for
nonlinear flows where a laminar-to-turbulent transition emerges without

energy growth and suppress transition. Further, we identify and characterize

point begins as classified according to one label, but over time the notion of
that label changes. Beyond linear autoregressive models, transfer and meta
learning address drift, but require data that is representative of disparate
domains at the outset of training. To relax this requirement, we propose a
memory-efficient \emph{online} universal function approximator based on
compressed kernel methods. Our approach hinges upon viewing non-stationary
learning as online convex optimization with dynamic comparators, for which
performance is quantified by dynamic regret.
  Prior works control dynamic regret growth only for linear models. In
contrast, we hypothesize actions belong to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS). We propose a functional variant of online gradient descent (OGD)
operating in tandem with greedy subspace projections. Projections are necessary
to surmount the fact that RKHS functions have complexity proportional to time.
  For this scheme, we establish sublinear dynamic regret growth in terms of
both loss variation and functional path length, and that the memory of the
function sequence remains moderate. Experiments demonstrate the usefulness of
the proposed technique for online nonlinear regression and classification

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at the interface, in addition to the
usual Heisenberg form. We numerically evaluate the dependence of the spin
current on the temperature and bulk DMI using a pyrochlore iridate as a model
insulator with all-in all-out (AIAO) ground state configuration. We also
compare the results of different crystalline surfaces arising from different
crystalline orientations and conclude that the relative angles between the
interfacial moments and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors play a significant role
in the spin transfer. Our work extends the theory of the SSE by including the
anisotropic nature of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange
interaction in magnetic insulator$|$non-magnetic metal heterostructures and can
suggest possible materials to optimize the interfacial spin transfer in
spintronic devices.

extended to fuse depth information from multiple target frames. Given two
unconstrained images from a monocular camera with known intrinsic calibration,
our network estimates relative camera poses and the depth map of the source
image. The core contribution of the proposed method is threefold. First, a
network is tailored for static scenes that jointly estimates the optical flow
and camera motion. By the joint estimation, the optical flow search space is
gradually reduced resulting in an efficient and accurate flow estimation.
Second, a novel triangulation layer is proposed to encode the estimated optical
flow and camera motion while avoiding common numerical issues caused by
epipolar. Third, beyond two-view depth estimation, we further extend the above
networks to fuse depth information from multiple target images and estimate the
depth map of the source image. To further benefit the research community, we
introduce tools to generate photorealistic structure-from-motion datasets such
that deep networks can be well trained and evaluated. The proposed method is
compared with previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results within
less time. Images from real-world applications and Google Earth are used to

Traditional approaches tackle entity resolution with hierarchical clustering,

sources in the input data correspond to elements and entities in output data

optimal inequalities (DOI), that we call flexible dual optimal inequalities,

recent works on the geometry of quantum correlations, we are interested in the
problem of computing quantum Bell inequalities or the boundary between quantum

efficient device-independent quantum processing protocols. We show that
computing quantum Bell inequalities is an instance of a quantifier elimination
problem, and apply these techniques to the bipartite scenario in which each
party can have three measurement settings. Due to heavy computational
complexity, we are able to obtain the characterization of certain ""linear""

methods, however, require multiple input images from varying viewpoints. In
this paper, we introduce a framework that synthesizes the 3D Ken Burns effect
from a single image, supporting both a fully automatic mode and an interactive
mode with the user controlling the camera. Our framework first leverages a
depth prediction pipeline, which estimates scene depth that is suitable for
view synthesis tasks. To address the limitations of existing depth estimation
methods such as geometric distortions, semantic distortions, and inaccurate
depth boundaries, we develop a semantic-aware neural network for depth
prediction, couple its estimate with a segmentation-based depth adjustment
process, and employ a refinement neural network that facilitates accurate depth
predictions at object boundaries. According to this depth estimate, our
framework then maps the input image to a point cloud and synthesizes the
resulting video frames by rendering the point cloud from the corresponding
camera positions. To address disocclusions while maintaining geometrically and
temporally coherent synthesis results, we utilize context-aware color- and
depth-inpainting to fill in the missing information in the extreme views of the
camera path, thus extending the scene geometry of the point cloud. Experiments
with a wide variety of image content show that our method enables realistic
synthesis results. Our study demonstrates that our system allows users to
achieve better results while requiring little effort compared to existing
solutions for the 3D Ken Burns effect creation.

attempts to find sparse loading vectors when conducting dimension reduction.
This paper considers the nonsmooth Riemannian optimization problem associated
with the ScoTLASS model for sparse PCA which can impose orthogonality and
sparsity simultaneously. A Riemannian proximal method is proposed in the work
of Chen et al. for the efficient solution of this optimization problem. In this
paper, two acceleration schemes are introduced. First and foremost, we extend
the FISTA method from the Euclidean space to the Riemannian manifold to solve
sparse PCA, leading to the accelerated Riemannian proximal gradient method.
Since the Riemannian optimization problem for sparse PCA is essentially
non-convex, a restarting technique is adopted to stabilize the accelerated
method without sacrificing the fast convergence. Second, a diagonal
preconditioner is proposed for the Riemannian proximal subproblem which can
further accelerate the convergence of the Riemannian proximal methods.
Numerical evaluations establish the computational advantages of the proposed
methods over the existing proximal gradient methods on a manifold.
Additionally, a short result concerning the convergence of the Riemannian
subgradients of a sequence is established, which, together with the result in
the work of Chen et al., can show the stationary point convergence of the
Riemannian proximal methods.

active when the Universe had only half of its present age. The density of the

pre-existing online algorithms were based on learning the dual optimal
solutions/prices of the linear programs (LP), and their analyses were focused
on the aggregate objective value and solving the packing LP where all

two major open questions were: (i) Does the set of LP optimal dual prices
learned in the pre-existing algorithms converge to those of the ""offline"" LP,
and (ii) Could the results be extended to general LP problems where the

type of OLP algorithm, Action-History-Dependent Learning Algorithm, which
improves the previous algorithm performances by taking into account the past

While deep learning approaches have been shown to be successful in providing
effective classification solutions, especially for high dimensional problems,
unfortunately they work best with a lot of labelled examples available. To
alleviate the second requirement for a particular dataset the transfer learning
approach can be used: first the network is pre-trained on some dataset with
large amount of training labels available, then the actual dataset is used to
fine-tune the network. This strategy is not straightforward to apply with
hyperspectral images, as it is often the case that only one particular image of

investigate a simple and effective strategy of transfer learning that uses
unsupervised pre-training step without label information. This approach can be
applied to many of the hyperspectral classification problems. Performed
experiments show that it is very effective at improving the classification
accuracy without being restricted to a particular image type or neural network
architecture. The experiments were carried out on several deep neural network
architectures and various sizes of labeled training sets. The greatest
improvement in overall accuracy on the Indian Pines and Pavia University

advantage of the proposed approach is the unsupervised nature of the

in the Gaussian cluster state (where the weight factor is unit). For the
four-mode square Gaussian weighted graph state, EPR steering between one and
its two nearest modes is also presented, which is absent in the four-mode
square Gaussian cluster state. We also show that Gaussian EPR steering in a
weighted graph state is also bounded by the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy
relation. The presented results are useful for exploiting EPR steering in a
Gaussian weighted graph state as a valuable resource in multiparty quantum
communication tasks.

interactively visualizes large line vector datasets at variable LODs. It is
based on the Douglas-Peucker line simplification principle, generating an
exhaustive set of line segments whose specific subsets represent the lines at
any variable LOD. At run time, an appropriate and view-dependent error metric
supports screen-space adaptive LOD levels and the display of the correct subset
of line segments accordingly. Our implementation shows that we can simplify and
display large line datasets interactively. We can successfully apply line style

the accretion burst was triggered between 1953 and 2009. We identified CO
emission associated with a molecular bipolar outflow extending up to a ~10^4 au
scale and a rotating molecular envelope extending over >10^4 au. The
interaction with the hot energetic FUor wind, which was observed using optical
spectroscopy, appears limited to a region within ~400 au of the star. The
envelope mass and the collimation of the extended CO outflow suggest that the
progenitor of this FUor is a low-mass Class I young stellar object (YSO). These
parameters for V900 Mon, another FUor, and a few FUor-like stars are consistent
with the idea that FUor outbursts are associated with normal YSOs. The
continuum emission is marginally resolved in our observations with a 0.""2x0.""15
(~300x225 au) beam, and a Gaussian model provides a deconvolved FWHM of ~90 au.
The emission is presumably associated with a dusty circumstellar disk, plus a
possible contribution from a wind or a wind cavity close to the star. The warm
compact nature of the disk continuum emission could be explained with viscous
heating of the disk, while gravitational fragmentation in the outer disk and/or
a combination of grain growth and their inward drift may also contribute to its
compact nature.

continuous or periodic transmission of information within feedback loop is
necessary for the effective control and stabilization of the system. In
addition, uncertainty---originating from variation of parameters or unmodeled
system dynamics---plays a key role in the system's stability. To address these
three critical factors, we solve the joint control and security problem for an
uncertain discrete-time Networked Control System (NCS) subject to limited
availability of the shared communication channel. An event-triggered-based
control and communication strategy is adopted to reduce bandwidth consumption.
To tackle the uncertainty in the system dynamics, a robust control law is
derived using an optimal control approach based on a virtual nominal dynamics
associated with a quadratic cost-functional. The conditions for closed-loop
stability and aperiodic transmission rule of feedback information are derived
using the discrete-time Input-to-State Stability theory. We show that the
proposed control approach withstands a general class of DoS attacks, and the
stability analysis rests upon the characteristics of the attack signal. The
results are illustrated and validated numerically with a classical NCS batch
reactor system.

maximise the robot's manipulability throughout the motion, while also
minimising surface-distance travelled between the two points. This work has
application in industrial problems of \textit{rough} robotic cutting,
\textit{e.g.} demolition of legacy nuclear plant, where the cut path need not
be precise as long as it achieves dismantling. We show how detours in the cut
path can be leveraged, to increase the manipulability of the robot at all
points along the path. This helps avoid singularities, while maximising the
robot's capability to make small deviations during task execution,
\textit{e.g.} compliantly responding to cutting forces via impedance control.
We show how a sampling-based planner can be projected onto the Riemannian
manifold of a curved surface, and extended to include a term which maximises
manipulability. We present the results of empirical experiments, with both
simulated and real robots, which are tasked with moving over a variety of
different surface shapes. Our planner enables successful task completion, while
avoiding singularities and ensuring significantly greater manipulability when

eviction and re-execution of low-priority jobs. We advocate a new resource
management design that exploits the idea of differential approximation and
sprinting. The unique combination of approximation and sprinting avoids the
eviction of low-priority jobs and its consequent latency degradation and
resource waste. To this end, we designed, implemented and evaluated DiAS, an
extension of the Spark processing engine to support deflate jobs by dropping
tasks and to sprint jobs. Our experiments on scenarios with two and three
priority classes indicate that DiAS achieves up to 90% and 60% latency
reduction for low- and high-priority jobs, respectively. DiAS not only
eliminates resource waste but also (surprisingly) lowers energy consumption up
to 30% at only a marginal accuracy loss for low-priority jobs.

million suns within an environment that differs markedly from that of the
Galactic disk. While the black hole is essentially quiescent in the broader
context of active galactic nuclei, X-ray observations have provided evidence
for energetic outbursts from its surroundings. Also, while the levels of star
formation in the Galactic Centre have been approximately constant over the last
few hundred Myr, there is evidence of elevated short-duration bursts, strongly
influenced by interaction of the black hole with the enhanced gas density
present within the ring-like Central Molecular Zone at Galactic longitude |l| <
0.7 degrees and latitude |b| < 0.2 degrees. The inner 200 pc region is
characterized by large amounts of warm molecular gas, a high cosmic ray
ionization rate, unusual gas chemistry, enhanced synchrotron emission, and a
multitude of radio-emitting magnetised filaments, the origin of which has not
been established. Here we report radio imaging that reveals bipolar bubbles
spanning 1 degree x 3 degrees (140 parsecs x 430 parsecs), extending above and
below the Galactic plane and apparently associated with the Galactic Centre.
The structure is edge-brightened and bounded, with symmetry implying creation
by an energetic event in the Galactic Centre. We estimate the age of the
bubbles to be a few million years, with a total energy of 7 x 10^52 ergs. We
postulate that the progenitor event was a major contributor to the increased
cosmic-ray density in the Galactic Centre, and is in turn the principal source
of the relativistic particles required to power the synchrotron emission of the
radio filaments within and in the vicinity of the bubble cavities.

specification, asks for the algorithmic verification of whether the model
satisfies the specification. Two classical models for reactive systems are
graphs and Markov decision processes (MDPs). A basic specification formalism in
the verification of reactive systems is the strong fairness (aka Streett)
objective, where given different types of requests and corresponding grants,
the requirement is that for each type, if the request event happens infinitely
often, then the corresponding grant event must also happen infinitely often.
All omega-regular objectives can be expressed as Streett objectives and hence
they are canonical in verification. Consider graphs/MDPs with n vertices, m
edges, and a Streett objectives with k pairs, and let b denote the size of the
description of the Streett objective for the sets of requests and grants. The
current best-known algorithm for the problem requires time $O(min(n^2, m
\sqrt{m \log n}) + b \log n)$. In this work, we present randomized near-linear
time algorithms, with expected running time $\widetilde{O}(m + b)$, where the
$\widetilde{O}$ notation hides poly-log factors. Our randomized algorithms are
near-linear in the size of the input, and hence optimal up to poly-log factors.

measurement and the Standard Model prediction of the CP asymmetry in $\tau\to
K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays, as well as the prospects of future measurements at
Belle II, we revisit this observable in this paper. Firstly, we reproduce the
known CP asymmetry due to $K^0 -\bar{K}^0$ mixing by means of the reciprocal
basis, which is convenient when a $K_{S(L)}$ is involved in the final state. As
the $K\pi$ tensor form factor plays a crucial role in generating a non-zero
direct CP asymmetry that can arise only from the interference of vector and
tensor operators, we then present a dispersive representation of this form
factor, with its phase obtained in the context of chiral theory with
resonances, which fulfills the requirements of unitarity and analyticity.
Finally, the $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays are analyzed both within a
model-independent low-energy effective theory framework and in a scalar
leptoquark scenario. It is observed that the CP anomaly can be accommodated in
the model-independent framework, even at the $1\sigma$ level, together with the
constraint from the branching ratio of $\tau^-\to K_S\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay; it
can be, however, marginally reconciled only at the $2\sigma$ level, due to the
specific relation between the scalar and tensor operators in the scalar
leptoquark scenario. Once the combined constraints from the branching ratio and
the decay spectrum of this decay are taken into account, these possibilities
are however both excluded, even without exploiting further the stronger bounds
from the (semi-)leptonic kaon decays under the assumption of lepton-flavour
universality, as well as from the neutron electric dipole moment and
$D-\bar{D}$ mixing under the assumption of $SU(2)$ invariance of the weak

between data-based learners and model-based solvers. Solvers such as classical
planners are very flexible and can deal with a variety of problem instances and
goals but require first-order symbolic models. Data-based learners, on the
other hand, are robust but do not produce such representations. In this work we
address this split by showing how the first-order symbolic representations that
are used by planners can be learned from non-symbolic inputs that encode the
structure of the state space. The representation learning problem is formulated
as the problem of inferring planning instances over a common but unknown
first-order domain that account for the structure of the observed state space.
This means to infer a complete first-order representation (i.e. general action
schemas, relational symbols, and objects) that explains the observed state
space structures. The inference problem is cast as a two-level combinatorial
search where the outer level searches for values of a small set of
hyperparameters and the inner level, solved via SAT, searches for a first-order
symbolic model. The framework is shown to produce general and correct
first-order representations for standard problems like Gripper, Blocksworld,
and Hanoi from input graphs that encode the flat state-space structure of a
single instance.

filtergrams in the blue with HiFI, (2) imaging spectroscopy of Na I D2 at 5890

out for the Si I 10827 A Stokes profiles. BPs are identified in Ca II H and
blue continuum filtergrams. They are also detected in the blue wing of Na I D2
and Si I 10827 A, as well as in Ca I 10839 A line-core images. We carried out
two studies to validate the expansion of the magnetic field with height. First,
we compare the photospheric Stokes V signals of two different spectral lines
that are sensitive to different optical depths (Ca I vs. Si I). The area at
which the Stokes V signal is significantly large is almost three times larger
for the Si I line - sensitive to higher layers - than for the Ca I one. Second,
the inferred line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields at two optical depths (log tau
= -1.0 vs. -2.5) from the Si I line reveal spatially broader fields in the
higher layer, up to 51% more extensive in one of the BPs. The dynamics of BPs
are tracked along the Na I D2 and Si I lines. The inferred flows from Na I D2
Doppler shifts are slow in BPs (< 1 km/s). The Si I line shows intriguing
Stokes profiles with important asymmetries. The analysis of these profiles
unveils the presence of two components, a fast and a slow one, within the same
resolution element. The faster one, with a smaller filling factor of 0.3,
exhibits LOS velocities of about 6 km/s. The slower component is slightly
blueshifted. The present work provides observational evidence for the expansion
of the magnetic field with height. Moreover, fast flows are likely present in
BPs but are often hidden because of observational limitations.

identifying inflowing (v_GSR < 0 km/s) and outflowing (v_GSR > 0 km/s)
populations, and using observational constraints on the distance, metallicity,
dust content, covering fractions, and total hydrogen column density of each

over outflowing gas suggests that the Milky Way is currently in an
inflow-dominated phase, but the presence of substantial mass flux in both
directions supports a Galactic fountain model, in which gas is constantly
recycled between the disk and the halo. We also find that the metal flux in
both directions (in and out) is indistinguishable. By comparing the outflow
rate to the Galactic star formation rate, we present the first estimate of the
mass loading factor (etc_HVC) of the disk-wide Milky Way wind, finding eta_HVC

light curves known for a stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities
to normal and `ultra-stripped' type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase
spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion, display
prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich transient. The Ca
emission lines at this phase show an unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of
10,000 -- 12,000 km/s. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra
suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of $0.2 - 0.4$ M$_\odot$ and
a low kinetic energy of $ (2-4)\times 10^{50}$ erg, giving a specific kinetic
energy $\sim1$ [$10^{51}$ erg]/M$_\odot$. The origin of this event cannot be
unambiguously defined. While the abundance distribution used to model the
spectra marginally favours a progenitor of white dwarf origin through the
tentative identification of \ArII, the specific kinetic energy, which is
defined by the explosion mechanism, is found to be more similar to an
ultra-stripped core-collapse events. SN 2019bkc adds to the diverse range of

  Analysis from Audio-visual Signals","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing (TAC)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Personality perception is implicitly biased due to many subjective factors,
such as cultural, social, contextual, gender and appearance. Approaches
developed for automatic personality perception are not expected to predict the
real personality of the target, but the personality external observers
attributed to it. Hence, they have to deal with human bias, inherently
transferred to the training data. However, bias analysis in personality
computing is an almost unexplored area. In this work, we study different
possible sources of bias affecting personality perception, including emotions
from facial expressions, attractiveness, age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as
their influence on prediction ability for apparent personality estimation. To
this end, we propose a multi-modal deep neural network that combines raw audio
and visual information alongside predictions of attribute-specific models to
regress apparent personality. We also analyse spatio-temporal aggregation
schemes and the effect of different time intervals on first impressions. We
base our study on the ChaLearn First Impressions dataset, consisting of
one-person conversational videos. Our model shows state-of-the-art results
regressing apparent personality based on the Big-Five model. Furthermore, given
the interpretability nature of our network design, we provide an incremental
analysis on the impact of each possible source of bias on final network
predictions.

The clinical effectiveness of primary prevention implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is under debate. It is urgently needed
to better identify patients who benefit from prophylactic ICD therapy. The
EUropean Comparative Effectiveness Research to Assess the Use of Primary
ProphylacTic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (EU-CERT-ICD) completed in
2019 will assess this issue.
  SUMMARY. The EU-CERT-ICD is a prospective investigator-initiated
non-randomized, controlled, multicenter observational cohort study done in 44
centers across 15 European countries. A total of 2327 patients with heart
failure due to ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy indicated for
primary prophylactic ICD implantation were recruited between 2014 and 2018
(>1500 patients at first ICD implantation, >750 patients non-randomized non-ICD
control group). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, first appropriate
shock was co-primary endpoint. At baseline, all patients underwent 12-lead ECG
and Holter-ECG analysis using multiple advanced methods for risk stratification
as well as documentation of clinical characteristics and laboratory values. The
EU-CERT-ICD data will provide much needed information on the survival benefit
of preventive ICD therapy and expand on previous prospective risk
stratification studies which showed very good applicability of clinical
parameters and advanced risk stratifiers in order to define patient subgroups
with above or below average ICD benefit.
  CONCLUSION. The EU-CERT-ICD study will provide new and current data about
effectiveness of primary prophylactic ICD implantation. The study also aims for
improved risk stratification and patient selection using clinical risk markers
in general, and advanced ECG risk markers in particular.

demographics, kinematics and the structure of the Broad Line Region (BLR) based
on the time-delay response between the continuum and emission line. The time
delay is directly related to the size of BLR which is related to the continuum
luminosity of the source, producing the well-known Radius-Luminosity (RL)
relation. The majority of sources have been monitored for their H$\beta$
emission line in low redshift sources ($z<0.1$), while there are some attempts
using the MgII line for higher redshifts. We present a recent MgII monitoring
for the quasar CTS C30.10 ($z=0.90$) observed with the 10-meter SALT, for which
RL scaling based on MgII holds within measurement and time-delay uncertainties.
One of the most important advantages of reverberation mapping technique is the
independent determination to the distant source, and considering the large
range of redshifts and luminosities found in AGNs, their application to
cosmology is promising. However, recently it has been found that highly
accreting sources show the time delays shorter than expected from RL relation.
We propose correction for this effect using a sample of 117 H$\beta$
reverberating-mapped AGNs with $0.02<z<0.9$, recovering the low scatter along
with the relation. We are able to determine the cosmological constants,
$\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ within 2$\sigma$ confidence level. We present
the first steps in modelling of light curves for H$\beta$ and MgII and discuss
the quasar selection in the context of photometric reverberation mapping with
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). With the onset of the LSST era, we
expect a huge rise in the overall quasar counts and redshift range covered
($z\lesssim 7.0$), which will provide a better constraint of AGN properties
with cosmological purposes.

the cell model predicted cytoskeleton reorganisation and reinforcement during

fluctuations of the polarization pattern over a broad spectral range, resulting
in some depolarization with respect to the pure scattering case when observed
at very low spatial and temporal resolutions. This is consistent with recent
theoretical modeling that predicts this to be the result of redistribution

magneto-optical effects. A first attempt at a quantitative exploitation of
these signals for the diagnosis of magnetic fields in the chromosphere is
attempted. In active regions, we present observations of circular polarization
dominated by the Zeeman effect. We are able to constrain the magnetic field

mechanisms are considered as the most important processes with which
biodiversity contributes to ecosystem stability. However, portfolio theories
usually regard biodiversity as a fixed property, but overlook the dynamics of
biodiversity altered by other ecosystem components. Here, we proposed a new
mechanistic food chain model with nutrient-diversity feedback to investigate
how dynamics of phytoplankton species diversity determines ecosystem stability.
Our model focuses on nutrient, community biomass of phytoplankton and
zooplankton, and phytoplankton species richness. The model assumes diversity
effects of phytoplankton on trophic interaction strength along plankton food
chain: phytoplankton diversity influences nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and
zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, which subsequently affects nutrient level
and community biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The nutrient level in
turn affects phytoplankton diversity. These processes collectively form
feedbacks between phytoplankton diversity and dynamics of plankton and
nutrient. More importantly, nutrient-diversity feedback introduced additional
temporal variabilities in community biomass, which apparently implies a
destabilizing effect of phytoplankton diversity on ecosystem. However, the
variabilities made ecosystems more robust against extinction of plankton
because increasing phytoplankton diversity facilitates resource consumptions
when consumers prone to extinct; while, reducing diversity weakens
destabilizing dynamics caused by over-growth. Our results suggest the presence
of a novel stabilizing effect of biodiversity acting through nutrient-diversity
feedback, being independent of portfolio mechanisms.

demand and local renewable generation in consideration. We model the
interactions among utilities as a non-cooperative game, in which each utility
aims at minimizing its per-unit electricity cost. We investigate utilities'
optimal bidding strategies and show that all utilities bidding according to
(net load) prediction is a unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium with two
salient properties. First, it incurs no loss of efficiency; hence, competition
among utilities does not increase the social cost. Second, it is robust and (0,
$N-1$) fault immune. That is, fault behaviors of irrational utilities only help
to reduce other rational utilities' costs. The expected market supply-demand
mismatch is minimized simultaneously, which improves the planning and
supply-and-demand matching efficiency of the electricity supply chain. We prove
the results hold under the settings of correlated prediction errors and a
general class of real-time spot pricing models, which capture the relationship
between the spot price, the day-ahead clearing price, and the market-level
mismatch. Simulations based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical
findings. Our study adds new insights to market mechanism design. In
particular, we derive a set of fairly general sufficient conditions for the
market operator to design real-time pricing schemes so that the interactions
among utilities admit the desired equilibrium.

checking: whenever an object 'flows' through code with a type annotation, the
object is dynamically checked to ensure it has the methods required by the
annotation. Just-in-time compilation and optimisation in virtual machines can
eliminate much of the overhead of run-time transient type checks. Unfortunately
this optimisation is not uniform: some type checks will significantly decrease,
or even increase, a program's performance.
  In this paper, we refine the so called ""Takikawa"" protocol, and use it to
identify which type annotations have the greatest effects on performance. In
particular, we show how graphing the performance of such benchmarks when
varying which type annotations are present in the source code can be used to
discern potential patterns in performance. We demonstrate our approach by
testing the Moth virtual machine: for many of the benchmarks where Moth's
transient type checking impacts performance, we have been able to identify one
or two specific type annotations that are the likely cause. Without these type
annotations, the performance impact of transient type checking becomes
negligible.
  Using our technique programmers can optimise programs by removing expensive

at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider

the net baryon density is determined by the amount of stopping, this is the
pre-requisiste for any investigation of other observables related to structures
in the QCD phase diagram such as a first-order phase transition or a critical
endpoint. In this work we employ a string model for treating hadron-hadron
interactions within a hadronic transport approach (SMASH, Simulating Many
Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons). Free parameters of the string
excitation and decay are tuned to match experimental measurements in elementary
proton-proton collisions, where some mismatch in the $x_F$ distribution of
protons is still present. Afterwards, the model is applied to heavy ion
collisions, where the experimentally observed change of the shape of the proton
rapidity spectrum from a single peak structure to a double peak structure with
increasing beam energy is reproduced. Heavy ion collisions provide the
opportunity to study the formation process of string fragments in terms of
formation times and reduced interaction cross-sections for pre-formed hadrons.
A good agreement with the measured rapidity spectra of protons and pions is
achieved while insights on the fragmentation process are obtained. In the
future, the presented approach can be used to create event-by-event initial
conditions for hybrid calculations.

function gives maximally objective description compatible with quantum theory.
However, the probability distribution does not depend on time and does not take
into account the existing of our macroscopic evolving Universe. What we wish to
know is how quantum processes in the Early Universe determined the state of the
present Universe in which we are able to observe macroscopic consequences of
these quantum processes. As an alternative to the Wheeler - DeWitt quantum
geometrodynamics we consider the picture that can be obtained in the extended

configuration model with degree distribution satisfying an infinite
second-moment condition, which includes power-law degrees with exponent $\tau
\in (2,3)$. It is well known that, in this regime, many canonical random graph
models, such as the configuration model, are robust in the sense that the giant
component is not destroyed when the percolation probability stays bounded away
from zero. Thus, the critical behavior is observed when the percolation
probability tends to zero with the network size, despite of the fact that the
average degree remains bounded.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of critical random graphs in the
infinite second-moment regime by identifying the critical window for the
configuration model. We prove scaling limits for component sizes and surplus
edges, and show that the maximum diameter the critical components is of order
$\log n$, which contrasts with the previous universality classes arising in the
literature. This introduces a third and novel universality class for the
critical behavior of percolation on random networks, that is not covered by the
multiplicative coalescent framework due to Aldous and Limic (1998). We also
prove concentration of the component sizes outside the critical window, and
that a unique, complex giant component emerges after the critical window. This
completes the picture for the percolation phase transition on the configuration
model.

the most common tools for this. Several of these applications deal with
censored data, either because of sensor saturation or limited detection
regions: when censoring happens, all measurements below a certain threshold are
clipped to the threshold value. The recently proposed Tobit Kalman Filter (TKF)
is an adjusted version of the KF that can deal with censored measurements.
However, like the traditional KF, it needs full knowledge of the process and
measurement noise covariances to work, which are not always available in

nestedness to single out the scale at which innovation complexity emerges from
the aggregation of specialized building blocks. Our analysis not only suggests
that the innovation space can be interpreted as a natural system in which
advantageous capabilities are selected by evolutionary pressure, but also that
the emerging structure of capabilities is not independent of the scale of
observation at which they are observed. Expanding on this insight allows us to
understand whether the capabilities characterizing the innovation space at a
given scale are compatible with a complex evolutionary dynamics or, rather, a
set of essentially independent activities allowing to reduce the system at that
scale to a set of disjoint non interacting sub-systems. This yields a measure
of the innovation complexity of the system, i.e. of the degree of
interdependence between the sets of capabilities underlying the system's
building blocks.

from the gravitational pull it induces on its luminous binary companion. While
the orbit of such binaries can be characterized with precise astrometric
measurements, constraints made from astrometry alone are not enough to measure
the component masses. In this work, we determine the precision with which Gaia
can astrometrically measure the orbits and -- with additional observations --
the component masses, for luminous stars hosting hidden companions. Using
realistic mock Gaia observations, we find that Gaia can precisely measure the
orbits of binaries hosting hidden brown-dwarfs out to tens of pc and hidden
white dwarf and neutron star companions at distances as far as several hundred
pc. Heavier black hole companions may be measured out to 1 kpc or farther. We
further determine how orbital period affects this precision, finding that Gaia
can characterize orbits with periods as short as 10 days and as long as a few
10$^3$ days, with the best measured orbits having periods just short of Gaia's
mission lifetime. Extending Gaia's nominal five-year mission lifetime by an
additional five years not only allows for the measurement of longer period
orbits, but those longer period binaries can be seen at even greater distances.

related to the matching scale $\mu_W$ and in particular to $\mu_t$ in
$m_t(\mu_t)$. We also reemphasize the important role of isospin-breaking and
QED effects in the evaluation of $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$. Omitting all these
effects, as done in the 2015 analysis by RBC-UKQCD collaboration, and choosing
as an example the QCD penguin ($Q_6$) and electroweak penguin ($Q_8$)
parameters $B_6^{(1/2)}$ and $B_8^{(3/2)}$ to be $B_6^{(1/2)} = 0.80 \pm 0.08$

$(\varepsilon'/\varepsilon)_\text{SM} = (9.4 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-4}$, whereas
including them results in $(\varepsilon'/\varepsilon)_\text{SM} = (5.6\pm 2.4)
\times 10^{-4}$. This is an example of an anomaly at the $3.3\,\sigma$ level,
which would be missed without these corrections. NNLO QCD contributions to QCD
penguins are expected to further enhance this anomaly. We provide a table for
$\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ for different values of $B_6^{(1/2)}$ and the
isospin-breaking parameter $\hat{\Omega}_\text{eff}$, that should facilitate
monitoring the values of $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ in the SM when the

with sticky, single-stranded DNA overhangs, have been previously studied in the
context of designing thermally responsive, viscoelastic hydrogels. In this
work, we use linker-mediated gels, where the sticky ends of two trivalent
nanostars are connected through the complementary sticky ends of a linear DNA
duplex. We can design this connection to be either rigid or flexible by
introducing flexible, non-binding bases. The additional flexiblity provided by
these non-binding bases influences the effective elasticity of the percolating
gel formed at low temperatures. Here we show that by choosing the right length
of the linear duplex and non-binding flexible joints, we obtain a completely
different phase behaviour to that observed for rigid linkers. In particular, we
use dynamic light scattering as microrheological tool to monitor the
self-assembly of DNA nanostars with linear linkers as a function of
temperature. While we observe classical gelation when using rigid linkers, the
presence of flexible joints leads to a cluster fluid with reduced viscosity.
Using both the oxDNA model and a coarse-grained simulation to investigate the
nanostar-linker topology, we hypothesise on the possible structure formed by
the DNA clusters.

skeletonization algorithm for topologies defined using filled and void

imposed on solid states in the solutions. An analytical example is presented
which suggests that for a skeletonized topology, optimal solutions may not
always exist for any specified volume fraction, minimum and maximum length
scales, and that there may exist implicit interdependence between them. A
Sequence for Length Scale (SLS) methodology is proposed wherein solutions are
sought by specifying only the minimum and maximum length scales with volume
fraction getting determined systematically. Through four benchmark problems in
small deformation topology optimization, it is demonstrated that solutions
by-and-large satisfy the length scale constraints though the latter may get
violated at certain local sites. The proposed approach seems promising, noting
especially that solutions, if rendered perfectly {\it black and white} with
minimum length scale explicitly imposed and boundaries smoothened, are quite
close in performance compared to the parent topologies. Attaining {\it volume
distributed} topologies, wherein members are more or less of the same
thickness, may also be possible with the proposed approach.

Our CNN approach divides this array up into 4x4 blocks of processing elements,
essentially trading-off image resolution for increased local memory capacity
per 4x4 ""pixel"". We implement parallel operations for image addition,
subtraction and bit-shifting images in this 4x4 block format. Using these
components we formulate how to perform ternary weight convolutions upon these
images, compactly store results of such convolutions, perform max-pooling, and
transfer the resulting sub-sampled data to an attached micro-controller. We
train ternary weight filter CNNs for digit recognition and a simple tracking
task, and demonstrate inference of these networks upon the SCAMP5 PPA system.
This work represents a first step towards embedding neural network processing
capability directly onto the focal plane of a sensor.

  In this paper we establish the spectrum of the magnetic Laplacian, as a set
of real numbers with multiplicities, on the Sierpinski gasket graph ($SG$)
where the magnetic fluxes equal $\alpha$ through the upright triangles, and
$\beta$ through the downright triangles. This is achieved upon showing the

modulated. This type of problem has been revisited numerous times since it was
first studied by Lord Kelvin in 1886. Our study analytically examines currents
whose unperturbed velocity profile $U(z)$ follows a power-law $z^q$, flowing
over a three-dimensional uneven bed. This particular form of $U$, which can
model a miscellany of realistic flows, allows explicit analytical solutions.
Arbitrary bed shapes can readily be imposed via Fourier's theorem provided
their steepness is moderate. Three-dimensional vorticity-bathymetry interaction
effects are evident when the flow makes an oblique angle with, a sinusoidally
corrugated bed. Streamlines are found to twist and the fluid particle drift is
redirected away from the direction of the unperturbed current. Furthermore, a
perturbation technique is developed which satisfies the bottom boundary
condition to arbitrary order also for large-amplitude obstructions which
penetrate well into the current profile. This introduces higher-order harmonics
of the bathymetry amplitude. States of resonance for first and higher order
harmonics are readily calculated. Although the method is theoretically
restricted to bathymetries of moderate inclination, a wide variety of steeper
obstructions are satisfactorily represented by the method, even provoking
occurrences of recirculation. All expressions are analytically explicit and
sequential fast Fourier transformations ensure quick and easy computation for
arbitrary three-dimensional bathymetries. A method for separating near and far

computational resources for too long (e.g., tracking and storing features).
Moreover, the optimal decision timing varies across flows.
  We present pForest, a system for ""As Soon As Possible"" (ASAP) in-network
classification according to supervised machine learning models on top of
programmable data planes. pForest automatically classifies each flow as soon as
its label is sufficiently established, not sooner, not later. A key challenge
behind pForest is finding a strategy for dynamically adapting the features and
the classification logic during the lifetime of a flow. pForest solves this
problem by: (i) training random forest models tailored to different phases of a
flow; and (ii) dynamically switching between these models in real time, on a
per-packet basis. pForest models are tuned to fit the constraints of
programmable switches (e.g., no floating points, no loops, and limited memory)

animals as well as in humans. In human speech, short rising and falling
FM-sweeps called formant transitions characterise individual speech sounds.
There are two representations of FM in the ascending auditory pathway: a
spectral representation, holding the instantaneous frequency of the stimuli;
and a sweep representation, consisting of neurons that respond selectively to
FM direction. To-date computational models use feedforward mechanisms to
explain FM encoding. However, from neuroanatomy we know that there are massive
feedback projections in the auditory pathway. Here, we found that a classical
FM-sweep perceptual effect, the sweep pitch shift, cannot be explained by
standard feedforward processing models. We hypothesised that the sweep pitch
shift is caused by a predictive interaction between the sweep and the spectral
representation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel model of FM
encoding incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism. The model fully
accounted for experimental data that we acquired in a perceptual experiment
with human participants as well as previously published experimental results.
We also designed a new family of stimuli for a second perceptual experiment to
further validate the model. Combined, our results indicate that predictive
interaction between different frequency encoding and direction encoding neural
representations plays an important role in the neural processing of FM. In the
brain, this mechanism is likely to occur at early stages of the processing
hierarchy.

of research for the past thirty years. Rigid-body assumptions are commonly used
to approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead
to challenging-to-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other
hand, robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact,
combined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding
NCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff
dynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially
during slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit
integration for these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search
(TALS), which greatly improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations
performed by implicit integrators. We find that TALS works best with
semi-implicit integration, but that the explicit treatment of normal compliance
can be problematic. To address this, we develop a Transition-Aware Modified
Semi-Implicit (TAMSI) integrator that has similar computational cost to
semi-implicit methods but implicitly couples compliant contact forces, leading
to a more robust method. We evaluate the robustness, accuracy and performance
of TAMSI and demonstrate our approach alongside relevant sim-to-real
manipulation tasks.

applied in nanocommunication, several alternative paradigms have emerged. Among
them, electromagnetic nanocommunication in the terahertz (THz) frequency band

summarize the current status in these research domains. In this survey, we
therefore aim to provide an overview of the current THz nanocommunication and
nanonetworking research. Specifically, we discuss the applications envisioned
to be supported by nanonetworks operating in the THz band, together with the
requirements such applications pose on the underlying nanonetworks.

to model temporal dynamics in videos to employ 3D human action recognition. To
that end, two main baseline approaches have been researched: (i) Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM); and (ii) skeleton
image representations used as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Although RNN approaches present excellent results, such methods lack the
ability to efficiently learn the spatial relations between the skeleton joints.
On the other hand, the representations used to feed CNN approaches present the
advantage of having the natural ability of learning structural information from
2D arrays (i.e., they learn spatial relations from the skeleton joints). To
further improve such representations, we introduce the Tree Structure Reference
Joints Image (TSRJI), a novel skeleton image representation to be used as input
to CNNs. The proposed representation has the advantage of combining the use of
reference joints and a tree structure skeleton. While the former incorporates
different spatial relationships between the joints, the latter preserves
important spatial relations by traversing a skeleton tree with a depth-first
order algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed representation for 3D action recognition on two datasets achieving
state-of-the-art results on the recent NTU RGB+D~120 dataset.

  In this paper we propose a scheme that speeds up simulations by several

is not only faster than other approaches at the same numerical precision, but
it can also be efficiently applied even without dislocation annihilation. The

Recent developments in data science provide alternative ways to effectively
extract/learn accurate macroscopic descriptions approximating the underlying

for the identification of unavailable coarse-scale PDEs from microscopic

data-driven discovery of macroscopic, concentration-level PDEs resulting from a
fine-scale, Lattice Boltzmann level model of a reaction/transport process. Once

light muonic atoms are based on an expansion in a parameter eta, where only
terms up to second order are retained. The parameter eta can be shown to be
proportional to the square root of the muon/proton mass ratio, so that it is
small and the expansion is expected to converge. However, practical
implementations show that the eta convergence may be slower than expected. In
this work we probe the uncertainties due to this expansion using a different
formalism, which is based on a multipole expansion of the longitudinal and
transverse response functions and was first introduced by Leidemann and
Rosenfelder. We refer to this alternative expansion as the eta-less formalism.
We generalize this formalism to account for the cancellation of elastic terms
such as the third Zemach moment (or Friar moment) and embed it in a
computationally efficient framework. We implement and test this approach in the
case of muonic deuterium. The comparison of results in the point nucleon limit
for both methods achieve sub-percent agreement. When nucleon form factors are
introduced we find a 4% and 2% difference in the third Zemach moment and
nuclear polarizability, respectively, compared to the eta-less expansion,
indicating that the nucleon form factor approximations should be improved.
However, we find that the sum of these terms removes this dependence and the
uncertainty due to the eta-expansion and the related second-order approximation
in the nucleon form factors amounts only to 0.2% and thus is fully justified in
muonic deuterium. This computationally efficient framework paves the way to
further studies in light muonic systems with more than two nucleons, where
controlling and reducing uncertainties in nuclear structure corrections is key

threshold photoelectron spectrum of 1-ethynylpyrene and to obtain the breakdown
graph describing the dissociation of the 1-ethynylpyrene cation. The threshold
photoelectron measurement has allowed us to improve the determination of the
ionization energy of 1-ethynylpyrene at 7.391 $\pm$ 0.005 eV. Concerning the
main dissociation channels, the analysis of the breakdown graph has given 3.70
$\pm$ 0.60 eV as the activation energy for the loss of one H atom and 2.98
$\pm$ 1.80 eV for the loss of a second independent H atom. The corresponding
entropies of activation are affected by large errors as observed in similar
studies of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cations. Minor dissociation
channels were also detected and identified as the loss of the C$_2$H group and
the loss of a C$_2$H$_2$ unit and/or that of an H atom plus the C$_2$H group.
The activation energies and the entropies of activation of these minor pathways
could not be derived from the measurements. It is found that the cation of
1-ethynylpyrene behaves like the cation of pyrene and is consequently more
photostable than the cation of 1-methylpyrene. We conclude that
photodissociation is not the leading cause of the low abundance, if not the
absence, of ethynyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon species in the
interstellar medium.

Point (ICP) allows estimating sensor displacements. It may prove important to

approach to 3D uncertainty of ICP that accounts for all the sources of error as
listed in Censi's pioneering work [1], namely wrong convergence,
underconstrained situations, and sensor noise. Our approach builds on two
facts. First, the uncertainty about the ICP's output fully depends on the
initialization accuracy. Thus speaking of the covariance of ICP makes sense
only in relation to the initialization uncertainty, which generally stems from
odometry errors. We capture this using the unscented transform, which also
reflects correlations between initial and final uncertainties. Then, assuming
white sensor noise leads to overoptimism as ICP is biased owing to e.g.
calibration biases, which we account for. Our solution is tested on publicly
available real data ranging from structured to unstructured environments, where
our algorithm predicts consistent results with actual uncertainty, and compares
favorably to previous methods.

short, convexes). When a small number of convexes are used, such a

This decomposition is fundamental in computer graphics, where it provides one
of the most common ways to approximate geometry, for example, in real-time
physics simulation. A convex object also has the property of being
simultaneously an explicit and implicit representation: one can interpret it
explicitly as a mesh derived by computing the vertices of a convex hull, or
implicitly as the collection of half-space constraints or support functions.
Their implicit representation makes them particularly well suited for neural
network training, as they abstract away from the topology of the geometry they
need to represent. However, at testing time, convexes can also generate
explicit representations -- polygonal meshes -- which can then be used in any
downstream application. We introduce a network architecture to represent a low

Based on the learned convex approximation of power flows, optimal power flow
(OPF) is formulated as a convex quadratic programming problem. The simulation

self-phase modulation in $\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(3)}$ materials as well as
second-harmonic generation in $\chi^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ materials. The
gate fidelity asymptotically approaches unity with increasing storage time for
a fixed duration of the incident photon wave packet. Further, dynamically
coupled cavities enable a trade-off between errors due to loss and wave packet
distortions since loss does not affect the ability to emit wave packets with
the same shape as the incoming photons. Our numerical results show that gates

age and metallicity distributions, with NGC 1407 and the Milky Way showing
mostly old globular clusters while NGC 3115 and NGC 3377 show a range of

that the globular cluster optical colour-metallicity relation is not universal

Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for the hydrogen atom; second, hard
(Bessel), soft (Airy) and bulk (sine) microscopic kernels from properly

alternative to standard methods of derivation of microscopic kernels, based

arbitrary number of options. Model-independence means that the analysis is not
performed on a specific set of equations, in contrast to classical approaches
to decision making that fix a specific model and analyze it. Rather, the
general features of decision making in dynamical opinion networks can be
derived starting from empirically testable hypotheses about the deciding
agents, the available options, and the interactions among them. After
translating these empirical hypotheses into algebraic ones, we use the tools of
equivariant bifurcation theory to uncover model-independent properties of
dynamical opinion networks. The model-independent results are illustrated on a
novel analytical model that is constructed by plugging a generic sigmoidal
nonlinearity, modeling boundedness of opinions and opinion perception, into the
model-independent equivariant structure. Our analysis reveals richer and more
flexible opinion-formation behavior as compared to model-dependent approaches.
For instance, analysis reveals the possibility of switching between consensus
and various forms of dissensus by modulation of the level of agent
cooperativity and without requiring any particular ad-hoc interaction topology
(e.g., structural balance). From a theoretical viewpoint, we prove new results
in equivariant bifurcation theory. We construct an exhaustive list of axial

suggested as one possible formation pathway for those two classes of MSPs.
However, it is difficult to produce all known MSPs with the traditional AIC
scenario. In this study by using the MESA stellar evolution code, we
investigate the detailed pre-AIC evolution of magnetized white dwarf binaries
with the magnetic confinement model where the high magnetic field strength of
the white dwarf can confine the accreted matter in the polar caps. We find that
the initial donor mass and orbital periods in our model can be lower than that
of previous traditional AIC models. We also present post-AIC evolution models
to form RBs and BWs with and without the spin down luminosity evaporation of
MSPs. Under the magnetic confinement model and evaporative winds (with
corresponding angular momentum loss from the surface of the donor star), the
companion masses and orbital periods of all known RBs can be covered and a
number of binaries can evolve to become BWs.

actions may be executed in pursuit of meeting a specified goal state. Thus,
integrating affordance-based reasoning into symbolic action plannning pipelines
would enhance the flexibility of robot manipulation. Unfortunately, the top
performing affordance recognition methods use object category priors to boost
the accuracy of affordance detection and segmentation. Object priors limit
generalization to unknown object categories. This paper describes an affordance
recognition pipeline based on a category-agnostic region proposal network for
proposing instance regions of an image across categories. To guide affordance
learning in the absence of category priors, the training process includes the
auxiliary task of explicitly inferencing existing affordances within a
proposal. Secondly, a self-attention mechanism trained to interpret each
proposal learns to capture rich contextual dependencies through the region.
Visual benchmarking shows that the trained network, called AffContext, reduces
the performance gap between object-agnostic and object-informed affordance
recognition. AffContext is linked to the Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL) with an augmented state keeper for action planning across temporally
spaced goal-oriented tasks. Manipulation experiments show that AffContext can
successfully parse scene content to seed a symbolic planner problem
specification, whose execution completes the target task. Additionally,
task-oriented grasping for cutting and pounding actions demonstrate the
exploitation of multiple affordances for a given object to complete specified
tasks.

robustness, and it tackles the value overestimation problem. It also leads to a
significant performance increase in tabular and high-dimensional settings, as
demonstrated via algorithms such as soft Q-learning (SQL) and soft actor-critic
(SAC). Cumulative entropy regularization has been extended to optimize over the
reference marginal policy instead of keeping it fixed, yielding a
regularization that minimizes the mutual information between states and
actions. While this has been initially proposed for Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) in tabular settings, it was recently shown that a similar principle
leads to significant improvements over vanilla SQL in RL for high-dimensional
domains with discrete actions and function approximators.
  Here, we follow the motivation of mutual-information regularization from an
inference perspective and theoretically analyze the corresponding Bellman
operator. Inspired by this Bellman operator, we devise a novel
mutual-information regularized actor-critic learning (MIRACLE) algorithm for
continuous action spaces that optimizes over the reference marginal policy. We
empirically validate MIRACLE in the Mujoco robotics simulator, where we
demonstrate that it can compete with contemporary RL methods. Most notably, it
can improve over the model-free state-of-the-art SAC algorithm which implicitly

Problems (CSPs) stated that such CSPs are solvable in polynomial time whenever
there is no natural reduction, in some precise technical sense, from the 3-SAT

algebraic characterization of the conjectured borderline: the CSP of a finite
structure permits no natural reduction from 3-SAT if and only if the stabilizer
of the polymorphism clone of the core of the structure satisfies some
nontrivial system of identities, and such satisfaction is always witnessed by
several specific nontrivial systems of identities which do not depend on the
structure.
  The tractability conjecture has been generalized in the above formulation to
a certain class of infinite domain CSPs, namely, CSPs of reducts of finitely
bounded homogeneous structures. It was subsequently shown that the conjectured
borderline between hardness and tractability, i.e., a natural reduction from
3-SAT, can be characterized for this class by a combination of algebraic and
topological properties. However, it was not known whether the topological
component is essential in this characterization.
  We provide a negative answer to this question by proving that the borderline
is characterized by one specific algebraic identity, namely the pseudo-Siggers
identity $\alpha s(x,y,x,z,y,z) \approx \beta s(y,x,z,x,z,y)$. This
accomplishes one of the steps of a proposed strategy for reducing the infinite

promise of dramatically outperforming classical computers. We have witnessed
the advent of quantum processors with over $50$ quantum bits (qubits), which
are expected to be beyond the reach of classical simulation. Quantum supremacy
is the event at which the old Extended Church-Turing Thesis is overturned: A
quantum computer performs a task that is practically impossible for any
classical (super)computer. The demonstration requires both a solid theoretical
guarantee and an experimental realization. The lead candidate is Random Circuit
Sampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution of
random quantum circuits. Google recently announced a $53-$qubit experimental
demonstration of RCS. Soon after, classical algorithms appeared that challenge
the supremacy of random circuits by estimating their outputs. How hard is it to
classically simulate the output of random quantum circuits?
  We prove that estimating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits
is formidably hard ($\#P$-Hard) for any classical computer. This makes RCS the
strongest candidate for demonstrating quantum supremacy relative to all other
proposals. The robustness to the estimation error that we prove may serve as a
new hardness criterion for the performance of classical algorithms. To achieve
this, we introduce the Cayley path interpolation between any two gates of a
quantum computation and convolve recent advances in quantum complexity and
information with probability and random matrices. Furthermore, we apply
algebraic geometry to generalize the well-known Berlekamp-Welch algorithm that
is widely used in coding theory and cryptography. Our results imply that there
is an exponential hardness barrier for the classical simulation of most quantum

working with such data is to determine when the underlying generative model has
changed, as this can offer insights into distinct operating regimes of the
underlying system. This paper describes a novel dynamic programming approach to
localizing changes in high-dimensional autoregressive processes and associated

piecewise stable, the proposed dynamic programming algorithm consistently
localizes change points even as the dimensionality, the sparsity of the

initial, coarse change point localization estimates can be boosted via a
computationally-efficient refinement algorithm that provably improves the
localization error rate. Finally, a comprehensive simulation experiments and a

detected at radio frequencies. FRB 131104 is the only case for which a

$S_{\gamma}\sim4\times10^{-6}$ erg $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. However, the association
with the FRB is still debated. Aims. We aim at testing the systematic presence
of an associated transient high-energy counterpart throughout a sample of the
FRB population. Methods. We used an approach like that used in machine learning
methodologies to accurately model the highly-variable Fermi/GBM instrumental
background on a time interval comparable to the duration of the proposed
$\gamma$-ray counterpart of FRB 131104. A possible $\gamma$-ray signal is then
constrained considering sample average lightcurves. Results. We constrain the
fluence of the possible $\gamma$-ray signal in the 8-1000 keV band down to $6.4
\times 10^{-7}$ ($7.1 \times 10^{-8}$) erg cm$^{-2}$ for a 200-s (1-s)
integration time. Furthermore, we found the radio-to-gamma fluence ratio to be
$\eta>10^{8}$ Jy ms erg$^{-1}$ cm$^2$. Conclusions. Our fluence limits exclude
$\sim 94\%$ of Fermi/GBM detected long gamma-ray bursts and $\sim 96\%$ of
Fermi/GBM detected short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, our limits on the
radio-to-gamma fluence ratio point to a different emission mechanism from that
of magnetar giant flares. Finally, we exclude a $\gamma$-ray counterpart as
fluent as the one possibly associated with FRB 131104 to be a common feature of
FRBs.

a direct access to the underlying flash storage through user space APIs, to

using the Key Value Layer APIs, employing NASA's MODIS Land Surface Reflectance
dataset as a large dataset use case. We performed Read and Write operations on
datasets of size ranging from 1MB to 3TB by varying the number of threads. We
then compared this performance with other heterogeneous storage and memory
devices such as NVM, SSD and RAM, without using the CAPI Accelerator in
synchronous and asynchronous file IO modes of operations. The results indicate
that FS900 & CAPI, together with the metadata cache in RAM, delivers the
highest IO/s and OP/s for read operations. This was higher than just using RAM,
along with utilizing lesser CPU resources. Among FS900, SSD and NVM, FS900 had
the highest write IO/s. Another important observation is that, when the size of
the input dataset exceeds the capacity of RAM, and when the data access is
non-uniform and sparse, FS900 with CAPI would be a cost-effective alternative.

Gauss-Newton-Markov-Kalman filter method for state estimation of dynamic models
given noisy measurements. The mathematical formulation of the proposed filter
is based on the construction of an optimal nonlinear map between the observable
and parameter (state) spaces via a convergent sequence of linear maps obtained
by successive linearisation of the observation operator in a Gauss-Newton-like
form. To allow automatic linearisation of the dynamical system in a sparse
form, the smoother is designed in a hierarchical setting such that the forward
map and its linearised counterpart are estimated in a Bayesian manner given a
forecasted data set. To improve the algorithm convergence, the smoother is
further reformulated in its incremental form in which the current and
intermediate states are assimilated before the initial one, and the
corresponding posterior estimates are taken as pseudo-measurements. As the
latter ones are random variables, and not deterministic any more, the novel
stochastic iterative filter is designed to take this into account. To correct
the bias in the posterior outcome, the procedure is built in a
predictor-corrector form in which the predictor phase is used to assimilate
noisy measurement data, whereas the corrector phase is constructed to correct
the mean bias. The resulting filter is further discretised via time-adapting
sparse polynomial chaos expansions obtained either via modified Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalisation or by a carefully chosen nonlinear mapping, both of which are
estimated in a Bayesian manner by promoting the sparsity of the outcomes. The
time adaptive basis with non-Gaussian arguments is further mapped to the
polynomial chaos one by a suitably chosen isoprobabilistic transformation.
Finally, the proposed method is tested on a chaotic nonlinear Lorenz 1984
system.

is the positive semi--definite sum of the squares of the auxiliary fields.
Setting the potential to zero yields a set of equations for the Vacuum
Expectation Values (`VEVs') of the scalar fields. These VEVs yield zero vacuum
energy for the Higgs potential, even after gauge symmetry breaking (`GSB').
Nothing like this happens in theories without SUSY. However, there are four
problems that make this initially promising feature look quite useless and
ineffective: (1) SUSY has too many Higgs Fields. (2) SUSY predicts
supermultiplets. (3) Spontaneous breaking of SUSY looks contrived and it is
unsuccessful anyway (because of the sum rules and the huge auxiliary VEVs). (4)
There are negative terms in the supergravity version of the Higgs potential.
These problems are normally considered to be an inevitable consequence of SUSY.
However, using a technique we call suppression of fields (or `flipping'), we
can remove all four problems, without disturbing the basic algebra of SUSY.
  We start with a conventional Grand Unified Supergravity Theory (`GUST'), and
its BRST Master Equation. The BRST Master Equation treats fields and Zinn
sources more or less like coordinates and momenta in the Classical Poisson
Bracket, and that suggests exchanging the fields and the Zinn sources, as in a
canonical transfomation. We call this flipping. The resulting new `suppressed'
GUST has a simple quadratic Higgs potential, and so it has a naturally zero
cosmological constant after GSB (at tree level). It also has a Master Equation,
simply derived from the original GUST, that preserves its symmetry, and its
unitarity.

temporally rich patterns, whose instances include human speech and
environmental sounds. For tasks that involve classifying such spatio-temporal
patterns with the Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), how these patterns are
encoded directly influence the difficulty of the task. In this paper, we
compare several existing temporal and population coding schemes and evaluate
them on both speech (TIDIGITS) and sound (RWCP) datasets. We show that, with
population neural codings, the encoded patterns are linearly separable using
the Support Vector Machine (SVM). We note that the population neural codings
effectively project the temporal information onto the spatial domain, thus
improving linear separability in the spatial dimension, achieving an accuracy
of 95\% and 100\% for TIDIGITS and RWCP datasets classified using the SVM,
respectively. This observation suggests that an effective neural coding scheme
greatly simplifies the classification problem such that a simple linear
classifier would suffice. The above datasets are then classified using the
Tempotron, an SNN-based classifier. SNN classification results agree with the
SVM findings that population neural codings help to improve classification
accuracy. Hence, other than the learning algorithm, effective neural encoding
is just as important as an SNN designed to recognize spatio-temporal patterns.
It is an often neglected but powerful abstraction that deserves further study.

strategy to improve its efficiency. The main idea of the new scheme contains
two parts. Firstly, inspired by the state-of-art simplifications on the
third-order HGKS, we extend the HGKS to the case of arbitrary high-order
accuracy and eliminate its unnecessary high-order dissipation terms. Secondly,
instead of computing the derivatives of particle distribution function and
their complex moments, we introduce a Lax-Wendroff procedure to compute the
high-order derivatives of macroscopic quantities directly. The new scheme takes
advantage of both HGKS and the Lax-Wendroff procedure, so that it can be easily
extended to the case of arbitrary high-order accuracy with practical
significance. Typical numerical tests are carried out by EHGKS, with the third,
fifth and seventh-order accuracy. The presence of good resolution on the
discontinuities and flow details, together with the optimal CFL numbers,
validates the high accuracy and strong robustness of EHGKS. To compare the
efficiency, we present the results computed by the EHGKS, the original HGKS and
Runge-Kutta-WENO-GKS. This further demonstrates the advantages of EHGKS.

irrespective of gradient behavior. Hence, an efficient way of deep network
optimization is to make adaptive step sizes for each parameter. Recently,
several attempts have been made to improve gradient descent methods such as
AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp and Adam. These methods rely on the square roots of
exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. Thus, these methods do
not take advantage of local change in gradients. In this paper, a novel
optimizer is proposed based on the difference between the present and the
immediate past gradient (i.e., diffGrad). In the proposed diffGrad optimization
technique, the step size is adjusted for each parameter in such a way that it
should have a larger step size for faster gradient changing parameters and a
lower step size for lower gradient changing parameters. The convergence
analysis is done using the regret bound approach of online learning framework.
Rigorous analysis is made in this paper over three synthetic complex non-convex
functions. The image categorization experiments are also conducted over the

  Nonlinear Eigenvalue Analysis",,,,,"math.NA cs.CV cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose to analyze stable and unstable modes of generic
image denoisers through nonlinear eigenvalue analysis. We attempt to find input
images for which the output of a black-box denoiser is proportional to the
input. We treat this as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. This has potentially
wide implications, since most image processing algorithms can be viewed as
generic nonlinear operators. We introduce a generalized nonlinear power-method
to solve eigenproblems for such black-box operators. Using this method we
reveal stable modes of nonlinear denoisers. These modes are optimal inputs for
the denoiser, achieving superior PSNR in noise removal. Analogously to the
linear case (low-pass-filter), such stable modes are eigenfunctions
corresponding to large eigenvalues, characterized by large piece-wise-smooth
structures. We also provide a method to generate the complementary, most
unstable modes, which the denoiser suppresses strongly. These modes are
textures with small eigenvalues. We validate the method using total-variation
(TV) and demonstrate it on the EPLL denoiser (Zoran-Weiss). Finally, we suggest
an encryption-decryption application.

A dataset analysis for recommender systems","2 pages ; accepted at REVEAL workshop, RecSys 2019",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research publication requires public datasets. In recommender systems, some
datasets are largely used to compare algorithms against a --supposedly-- common
benchmark. Problem: for various reasons, these datasets are heavily
preprocessed, making the comparison of results across papers difficult. This
paper makes explicit the variety of preprocessing and evaluation protocols to
test the robustness of a dataset (or lack of flexibility). While robustness is
good to compare results across papers, for flexible datasets we propose a
method to select a preprocessing protocol and share results more transparently.

  Martin Schaefer","Map Matching Algorithm for Large-scale Datasets",,,,,"cs.NI cs.CV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GPS receivers embedded in cell phones and connected vehicles generate a
series of location measurements that can be used for various analytical
purposes. A common pre-processing step of this data is the so-called map
matching. The goal of map matching is to infer the trajectory that the device
followed in a road network from a potentially sparse series of noisy location
measurements. Although accurate and robust map matching algorithms based on
probabilistic models exist, they are computationally heavy and thus impractical
for processing of large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable
map-matching algorithm based on Dijkstra shortest path method, that is both
accurate and applicable to large datasets. Our experiments on a
publicly-available dataset showed that the proposed method achieves accuracy
that is comparable to that of the existing map matching methods using only a
fraction of computational resources. In result, our algorithm can be used to
efficiently process large datasets of noisy and potentially sparse location
data that would be unexploitable using existing techniques due to their high
computational requirements.
