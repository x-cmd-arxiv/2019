229, the supernova remnant (SNR) 0532$-$675 and the Wolf-Rayet (WR) bubble DEM
L 231 around the WR star Br 48. Comparison with infrared images unveils the
powerful effect of massive stars in destroying their nurseries. The
distribution of the hot gas in the SNR and the SB display their maxima in
regions in contact with the filamentary cold material detected by IR images.
Our observations do not reveal extended X-ray emission filling DEM L 231,
although several point-like sources are detected in the field of view of this
WR nebula. The X-ray properties of Br 48 are consistent with a binary WN4$+$O
as proposed by other authors. We modeled the X-ray emission from the SB and
found that its X-ray emission can be simply explained by pressure-driven wind
model, that is, there is no need to invoke the presence of a SN explosion as
previously suggested. The pressure calculations of the hot gas confirms that
the dynamical evolution of the SB DEM L 229 is dominated by the stellar winds
from the star cluster LH 76.

quark flavours at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential. It emerges
dynamically from the underlying fundamental interactions between quarks and
gluons in our work. To this end, starting from the perturbative high-energy
regime, we systematically integrate-out quantum fluctuations towards low
energies by using the functional renormalisation group. By dynamically
hadronising the dominant interaction channels responsible for the formation of
light mesons and quark condensates, we are able to extract the phase diagram
for $\mu_B/T \lesssim 6$. We find a critical endpoint at
$(T_\text{CEP},{\mu_B}_{\text{CEP}})=(107, 635)\,\text{MeV}$. The curvature of
the phase boundary at small chemical potential is $\kappa=0.0142(2)$, computed
from the renormalised light chiral condensate $\Delta_{l,R}$. Furthermore, we
find indications for an inhomogeneous regime in the vicinity and above the
chiral transition for $\mu_B\gtrsim 417$ MeV. Where applicable, our results are
in very good agreement with the most recent lattice results. We also compare to
results from other functional methods and phenomenological freeze-out data.
This indicates that a consistent picture of the phase structure at finite
baryon chemical potential is beginning to emerge. The systematic uncertainty of
our results grows large in the density regime around the critical endpoint and
we discuss necessary improvements of our current approximation towards a
quantitatively precise determination of QCD phase diagram.

tropical picture as describing wall-crossing in the derived category of
coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, giving a translation of the original
Gromov-Witten question into a known statement about Euler characteristics of

detector concept, assembly, installation in the underground laboratory in
Modane in 2018, and provide results from the first datasets. The demonstrator
consists of an array of 20 scintillating bolometers comprised of
$^{100}$Mo-enriched 0.2 kg Li$_2$MoO$_4$ crystals. The detectors are
complemented by 20 thin cryogenic Ge bolometers acting as light detectors to
distinguish $\alpha$ from $\gamma$/$\beta$ events by the detection of both heat
and scintillation light signals. We observe good detector uniformity,
facilitating the operation of a large detector array as well as excellent
energy resolution of 5.3 keV (6.5 keV) FWHM at 2615 keV, in calibration
(physics) data. Based on the observed energy resolutions and light yields a
separation of $\alpha$ particles at much better than 99.9\% with equally high
acceptance for $\gamma$/$\beta$ events is expected for events in the region of
interest for $^{100}$Mo $0\nu\beta\beta$. We present limits on the crystals'
radiopurity ($\leq$3 $\mu$Bq/kg of $^{226}$Ra and $\leq$2 $\mu$Bq/kg of
$^{232}$Th). Based on these initial results we also discuss a sensitivity study
for the science reach of the CUPID-Mo experiment, in particular, the ability to
set the most stringent half-life limit on the $^{100}$Mo $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay
after half a year of livetime. The achieved results show that CUPID-Mo is a
successful demonstrator of the technology - developed in the framework of the

observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and model its
atmosphere through a radiative transfer simulation. Given its short orbital
period of $\sim1.275$ days, inflated state and bright host star, WASP-121 b is
exceptionally favorable for detailed atmospheric characterization. Towards this
purpose, we use \texttt{allesfitter} to characterize its full red-optical phase
curve, including the planetary phase modulation and the secondary eclipse. We
measure the day and nightside brightness temperatures in the TESS passband as
$3012\substack{+40 \\ -42}$ K and $2022\substack{+254 \\ -602}$ K,
respectively, and do not find a statistically significant phase shift between
the brightest and substellar points. This is consistent with an inefficient
heat recirculation on the planet. We then perform an atmospheric retrieval
analysis to infer the dayside atmospheric properties of WASP-121 b such as its
bulk composition, albedo and heat recirculation. We confirm the temperature
inversion in the atmosphere and suggest H$^-$, TiO and VO as potential causes
of the inversion, absorbing heat at optical wavelengths at low pressures.
Future HST and JWST observations of WASP-121 b will benefit from its first full
phase curve measured by TESS.

silicate Earth and delivers a substantial mass of metal to Earth's core.
Subsequent evolution of the magma ocean and overlying atmosphere has been
described by theoretical models but observable constraints on this epoch have
proved elusive. Here, we report calculations of the primordial atmosphere
during the magma ocean and water ocean epochs and forge new links with
observations to gain insight into the behavior of volatiles on the early Earth.
As Earth's magma ocean crystallizes, it outgasses the bulk of the volatiles
into the primordial atmosphere. The redox state of the magma ocean controls
both the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen
isotopic composition of water oceans that remain after hydrogen loss from the
primordial atmosphere. Whereas water condenses and is retained, molecular
hydrogen does not condense and can escape, allowing large quantities (~10^2
bars) of hydrogen - if present - to be lost from Earth in this epoch. Because
the escaping inventory of H can be comparable to the hydrogen inventory in the
early oceans, the corresponding deuterium enrichment can be large with a
magnitude that depends on the initial H2 inventory. By contrast, the common
view that terrestrial water has a carbonaceous chondrite source requires the
oceans to preserve the isotopic composition of that source, undergoing minimal
D-enrichment via H2 loss. Such minimal enrichment places upper limits on the
amount of primordial H2 in contact with early water oceans (pH2<20 bars),
implies oxidizing conditions for outgassing from the magma ocean, and suggests
that Earth's mantle supplied the oxidant for the chemical resorption of metals
during late accretion.

of gates required to perform a non-trivial quantum computation may be very
large, decoherence and errors in realistic quantum architectures limit the
number of physical gate operations that can be performed coherently. Therefore,
an optimal mapping of the quantum algorithm into the physically available set
of operations is of crucial importance. We examine this problem for a
measurement-only topological quantum computer based on Majorana zero modes,
where gates are performed through sequences of measurements. Such a scheme has
been proposed as a practical, scalable approach to process quantum information
in an array of topological qubits built using Majorana zero modes. Building on
previous work that has shown that multi-qubit Clifford gates can be enacted in
a topologically protected fashion in such qubit networks, we discuss methods to
obtain the optimal measurement sequence for a given Clifford gate under the
constraints imposed by the physical architecture, such as layout and the
relative difficulty of implementing different types of measurements. Our
methods also provide tools for comparative analysis of different architectures
and strategies, given experimental characterizations of particular aspects of
the systems under consideration. As a further non-trivial demonstration, we
discuss an implementation of the surface code in Majorana-based topological
qubits. We use the techniques developed here to obtain an optimized measurement
sequence that implements the stabilizer measurements using only fermionic
parity measurements on nearest-neighbor topological qubit islands.

attractive models of particle physics where magnetic flux plays a twofold role,
being the source of fermion chirality as well as supersymmetry breaking. A
potential problem of these models is the appearance of tachyons which can only
be avoided in certain regions of moduli space and in the presence of Wilson
lines. We study the effective four-dimensional field theory for an orientifold
compactification of type IIA string theory and the corresponding toroidal
compactification of type I string theory. After determining the Kaluza-Klein

evaluate their contributions to the one-loop effective potential, summing over
all massive states, and we relate the result to the corresponding string
partition functions. We find that the Wilson-line effective potential has only
saddle points, and the theory is therefore driven to the tachyonic regime.
There tachyon condensation takes place and chiral fermions acquire a mass of
the order of the compactification scale. We also find evidence for a tachyonic
behaviour of the volume moduli. More work on tachyon condensation is needed to
clarify the connection between supersymmetry breaking, a chiral fermion
spectrum and vacuum stability.

of potential conditional powers, beyond which the trial will stop for a go or
no-go decision. This search is novel: firstly, the search is undertaken over a
range of values unique to each possible design realisation. Secondly, these
values are evaluated taking into account the possibility of early stopping.
Finally, each design realisation's operating characteristics are obtained
exactly.
  The proposed designs are compared to existing designs in a real data example.
They are also compared under three scenarios, both with respect to four single
optimality criteria and using a loss function.
  The proposed designs are superior in almost all cases. Optimising for the
expected sample size under either the null or alternative hypothesis, the
saving compared to the popular Simon's design ranges from 22% to 55%.

The new integral gives rise to a previously unstudied class of pure-jump

$X^{\mathrm{qc}}$ is quasi-left-continuous and $X^{\mathrm{dp}}$ is a

for local martingales (Yoeurp, 1976, Theoreme~1.4) and gives a rigorous meaning
to the notions of continuous-time and discrete-time components of a
semimartingale. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates a wider class of
processes that are equal to the sum of their jumps in the semimartingale

creation in a cosmological framework, which is an essentially

satisfied in the simplest extension of General Relativity, without the need of
CPT violation. Here, derivatives of the curvature can be disregarded, thus
evading the potential problems associated with the Gravitational Baryogenesis

operation by using a machine-learning based algorithm. The DATA method is
implemented within a RESTful application (DATA App) which monitors and analyzes
the ongoing network traffic and provides instructions to the SDN controller to
adapt the traffic flow matching strategies accordingly. A thorough performance
evaluation of DATA is conducted in an SDN emulation environment. The results
show that---compared to the default behavior of common SDN controllers---the

are converted to photons that are then detected. Dubbed Particle Accelerator
helioScopes for Slim Axion-like-particle deTection (PASSAT), our proposal uses
the principle of the axion helioscope but replaces ALPs produced in Sun with
those produced in a target material. Since we rely on ALP-photon conversions,
our proposal probes light (slim) ALPs that are otherwise inaccessible to
lab-based exps which rely on ALP decay, and complements astrophysical probes
that are more model-dependent. We first reinterpret existing data from the
NOMAD exp in light of PASSAT, and constrain the parameter space for ALPs
lighter than ~100 eV and ALP-photon coupling larger than ~$10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$.
As benchmarks of feasible low-cost exps improving over the NOMAD limits, we
study the possibility of reusing the magnets of the CAST and the proposed
BabyIAXO exps and placing them at the proposed BDF facility at CERN, along with
some new detectors. We find that these realizations of PASSAT allow for a
direct probe of the parameter space for ALPs lighter than ~100 eV and

that have not been probed yet by exps with lab-produced ALPs. In contrast to
other proposals aiming at detecting 1 or 2-photon only events in hadronic beam
dump environments, that rely heavily on Monte Carlo simulations, the background
(BG) in our proposal can be directly measured in-situ, its suppression
optimized, and the irreducible BG statistically subtracted. Sensitivity studies
with other beams will be the subject of future work. The measurements suggested

the number of new degrees of freedom, which we refer to as movers. We focus on
two limiting cases: Blocks with only one mover and the ones with a finite
density of movers. The former many-particle block can be exactly mapped to a
single-particle Anderson model with correlated disorder in one dimension. As a
result, these eigenstates are always localized for any finite amount of
disorder. The blocks with a finite density of movers, on the other side, show
an MBL transition that is tuned by the disorder strength. Moreover, we provide
numerical evidence that its ergodic phase is diffusive at weak disorder.
Approaching the MBL transition, we observe sub-diffusive dynamics at finite

mature galaxy formation in which galaxies considerably increase their stellar
mass, metallicity, and dust content. The study of galaxies in this redshift
range is therefore important to understand early galaxy formation and the fate
of galaxies at later times. Here, we investigate the burstiness of the recent
star-formation history (SFH) of 221 $z\sim4.5$ main-sequence galaxies at log(M)
> 9.7 by comparing their ultra-violet (UV) continuum, H$\alpha$ luminosity, and
H$\alpha$ equivalent-width (EW). The H$\alpha$ properties are derived from the
Spitzer [3.6$\mu$m]-[4.5$\mu$m] broad-band color, thereby properly taking into
account model and photometric uncertainties. We find a significant scatter
between H$\alpha$ and UV-derived luminosities and star-formation rates (SFRs).
About half of the galaxies show a significant excess in H$\alpha$ compared to
expectations from a constant smooth SFH. We also find a tentative
anti-correlation between H$\alpha$ EW and stellar mass, ranging from
1000$\r{A}$ at log(M) < 10 to below 100$\r{A}$ at log(M) > 11. Consulting
models suggests that most $z\sim4.5$ galaxies had a burst of star-formation
within the last 50 Myrs, increasing their SFRs by a factor of > 5. The most
massive galaxies on the other hand might decrease their SFRs, and may be
transitioning to a quiescent stage by z=4. We identify differential dust
attenuation (f) between stars and nebular regions as the main contributor to
the uncertainty. With local galaxies selected by increasing H$\alpha$ EW
(reaching values similar to high-z galaxies), we predict that f approaches
unity at $z>4$ consistent with the extrapolation of measurements out to z=2.

$\log_{10}(M_{\text{HI}}h^2_{70}/M_{\odot}) \leq 8.0$ are the faint blue and
faint bluer populations, the latter's dominance being sensitive to its

aligned dust grains is determined to a large extent by local magnetic field
structure. However, the observed significant anticorrelation between
polarization fraction and column density may be strongly affected, perhaps even
dominated by variations in grain alignment efficiency with local conditions, in
contrast to standard assumptions of a spatially homogeneous grain alignment
efficiency. Here we introduce a generic way to incorporate heterogeneous grain
alignment into synthetic polarization observations of molecular clouds, through
a simple model where the grain alignment efficiency depends on the local gas
density as a power-law. We justify the model using results derived from
radiative torque alignment theory. The effects of power-law heterogeneous
alignment models on synthetic observations of simulated molecular clouds are
presented. We find that the polarization fraction-column density correlation
can be brought into agreement with observationally determined values through
heterogeneous alignment, though there remains degeneracy with the relative
strength of cloud-scale magnetized turbulence and the mean magnetic field
orientation relative to the observer. We also find that the dispersion in
polarization angles-polarization fraction correlation remains robustly
correlated despite the simultaneous changes to both observables in the presence

ultra-high energy cosmic ray fluorescence detectors belonging to the JEM-EUSO
program, it will make the first UV map of the Earth by observing atmospheric
phenomena such as transient luminous events, sprites and lightning, as well as
meteors and bioluminescence from earth. Diffused light from laser shots from
the ground, which mimic the fluorescence light emitted by Nitrogen molecules
when extensive air showers pass through the atmosphere, can be used to verify
the capability of this kind of detector to observe ultra-high energy cosmic
rays. To validate the electronics and the trigger algorithms developed for
Mini-EUSO, a scaled down version of the telescope with 1:9 of the original
focal surface and a lens of 2.5 cm diameter has been built. Tests of the
Mini-EUSO engineering model have been made in laboratory and in open sky

which include the detection of stars, meteors, a planet and a rocket body
reflecting the sunlight. Interesting results of the observation of city lights

We propose a multi-scale, cascaded recurrent neural network architecture,
MSC-RNN, comprised of an efficient multi-instance learning (MIL) Recurrent

complex RNN classifier for source classification at the upper tier. By
controlling the invocation of the upper RNN with the help of the lower tier

holistically improves the accuracy and per-class recalls over ML models

their underlying cellular diversity. Traditional attempts based on comparing
anatomical or physiological features of neurons and glia, while productive,
have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neural cell types. The recent
development of single-cell transcriptomics has enabled, for the first time,
systematic high-throughput profiling of large numbers of cortical cells and the
generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and
permanent. Statistical analyses of these data have revealed the existence of
clear clusters, many of which correspond to cell types defined by traditional
criteria, and which are conserved across cortical areas and species. To
capitalize on these innovations and advance the field, we, the Copenhagen
Convention Group, propose the community adopts a transcriptome-based taxonomy
of the cell types in the adult mammalian neocortex. This core classification
should be ontological, hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It
should be configured to flexibly incorporate new data from multiple approaches,
developmental stages and a growing number of species, enabling improvement and
revision of the classification. This community-based strategy could serve as a
common foundation for future detailed analysis and reverse engineering of
cortical circuits and serve as an example for cell type classification in other
parts of the nervous system and other organs.

adversarial attacks for text classification models. To identify adversarial
attacks, a perturbation discriminator validates how likely a token in the text

perturbation, an embedding estimator learns to restore the embedding of the
original word based on the context and a replacement token is chosen based on
approximate kNN search. DISP can block adversarial attacks for any NLP model
without modifying the model structure or training procedure. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that DISP significantly
outperforms baseline methods in blocking adversarial attacks for text

compute entanglement entropy of the boosted plasma at high temperature living

  The electrical characteristics of the EEG signals can be used for seizure
detection. Statistical independence between different brain regions is measured
by functional brain connectivity (FBC). Specific directional effects can't
consider by FBC and thus effective brain connectivity (EBC) is used to measure
causal intervention between one neuronal region and the rest of the neuronal
regions. Our main purpose is to provide a reliable automatic seizure detection
approach.
  Methods
  In this study, three new methods are provided. Deep modular neural network
(DMNN) is developed based on a combination of various EBC classification
results in the different frequencies. Another method is named ""modular
effective neural networks (MENN)"". This method combines the classification
results of the three different EBC in the specific frequency. ""Modular
frequency neural networks (MFNN)"" is another method that combines the
classification results of the specific EBC in the seven different frequencies.
  Results
  The mean accuracy of the MFNN are 97.14%, 98.53%, and 97.91% using directed
transfer function, directed coherence, and generalized partial directed
coherence, respectively. Using the MENN, the highest mean accuracy is 98.34%.
Finally, DMNN has the highest mean accuracy which is equal to 99.43. To our
best knowledge, the proposed method is a new method that provides the high
accuracy in comparison to other studies which used MIT-CHB database.
  Conclusion and significance
  The knowledge of structure-function relationships between different areas of
the brain is necessary for characterizing the underlying dynamics. Hence,
features based on EBC can provide a reliable automatic seizure detection
approach.

the rate of false detections, and the quality of lag measurements for each of
these methods and under different survey designs (e.g., observing cadence and
depth) using mock quasar light curves. Overall JAVELIN and ICCF outperform ZDCF
in essentially all tests performed. Compared with ICCF, JAVELIN produces higher
quality lag measurements, is capable of measuring more lags with timescales
shorter than the observing cadence, is less susceptible to seasonal gaps and
S/N degradation in the light curves, and produces more accurate lag
uncertainties. We measure the Hbeta broad-line region size-luminosity (R-L)
relation with each method using the simulated light curves to assess the impact
of selection effects of the design of MOS-RM surveys. The slope of the R-L
relation measured by JAVELIN is the least biased among the three methods, and
is consistent across different survey designs. These results demonstrate a
clear preference for JAVELIN over the other two non-parametric methods for
MOS-RM programs, particularly in the regime of limited light curve quality as
expected from most MOS-RM programs.

representation of the original data by optimizing kernel dependency measures
that are capable of capturing nonlinear relationships. The standard strategy is
to first map the data into a high dimensional feature space using kernels prior
to a projection onto a low dimensional space. While KDR methods can be easily
solved by keeping the most dominant eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, its
features are no longer easy to interpret. Alternatively, Interpretable KDR
(IKDR) is different in that it projects onto a subspace \textit{before} the
kernel feature mapping, therefore, the projection matrix can indicate how the
original features linearly combine to form the new features. Unfortunately, the
IKDR objective requires a non-convex manifold optimization that is difficult to
solve and can no longer be solved by eigendecomposition. Recently, an efficient
iterative spectral (eigendecomposition) method (ISM) has been proposed for this
objective in the context of alternative clustering. However, ISM only provides
theoretical guarantees for the Gaussian kernel. This greatly constrains ISM's
usage since any kernel method using ISM is now limited to a single kernel. This
work extends the theoretical guarantees of ISM to an entire family of kernels,
thereby empowering ISM to solve any kernel method of the same objective. In
identifying this family, we prove that each kernel within the family has a
surrogate $\Phi$ matrix and the optimal projection is formed by its most
dominant eigenvectors. With this extension, we establish how a wide range of
IKDR applications across different learning paradigms can be solved by ISM. To

connections such that the parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of

theory \cite{V5} such a linear connection must be metrical with respect to the
averaged Riemannian metric given by integration of the Riemann-Finsler metric
on the indicatrix hypersurfaces. Therefore the linear connection (preserving
the Finslerian length of tangent vectors) is uniquely determined by its
torsion. If the torsion is zero then we have a classical Berwald manifold.
Otherwise, the torsion is a strange data we need to express in terms of the
intrinsic quantities of the Finsler manifold. In the paper we consider the
extremal compatible linear connection of a generalized Berwald manifold by
minimizing the pointwise length of its torsion tensor. It is a conditional
extremum problem involving functions defined on a local neighbourhood of the
tangent manifold. In case of a given point of the manifold, the reference
element method provides that the number of the Lagrange multipliers equals to
the number of the equations providing the compatibility of the linear
connection to the Finslerian metric. Therefore the solution of the conditional
extremum problem with a reference element can be expressed in terms of the
canonical data. The solution of the conditional extremum problem independently
of the reference elements can be constructed algorithmically at each point of
the manifold. The pointwise solutions constitute a section of the torsion
tensor bundle for testing the compatibility of the corresponding linear
connection to the Finslerian metric. In other words, we have an intrinsic
algorithm to check the existence of compatible linear connections on a Finsler
manifold because it is equivalent to the existence of the extremal compatible
linear connection.

galaxy-matter correlation functions on non-linear scales ($\lesssim 10 h^{-1}
\mathrm{Mpc}$) requires cosmological simulations. Additionally, one has to
marginalise over several nuisance parameters of the galaxy-halo connection.
However, the computational cost of such simulations prohibits naive
implementations of stochastic posterior sampling methods like Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) that would require of order $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ samples in
cosmological parameter space. Several groups have proposed surrogate models as
a solution: a so-called emulator is trained to reproduce observables for a
limited number of realisations in parameter space. Afterwards, this emulator is
used as a surrogate model in an MCMC analysis. Here, we demonstrate a different
method called Cosmological Evidence Modelling (CEM). First, for each
simulation, we calculate the Bayesian evidence marginalised over the
galaxy-halo connection by repeatedly populating the simulation with galaxies.
We show that this Bayesian evidence is directly related to the posterior
probability of cosmological parameters. Finally, we build a physically
motivated model for how the evidence depends on cosmological parameters as
sampled by the simulations. We demonstrate the feasibility of CEM by using
simulations from the Aemulus simulation suite and forecasting cosmological
constraints from BOSS CMASS measurements of redshift-space distortions. Our
analysis includes an exploration of how galaxy assembly bias affects
cosmological inference. Overall, CEM has several potential advantages over the
more common approach of emulating summary statistics, including the ability to
easily marginalise over highly complex models of the galaxy-halo connection and
greater accuracy, thereby reducing the number of simulations required.

heuristic to adapt to non-stationary data streams. The first contribution of
this paper rigorously characterizes the effect of forgetting factors for a
class of online Newton algorithms. For exp-concave and strongly convex
objectives, the algorithms achieve the dynamic regret of $\max\{O(\log
T),O(\sqrt{TV})\}$, where $V$ is a bound on the path length of the comparison
sequence. In particular, we show how classic recursive least-squares with a
forgetting factor achieves this dynamic regret bound. By varying $V$, we obtain
a trade-off between static and dynamic regret. In order to obtain more
computationally efficient algorithms, our second contribution is a novel
gradient descent step size rule for strongly convex functions. Our gradient
descent rule recovers the order optimal dynamic regret bounds described above.
For smooth problems, we can also obtain static regret of $O(T^{1-\beta})$ and
dynamic regret of $O(T^\beta V^*)$, where $\beta \in (0,1)$ and $V^*$ is the
path length of the sequence of minimizers. By varying $\beta$, we obtain a
trade-off between static and dynamic regret.

an ill-posed problem and plays a key role in subsequent processing. However,
most of existing methods usually require expert supervision or heavy runtime,

proposed to deal with the issue that there is no ground truth sample for

generate a component of the force perpendicular to the velocity of the particle

induced electrostatic wake potential that is associated with the action of the
Lorentz force on the background plasma. The direction depends on the speed of
the test charge. If it is faster than a critical speed characteristic of the
sound speed, it acts to reduce the component of velocity parallel to the

below this critical speed, it acts to increase the velocity parallel to the

perpendicular to the velocity, it does not directly influence the total energy

universal, i.e., all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the

Weigel's work and reflect on where these recent developments leave our

solves using an off-the-shelf solver.

elliptical galaxies, but its origin remains unclear. We propose that uneven
heating from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), together with radiative cooling, can
lead to the formation of the cool phase. The basic idea is that since SNe Ia
explode randomly, gas parcels which are not directly heated by SN shocks will
cool, forming multiphase gas. We run a series of idealized high-resolution
numerical simulations, and find that cool gas develops even when the overall
SNe heating rate $H$ exceeds the cooling rate $C$ by a factor as large as 1.4.
We also find that the time for multiphase gas development depends on the gas
temperature. When the medium has a temperature $T = 3\times 10^6$ K, the cool
phase forms within one cooling time \tc; however, the cool phase formation is
delayed to a few times \tc\ for higher temperatures. The main reason for the
delay is turbulent mixing. Cool gas formed this way would naturally have a
metallicity lower than that of the hot medium. For constant $H/C$, there is
more turbulent mixing for higher temperature gas. We note that this mechanism
of producing cool gas cannot be captured in cosmological simulations, which
usually fail to resolve individual SN remnants.

distances or durations. However, daily walking involves walking for bouts of
different distances and walking with turning. Here, we studied walking for
short distances and walking in circles in unilateral lower-limb amputees
wearing an above or below-knee passive prosthesis, specifically, a Jaipur foot
prosthesis. Analogous to earlier results in non-amputees, we found that their
preferred walking speeds are lower for short distances and lower for circles of
smaller radii. Using inverse optimization, we estimated the cost of changing
speeds and turning such that the observed preferred walking speeds in our
experiments minimizes the total energy cost. The inferred costs of changing
speeds and turning were much larger than for non-amputees. These findings could
inform prosthesis design and rehabilitation therapy to better assist changing
speeds and turning tasks in amputee walking. Further, measuring the preferred
speed for a range of distances and radii is a more robust subject-specific
measure of walking performance.

Specifically, we consider the setting that cameras can be well approximated as
static, e.g. in video surveillance scenarios, and scene pseudo depth maps can
therefore be inferred easily from the object scale on the image plane. We make
the following contributions: First, we extend the recent anchor-free detector
(CornerNet [17]) to video object detections. In order to exploit the
spatial-temporal information while maintaining high efficiency, the proposed
model accepts video clips as input, and only makes predictions for the starting
and the ending frames, i.e. heatmaps of object bounding box corners and the
corresponding embeddings for grouping. Second, to tackle the challenge from
scale variations in object detection, scene geometry information, e.g. derived
depth maps, is explicitly incorporated into deep networks for multi-scale
feature selection and for the network prediction. Third, we validate the
proposed architectures on an autonomous driving dataset generated from the
Carla simulator [5], and on a real dataset for human detection (DukeMTMC
dataset [28]). When comparing with the existing competitive single-stage or
two-stage detectors, the proposed geometry-aware spatio-temporal network
achieves significantly better results.

  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$","4+ pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One key feature of the multi-orbital superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is the
presence of nodal or near-nodal quasiparticle excitations revealed in a wide
variety of experiments. Typically, a nodal gap structure in a two-dimensional
model would be inconsistent with the chiral or helical p-wave interpretations.
However, we demonstrate that true gap nodes may emerge along certain
high-symmetry directions on the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surfaces, if the
multi-orbital chiral or helical p-wave pairings acquire peculiar forms wherein
the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals develop $k_y$- and $k_x$-like pairings,
respectively. Spin-orbit coupling $\eta$ induces a near-nodal gap of order
$\eta^2/W^2 \Delta_0$, where $\Delta_0$ is the gap amplitude and $W$ roughly
the bandwidth. Provided the aforementioned pairing is predominant, the
near-nodal gap structure is robust upon the inclusion of other multi-orbital
pairings that share the same symmetries. In light of the recent experimental
progresses, our proposal suggests that two-dimensional p-wave pairings may
still be viable candidate ground states for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. A near-nodal helical
p-wave order, for example, would also be consistent with the substantial drop
in the NMR Knight shift under an in-plane magnetic field.

frequencies, and showed large broadenings in energy owing to anharmonicity. Ab
initio computations were first performed with the quasiharmonic approximation
(QHA), in which the phonon frequencies depend only on $V$, and on $T$ only
insofar as it alters $V$ by thermal expansion. This QHA was an unqualified
failure for predicting the temperature dependence of phonon frequencies, even
300 K, and the thermal expansion was in error by a factor of four. Ab initio

in activity. Neutrinos escape a supernova hours before light does, so any
prompt information about the supernova's direction that can be inferred via the
neutrino signal will help to enable early electromagnetic observations of the
supernova. While there are methods to determine the direction via intrinsic
directionality of some neutrino-matter interaction channels, a complementary
method which will reach maturity with the next generation of large neutrino
detectors is the use of relative neutrino arrival times at different detectors
around the globe. To evaluate this triangulation method for realistic detector
configurations of the next few decades, we generate random supernova neutrino
signals with realistic detector assumptions, and quantify the error in expected
time delay between detections. We investigate a practical and robust method of
estimating the time differences between burst detections, also correcting for
detection efficiency bias. With this method, we determine the pointing
precision of supernova neutrino triangulation as a function of supernova
distance and location, detectors used, detector background level and neutrino
mass ordering assumption. Under favorable conditions, the 1$\sigma$ supernova
search area from triangulation could be reduced to a few percent of the sky. It

measure recourse as the distance of an individual from the decision boundary of

Galaxy, indexes larger than 2 are reported. We show that indexes larger than 2
could be the result of line-of-sight superposition of emission that does not

between 0.001\%\ and 10\%\ of the line-of-sight, allows to reproduce the
mass-size relation with $q \sim 2.2-2.3$ observed in Galactic CO surveys.
Furthermore, for dense cores within a single cloud, or molecular clouds within
a single galaxy, we argue that, even in these cases, there is observational and
theoretical evidence that some degree of superposition may be occurring.
However, additional effects may be present in each case, and are briefly
discussed. We also argue that defining the fractal dimension of clouds via the
mass-size relation is not adequate, since the mass is not {necessarily} a proxy
to the area, and the size reported in $M-R$ relations is typically obtained
from the square root of the area, rather than from an estimation of the size
independent from the area. Finally, we argue that the statistical analysis of

The question of determining the smallest size of such sets is a natural
generalization of the finite field Kakeya problem. The only previously known
bound for these sets is due to Ellenberg-Erman and requires sophisticated
machinery from algebraic geometry. In this work we give new, completely
elementary and simple, proofs which significantly improve the known bounds. Our
main result relies on an equivalent formulation of the problem using the notion
of min-entropy, which could be of independent interest.

difficult: valve and pump models form non-trivial, combinatorial logic;
hydraulic models are nonconvex; water demand patterns are uncertain; and WDN
are naturally large-scale. Prior research on control of WDN addressed major
research challenges, yet either (i) adopted simplified hydraulic models, WDN
topologies, and rudimentary valve/pump modeling or (ii) used mixed-integer,
nonconvex optimization to solve WDN control problems.
  The objective of this paper is to develop tractable computational algorithms
to manage WDN operation, while considering arbitrary topology, flow direction,
an abundance of valve types, control objectives, hydraulic models, and
operational constraints---all while only using convex, continuous optimization.
Specifically, we propose new Geometric Programming (GP)-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) algorithms, designed to solve the water flow equations and obtain
WDN controls, i.e., pump/valve schedules alongside heads and flows. The
proposed approach amounts to solving a series of convex optimization problems
that graciously scale to large networks. The proposed approach is tested using
a 126-node network with many valves and pumps and shown to outperform
traditional, rule-based control. The developed GP-based MPC algorithms, as well
as the numerical test results are all included on Github.

that quantities which correlate with magnetic field strength may also correlate

shorter rotation periods and stellar youth tests these principles. Here we
analyze the {starspot} covering fraction versus stellar age for M{-}, G{-},
K{-}, and F{-}type stars based on previously determined variability and
rotation periods of over 30,000 {\textit{Kepler}} main-sequence stars. We
determine the correlation between age and variability using single and dual
power law best fits. We find that {starspot} coverage does indeed decrease with
age. Only when the data {are} binned in an effort to remove the effects of
activity cycles of individual stars, do statistically significant power law
fits emerge for each stellar type. {Using bin averages,} we then find that the
{starspot} covering fraction scales with the {X}-ray to bolometric ratio to the
power $\lambda$ with {$0.22\pm 0.03 < \lambda < 0.32\pm 0.09$} for {G-type}

graph-structured data. Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and
tremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN
architecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is
significantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as
aggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has
shown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning
tasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot
be directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN
is different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation
learning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight
architecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional
search methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing
might become unstable in GNN.
  To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN)
framework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined
search space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily
validate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing
strategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a
carefully-designed homogeneity definition. Experiments on real-world benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the GNN architecture identified by AGNN achieves the
best performance, comparing with existing handcrafted models and tradistional

By repeatedly and adaptively choosing items to compare, we want to fully rank
the items with a certain confidence, and use as few comparisons as possible.
Different from most previous works, in this paper, we have three main
novelties: (i) compared to prior works, our upper bounds (algorithms) and lower

rankings or study exact ranking but require prior knowledge. We first derive
lower bounds for pairwise ranking (i.e., compare two items each time), and then
propose (nearly) optimal pairwise ranking algorithms. We further make
extensions to listwise ranking (i.e., comparing multiple items each time).

that includes a global encoder and the reward penalization mechanism. The
global encoder solves two issues that arise when applying GAIL framework to
high-dimensional image state. Also, it is shown that the penalization mechanism
provides more adequate reward to the agent, resulting in stable performance
improvement. Our approach's potential can be backed up by the fact that it is
generally applicable to variants of GAIL framework. We conducted in-depth
experiments by applying our methods to various variants of the GAIL framework.
And, the results proved that our method significantly improves the performances
when it comes to low-level and high-dimensional tasks.

underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown dynamics and
constrained inputs. Different from existing policy gradient methods which
employ single actor-critic but cannot realize satisfactory tracking control
accuracy and stable learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve high-level
tracking control accuracy of AUVs and stable learning by applying a hybrid
actors-critics architecture, where multiple actors and critics are trained to
learn a deterministic policy and action-value function, respectively.
Specifically, for the critics, the expected absolute Bellman error based
updating rule is used to choose the worst critic to be updated in each time
step. Subsequently, to calculate the loss function with more accurate target
value for the chosen critic, Pseudo Q-learning, which uses sub-greedy policy to
replace the greedy policy in Q-learning, is developed for continuous action
spaces, and Multi Pseudo Q-learning (MPQ) is proposed to reduce the
overestimation of action-value function and to stabilize the learning. As for
the actors, deterministic policy gradient is applied to update the weights, and
the final learned policy is defined as the average of all actors to avoid large
but bad updates. Moreover, the stability analysis of the learning is given
qualitatively. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed MPQ-based
Deterministic Policy Gradient (MPQ-DPG) algorithm are verified by the
application on AUV with two different reference trajectories. And the results
demonstrate high-level tracking control accuracy and stable learning of
MPQ-DPG. Besides, the results also validate that increasing the number of the
actors and critics will further improve the performance.

plays little role in the network performance, and it is the internal resolution
that is the critical driver of model quality. We then build on these insights
to develop novel neural network architectures that we call \emph{Isometric

equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski's theorem is also
often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. However, there
has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of finding
the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a
computational formalism based on monotone functions on the $d$-dimensional grid
with sides of length $N$, and their fixed points, as well as the closely
connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that
finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in time
$\log^d N$, and we show it requires at least $\log^2 N$ function evaluations
already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that
the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone
function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class PLS of
problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class
PPAD. Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski's theorem,
however, requires $d\cdot N$ steps, and is NP-hard in the white box model. For
supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games is
essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding the
maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player
supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional
can be solved in $O(\log N)$ steps. We also observe that computing
(approximating) the value of Condon's (Shapley's) stochastic games reduces to

GNNs is the over-smoothing issue (indistinguishable representations of nodes in

study on the over-smoothing issue of GNNs. First, we introduce two quantitative
metrics, MAD and MADGap, to measure the smoothness and over-smoothness of the
graph nodes representations, respectively. Then, we verify that smoothing is
the nature of GNNs and the critical factor leading to over-smoothness is the
low information-to-noise ratio of the message received by the nodes, which is
partially determined by the graph topology. Finally, we propose two methods to
alleviate the over-smoothing issue from the topological view: (1) MADReg which
adds a MADGap-based regularizer to the training objective;(2) AdaGraph which
optimizes the graph topology based on the model predictions. Extensive
experiments on 7 widely-used graph datasets with 10 typical GNN models show
that the two proposed methods are effective for relieving the over-smoothing

Comprehension and Text Editing. However, almost all existing approaches require

necessitates a task-specific autoencoder. Moreover, these models only generate
one compressed sentence for each source input, so that adapting to different
style requirements (e.g. length) for the final output usually implies
retraining the model from scratch. In this work, we propose a fully
unsupervised model, Deleter, that is able to discover an ""optimal deletion
path"" for an arbitrary sentence, where each intermediate sequence along the
path is a coherent subsequence of the previous one. This approach relies
exclusively on a pretrained bidirectional language model (BERT) to score each
candidate deletion based on the average Perplexity of the resulting sentence
and performs progressive greedy lookahead search to select the best deletion
for each step. We apply Deleter to the task of extractive Sentence Compression,
and found that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models
trained on 1.02 million in-domain examples with similar compression ratio.
Qualitative analysis, as well as automatic and human evaluations both verify
that our model produces high-quality compression.

the decay of an unstable system can be slowed down by measuring it frequently
enough. It was also noticed later that the opposite effect, i.e., enhancement
of the decay due to frequent measurements, is rather common. An important
question arising in this regards is how to choose the optimal measurement
strategy to achieve the highest possible decay rate. Here we rigorously prove
the universal optimality of the stroboscopic measurement protocol in the sense
that it always provides the shortest expected decay time among all measurement
procedures. However, the implementation of the stroboscopic protocol requires
the knowledge of the optimal sampling period which may depend on the fine
details of the quantum problem. We show that this difficulty can be overcame
with the simple non-regular measurement procedures inspired by the scale-free
restart strategies used to speed up the completion of random search tasks and
probabilistic algorithms in computer science. Besides, our analysis reveals the
universal criteria to discriminate between Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes for the

previous works, our new framework models relations as functions that map
subjects to objects in a sentence, which naturally handles the overlapping

state-of-the-art methods even when its encoder module uses a randomly

enjoys further performance boost when employing a pre-trained BERT encoder,
outperforming the strongest baseline by 17.5 and 30.2 absolute gain in F1-score

different scenarios of overlapping triples shows that the method delivers
consistent performance gain across all these scenarios. The source code and

equation and to the discrete Liouville equation. Both of these initial value
problems lead to exponential degree growth for Hirota's dKdV, the
quintessential integrable lattice equation. For the discrete Liouville
equation, though it is linearizable, one of the initial value problems yields
exponential degree growth whereas the other is shown to yield non-polynomial
(though still sub-exponential) growth. These results are in contrast to the
common belief that discrete integrable equations must have polynomial growth
and that linearizable equations necessarily have linear degree growth,

temperature profile and mean gaseous abundance of a planet at all longitudes
and latitudes \textbf{simultaneously}, assuming that the temperature or
composition, $x$, at a particular longitude and latitude $(\Lambda,\Phi)$ is
given by $x(\Lambda,\Phi) = \bar{x} + (x(\Lambda,0) - \bar{x})\cos^n\Phi$,
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the morning and evening terminator values of
$x(\Lambda,0)$, and $n$ is an assumed coefficient. We compare our new 2.5-D
scheme with the more traditional 1-D approach, which assumes the same
temperature profile and gaseous abundances at all points on the visible disc of
a planet for each individual phase observation, using a set of synthetic phase
curves generated from a GCM-based simulation. We find that our 2.5-D model fits
these data more realistically than the 1-D approach, confining the hotter
regions of the planet more closely to the dayside. We then apply both models to
WASP-43b phase curve observations of HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that
the dayside of WASP-43b is apparently much hotter than the nightside and show
that this could be explained by the presence of a thick cloud on the nightside
with a cloud top at pressure $< 0.2$ bar. We further show that while the mole
fraction of water vapour is reasonably well constrained to
$(1-10)\times10^{-4}$, the abundance of CO is very difficult to constrain with
these data since it is degenerate with temperature and prone to possible
systematic radiometric differences between the HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC
observations. Hence, it is difficult to reliably constrain C/O.

research direction for scene recognition. Due to the large intra-class
structural diversity, building and modeling flexible structural layout to adapt
various image characteristics is a challenge. Existing structural modeling
methods in scene recognition either focus on predefined grids or rely on
learned prototypes, which all have limited representative ability. In this
paper, we propose Prototype-agnostic Scene Layout (PaSL) construction method to
build the spatial structure for each image without conforming to any prototype.
Our PaSL can flexibly capture the diverse spatial characteristic of scene
images and have considerable generalization capability. Given a PaSL, we build
Layout Graph Network (LGN) where regions in PaSL are defined as nodes and two
kinds of independent relations between regions are encoded as edges. The LGN
aims to incorporate two topological structures (formed in spatial and semantic
similarity dimensions) into image representations through graph convolution.
Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results
on widely recognized MIT67 and SUN397 datasets without multi-model or
multi-scale fusion. Moreover, we also conduct the experiments on one of the
largest scale datasets, Places365. The results demonstrate the proposed method
can be well generalized and obtains competitive performance.

astrophysical reaction rates in a large reaction network. As the detailed
astrophysical conditions of the $\nu p$ process still are unknown, a parameter
study was performed, with 23 trajectories covering a large range of entropies

dramatic drops of entropies upon cooling toward the glass transition
temperatures. The entropy drops reduce possible kinetic pathways and lead to
dramatic slowdowns in the dynamics. In addition, the kinetic fragility is shown
to correlate with a thermodynamic fragility.

known as large-scale vortices (LSVs), which play an important role in the
dynamics and long-term evolution of geophysical and astrophysical fluids. Here,
using direct numerical simulations, we show that LSVs in rapidly rotating mixed
convective and stably stratified fluids, which approximates the two-layer,
turbulent-stratified dynamics of many geophysical and astrophysical fluids,
have a generic shape and that their size can be predicted. We show that LSVs
emerge in the convection zone from upscale energy transfers and can penetrate
into the stratified layer. At the convective-stratified interface, the LSV
cores have a positive buoyancy anomaly. Due to the thermal wind constraint,
this buoyancy anomaly leads to winds in the stratified layer that decay over a
characteristic vertical length scale. Thus LSVs take the shape of a
depth-invariant cylinder with a finite-size radius in the turbulent layer and
of a penetrating half dome in the stratified layer. Importantly, we demonstrate
that when LSVs penetrate all the way through the stratified layer and reach a
boundary that is no-slip, they saturate by boundary friction. We provide a
prediction for the penetration depth and maximum radius of LSVs as a function
of the LSV vorticity, the stratified layer depth, and the stratification. Our
results, which apply for cyclonic LSVs, suggest that LSVs in slowly rotating
stars and Earth's liquid core are confined to the convective layer, while in
Earth's atmosphere and oceans they can penetrate far into the stratified layer.

enhance the performance. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated on a

probability distribution for the subhalo occupation number and the halo
concentration. This prescription enabled us to recover the benchmark power
spectrum from $N$-body simulations to within 1\% and the bispectrum to within
4\% across the entire range of scales of the simulation. A small further boost
adding an extra galaxy to all parent halos above the mass threshold
$M>2\times10^{14}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ obtained a better than 1\% fit to both power
spectrum and bispectrum in the range $K/3<1.1\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, where
$K=k_1+k_2+k_3$. This statistical model should be applicable to fast dark

reproduce the halo power spectrum and bispectrum obtained from $N$-body
simulations. We also investigate alternative schemes using the Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) which depend only on halo mass, but these yield results
deficient in both the power spectrum (2\%) and the bispectrum (>4\%) at $k,K/3
\approx 0.2\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, with poor scaling for the latter. Efforts to
match the power spectrum by modifying the standard four-parameter HOD model

we construct an action proposal graph, where each proposal is represented as a

types of relations, one for capturing the context information for each proposal
and the other one for characterizing the correlations between distinct actions.
Then we apply the GCNs over the graph to model the relations among different
proposals and learn powerful representations for the action classification and
localization. Experimental results show that our approach significantly

core, our modelling demonstrates the splitting of the guided mode into a
surface sensing mode and a mode that is isolated from the surface. With the
isolated mode acting as a reference arm, this two-mode one-fibre solution

hard-to-reach places inside living organisms, such as the spinal cord, ovarian

algorithm for a given problem. Supervised machine learning models can
accurately predict which solver is best for a given problem, but they require
first to run every solver in the portfolio for all examples available to create
labelled data. As this approach cannot scale, we developed an active learning

soft glassy behavior of the amorphous alloy. Conversely, in crystalline SiNW,
the larger stress in the narrow crystalline lithiated interface is hardly

recurrent Nova LMC 1968 in the Large Magellanic Cloud which was previously
observed in eruption in 1968, 1990, 2002, 2010, and most recently in 2016. We
derive a probable recurrence time of $6.2 \pm 1.2$ years and provide the
ephemerides of the eclipse. In the ultraviolet-optical-IR photometry the light
curve shows high variability right from the first observation around two days
after eruption. Therefore no colour changes can be substantiated. Outburst
spectra from 2016 and 1990 are very similar and are dominated by H and He lines
longward of 2000 Angstrom. Interstellar reddening is found to be E(B-V) =
$0.07\pm0.01$. The super soft X-ray luminosity is lower than the Eddington
luminosity and the X-ray spectra suggest the mass of the WD is larger than 1.3
M$_\odot$. Eclipses in the light curve suggest that the system is at high
orbital inclination. On day four after the eruption a recombination wave was
observed in Fe II ultraviolet absorption lines. Narrow line components are seen
after day 6 and explained as being due to reionisation of ejecta from a
previous eruption. The UV spectrum varies with orbital phase, in particular a
component of the He II 1640 Angstrom emission line, which leads us to propose
that early-on the inner WD Roche lobe might be filled with a bound opaque
medium prior to the re-formation of an accretion disk. Both this medium and the
ejecta can cause the delay in the appearance of the soft X-ray source.

objective is to minimize a global cost function formed by a sum of local smooth
cost functions, by using local information exchange. The standard assumption
for proving exponential/linear convergence of first-order methods is the strong
convexity of the cost functions, which does not hold for many practical
applications. In this paper, we first show that the continuous-time distributed
primal-dual gradient algorithm converges to one global minimizer exponentially
under the assumption that the global cost function satisfies the restricted
secant inequality condition. This condition is weaker than the strong convexity
condition since it does not require convexity and the global minimizers are not
necessary to be unique. We then show that the discrete-time distributed
primal-dual algorithm constructed by using the Euler's approximation method
converges to one global minimizer linearly under the same condition. The
theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

chemical activity into motion has conceptual and experimental support, but much
of the claimed support comes from experimental conditions where the substrate

the Michaelis-Menten constant. Moreover, many of the enzymes studied
experimentally to date are oligomeric. Urease, a hexamer of subunits, has been
considered to be the gold standard demonstrating enhanced diffusion. Here we
show that urease and certain other oligomeric enzymes of high catalytic

more rapidly, thus providing a simple physical mechanism of enhanced diffusion
in this regime of concentrations. Mindful that this conclusion may be
controversial, our findings are sup-ported by four independent analytical

size-exclusion chroma-tography (SEC), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy

perturbative renormalization group methods on the Bray-Roberts reduced
Landau-Ginzburg-type theory for a short-range Ising spin glass in space of
dimension $d$, we show that at nonzero magnetic field the nature of the
corresponding transition is modified as follows: a) for $d-6$ small and
positive, with increasing field on the AT line first, the ordered phase just
below the transition becomes the so-called one-step RSB, instead of the full
RSB that occurs in mean-field theory; the transition on the AT line remains
continuous with a diverging correlation length. Then at a higher field, a
tricritical point separates the latter transition from a quasi-first-order one,
that is one at which the correlation length does not diverge, and there is a
jump in part of the order parameter, but no latent heat. The location of the
tricritical point tends to zero as $d\to6^+$; b) for $d\leq 6$, we argue that
the quasi-first-order transition could persist down to arbitrarily small
nonzero fields, with a transition to full RSB still expected at lower
temperature. Whenever the quasi-first-order transition occurs, it is at a
higher temperature than the AT transition would be for the same field,
preempting it as the temperature is lowered. We also draw attention to the
similarity of the ""dynamically-frozen"" state, which occurs at temperatures just
above the quasi-first-order transition, and the ""metastate-average state"" of
the one-step RSB phase, and discuss the issue of the number of pure states in

automation engineering is supported by a suite of software tools including
integrated development environments (IDE), hardware configurators, compilers,
and runtimes. These tools focus on the automation code itself, but leave the
automation engineer unassisted in their decision making. This can lead to
increased time for software development because of imperfections in decision
making leading to multiple iterations between software and hardware. To address
this, this paper defines multiple challenges often faced in automation
engineering and propose solutions using machine learning to assist engineers
tackle such challenges. We show that machine learning can be leveraged to
assist the automation engineer in classifying automation, finding similar code
snippets, and reasoning about the hardware selection of sensors and actuators.
We validate our architecture on two real datasets consisting of 2,927 Arduino
projects, and 683 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) projects. Our results
show that paragraph embedding techniques can be utilized to classify automation
using code snippets with precision close to human annotation, giving an
F1-score of 72%. Further, we show that such embedding techniques can help us
find similar code snippets with high accuracy. Finally, we use autoencoder
models for hardware recommendation and achieve a p@3 of 0.79 and p@5 of 0.95.

  type I neurons",,,,,"nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The collective behaviour of neural networks depends on the cellular and
synaptic properties of the neurons. The phase-response curve (PRC) is an
experimentally obtainable measure of cellular properties that quantifies the
shift in the next spike time of a neuron as a function of the phase at which
stimulus is delivered to that neuron. The neuronal PRCs can be classified as
having either purely positive values (type I) or distinct positive and negative
regions (type II). Networks of type 1 PRCs tend not to synchronize via mutual
excitatory synaptic connections. We study the synchronization properties of
identical type I and type II neurons, assuming unidirectional synapses.
Performing the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation of the
extended Kuramoto model, we show that feedforward loop motifs favour
synchronization of type I excitatory and inhibitory neurons, while feedback
loop motifs destroy their synchronization tendency. Moreover, large directed
networks, either without feedback motifs or with many of them, have been
constructed from the same undirected backbones, and a high synchronization
level is observed for directed acyclic graphs with type I neurons. It has been
shown that, the synchronizability of type I neurons depends on both the
directionality of the network connectivity and the topology of its undirected
backbone. The abundance of feedforward motifs enhances the synchronizability of
the directed acyclic graphs.

beamed jet and blue bump together with broad emission lines. The coexistence of
the comparably prominent jet and accretion disk leads to complicated
variability properties. Recent reverberation mapping monitoring for 3C 273
revealed that the optical continuum shows a distinct long-term trend that does
not have a corresponding echo in the Hbeta fluxes. We compile multi-wavelength
monitoring data from the Swift archive and other ground-based programs and
clearly find two components of emissions at optical wavelength. One component
stems from the accretion disk itself and the other component can be ascribed to
the jet contribution, which also naturally accounts for the non-echoed trend in
reverberation mapping data. We develop an approach to decouple the optical
emissions from the jet and accretion disk in 3C 273 with the aid of
multi-wavelength monitoring data. By assuming the disk emission has a
negligible polarization in consideration of the low inclination of the jet, the
results show that the jet contributes a fraction of ~10% at the minimum and up
to ~40% at the maximum to the total optical emissions. This is the first time
to provide a physical interpretation to the ""detrending"" manipulation
conventionally adopted in reverberation mapping analysis. Our work also
illustrates the importance of appropriately analyzing variability properties in
cases of coexisting jets and accretion disks.

Conveniently, the objectives of different dimensionality reduction applications

nonconvexity of the objective function arising from non-linear kernels poses a
serious challenge to optimization efficiency and limits the potential of
HSIC-based formulations. As a result, only linear kernels have been
computationally tractable in practice. This paper proposes a spectral-based
optimization algorithm that extends beyond the linear kernel. The algorithm
identifies a family of suitable kernels and provides the first and second-order
local guarantees when a fixed point is reached. Furthermore, we propose a
principled initialization strategy, thereby removing the need to repeat the

sufficient computational resources to ensure correct grammar recognition. A
widely-used approach to expand model capacity would be to couple an RNN to an

(NSPDA), which consists of a digital stack, instead of an analog one, that is
coupled to a neural network state machine. We empirically show its
effectiveness in recognizing various context-free grammars (CFGs). First, we
develop the underlying mechanics of the proposed higher order recurrent network
and its manipulation of a stack as well as how to stably program its underlying
pushdown automaton (PDA) to achieve desired finite-state network dynamics.
Next, we introduce a noise regularization scheme for higher-order (tensor)
networks, to our knowledge the first of its kind, and design an algorithm for
improved incremental learning. Finally, we design a method for inserting
grammar rules into a NSPDA and empirically show that this prior knowledge
improves its training convergence time by an order of magnitude and, in some
cases, leads to better generalization. The NSPDA is also compared to a
classical analog stack neural network pushdown automaton (NNPDA) as well as a
wide array of first and second-order RNNs with and without external memory,
trained using different learning algorithms. Our results show that, for Dyck(2)

and for ensuring generalization to longer sequences at test time. We observe
that many RNNs with and without memory, but no prior knowledge, fail to

emerging and challenging topic in remote sensing. In particular, one of the
main challenges is to tackle the problem in an unsupervised manner. In this
paper we propose an unsupervised framework for bitemporal heterogeneous change
detection based on the comparison of affinity matrices and image regression.
First, our method quantifies the similarity of affinity matrices computed from
co-located image patches in the two images. This is done to automatically
identify pixels that are likely to be unchanged. With the identified pixels as
pseudo-training data, we learn a transformation to map the first image to the
domain of the other image, and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected
to carry out the transformation: Gaussian process regression, support vector
regression, random forest regression, and a recently proposed kernel regression
method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate the potentials and
limitations of our framework, and also the benefits and disadvantages of each
regression method, we perform experiments on two real data sets. The results
indicate that the comparison of the affinity matrices can already be considered
a change detection method by itself. However, image regression is shown to
improve the results obtained by the previous step alone and produces accurate
change detection maps despite of the heterogeneity of the multitemporal input
data. Notably, the random forest regression approach excels by achieving
similar accuracy as the other methods, but with a significantly lower
computational cost and with fast and robust tuning of hyperparameters.

submerged in the bulk of a surfactant solution may self-propel along a

model capturing all three types of self-propulsion trajectories of a drop in
the case of a nematic LC with homeotropic anchoring at LC-fluid interface. We
emulate the director field within the drop by a single preferred polarization
vector that is subject of two reorientation mechanisms, namely, the internal
flow-induced displacement of the hedgehog defect and the droplet's rotation.
Within this reduced-order model, the coupling between the nematic ordering of
the drop and the surfactant transport is represented by variations of the
droplet's interfacial properties with nematic polarization. Our analysis
reveals that a novel mode of orientational instability emerges from the
competition of the two reorientation mechanisms and is characterized by a
spontaneous rotation of the self-propelling drop responsible for helical
self-propulsion trajectories. In turn, we also show that random trajectories in
isotropic and nematic drops alike stem from the advection-driven transition to
chaos. The succession of the different propulsion modes is consistent with
experimentally-reported transitions in the shape of droplet trajectories as the
drop size is varied.
