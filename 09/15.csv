to secure the IV data sharing against malicious attacks. Blockchain, as
expected by both research and industry communities, has emerged as a good
solution to address these issues. The major issues in IV data sharing are
trust, data accuracy and reliability of data sharing in the communication
channel. Blockchain technology, previously working for the cryptocurrency, has
recently applied to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with
similar topologies of IV data sharing. In this chapter, we present a new
framework, namely biometric blockchain (BBC), for secure IV data sharing. In
our new scheme, biometric information is exploited as a cue to record who is
responsible in the data sharing activities, while the proposed BBC technology
serves as the backbone of the IV data-sharing architecture. Hence, the proposed
BBC technology provides a more reliable trust environment between the vehicles

Besides achieving substantial dimension reduction, the proposed model is

leads to a sparsity-inducing estimator. For the low-dimensional case, we derive
asymptotic properties of the proposed least squares estimator and introduce an

extended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent
factor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the
characteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of
purchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of
items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and
category-aspect of items. Moreover, the latent factor models usually use the
shallow projection, which cannot capture the characteristics of users and items
well. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level
Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent
factors. Through modelling the rich object properties and relations in
recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first
extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items
respectively through different meta-paths, and then feeds an elaborately
designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent
factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent factors are fused for the top-N
recommendation. Moreover, to fuse information from different aspects more
effectively, we further propose NeuACF++ to fuse aspect-level latent factors
with self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three real world
datasets show that NeuACF and NeuACF++ significantly outperform both existing
latent factor models and recent neural network models.

a flux rope. Here we report direct observations of breakout reconnection and
plasmoid formation during two jets in the fan-spine topology of an embedded
bipole. For the first time, we observed the formation and evolution of multiple
small plasmoids with bidirectional flows associated with fast reconnection in
3D breakout current sheets in the solar corona. The first narrow jet was
launched by reconnection at the breakout current sheet originating at the
deformed 3D null, without significant flare reconnection or a filament
eruption. In contrast, the second jet and release of cool filament plasma were
triggered by explosive breakout reconnection when the leading edge of the

calculation, construction, and maintenance of the packet transmission schedules
are not defined. Moreover, to ensure optimal throughput, most of the existing
scheduling methods are based on the assumption that instantaneous and accurate
Channel State Information (CSI) is available. However, due to the inevitable
errors in the channel estimation process, this assumption cannot be
materialized in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose two
alternative and realistic approaches. In our first approach, we assume that
only the statistical knowledge of CSI is available a priori. Armed with this
knowledge, the average packet rate on each link is computed and then, using the
results, the throughput-optimal schedule for the assignment of (slot-frame)
cells to links can be formulated as a max-weight bipartite matching problem,
which can be solved efficiently using the well-known Hungarian algorithm. In
the second approach, we assume that no CSI knowledge (even statistical) is
available at the design stage. For this zero-knowledge setting, we introduce a
machine learning-based algorithm by formally modeling the scheduling problem in
terms of a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) process. Our CMAB-based
scheme is widely applicable to many real operational environments, thanks to
its reduced reliance on design-time knowledge. Simulation results show that the
average throughput obtained by the statistical CSI-based method is within the
margin of 15% from the theoretical upper bound associated with perfect
instantaneous CSI. The aforesaid margin is around 18% for our
learning-theoretic solution.

alternate route to color-center-assisted DNP using nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond coupled to substitutional nitrogen impurities, the so-called
P1 centers. Working near the level anti-crossing condition - where the P1
Zeeman splitting matches one of the NV spin transitions - we demonstrate
efficient microwave-free 13C DNP through the use of consecutive magnetic field
sweeps and continuous optical excitation. The amplitude and sign of the
polarization can be controlled by adjusting the low-to-high and high-to-low
magnetic field sweep rates in each cycle so that one is much faster than the
other. By comparing the 13C DNP response for different crystal orientations, we
show that the process is robust to magnetic field/NV misalignment, a feature
that makes the present technique suitable to diamond powders and settings where
the field is heterogeneous. Applications to shallow NVs could capitalize on the
greater physical proximity between surface paramagnetic defects and outer

results from two main contributions: a capillary flow pushing the liquid
towards the contact line from the bulk and a thermal Marangoni flow pulling the
drop free surface towards the summit. Current analytical and numerical models
are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations however they
overestimate the interfacial velocity values by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This
discrepancy is generally ascribed to contamination of the water samples with
non-soluble surfactants, however an experimental confirmation of this
assumption has not yet been provided. In this work, we show that a small ""ionic
contamination"" can cause a significant effect in the flow pattern inside the
droplet. To provide the proof, we compare the flow in evaporating droplets of
ultrapure water with commercially available bottled water of different
mineralization levels. Mineral waters are bottled at natural springs, are
micro-biologically pure, and contain only traces of minerals (as well as traces
of other possible contaminants), therefore one would expect a slower
interfacial flow as the amount of ""contaminants"" increase. Surprisingly, our
results show that the magnitude of the interfacial flow is practically the same
for mineral waters with low content of minerals as that of ultrapure water.
However, for waters with larger content of minerals, the interfacial flow tends
to slow down due to the presence of ionic concentration gradients. Our results
show a much more complex scenario than it has been typically suspected, and
therefore a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the huge differences
between numerical models and experiments is necessary.

Oracle property has two parts; one is the variable selection consistency (VSC)

In this paper, we consider different penalized regression techniques which are
VSC and classify those based on oracle and strong oracle property. We show that
both the residual and the perturbation bootstrap methods are second order
correct for any penalized estimator irrespective of its class. Most interesting

of QCD at high temperatures he does not address and even mention the essence of
our arguments. In recent years a new ""hidden"" symmetry in QCD was discovered.
It is a symmetry of the electric sector of QCD, that is higher than the chiral
symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian as the whole. This symmetry was clearly observed
above T_c in spatial correlators and very recently also in time correlators.
The latter correlators are directly related to observable spectral density.
Then in a model-independent way we conclude that degrees of freedom in QCD
above T_c, but below roughly 3T_c, are chirally symmetric quarks bound by the
chromoelectric field into color-singlet compounds without the chromomagnetic
effects. This regime of QCD has been referred to as a Stringy Fluid since such
objects are very reminiscent of strings.At higher temperatures there is a very
smooth transition to the partonic degrees of freedom, i.e. to the QGP regime.

implemented on conventional von Neumann computing systems. Consequently, recent
years have seen an emergence of research in machine learning hardware that
strives to bring memory and computing closer together. A popular approach is to
realise artificial neural networks in hardware by implementing their synaptic
weights using memristive devices. However, various device- and system-level
non-idealities usually prevent these physical implementations from achieving
high inference accuracy. We suggest applying a well-known concept in computer
science -- committee machines -- in the context of memristor-based neural
networks. Using simulations and experimental data from three different types of
memristive devices, we show that committee machines employing ensemble
averaging can successfully increase inference accuracy in physically
implemented neural networks that suffer from faulty devices, device-to-device
variability, random telegraph noise and line resistance. Importantly, we
demonstrate that the accuracy can be improved even without increasing the total
number of memristors.

paper, we report on a systematic study of weak-antilocalization (WAL) effect in
n-type two-dimensional (2D) Te films. We find that the WAL agrees well with
Iordanskii, Lyanda-Geller, and Pikus (ILP) theory. The gate and temperature

together with gate tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Transition from
weak-localization (WL) to weak-antilocalization (WAL) depending on gate bias is
also observed. These results demonstrate that newly developed solution-based

We study how the mobile training environment impacts performance by simulating

speech impaired users for personalization. Our results show that
personalization achieved 63.7\% relative word error rate reduction when trained
in a server environment and 58.1% in a mobile environment. Moving to on-device
personalization resulted in 18.7% performance degradation, in exchange for
improved scalability and data privacy. To train the model on device, we split
the gradient computation into two and achieved 45% memory reduction at the

Methods: Five children of mixed aetiology in NCSE were given high flow of
inhaled carbogen (5% carbon dioxide/95% oxygen) using a face mask for maximum
120s. EEG was recorded concurrently in all patients. The effects of inhaled
carbogen on patient EEG recordings were investigated using band-power,
functional connectivity and graph theory measures. Carbogen effect was
quantified by measuring effect size (Cohen's d) between ""before"", ""during"" and
""after"" carbogen delivery states. Results: Carbogen's apparent effect on EEG
band-power and network metrics across all patients for ""before-during"" and
""before-after"" inhalation comparisons was inconsistent across the five
patients. Conclusion: The changes in different measures suggest a potentially
non-homogeneous effect of carbogen on the patients' EEG. Different aetiology
and duration of the inhalation may underlie these non-homogeneous effects.
Tuning the carbogen parameters (such as ratio between CO2 and O2, duration of
inhalation) on a personalised basis may improve seizure suppression in future.

we focus on the neural architecture design problem in the context of
class-incremental learning: at each time step, the learner must optimize its
performance on all classes observed so far by selecting the most competitive
neural architecture. To tackle this problem, we propose Continual Neural
Architecture Search (CNAS): an autoML approach that takes advantage of the
sequential nature of class-incremental learning to efficiently and adaptively
identify strong architectures in a continual learning setting. We employ a task
network to perform the classification task and a reinforcement learning agent
as the meta-controller for architecture search. In addition, we apply network
transformations to transfer weights from previous learning step and to reduce
the size of the architecture search space, thus saving a large amount of
computational resources. We evaluate CNAS on the CIFAR-100 dataset under varied
incremental learning scenarios with limited computational power (1 GPU).
Experimental results demonstrate that CNAS outperforms architectures that are
optimized for the entire dataset. In addition, CNAS is at least an order of

the input to the WADC should be the most observable signal and the WADC output
should be sent to the most controllable generator. This paper presents a
measurement-based novel algorithm for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) transfer
function identification of the power system based on optimization to estimate

linearized model which does not consider changing operating conditions. The
overall algorithm is implemented and validated on a RTDS/RSCAD and MATLAB

considering Handelman's Positivstellensatz (Psatz) over a box, we construct
non-SOS Schm\""{u}dgen-type Ps\""atze over any compact semialgebraic set. That
is, a family of Ps\""atze that follow the structure of the fundamental
Schm\""{u}dgen's Psatz, but where instead of SOS polynomials, any class of
polynomials containing the non-negative constants can be used, such as SONC,
DSOS/SDSOS, hyperbolic or sums of AM/GM polynomials. Secondly, by considering
the simplex as the simple set, we derive a sparse Psatz over general compact
sets, which does not require any structural assumptions, such as the running
intersection property. Finally, by considering P\'olya's Psatz over the
non-negative orthant, we derive a new non-SOS Psatz over unbounded sets which
satisfy some generic conditions. All these results contribute to and generalize
recent related results in the literature regarding the use of non-SOS
polynomials and sparse NNCs to derive Ps\""atze over compact and unbounded sets.
Moreover, in contrast to most related literature, our approach is based on
basic real analysis rather than algebraic geometry tools.

modeled as a constrained dynamical system. For such systems, the interplay of
feasibility region (man-made limits) and stability region (natural dynamical
system response) results in a positively invariant region in state space known
as the constrained stability region (CSR). After the occurrence of a

first scans a subset of the channels to find one that is idle. If at least one
idle channel is found, the user transmits a file over that channel. If no idle
channel is found, a persistent user will repeat the access attempt at a later
time, while a non-persistent user will leave. This is a useful mathematical
model for ""coffee shop"" situations where a group of persistent users stay near
an access point for an extended period of time while non-persistent users come

steady state probabilities are found by exploiting a latent reversibility
property. This enables simple expressions for throughput and blocking
probability.

association (TWA, ~8-10 Myr), an ideal target to probe the final stages of disk
accretion down to brown dwarf masses. Our sample comprises eleven TWA members
with infrared excess, amounting to 85% of the total TWA population with disks,
with spectral types between M0 and M9, and masses between 0.58 and 0.02 Msol.
We employed homogeneous spectroscopic data from 300 to 2500 nm, obtained with
X-shooter, to derive individual extinction, stellar parameters, and accretion
parameters simultaneously. We then examined Balmer lines and forbidden emission
lines to probe the physics of the star-disk interaction environment. We
detected signatures of ongoing accretion for 70% of our TWA targets. This
implies a fraction of accretors of 13-17% across the entire TWA (accounting for
potentially accreting members not included in our survey). The spectral
emission associated with these stars reveals a more evolved stage of these
accretors compared to younger PMS populations: (i) a large fraction (~50%)
exhibit nearly symmetric, narrow H_alpha line profiles; (ii) over 80% exhibit
Balmer decrements consistent with moderate accretion and optically thin
emission; (iii) less than a third exhibit forbidden line emission in [O I]
6300A, indicative of winds and outflows activity. However, the distribution in
accretion rates (Mdot) derived for the TWA sample follows closely that of
younger regions for Mstar~0.1-0.3 Msun. An overall correlation between Mdot and
Mstar is detected, best reproduced by Mdot~Mstar^(2.1+/-0.5). At least in the
lowest Mstar regimes, stars that still retain a disk at ages ~8-10 Myr are
found to exhibit statistically similar, albeit moderate, accretion levels as
those measured around younger objects. This slow Mdot evolution may be
associated with longer evolutionary timescales of disks around low-mass stars.

from correlations in the observed RM. RM is a variable which can be derived
from the polarised radiative transfer equations in restrictive conditions. This
paper assesses the usage of RMF (rotation measure fluctuation) analyses for

caution against interpretations of RMF analyses when a characteristic density
is ill-defined, e.g. in cases of log-normal distributed and fractal-like

the line-of-sight longitudinal direction and the sky plane direction, one also
needs to clarify the context of RMF when inferring from observational data. In
complex situations, a covariant polarised radiative transfer calculation is
essential to capture all aspects of radiative and transport processes, which
would otherwise ambiguate the interpretations of magnetism in galaxy clusters

to large or complex spaces. Complementarily, in autonomous systems technology,
applications have been growing for distributed control methods that scale to
large numbers of low-footprint mobile platforms. Animals and many-robot groups
must solve common problems of navigating complex and uncertain environments.
Here, we introduce the 'NeuroSwarms' control framework to investigate whether
adaptive, autonomous swarm control of minimal artificial agents can be achieved
by direct analogy to neural circuits of rodent spatial cognition. NeuroSwarms
analogizes agents to neurons and swarming groups to recurrent networks. We
implemented neuron-like agent interactions in which mutually visible agents
operate as if they were reciprocally-connected place cells in an attractor
network. We attributed a phase state to agents to enable patterns of
oscillatory synchronization similar to hippocampal models of theta-rhythmic
(5-12 Hz) sequence generation. We demonstrate that multi-agent swarming and
reward-approach dynamics can be expressed as a mobile form of Hebbian learning
and that NeuroSwarms supports a single-entity paradigm that directly informs
theoretical models of animal cognition. We present emergent behaviors including
phase-organized rings and trajectory sequences that interact with environmental
cues and geometry in large, fragmented mazes. Thus, NeuroSwarms is a model
artificial spatial system that integrates autonomous control and theoretical
neuroscience to potentially uncover common principles to advance both domains.

the maximally degenerate case in odd dimensions (Chern-Simons AdS) the

multi-label prediction models from instances with overcomplete noisy

PML-GAN, under a generalized encoder-decoder framework for partial multi-label

to the disambiguated label vectors, while deploying a generative adversarial
network as an inverse mapping from label vectors to data samples in the input
feature space. The learning of the overall model corresponds to a minimax
adversarial game, which enhances the correspondence of input features with the

approaches, making training a challenge. Existing non-adversarial methods learn
mappings between the source and target domains, to achieve reasonable
performance. However, even these methods do not focus on a key aspect:
maintaining performance on the source domain, even after optimizing over the
target domain. Additionally, there exist very few methods in low resource
supervised domain adaptation. This work proposes a method, LRS-DAG, that aims
to solve these current issues in the field. By adding a set of ""encoder layers""
which map the target domain to the source, and can be removed when dealing
directly with the source data, the model learns to perform optimally on both
domains. LRS-DAG showcases its uniqueness by being a new algorithm for low
resource domain adaptation which maintains performance over the source domain,
with a new metric for learning mappings between domains being introduced. We
show that, in the case of FCNs, when transferring from MNIST to SVHN, LRS-DAG
performs comparably to fine tuning, with the advantage of maintaining
performance over the source domain. LRS-DAG outperforms fine tuning when
transferring to a synthetic dataset similar to MNIST, which is a setting more
representative of low resource supervised domain adaptation.

Network (Cascade RPN) for improving the region-proposal quality and detection

conventional RPN that \textit{heuristically defines} the anchors and
\textit{aligns} the features to the anchors. First, instead of using multiple
anchors with predefined scales and aspect ratios, Cascade RPN relies on a
\textit{single anchor} per location and performs multi-stage refinement. Each
stage is progressively more stringent in defining positive samples by starting
out with an anchor-free metric followed by anchor-based metrics in the ensuing
stages. Second, to attain alignment between the features and the anchors
throughout the stages, \textit{adaptive convolution} is proposed that takes the
anchors in addition to the image features as its input and learns the sampled
features guided by the anchors. A simple implementation of a two-stage Cascade
RPN achieves AR 13.4 points higher than that of the conventional RPN,
surpassing any existing region proposal methods. When adopting to Fast R-CNN

algorithm to solve a convex consensus optimization problem defined over a
decentralized network. A remarkable existing algorithm to solve this problem is
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), in which at every
iteration every node updates its local variable through combining neighboring
variables and solving an optimization subproblem. The proposed algorithm,
called as COmmunication-censored Linearized ADMM (COLA), leverages a
linearization technique to reduce the iteration-wise computation cost of ADMM
and uses a communication-censoring strategy to alleviate the communication
cost. To be specific, COLA introduces successive linearization approximations
to the local cost functions such that the resultant computation is first-order
and light-weight. Since the linearization technique slows down the convergence
speed, COLA further adopts the communication-censoring strategy to avoid
transmissions of less informative messages. A node is allowed to transmit only
if the distance between the current local variable and its previously
transmitted one is larger than a censoring threshold. COLA is proven to be
convergent when the local cost functions have Lipschitz continuous gradients
and the censoring threshold is summable. When the local cost functions are
further strongly convex, we establish the linear (sublinear) convergence rate
of COLA, given that the censoring threshold linearly (sublinearly) decays to 0.
Numerical experiments corroborate with the theoretical findings and demonstrate
the satisfactory communication-computation tradeoff of COLA.

also study the adversarial robustness of trained models by leveraging the

platform study unveils that the migration and quantization still suffer from
compatibility and reliability issues. Meanwhile, we find several DL software

the sociodemographic variables was performed by groups of cause of death, the
life table by sex and years of potential life lost (APVP) for each year group
and cause of death was calculated. Results: External causes and assaults,
homicides, as the main cause of death occurs during the decade of study, and
especially in men, which had higher mortality rates, more likely to die and
less life expectancy during the period. On average men and external causes
showed a higher number of potential years of life lost for the years 2001-2010
life. Conclusions: Men have higher mortality rates over the decade, as external
causes, assaults, murders, and a greater proportion of young men. The causes of
death that bring more potential years of life lost are external causes. Life
expectancy at birth and throughout the decade is greater for women than it is
therefore essential for men, that the municipality analyze the current
situation of these causes of death, and to be carried out public policies that
contribute to its decline and hence to improve the life expectancy of the
population.

B\,1422+231, sizes from the two methods are consistent with each other, e.g.
$R_X^{hard}/R_G = 6.17\pm5.48 \text{ (Bayesian), } 11.81\pm3.75 \text{ (maximum

more frequently sampled data with better signal-to-noise ratio are needed to
measure the source size for these two objects. Comparing the acquired size
values with the radio-quiet sample in the literature we found that our results
are consistent with X-ray source size scaling approximately as $R_X \propto
M_{BH}$ with the mass of the central supermassive black hole. Our results also
indicate that radio-loud quasars tend to have larger unresolved X-ray emission

remarkable quantum effects lack of comprehensive understanding, and an exotic

the key ingredient. Another essential substance is the phonons stemming from
intra- and inter-molecular vibrations, and the relevant diagonal
electron-phonon couplings give rise to spatial localization and the
off-diagonal couplings refer to the dispersion of electron wavefunctions. In
this work, we first propose a toy model based upon the fracton physics to
phenomenologically unveil the coherent motion of CT excitons followed by
resonant phonons in the aggregates. Based on this model, a generic scenario of
hierarchical quantum effects is described in various material systems. To
examine whether the fracton model can be applicable in practice, we calculate
the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a quantum dynamic measurement of the
entanglement entropy, of CT excitons by the adaptive time-dependent density
matrix renormalization group algorithm. On the basis of three commonly-used
realistic models in organic materials with two competing interactions taking
into account, we investigate the irreducible roles of CT excitons and aggregate
phonons in the ultrafast charge transfer, the coherent polaron hopping, and the
dissociation of triplet pairs, respectively. Our theory unifies the charge,
exciton, spin and phonons into a single framework, which may help clarify the

method for evaluating the dispersion relation of SPP from the position of a dip
in the reflection spectrum. However, recent studies have shown that the dips
are displaced from SPP resonance because they are produced by a type of Fano
resonance, i.e., the interference between the resonant reflection process
accompanied by resonant excitation of SPP and the direct reflection process
without resonant excitation. This result suggests that the system properties
difficult to be achieved in the dispersion relation of SPP can be characterized
using the ATR method. In this study, we investigate the effect of surface
roughness due to nanosized dimples created in the initial stage of pitting
corrosion on the ATR spectrum, from the viewpoint of Fano resonance. Using the
temporal coupled-mode method, it is shown that the Fano resonance in ATR is
caused by the phase change of direct reflection because of the absorption on
the metal surface, and the spectral shape is determined by this phase, along
with the ratio of the external (radiative) decay rate to the total decay rate
of the resonant mode. Moreover, it is clarified that the internal and external
decay rates extracted from the ATR spectrum provide information on corrosion,
such as the effective thickness of the metal film and the randomness in dimple
distribution.

monomers to Earth-sized bodies outside the ""snow line"", located several parsecs
from SMBHs in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In contrast to
protoplanetary disks, the ""radial drift barrier"" does not prevent the formation
of planetesimals. In the early phase of the evolution, low collision velocity
between dust particles promotes sticking; therefore, the internal density of
the dust aggregates decreases with growth. When the porous aggregate's size
reaches 0.1--1 cm, the collisional compression becomes effective, and the
decrease in internal density stops. Once 10--100 m sized aggregates are formed,
they are decoupled from gas turbulence, and the aggregate layer becomes
gravitationally unstable, leading to the formation of planets by the
fragmentation of the layer, with ten times the mass of the earth. The growth
time scale depends on the turbulent strength of the circumnuclear disk and the
black hole mass $M_{BH}$, and it is comparable to the AGN's lifetime ($\sim
10^8$ yr) for low mass ($M_{BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) SMBHs.

appropriate antenna. In this new criterion, the antenna selection is modeled as
a multi-objective optimization problem. Here, the antennas which simultaneously
minimizes interference channel gain and maximizes uplink (UL) and downlink (DL)
channel gains are selected for transmission and reception. The base station has
to perform well in both the UL and DL and reduce the self-interference
simultaneously. Therefore, the multi-objective criterion has a better
performance than the single-objective criterion. Although, in conventional
antenna selection with the single-objective criterion, only the function of the
UL and DL channels or the interference channel is considered. Finally, the

the object to immobilize it while keeping it from getting damaged. Soft robotic
hands have been proposed for safe grasping due to their passive compliance, but
even such a hand can crush objects if the applied force is too high. Thus for
safe grasping, regulating the grasping force is of uttermost importance even
with soft hands. In this work, we present a force controlled soft hand and use
it to achieve safe grasping. To this end, resistive force and bend sensors are
integrated in a soft hand, and a data-driven calibration method is proposed to
estimate contact interaction forces. Given the force readings, the pneumatic
pressures are regulated using a proportional-integral controller to achieve
desired force. The controller is experimentally evaluated and benchmarked by
grasping easily deformable objects such as plastic and paper cups without
neither dropping nor deforming them. Together, the results demonstrate that our
force controlled soft hand can grasp deformable objects in a safe yet stable
manner.

proteins leading to denaturation. In contrast, Choline Chloride (ChCl) and
urea, in 1:2 molar ratio form a deep eutectic mixture, a liquid at room
temperature and protect proteins from denaturation. In order to get a
microscopic picture of this phenomenon, we perform extensive all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations on a model protein HP-36. Based on our calculation of
Kirkwood-Buff integrals, we analyze the relative accumulation of these
osmolytes around the protein. Additional insights are drawn from the analyses
of the translational and rotational dynamics of solvent molecules and also from
the hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions. In the presence of urea, water
shows slow subdiffusive dynamics around the protein backbone as a consequence
of stronger interaction of water molecules with the backbone atoms. Urea also
shows subdiffusive motion. Addition of choline further slows down the dynamics
of urea restricting its inclusion around the protein backbone. Adding to this,
choline molecules in the first solvation shell of the protein shows the
strongest subdiffusive behavior. In other words, ChCl behaves as a nano-crowder
by excluding urea from the protein backbone and thereby slowing down the
dynamics of the water layer around the protein. This prevents the protein from
denaturation and makes it structurally rigid which in turn is supported by the
smaller radius of gyration and root mean square deviation values of HP-36 when
ChCl is present in the system.

the Nash equilibria and the best response functions of the resulting game. We

throughput, extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has
great potential to be one of the key technologies for the next generation
wireless communication systems. However, in practice, when the antenna
dimensions grow large, spatial non-stationarities occur and users will only see
a portion of the base station antenna array, which we call visibility region
(VR). To assess the impact of spatial non-stationarities, in this paper, we
investigate the uplink transmission of extra-large scale massive MIMO systems
by considering VRs. In particular, we first propose a subarray-based system
architecture for extra-large scale massive MIMO systems. Then, tight
closed-form uplink spectral efficiency (SE) approximations with linear
receivers are derived. With the objective of maximizing the achievable SE, we
also propose schemes for the subarray phase coefficient design. In addition,
based on the obtained ergodic achievable SE approximations, two statistical
channel state information (CSI)-based greedy user scheduling algorithms are
developed. Our results indicate that the statistical CSI-based greedy joint
user and subarray scheduling algorithm collaborating with the on-off
switch-based subarray architecture is a promising practical solution for
extra-large scale massive MIMO systems.

this paper, we propose a novel framework which queries the KB in two steps to

the observation that a response can usually be supported by a single KB row, we
introduce a KB retrieval component which explicitly returns the most relevant
KB row given a dialogue history. The retrieval result is further used to filter
the irrelevant entities in a Seq2Seq response generation model to improve the
consistency among the output entities. In the second step, we further perform
the attention mechanism to address the most correlated KB column. Two methods
are proposed to make the training feasible without labeled retrieval data,

two publicly available task oriented dialog datasets show the effectiveness of
our model by outperforming the baseline systems and producing entity-consistent

slice direction and lower contrast, due to a relatively small signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) than those from high field (typically 1.5T and 3T). We adapt the
recent idea of Image Quality Transfer (IQT) to enhance very low-field
structural images aiming to estimate the resolution, spatial coverage, and
contrast of high-field images. Analogous to many learning-based image
enhancement techniques, IQT generates training data from high-field scans alone
by simulating low-field images through a pre-defined decimation model. However,
the ground truth decimation model is not well-known in practice, and lack of
its specification can bias the trained model, aggravating performance on the
real low-field scans. In this paper we propose a probabilistic decimation
simulator to improve robustness of model training. It is used to generate and
augment various low-field images whose parameters are random variables and
sampled from an empirical distribution related to tissue-specific SNR on a
0.36T scanner. The probabilistic decimation simulator is model-agnostic, that
is, it can be used with any super-resolution networks. Furthermore we propose a
variant of U-Net architecture to improve its learning performance. We show
promising qualitative results from clinical low-field images confirming the
strong efficacy of IQT in an important new application area: epilepsy diagnosis
in sub-Saharan Africa where only low-field scanners are normally available.

continuous component evolves according to semiflows, which are switched at the
jump times of a Poisson process. The associated Markov chain describes the
states of this process directly after the jumps. Certain ergodic properties of
these two objects have already been investigated in our recent papers. We now
aim to establish the law of the iterated logarithm for the aforementioned
continuous-time process. Moreover, we intend to do this using the already
proven properties of the discrete-time system. The abstract model under

described by classical nucleation theory (CNT). However, recently an increasing
number of systems displaying such a transition have not been successfully
modelled by CNT. The delayed crystallization of phospholipids upon
super-cooling is an interesting case, since the extended timescales allow
access into the dynamics. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable behavior of
the long-lived metastable liquid-crystalline phase of
dilauroyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DLPE), arranged in multi-lamellar vesicles,
and the ensuing cooperative transition to the crystalline state.
Experimentally, we find that the delay in crystallization is a bulk phenomenon,
which is tunable and can be manipulated to span two orders of magnitude in time
by changing the quenching temperature, solution salinity, or adding a secondary
phospholipid. Our results reveal the robust persistence of the metastability,
and showcase the apparent deviation from CNT. This distinctive suppression of
the transition may be explained by the resistance of the multi-lamellar vesicle
to deformations caused by nucleated crystalline domains. Since phospholipids
are used as a platform for drug-delivery, a programmable design of cargo hold
and release can be of great benefit.

quantum walk on a graph with floating vertices. This effect is a completely

using the variational autoencoder (VAE). Though it can handle many-to-many
voice conversion without the parallel training, the VAE based voice conversion
methods suffer from low sound qualities of the converted speech. One of the
major reasons is because the VAE learns only the self-reconstruction path. The
conversion path is not trained at all. In this paper, we propose a cycle
consistency loss for VAE to explicitly learn the conversion path. In addition,
we propose to use multiple decoders to further improve the sound qualities of
the conventional VAE based voice conversion methods. The effectiveness of the

as the critical point is approached from the absorbing phase. By using cluster
analysis tools from percolation theory, we characterize the critical properties

characterizing the avalanche distributions and divergence of the response

a universal scaling function for the avalanche profile to find that the firing

appropriate rescaling. We also find data collapse for the avalanche
distribution functions, which is stronger evidence of criticality than just the
existence of power laws. Critical slowing-down and power law relaxation of

Such angled MLMs exhibit a selective response to circularly polarized light, in

community of imitation learning, ranging from parametric to non-parametric,

Meanwhile, ample applications (e.g., grasping tasks and human-robot

human skills in unconstrained environment, the problem of learning constrained
motor skills, however, has not received equal attention yet. In fact,

technique used to partition a given view-sequence map into place classes (i.e.,
map segments) so that each class has good place-specific training images for a
visual place classifier (VPC). Existing approaches to MS implicitly/explicitly
suppose that map segments have a certain size, or individual map segments are
balanced in size. However, recent VPR systems showed that very small important
map segments (minimal map segments) often suffice for VPC, and the remaining
large unimportant portion of the map should be discarded to minimize map
maintenance cost. Here, a new MS algorithm that can mine minimal map segments
from a large view-sequence map is presented. To solve the inherently NP hard
problem, MS is formulated as a video-segmentation problem and the efficient
point-trajectory based paradigm of video segmentation is used. The proposed map
representation was implemented with three types of VPC: deep convolutional
neural network, bag-of-words, and object class detector, and each was
integrated into a Monte Carlo localization algorithm (MCL) within a topometric
VPR framework. Experiments using the publicly available NCLT dataset thoroughly
investigate the efficacy of MS in terms of VPR performance.

presence of a static electromagnetic field in which the interaction of the
magnetic field with both the orbital and spin moments is explicitly considered.
The theory is described from a new perspective, viz. that of the individual
electron via its equation of motion or `Quantal Newtonian' first law. The law
leads to new physical and mathematical insights into the theory. The law is in
terms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantum mechanical expectation
values of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the system wave function.
The law states that each electron experiences an external and an internal
field, the sum of which vanish. The external field is the sum of the
electrostatic and a Lorentz field. The internal field is a sum of fields: the
electron-interaction, differential density, kinetic, and internal magnetic
fields. These fields are respectively representative of a property of the
system: electron correlations due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb
repulsion, the electron density, kinetic effects, and the physical current
density. The energy components can be expressed in integral virial form in
terms of these fields. The law leads to the further understanding that the
Hamiltonian is an exactly known and universal functional of the wave function.
This allows for the generalization of the SP equation, which then proves it to
be intrinsically self-consistent. A Quantal density functional (local effective
potential) theory of the SP system is developed. Further generalizations of the
present work to the temporal case, and relativistic Dirac theory are proposed.

The way we narrate a story often comprises of two stages, which are, forming a
central mind map of entities and then weaving a story around them. A
contributing factor to coherence is not just basing the story on these entities
but also, referring to them using appropriate terms to avoid repetition. In
this paper, we address these two stages of introducing the right entities at
seemingly reasonable junctures and also referring them coherently in the
context of visual storytelling. The building blocks of the central mind map,
also known as entity skeleton are entity chains including nominal and
coreference expressions. This entity skeleton is also represented in different
levels of abstractions to compose a generalized frame to weave the story. We
build upon an encoder-decoder framework to penalize the model when the decoded
story does not adhere to this entity skeleton. We establish a strong baseline
for skeleton informed generation and then extend this to have the capability of
multitasking by predicting the skeleton in addition to generating the story.
Finally, we build upon this model and propose a glocal hierarchical attention
model that attends to the skeleton both at the sentence (local) and the story
(global) levels. We observe that our proposed models outperform the baseline in
terms of automatic evaluation metric, METEOR. We perform various analysis
targeted to evaluate the performance of our task of enforcing the entity
skeleton such as the number and diversity of the entities generated. We also
conduct human evaluation from which it is concluded that the visual stories
generated by our model are preferred 82% of the times. In addition, we show
that our glocal hierarchical attention model improves coherence by introducing
