Cruise Controller in a PTV VISSIM microsimulation environment. We dissect our
controller into two parts: 1. the anticipative mode, more immediately
beneficial when automated vehicle fleet penetration is low, and 2. the
connected mode, beneficial in coordinated car-following scenarios and high
automated vehicle penetrations appropriate for autonomous vehicle specific
applications. Probabilistic constraints handle safety considerations, and
vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use
of powertrain maps. Real traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway
distributions from traffic data. To study impact over a range of demands, we
vary input vehicle volume from low to high and then vary automated vehicle
penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios,
network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as
rush-hour traffic. We further find that with automated vehicles introduced
which utilize probabilistic constraints to balance safety and traffic
compactness, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume
scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for
conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles
perform at a 10% - 20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when
considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform
at a 3% - 9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering
electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic
flow, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with
automated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10% more
energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.

extension to the proposed scheme, distance-based formation centroid maneuvering
is also studied for disturbance-free agents, in which the formation centroid
tracks a desired time-varying velocity. The proposed control laws are
decentralized, in the sense that each agent employs local relative information
regarding its neighbors to calculate its control signal. Therefore, the control
scheme is implementable on the agents' local coordinate frames. Using rigid
graph theory, input-to-state stability, and Lyapunov based analysis, the
results are established for minimally and infinitesimally rigid formations in
2-D or 3-D space. Furthermore, it is argued that the proposed approach
increases formation robustness against shape distortions and can prevent
formation convergence to incorrect shapes, which is likely to happen in
conventional distance-based formation control methods. Finally, extensive
simulation studies clarify and verify the proposed approach.

  exploring the tidal screening theory",,,"10.1093/mnras/staa075",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical theories for the stellar initial mass function (IMF) predict a peak
mass which scales with the properties of the molecular cloud. In this work, we
explore a new theory proposed by Lee & Hennebelle (2018). The idea is that the
tidal field around first Larson cores prevents the formation of other
collapsing clumps within a certain radius. The protostar can then freely
accrete the gas within this radius. This leads to a peak mass of roughly $10 \,
M_{\mathrm{1LC}}$, independent of the parent cloud properties. Using simple
analytical arguments, we derive a collapse condition for clumps located close
to a protostar. We then study the tidal field and the corresponding collapse
condition using a series of numerical simulations. We find that the tidal field
around protostars is indeed strong enough to prevent clumps from collapsing
unless they have high enough densities. For each newly formed protostar, we
determine the region in which tidal screening is dominant. We call this the
tidal bubble. The mass within this bubble is our estimate for the final mass of
the star. Using this formalism, we are able to construct a very good prediction
for the final IMF in our simulations. Not only do we correctly predict the
peak, but we are also able to reproduced the high and low mass end of the IMF.
We conclude that tidal forces are important in determining the final mass of a
star and might be the dominant effect in setting the peak mass of the IMF.

given a set of images captured from the same viewing angle, but under unknown,
varying illumination. While the theoretical foundations of this inverse problem
under directional lighting are well-established, there is a lack of
mathematical evidence for the uniqueness of a solution under general lighting.
On the other hand, stable and accurate heuristical solutions of uncalibrated
photometric stereo under such general lighting have recently been proposed. The
quality of the results demonstrated therein tends to indicate that the problem
may actually be well-posed, but this still has to be established. The present
paper addresses this theoretical issue, considering first-order spherical
harmonics approximation of general lighting. Two important theoretical results
are established. First, the orthographic integrability constraint ensures
uniqueness of a solution up to a global concave-convex ambiguity, which had
already been conjectured, yet not proven. Second, the perspective integrability
constraint makes the problem well-posed, which generalizes a previous result
limited to directional lighting. Eventually, a closed-form expression for the
unique least-squares solution of the problem under perspective projection is
provided, allowing numerical simulations on synthetic data to empirically
validate our findings.

  Intersection Number",,,,,"cs.CG cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A family of closed simple (i.e., Jordan) curves is $m$-intersecting if any
pair of its curves have at most $m$ points of common intersection. We say that
a pair of such curves touch if they intersect at a single point of common
tangency. In this work we show that any $m$-intersecting family of $n$ Jordan
curves in general position in the plane contains
$O\left(n^{2-\frac{1}{3m+15}}\right)$ touching pairs
  Furthermore, we use the string separator theorem of Fox and Pach in order to
establish the following Crossing Lemma for contact graphs of Jordan curves: Let
$\Gamma$ be an $m$-intersecting family of closed Jordan curves in general
position in the plane with exactly $T=\Omega(n)$ touching pairs of curves, then
the curves of $\Gamma$ determine
$\Omega\left(T\cdot\left(\frac{T}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{9m+45}}\right)$
intersection points.
  This extends the similar bounds that were previously established by Salazar
for the special case of pairwise intersecting (and $m$-intersecting) curves.
Specializing to the case at hand, this substantially improves the bounds that
were recently derived by Pach, Rubin and Tardos for arbitrary families of
Jordan curves.

serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's

harmonic mitigation is a planning procedure of high complexity. Since filter
placement discounting the overall system response may deteriorate harmonic
conditions at remote buses due to frequency characteristics alteration. The
stochastic behavior of harmonic loads demands adequate models and calculations.
The interlinked topology of a transmission system also necessitates an
extensive system-wide study. This paper presents an analytical methodology for
determining the appropriate number, location, and parameters of C-Type passive
filters in a transmission system to improve the overall harmonic condition. The
proposed strategy targets minimizing the expected value of a system-wide index

voltage distortions to the standard levels prescribed by IEEE Std. 519 and
satisfying the fundamental power flow constraints. A restricted hierarchical
direct search algorithm is utilized to find the near global solution whose

in financial networks harbor a great threat for the stability of the entire
system. Without sufficient capital requirements for banks and other financial
institutions, shocks that are locally confined at first can spread through the
entire system and be significantly amplified by various contagion channels. The
aim of this thesis is thus to investigate in detail two selected contagion
channels of this so-called systemic risk, provide mathematical models and
derive consequences for the systemic risk management of financial institutions.
The first contagion channel we consider is default contagion. The underlying
effect is here that insolvent institutions cannot service their debt or other
financial obligations anymore - at least partially. Debtors and other directly
impacted parties in the system are thus forced to write off their losses and
can possibly be driven into insolvency themselves due to their incurred
financial losses. This on the other hand starts a new round in the default
contagion process. In our model we simplistically describe each institution by
all the financial positions it is exposed to as well as its initial capital. In
doing so, our starting point is the work of Detering et al. (2017) - a model
for contagion in unweighted networks - which particularly considers the exact
network configuration to be random and derives asymptotic results for large
networks. We extend this model such that weighted networks can be considered
and an application to financial networks becomes possible. More precisely, for
any given initial shock we deduce an explicit asymptotic expression for the
total damage caused in the system by contagion and provide a necessary and
sufficient criterion for an unshocked financial system to be stable against
small shocks. Moreover, ...

critical importance for algorithm designs. In this paper, we first present a
simple example in MFCs with learning where DPP fails with a mis-specified Q
function; and then propose the correct form of Q function in an appropriate

from the classical one and is called the IQ function. In the special case when
the transition probability and the reward are independent of the mean-field
information, it integrates the classical Q function for single-agent RL over
the state-action distribution. In other words, MFCs with learning can be viewed
as lifting the classical RLs by replacing the state-action space with its
probability distribution space. This identification of the IQ function enables
us to establish precisely the DPP in the learning framework of MFCs. Finally,
we illustrate through numerical experiments the time consistency of this IQ

$\ell_2$ distance criteria. The proposed sparse classifiers perform
simultaneous classification and feature selection, by detecting the features
that are most relevant for the classification purpose. We show that training of
the proposed sparse models, with both distance criteria, can be performed
exactly (i.e., the globally optimal set of features is selected) and at a
quasi-linear computational cost. The experimental results show that the
proposed methods are competitive in accuracy with state-of-the-art feature
selection techniques, while having a significantly lower computational cost.

  Convolutional Networks","Published in NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently received wide attentions,
due to their successful applications in different graph tasks and different
domains. Training GCNs for a large graph, however, is still a challenge.
Original full-batch GCN training requires calculating the representation of all
the nodes in the graph per GCN layer, which brings in high computation and
memory costs. To alleviate this issue, several sampling-based methods have been
proposed to train GCNs on a subset of nodes. Among them, the node-wise
neighbor-sampling method recursively samples a fixed number of neighbor nodes,
and thus its computation cost suffers from exponential growing neighbor size;
while the layer-wise importance-sampling method discards the neighbor-dependent
constraints, and thus the nodes sampled across layer suffer from sparse
connection problem. To deal with the above two problems, we propose a new
effective sampling algorithm called LAyer-Dependent ImportancE Sampling
(LADIES). Based on the sampled nodes in the upper layer, LADIES selects their
neighborhood nodes, constructs a bipartite subgraph and computes the importance
probability accordingly. Then, it samples a fixed number of nodes by the
calculated probability, and recursively conducts such procedure per layer to
construct the whole computation graph. We prove theoretically and
experimentally, that our proposed sampling algorithm outperforms the previous
sampling methods in terms of both time and memory costs. Furthermore, LADIES is
shown to have better generalization accuracy than original full-batch GCN, due
to its stochastic nature.

stars. Specifically, the BBN epoch is characterized by a dilute baryon plasma
for which the velocity distribution of nuclei is mainly determined by the
dominant Coulomb elastic scattering with mildly relativistic electrons. One
must therefore deduce the momentum distribution for reacting nuclei from the
multi-component relativistic Boltzmann equation. However, the full
multi-component relativistic Boltzmann equation has only recently been analyzed

We also derive a Langevin model and perform relativistic Monte-Carlo
simulations which clarify the baryon distribution during BBN and can be used to
analyze any relaxation from a non-thermal injection. We show by these analyses
that the thermalization process leads to a nuclear distribution function that

characteristics of systems that can act as building blocks of massive galaxies.
This paper discusses the history of star formation and gas flows (inflow and
outflow) of a dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group, NGC 6822, from the
viewpoint of gas-phase and stellar chemical abundance. Gas-phase oxygen
abundance, stellar metallicity distribution and gas fraction data are compared
to chemical evolution models in which continuous star formation and gas flows
are assumed. If the galaxy is assumed to be a closed or an accretion-dominated
system where steeper stellar initial mass functions are allowed, the observed
gas-phase oxygen abundance and gas fraction can be explained simultaneously;
however metallicity distributions predicted by the models seem to be
inconsistent with the observed distribution, which suggests that the star
formation, gas flows and/or chemical enrichment are more complex than assumed
by the models. When NGC 6822 is assumed to be a system dominated by outflow,
the observed values of gas-phase oxygen abundance and gas fraction can be
explained, and the metallicity distributions predicted by some of the models
are also roughly consistent with the observed distribution in the metallicity
range of -2.0<[Fe/H]<-0.5. It should be noted that this result does not
necessarily mean that the accretion of gas is completely ruled out. More
observables, such as chemical abundance ratios, and detailed modelling may
provide deeper insight into the evolution of the system.

construct a new type of geometry using a scalar field, f, on the cotangent
bundle of a differentiable manifold, M. This new geometry will be called
Lorentzian Cofinsler geometry. This geometry will enable me to use the second
vertical derivatives of f, along with the differential of the scalar field, phi
on M, to construct a Lorentzian metric tensor on M, that depends upon phi. f
will be chosen so that the resultant metric on M has the form of a FLRW metric,
with the t equal constant slices being flat. When the Horndeski Lagrangians are
evaluated for this choice of geometry the quartic and quintic Lagrangians are
of third order, but reduce to non-degenerate second-order Lagrangians plus a
divergence. Upon varying phi in these ""scalarized"" Horndeski Lagrangians,
equations will be obtained which admit self-inflating universe solutions,
provided that the coefficient functions appearing in the Horndeski Lagrangians
are chosen suitably. This approach is also used to study solutions of the most
general conformally invariant scalar-tensor field theory which is flat space
compatible (i.e., such that the Lagrangians of the field theory are
well-defined when either the space is flat or the scalar field is constant).
There too the coefficient functions can be chosen to give self-inflating
universes. Arguments will be presented to show that it is possible to construct
model universes that begin explosively, and then settle down to a period of
much quieter acceleration which either continues forever, or stops and
collapses to the models original, pre-expansion, state.

uniformly random order, and we want to choose a single item, or a set of size
$K$. The random order model allows us to escape from the strong lower bounds
for the adversarial order setting, and excellent algorithms are known in this
setting. However, one worrying aspect of these results is that the algorithms
overfit to the model: they are not very robust. Indeed, if a few ""outlier""
arrivals are adversarially placed in the arrival sequence, the algorithms
perform poorly. E.g., Dynkin's popular $1/e$-secretary algorithm fails with
even a single adversarial arrival.
  We investigate a robust version of the secretary problem. In the Byzantine
Secretary model, we have two kinds of elements: green (good) and red (rogue).
The values of all elements are chosen by the adversary. The green elements
arrive at times uniformly randomly drawn from $[0,1]$. The red elements,
however, arrive at adversarially chosen times. Naturally, the algorithm does
not see these colors: how well can it solve secretary problems?
  We give algorithms which get value comparable to the value of the optimal
green set minus the largest green item. Specifically, we give an algorithm to
pick $K$ elements that gets within $(1-\varepsilon)$ factor of the above
benchmark, as long as $K \geq \mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1} \log n)$. We
extend this to the knapsack secretary problem, for large knapsack size $K$.
  For the single-item case, an analogous benchmark is the value of the
second-largest green item. For value-maximization, we give a $\mathrm{poly}
\log^* n$-competitive algorithm, using a multi-layered bucketing scheme that
adaptively refines our estimates of second-max over time. For
probability-maximization, we show the existence of a good randomized algorithm,

and develop several methods using either primal or dual approach to solve it.
In the primal case, we use a special penalization technique to make the initial
problem more convenient for using optimization methods. We propose algorithms
to solve it based on Similar Triangles Method with Inexact Proximal Step for
the convex smooth and strongly convex smooth objective functions and methods
based on Gradient Sliding algorithm to solve the same problems in the
non-smooth case. We prove the convergence guarantees in the smooth convex case
with deterministic first-order oracle.
  We propose and analyze three novel methods to handle stochastic convex
optimization problems with affine constraints: SPDSTM, R-RRMA-AC-SA$^2$, and
SSTM_sc. All methods use stochastic dual oracle. SPDSTM is the stochastic
primal-dual modification of STM and it is applied for the dual problem when the
primal functional is strongly convex and Lipschitz continuous on some ball. We
extend the result from Dvinskikh & Gasnikov (2019) for this method to the case
when only biased stochastic oracle is available. R-RRMA-AC-SA$^2$ is an
accelerated stochastic method based on the restarts of RRMA-AC-SA$^2$ from
Foster et al. (2019) and SSTM_sc is just stochastic STM for strongly convex
problems. Both methods are applied to the dual problem when the primal
functional is strongly convex, smooth, and Lipschitz continuous on some ball
and use stochastic dual first-order oracle. We develop convergence analysis for
these methods for unbiased and biased oracles respectively.
  Finally, we apply all the aforementioned results and approaches to solve the
decentralized distributed optimization problem and discuss the optimality of
the obtained results in terms of communication rounds and the number of oracle
calls per node.

At the lower layer, for each user, different appliances are scheduled for
energy consumption. For enegy provider, different generators are utilized for
energy generation. At the upper level, with the supplier acting as a leader and
the users acting as followers, a Stackelberg dynamic game is used to capture
the interaction among the energy provider and the users where the energy
provider and the users care only about their own cost. We analyze the
one-leader-N-followers Stackelberg dynamic game and characterize the
Stackelberg equilibrium. We provide a closed-form Nash solution of the optimal

that the KH instability-driven turbulence has a quasi-2D nature. The validity

  Abstract",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms continue to rival human
performance on a variety of clinical tasks, the question of how best to
incorporate these algorithms into clinical workflows remains relatively
unexplored. We investigated how AI can affect pathologist performance on the
task of differentiating between two subtypes of primary liver cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). We developed an AI
diagnostic assistant using a deep learning model and evaluated its effect on
the diagnostic performance of eleven pathologists with varying levels of
expertise. Our deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 0.885 on an internal
validation set of 26 slides and an accuracy of 0.842 on an independent test set
of 80 slides. Despite having high accuracy on a hold out test set, the
diagnostic assistant did not significantly improve performance across
pathologists (p-value: 0.184, OR: 1.287 (95% CI 0.886, 1.871)). Model
correctness was observed to significantly bias the pathologist decisions. When
the model was correct, assistance significantly improved accuracy across all
pathologist experience levels and for all case difficulty levels (p-value: <
0.001, OR: 4.289 (95% CI 2.360, 7.794)). When the model was incorrect,
assistance significantly decreased accuracy across all 11 pathologists and for
all case difficulty levels (p-value < 0.001, OR: 0.253 (95% CI 0.126, 0.507)).
Our results highlight the challenges of translating AI models to the clinical
setting, especially for difficult subspecialty tasks such as tumor
classification. In particular, they suggest that incorrect model predictions
could strongly bias an expert's diagnosis, an important factor to consider when
designing medical AI-assistance systems.

at the root, and recurse on the subfunctions $f_{x_i=0}$ and $f_{x_i=1}$ on the
left and right subtrees respectively; terminate once the tree is an
$\varepsilon$-approximation of $f$. We analyze the quality of this heuristic,
obtaining near-matching upper and lower bounds:
  $\circ$ Upper bound: For every $f$ with decision tree size $s$ and every
$\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$, this heuristic builds a decision tree of size
at most $s^{O(\log(s/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))}$.
  $\circ$ Lower bound: For every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$ and $s \le

this heuristic builds a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$.
  We also obtain upper and lower bounds for monotone functions:
$s^{O(\sqrt{\log s}/\varepsilon)}$ and $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt[4]{\log s } )}$
respectively. The lower bound disproves conjectures of Fiat and Pechyony (2004)
and Lee (2009).
  Our upper bounds yield new algorithms for properly learning decision trees
under the uniform distribution. We show that these algorithms---which are
motivated by widely employed and empirically successful top-down decision tree
learning heuristics such as ID3, C4.5, and CART---achieve provable guarantees
that compare favorably with those of the current fastest algorithm (Ehrenfeucht
and Haussler, 1989). Our lower bounds shed new light on the limitations of
these heuristics.
  Finally, we revisit the classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler. We extend
it to give the first uniform-distribution proper learning algorithm that
achieves polynomial sample and memory complexity, while matching its
state-of-the-art quasipolynomial runtime.

distribution (or a $k$-wise independent distribution over its marginals for
small $k$). We propose the problem of enumerating/list-decoding all large
subcubes where the distribution $\psi$ deviates markedly from what we expect;
we refer to such subcubes as skewed subcubes. Skewed subcubes are certificates
of dependencies between small subsets of variables in $\psi$. We motivate this
problem by showing that it arises naturally in the context of algorithmic
fairness and anomaly detection.
  In this work we focus on the special but important case where the space is
the Boolean hypercube, and the expected marginals are uniform. We show that the
obvious definition of skewed subcubes can lead to intractable list sizes, and
propose a better definition of a minimal skewed subcube, which are subcubes
whose skew cannot be attributed to a larger subcube that contains it. Our main
technical contribution is a list-size bound for this definition and an
algorithm to efficiently find all such subcubes. Both the bound and the
algorithm rely on Fourier-analytic techniques, especially the powerful
hypercontractive inequality.
  On the lower bounds side, we show that finding skewed subcubes is as hard as
the sparse noisy parity problem, and hence our algorithms cannot be improved on
substantially without a breakthrough on this problem which is believed to be
intractable. Motivated by this, we study alternate models allowing query access
to $\psi$ where finding skewed subcubes might be easier.

metrics, these techniques in general lack transparency and decision reasoning,
i.e., explaining why the input set of images is similar or dissimilar. In this
work, we solve this key problem by proposing the first method to generate
generic visual similarity explanations with gradient-based attention. We
demonstrate that our technique is agnostic to the specific similarity model
type, e.g., we show applicability to Siamese, triplet, and quadruplet models.
Furthermore, we make our proposed similarity attention a principled part of the
learning process, resulting in a new paradigm for learning similarity
functions. We demonstrate that our learning mechanism results in more
generalizable, as well as explainable, similarity models. Finally, we
demonstrate the generality of our framework by means of experiments on a
variety of tasks, including image retrieval, person re-identification, and
low-shot semantic segmentation.

chordwise porosity distributions. The analysis considers a linearised porosity
boundary condition where the seepage velocity through the aerofoil is related
to the local pressure jump across the aerofoil surface and to the unsteady
characteristics of the porous medium. Application of the Plemelj formulae to
the resulting boundary value problem yields a singular Fredholm--Volterra
integral equation which does not admit an analytic solution. Accordingly, we
develop a numerical solution scheme by expanding the bound vorticity
distribution in terms of appropriate basis functions. Asymptotic analysis at
the leading- and trailing-edges reveals that the appropriate basis functions
are weighted Jacobi polynomials whose parameters are related to the porosity
distribution. The Jacobi polynomial basis enables the construction of a
numerical scheme that is accurate and rapid, in contrast to the standard choice
of Chebyshev basis functions that are shown to {be unsuitable} for porous
aerofoils. Applications of the numerical solution scheme to discontinuous
porosity profiles, quasi-static problems, and the separation of circulatory and
non-circulatory contributions are presented. Analogues to the classical
Theodorsen and Sears functions are computed numerically, which show that an
effect of trailing-edge porosity is to reduce the amount of vorticity shed into
the wake, thereby reducing the magnitude of the circulatory lift. {Fourier
transform inversion of these frequency-domain functions produces porous
extensions to the Wagner and K\""{u}ssner functions for transient aerofoil
motions or gust encounters, respectively.}

spatially localize individual spots of light, called phosphenes, by assigning
appropriate stimulating parameters to implanted electrodes. Imitating the
natural responses to phosphene-like stimuli at different positions can help in
designing a systematic procedure to determine these parameters. The key
characteristic of such a system is the ability to discriminate between
responses to different positions in the visual field. While most previous
prosthetic devices have targeted the primary visual cortex, the extrastriate
cortex has the advantage of covering a large part of the visual field with a
smaller amount of cortical tissue, providing the possibility of a more compact
implant. Here, we studied how well ensembles of Multiunit activity (MUA) and
Local Field Potentials (LFPs) responses from extrastriate cortical visual area
V4 of a behaving macaque monkey can discriminate between two-dimensional
spatial positions. We found that despite the large receptive field sizes in V4,
the combined responses from multiple sites, whether MUA or LFP, has the
capability for fine and coarse discrimination of positions. We identified a
selection procedure that could significantly increase the discrimination
performance while reducing the required number of electrodes. Analysis of noise
correlation in MUA and LFP responses showed that noise correlations in LFP
responses carry more information about the spatial positions. Overall, these
findings suggest that spatial positions could be localized with patterned
stimulation in extrastriate area V4.

with randomly switching topologies involves two random components (switching
times and choices of network topologies at switching instant). First, we allow
switching times for the network topology to be random so that the successive
increments are i.i.d. processes following the common probability distribution.
Second, at each switching instant, we choose a network topology randomly from a
finite set of admissible network topologies whose union contains a spanning
tree. Even for the fixed deterministic network topology, the CS ensemble may
not exhibit a mono-cluster flocking depending on the initial data and the decay
mode of the communication weight functions measuring the degree of interactions
between particles. For the flocking dynamics of the CS ensemble with these two
random components, we first use a priori conditions on the network topologies
and uniform boundedness of position diameter, and derive the flocking estimates
via matrix theory together with a priori conditions, and then replace the a
priori condition for the position diameter by some suitable condition on the
system parameters and communication weight. The a priori condition on the

surpassed human-level performance on diverse classification tasks. At the same
time, there is a stark need to characterize and quantify reliability of a
model's prediction on individual samples. This is especially true in
application of such models in safety-critical domains of industrial control and
healthcare. To address this need, we link the question of reliability of a
model's individual prediction to the epistemic uncertainty of the model's
prediction. More specifically, we extend the theory of Justified True Belief
(JTB) in epistemology, created to study the validity and limits of
human-acquired knowledge, towards characterizing the validity and limits of
knowledge in supervised classifiers. We present an analysis of neural network
classifiers linking the reliability of its prediction on an input to
characteristics of the support gathered from the input and latent spaces of the
network. We hypothesize that the JTB analysis exposes the epistemic uncertainty
(or ignorance) of a model with respect to its inference, thereby allowing for
the inference to be only as strong as the justification permits. We explore
various forms of support (for e.g., k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and l_p-norm
based) generated for an input, using the training data to construct a
justification for the prediction with that input. Through experiments conducted
on simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can provide
reliability for individual predictions and characterize regions where such
reliability cannot be ascertained.

capability and only needs several surface data for training, much less than
other learning-based reconstruction methods, which can effectively avoid
overfitting. The trained model of SSRNet on one dataset can be directly used on
other datasets with superior performance. Finally, the time consumption with
SSRNet on a large-scale point cloud is acceptable and competitive. To our
knowledge, the proposed SSRNet is the first to really bring a convincing
solution to the scalability issue of the learning-based surface reconstruction
methods, and is an important step to make learning-based methods competitive
with respect to geometry processing methods on real-world and challenging data.
Experiments show that our method achieves a breakthrough in scalability and
quality compared with state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

electronic wavefunctions that occupy it determine the functionality and the
topological nature of the superconducting state induced therein. Here we study
this buried interface by performing spectroscopic mappings of superconducting
aluminum islands epitaxially grown in-situ on indium arsenide nanowires. We
find unexpected robustness of the hybrid system as the direct contact with the
aluminum islands does not lead to any change in the chemical potential of the
nanowires, nor does it induce a significant band bending in their vicinity. We
attribute this to the presence of surface states bound to the facets of the
nanowire. Such surface states, that are present also in bare nanowires prior to
aluminum deposition, pin the Fermi-level thus rendering the nanowires resilient
to surface perturbations. The aluminum islands further display Coulomb blockade
gaps and peaks that signify the formation of a resistive tunneling barrier at
the InAs-Al interface. At low energies we identify a potential energy barrier
that further suppresses the transmittance through the interface. A
corresponding barrier exists in bare semiconductors between surface states and
the accumulation layer, induced to maintain charge neutrality. Our observations
elucidate the delicate interplay between the resistive nature of the InAs-Al
interface and the ability to proximitize superconductivity and tune the

computer vision and human-computer interaction. Although recent hand pose
estimation methods using convolution neural network (CNN) have shown notable
improvements in accuracy, most of them have a limitation that they rely on a
complex network structure without fully exploiting the articulated structure of
the hand. A hand, which is an articulated object, is composed of six local
parts: the palm and five independent fingers. Each finger consists of
sequential-joints that provide constrained motion, referred to as a kinematic
chain. In this paper, we propose a hierarchically-structured convolutional
recurrent neural network (HCRNN) with six branches that estimate the 3D
position of the palm and five fingers independently. The palm position is
predicted via fully-connected layers. Each sequential-joint, i.e. finger
position, is obtained using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the
spatial dependencies between adjacent joints. Then the output features of the
palm and finger branches are concatenated to estimate the global hand position.
HCRNN directly takes the depth map as an input without a time-consuming data
conversion, such as 3D voxels and point clouds. Experimental results on public
datasets demonstrate that the proposed HCRNN not only outperforms most 2D
CNN-based methods using the depth image as their inputs but also achieves
competitive results with state-of-the-art 3D CNN-based methods with a highly
efficient running speed of 285 fps on a single GPU.

strict preferences of every agent over the agents from the next agent set. A
weakly stable cyclic matching is a partition of the set of agents into disjoint
union of $r$-long cycles, one agent from each set per cycle, such that there
are no destabilizing $r$-long cycles, i.e. cycles in which every agent strictly
prefers its successor to its successor in the matching. Assuming that the
preferences are uniformly random and independent, we show that the expected
number of stable matchings grows with $n$ (cardinality of each agent set) as
$(n\log n)^{r-1}$. We also consider a bipartite stable matching problem where
preference list of each agent forms a partially ordered set. Each partial order
is an intersection of several, $k_i$ for side $i$, independent, uniformly
random, strict orders. For $k_1+k_2>2$, the expected number of stable matchings
is analyzed for three, progressively stronger, notions of stability. The
expected number of weakly stable matchings is shown to grow super-exponentially
fast. In contrast, for $\min(k_1,k_2)>1$, the fraction of instances with at
least one strongly stable (super-stable) matching is super-exponentially small.

acquire and reduce dimension of signals that admit sparse representations. This
is achieved by collecting linear, non-adaptive measurements of a signal, which
can be formalized as multiplying the signal with a ""measurement matrix"". If the
measurement satisfies the so-called restricted isometry property (RIP), then it
will be appropriate to be used in compressed sensing. While a wide class of
random matrices provably satisfy the RIP with high probability, explicit and
deterministic constructions have been shown (so far) to satisfy the RIP only in
a significantly suboptimal regime.
  In this paper, we propose two novel approaches for improving the RIP constant
estimates based on Gershgorin circle theorem for a specific deterministic
construction based on Paley tight frames, obtaining an improvement over the
Gershgorin bound by a multiplicative constant. In one approach we use a recent
result on the spectra of the skew-adjacency matrices of oriented graphs. In the
other approach, we use the so-called Dembo bounds on the extreme eigenvalues of
a positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix. We also generalize these bounds and
we combine the new bounds with a conjecture we make regarding the distribution
of quadratic residues in a finite field to provide a potential path to break
the so-called ""square-root barrier""-we provide a proof based on the assumption
that the conjecture holds.

information to improve recommendation performance, have caught more and more
attention in both academia and industry. How to predict user preferences from
diverse contextual features is the core of CARS. Several recent models pay
attention to user behaviors and use specifically designed structures to extract
adaptive user interests from history behaviors. However, few works take item
history interactions into consideration, which leads to the insufficiency of
item feature representation and item attraction extraction. From these
observations, we model the user-item interaction as a dynamic interaction graph
(DIG) and proposed a GNN-based model called Pairwise Interactive Graph
Attention Network (PIGAT) to capture dynamic user interests and item
attractions simultaneously. PIGAT introduces the attention mechanism to
consider the importance of each interacted user/item to both the user and the
item, which captures user interests, item attractions and their influence on
the recommendation context. Moreover, confidence embeddings are applied to
interactions to distinguish the confidence of interactions occurring at
different times. Then more expressive user/item representations and adaptive
interaction features are generated, which benefits the recommendation
performance especially when involving long-tail items. We conduct experiments

monogamy via entanglement measure inequalities, we introduce a state-dependent
set of free states to quantify the unextendibility of a bipartite quantum
state. First, we define a family of entanglement measures called
\textit{unextendible entanglement}. Given a bipartite state $\rho_{AB}$, the
key idea behind these measures is to minimize a divergence between $\rho_{AB}$
and any possible reduced state $\rho_{AB'}$ of an extension $\rho_{ABB'}$ of
$\rho_{AB}$. These measures are intuitively motivated by the fact that the more
that a bipartite state is entangled, the less that each of its individual
systems can be entangled with a third party. Second, we show that the
unextendible entanglement is an entanglement monotone under two-extendible
operations, which include local operations and one-way classical communication
as a special case. Unextendible entanglement has several other desirable
properties, including normalization and faithfulness. As practical
applications, we show that the unextendible entanglement provides efficiently
computable benchmarks for the rate of exact secret key distillation and
entanglement distillation and the overhead of probabilistic secret key or
entanglement distillation.

ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. As demonstrated, the
pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-MUSIC would be highly precise; and the
estimated AoA is almost as accurate as standard MUSIC. In contrast, our new

gravitational waves by the LIGO, the upper bound on the graviton mass $m_g$ is

arrival time of light and gravitational waves, lensing effects could be
important for some cases. Moreover, in many cases, the wavelength of
gravitational waves is comparable with the gravitational radius of a lens
object. Hence, we calculate arrival time differences between electromagnetic
waves and massive gravitational waves by taking into account the effect of the
gravitational wave optics. Here we take two lens models, a point mass lens and
a singular isothermal sphere lens. We find that the lensing changes the arrival

results in the expansion of the opening cone in which the shocked pulsar wind

of instructions, and an archive of files. Layers allow Docker to separate a
large build task into smaller ones, such that when a part of the program is
changed, only the corresponding layer needs to be changed. Yet the current
implementation has major inefficiencies that make the rebuilding of an image
unnecessarily slow when changes in bottom layers are required: uneven content
distribution amongst layers, the need to rebuild an entire layer during update,
and the rebuild fall-throughs in many cases. In this paper, we propose a code
injection method that overcomes these inefficiencies by targeting only the
changed layer and then bypassing the layer's content checksum. This process is
developed specifically for an interpreted language such as Python, where
changes can be detected explicitly via text diff tools and run as-is without
compilation. We then demonstrate that this method can accelerate the rebuild
time, effectively reducing the O(n) where n = size of layer rebuild time to
O(1). Whereas for compiled languages, literal code injection cannot guarantee
integrity in compiled machine code. Expanding on the same code injection
principle, multi-layer targeted code injection will be addressed in a future
discussion.

with a realistic void-volume density of 0.2%, the dynamics of Si and H atoms on

the shape and size of the voids were examined using first-principles
density-functional simulations. The results from $ab$ $initio$ calculations
were compared with those obtained from using the modified Stillinger-Weber
potential. The temperature-induced nanostructural evolution of the voids was
examined by analyzing the three-dimensional distribution of Si and H atoms
on/near void surfaces using the convex-hull approximation, and computing the
radius of gyration of the corresponding convex hulls. A comparison of the
results with those from the simulated values of the intensity in small-angle
X-ray scattering of $a$-Si/$a$-Si:H in the Guinier approximation is also

Researchers and practitioners employ CAEs for a variety of tasks, ranging from
outlier detection and compression to transfer and representation learning.
Despite their widespread adoption, we have limited insight into how the
bottleneck shape impacts the emergent properties of the CAE. We demonstrate
that increased height and width of the bottleneck drastically improves
generalization, which in turn leads to better performance of the latent codes
in downstream transfer learning tasks. The number of channels in the
bottleneck, on the other hand, is secondary in importance. Furthermore, we show
empirically that, contrary to popular belief, CAEs do not learn to copy their
input, even when the bottleneck has the same number of neurons as there are
pixels in the input. Copying does not occur, despite training the CAE for 1,000
epochs on a tiny ($\approx$ 600 images) dataset. We believe that the findings

We demonstrate that for some nonsymmorphic chiral space groups, several

symmetry-enforced Weyl phonons (SEWPs). The SEWPs, enumerated in Table I, are
pinned at the boundary of the three-dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone (BZ) and
protected by nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries. By performing first-principles
calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose that as an example of SEWPs, the
two-fold degeneracies at P are monopole WPs in K$_2$Sn$_2$O$_3$ with space
group 199. The two WPs of the same chirality at two nonequivalent P points are
related by time-reversal symmetry. In particular, at $\sim 17.5$ THz, a spin-1
Weyl phonon is also found at H, since two Weyl phonons at P carrying a non-zero
net Chern number cannot exist alone in the 3D BZ. The significant separation
between P and H points makes the surface arcs long and clearly visible. Our

can deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as base stations (BSs). In another
application, one can use UAVs to collect data from sensors on the ground. For a
power-efficient and scalable deployment of such flying BSs, directional
antennas can be utilized to efficiently cover arbitrary 2-D ground areas. We
consider a large-scale wireless path-loss model with a realistic
angle-dependent radiation pattern for the directional antennas. Based on such a
model, we determine the optimal 3-D deployment of N UAVs to minimize the
average transmit-power consumption of the users in a given target area. The
users are assumed to have identical transmitters with ideal omnidirectional
antennas and the UAVs have identical directional antennas with given half-power
beamwidth (HPBW) and symmetric radiation pattern along the vertical axis. For
uniformly distributed ground users, we show that the UAVs have to share a
common flight height in an optimal power-efficient deployment. We also derive
in closed-form the asymptotic optimal common flight height of $N$ UAVs in terms
of the area size, data-rate, bandwidth, HPBW, and path-loss exponent.

doping, super-B can be transformed into a Dirac material from pristine metal.
Like graphene, it can also sustain tensile strain smaller than 24%, indicating
superior flexibility. Moreover, due to the small atomic mass and large density
of states at the Fermi level, super-B has the highest critical temperature Tc
of 25.3 K in single-element superconductors at ambient conditions. We attribute
this high Tc of super-B to the giant anharmonicity of two linear acoustic
phonon branches and an unusually low optic phonon mode. These predictions

maneuvering targets, which suffers from the intractable inference of
high-dimensional latent variables that include target kinematic state, target

unified message passing algorithm that combines belief propagation (BP) and
mean-field (MF) approximation is proposed for simplifying the intractable
inference. By assuming conjugate-exponential priors for target kinematic state,
target visibility state, and motion mode-model association, the MF
approximation decouples the joint inference of target kinematic state, target
visibility state, motion mode-model association into individual low-dimensional
inference, yielding simple message passing update equations. The BP is
exploited to approximate the probabilities of data association events since it
is compatible with hard constraints. Finally, the approximate posterior
probability distributions are updated iteratively in a closed-loop manner,
which is effective for dealing with the coupling issue between the estimations
of target kinematic state and target visibility state and decisions on motion
mode-model association and data association. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated by comparing with the well-known multiple maneuvering
target tracking algorithms, including interacting multiple model joint
probabilistic data association, interacting multiple model hypothesis-oriented

1\}$-edge-labeled rooted trees $T$ with leaf set $X$: there is an arc $(x,y)
\in E$ if and only if the unique path in $T$ that connects the last common
ancestor $\mathrm{lca}(x,y)$ of $x$ and $y$ with $y$ contains at least one edge
with label ""1"". In practice, Fitch graphs represent xenology relations, i.e.,
pairs of genes $x$ and $y$ for which a horizontal gene transfer happened along
the path from $\mathrm{lca}(x,y)$ to $y$.
  In this contribution, we generalize the concept of Fitch graphs and consider
trees $T$ that are equipped with edge-labeling $\lambda: E\to \mathcal{P}(M)$
that assigns to each edge a subset $M'\subseteq M$ of colors. Given such a
tree, we can derive a map $\varepsilon_{(T,\lambda)}$ (or equivalently a set of
not necessarily disjoint binary relations), such that $i\in
\varepsilon_{(T,\lambda)}(x,y)$ (or equivalently $(x,y)\in R_i$) with $x,y\in
X$, if and only if there is at least one edge with color $i$ from
$\mathrm{lca}(x,y)$ to $y$.
  The central question considered here: Is a given map $\varepsilon$ a Fitch
map, i.e., is there there an edge-labeled tree $(T,\lambda)$ with
$\varepsilon_{(T,\lambda)} = \varepsilon$, and thus explains $\varepsilon$?
Here, we provide a characterization of Fitch maps in terms of certain
neighborhoods and forbidden submaps. Further restrictions of Fitch maps are
considered. Moreover, we show that the least-resolved tree explaining a Fitch
map is unique (up to isomorphism). In addition, we provide a polynomial-time
algorithm to decide whether $\varepsilon$ is a Fitch map and, in the
affirmative case, to construct the (up to isomorphism) unique least-resolved
tree $(T^*,\lambda^*)$ that explains $\varepsilon$.

fashion textures are multi-modal. We fit and sample from a Gaussian mixture

training through incorporating weights of pre-trained networks as the
starting-point of optimization for regularization. While deep transfer learning
can usually boost the performance with better accuracy and faster convergence,
transferring weights from inappropriate networks hurts training procedure and
may lead to even lower accuracy. In this paper, we consider deep transfer
learning as minimizing a linear combination of empirical loss and regularizer
based on pre-trained weights, where the regularizer would restrict the training
procedure from lowering the empirical loss, with conflicted descent directions
(e.g., derivatives). Following the view, we propose a novel strategy making
regularization-based Deep Transfer learning Never Hurt (DTNH) that, for each
iteration of training procedure, computes the derivatives of the two terms
separately, then re-estimates a new descent direction that does not hurt the
empirical loss minimization while preserving the regularization affects from
the pre-trained weights. Extensive experiments have been done using common
transfer learning regularizers, such as L2-SP and knowledge distillation, on
top of a wide range of deep transfer learning benchmarks including Caltech, MIT
indoor 67, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The empirical results show that the proposed
descent direction estimation strategy DTNH can always improve the performance
of deep transfer learning tasks based on all above regularizers, even when
transferring pre-trained weights from inappropriate networks. All in all, DTNH
strategy can improve state-of-the-art regularizers in all cases with 0.1%--7%
higher accuracy in all experiments.

network model, corresponding to a large span in viscosity ratios and capillary
numbers. From these simulations, dimensionless quantities such as relative
permeabilities, residual saturations, mobility ratios and fractional flows are
computed. Relative permeabilities and residual saturations show many of the
same qualitative features observed in other experimental and modeling studies.
However, while other studies find that relative permeabilities converge to
straight lines at high capillary numbers we find that this is not the case when
viscosity ratios are different from 1. Our conclusion is that departure from
straight lines occurs when fluids mix rather than form decoupled flow channels.
Another consequence of the mixing is that computed fractional flow curves,
plotted against saturation, lie closer to the diagonal than they would
otherwise do. At lower capillary numbers, fractional flow curves have a
classical S-shape. Ratios of average mobility to their high-capillary number
limit values are also considered. These vary, roughly, between 0 and 1,
although values larger than 1 are also observed. For a given saturation and
viscosity ratio, the mobilities are not always monotonically increasing with
the pressure gradient. While increasing the pressure gradient mobilizes more
fluid and activates more flow paths, when the mobilized fluid is more viscous,
a reduction in average mobility may occur.

sequence of dependent nonparametric random dot product graphs. To be specific,
assume that at every time point, a network is generated from a nonparametric
random dot product graph model \citep[see e.g.][]{athreya2017statistical},
where the latent positions are generated from unknown underlying distributions.
The underlying distributions are piecewise constant in time and change at
unknown locations, called change points. Most importantly, we allow for
dependence among networks generated between two consecutive change points. This
setting incorporates edge-dependence within networks and temporal dependence
between networks, which is the most flexible setting in the published

novel change point detection algorithm, consisting of two steps. First, we
estimate the latent positions of the random dot product model, our theoretical
result being a refined version of the state-of-the-art results, allowing the
dimension of the latent positions to diverge. Subsequently, we construct a
nonparametric version of the CUSUM statistic \citep[e.g.][]{Page1954,

localization is proved theoretically and supported by extensive numerical
experiments, which illustrate state-of-the-art performance. We also provide in

area of both mathematicians and engineers. Among them, uniform mixing provides
a uniform probability distribution of quantum information over time which
attracts a special attention. However, there are only a few known examples of
graphs which admit uniform mixing. In this paper, a characterization of abelian
Cayley graphs having uniform mixing is presented. Some concrete constructions
of such graphs are provided. Specifically, for cubelike graphs, it is shown
that the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(\mathbb{F}_2^{2k};S)$ has uniform mixing if
the characteristic function of $S$ is bent. Moreover, a difference-balanced
property of the eigenvalues of an abelian Cayley graph having uniform mixing is
established. Furthermore, it is proved that an integral abelian Cayley graph
exhibits uniform mixing if and only if the underlying group is one of the
groups: $\mathbb{Z}_2^d, \mathbb{Z}_3^d$, $\mathbb{Z}_4^d$ or
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{r}\otimes \mathbb{Z}_4^d$ for some integers $r \geq 1, d\geq 1$.
Thus the classification of integral abelian Cayley graphs having uniform mixing

selectively querying the label of data. OAL is applicable to many real-world
problems, such as anomaly detection in health-care and finance. In these
problems, there are two key challenges: the query budget is often limited; the
ratio between classes is highly imbalanced. In practice, it is quite difficult
to handle imbalanced unlabeled datastream when only a limited budget of labels
can be queried for training. To solve this, previous OAL studies adopt either
asymmetric losses or queries (an isolated asymmetric strategy) to tackle the
imbalance, and use first-order methods to optimize the cost-sensitive measure.
However, the isolated strategy limits their performance in class imbalance,
while first-order methods restrict their optimization performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel Online Adaptive Asymmetric Active learning algorithm,
based on a new asymmetric strategy (merging both asymmetric losses and queries
strategies), and second-order optimization. We theoretically analyze its
mistake bound and cost-sensitive metric bounds. Moreover, to better balance
performance and efficiency, we enhance our algorithm via a sketching technique,
which significantly accelerates the computational speed with quite slight
performance degradation. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness and

  Divergent Component of Motion",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Keeping the stability can be counted as the essential ability of a humanoid
robot to step out of the laboratory to work in our real environment. Since
humanoid robots have similar kinematic to a human, humans expect these robots
to be robustly capable of stabilizing even in a challenging situation like
while a severe push is applied. This paper presents a robust walking framework
which not only takes into account the traditional push recovery approaches
(e.g., ankle, hip and step strategies) but also uses the concept of Divergent
Component of the Motion (DCM) to adjust next step timing and location. The
control core of the proposed framework is composed of a
Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller and two proportional controllers. In
this framework, the LQG controller tries to track the reference trajectories
and the proportional controllers are designed to adjust the next step timing
and location that allow the robot to recover from a severe push. The robustness
and the performance of the proposed framework have been validated by performing
a set of simulations, including walking and push recovery using MATLAB. The
simulation results verified that the proposed framework is capable of providing
a robust walking even in very challenging situations.

acquire and reduce dimension of signals that admit sparse representations. When
such a signal is acquired according to the principles of CS, the measurements
still take on values in the continuum. In today's ""digital"" world, a subsequent
quantization step, where these measurements are replaced with elements from a
finite set is crucial. We focus on one of the approaches that yield efficient
quantizers for CS: $\Sigma \Delta$ quantization, followed by a one-stage
tractable reconstruction method, which was developed by Saab et al. with
theoretical error guarantees in the case of sub-Gaussian matrices. We propose
two alternative approaches that extend this result to a wider class of
measurement matrices including (certain unitary transforms of) partial bounded
orthonormal systems and deterministic constructions based on chirp sensing
matrices.

We applied Bayesian filtering through dynamic linear models to sequentially
update the parameters. We considered uncertain investment lifetime to make the
model more adaptive to the market conditions. These updated parameters are put
into the dynamic mean-variance problem to arrive at optimal efficient
portfolios. Extensive simulations are conducted to study the effect of varying

into per-pixel instance \verb|id| classification, which leverages the panoptic
supervision to assist in the modeling of overlap relations. Besides, we
generate an approximate ground truth of overlap relations as the weak

relevance between queries and candidates in a bipolar way -- relevant or
irrelevant, and all ""irrelevant"" candidates are uniformly pushed away from the
query by an equal margin in the embedding space, regardless of their various
proximity to the query. This practice disregards relatively discriminative
information and could lead to suboptimal ranking in the retrieval results and
poorer user experience, especially in the long-tail query scenario where a
matching candidate may not necessarily exist. In this paper, we introduce a
continuous variable to model the relevance degree between queries and multiple
candidates, and propose to learn a coherent embedding space, where candidates
with higher relevance degrees are mapped closer to the query than those with
lower relevance degrees. In particular, the new ladder loss is proposed by
extending the triplet loss inequality to a more general inequality chain, which
implements variable push-away margins according to respective relevance
degrees. In addition, a proper Coherent Score metric is proposed to better
measure the ranking results including those ""irrelevant"" candidates. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed method,
which achieves significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

incorporate a new ingredient that is essential to understand the flux of these

to argue that the only effect of the solar magnetic field on the isotropic
cosmic ray flux is to interrupt some of the trajectories that were aiming to
the Earth and create a shadow. This shadow reveals the average solar depth
crossed by cosmic rays of a given rigidity. The absorbed cosmic ray flux is
then processed in the thin Solar surface and, assuming that the emission of
neutral particles by low-energy charged particles is isotropic, we obtain (i) a
flux of gammas that is consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, (ii) a flux of
100-300 neutrons/(year m^2) produced basically in the spallation of primary He
nuclei, and (iii) a neutrino flux that is above the atmospheric neutrino

protocols for the detection of quantum correlations or for the secure

designs. The key property of quantum designs is their indistinguishability from
truly random quantum processes as long as one is concerned with moments up to

polynomial functions of measurement probabilities which leads to lower bounds
on sums of generalized entropies. As an application we use the derived
uncertainty relations to investigate the incompatibility of sets of binary

due to Kleinberg and Oren, it has been possible to investigate the
computational complexity of how a task designer best can support a
present-biased agent in completing the task. In this paper, we study the
complexity of finding a choice reduction for the agent; that is, how to remove
edges and vertices from the task graph such that a present-biased agent will
remain motivated to reach his target even for a limited reward. While this
problem is NP-complete in general, this is not necessarily true for instances
which occur in practice, or for solutions which are of interest to task
designers. For instance, a task designer may desire to find the best task graph
which is not too complicated.
  We therefore investigate the problem of finding simple motivating subgraphs.
These are structures where the agent will modify his plan at most $k$ times
along the way. We quantify this simplicity in the time-inconsistency model as a
structural parameter: The number of branching vertices (vertices with
out-degree at least $2$) in a minimal motivating subgraph.
  Our results are as follows: We give a linear algorithm for finding an optimal
motivating path, i.e. when $k=0$. On the negative side, we show that finding a
simple motivating subgraph is NP-complete even if we allow only a single
branching vertex --- revealing that simple motivating subgraphs are indeed hard
to find. However, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the case when $k$
is fixed and edge weights are rationals, which might be a reasonable assumption
in practice.

algorithm that does not trust any individual component in the network (neither
workers nor servers), nor does it induce additional communication rounds (on
average), compared to standard non-Byzantine resilient algorithms. LiuBei
builds upon gradient aggregation rules (GARs) to tolerate a minority of
Byzantine workers. Besides, LiuBei replicates the parameter server on multiple
machines instead of trusting it. We introduce a novel filtering mechanism that
enables workers to filter out replies from Byzantine server replicas without
requiring communication with all servers. Such a filtering mechanism is based
on network synchrony, Lipschitz continuity of the loss function, and the GAR
used to aggregate workers' gradients. We also introduce a protocol,
scatter/gather, to bound drifts between models on correct servers with a small
number of communication messages. We theoretically prove that LiuBei achieves
Byzantine resilience to both servers and workers and guarantees convergence. We
build LiuBei using TensorFlow, and we show that LiuBei tolerates Byzantine
behavior with an accuracy loss of around 5% and around 24% convergence overhead

Unfortunately these are very scarce and many astronomical targets require
wavefront correction to work over much of the sky. We therefore need to be able
to use very much fainter reference objects. Laser guide stars in principle can
allow 0.1 arcsecond resolution but have a number of severe technical problems
that limit their application. Our aims are to provide imaging at even higher
resolution than Hubble. Lucky Imaging completely eliminates the tip-tilt errors
in astronomical wavefront detection. Most of the power that remains is in low
order, large scale structures. These may be detected with high sensitivity
using photon-counting EMCCD detectors working at high frame rate, up to ~100Hz.
With a new design of curvature wavefront sensor, wavefront errors may be
measured and corrected to give near diffraction-limited performance on large
groundbased telescopes in the visible. Reference stars (and reference compact
galaxies) fainter than I~17.5 mag may be used routinely. This paper will
describe how these work, what detector and other hardware is needed and what
software should be used to measure the wavefront errors and drive deformable
mirror hardware. The software techniques that are used are those routinely
applied for MRI and CT imaging. They are fast and relatively easy to implement.
The net effect is that imaging systems can be constructed that improve
substantially over Hubble resolution from the ground for a relatively modest
sum of money.

technologies allow images to be acquired at high speed without significant
noise penalty. Aligning these images before they are combined can yield a 3-5
fold improvement in image resolution. By using arrays of such detectors, survey
fields may be as wide as the telescope optics allows. We describe the
instrument and detail its application to accelerate greatly the rate of
detection of Earth size planets by gravitational microlensing. GravityCam will
improve substantially the quality of weak shear studies of dark matter
distribution in distant clusters of galaxies. An extensive microlensing survey
will also provide a vast dataset for asteroseismology studies, and GravityCam
promises to generate a unique data set on the population of the Kuiper belt and
possibly the Oort cloud.

languages in QMA. Our first main result is the following: if Learning With
Errors (LWE) is hard for quantum computers, then any language in QMA has an
NIZK argument with preprocessing. The preprocessing in our argument system
consists of (i) the generation of a CRS and (ii) a single
(instance-independent) quantum message from verifier to prover. The
instance-dependent phase of our argument system involves only a single
classical message from prover to verifier. Importantly, verification in our
protocol is entirely classical, and the verifier needs not have quantum memory;
its only quantum actions are in the preprocessing phase. Our second
contribution is to extend the notion of a classical proof of knowledge to the
quantum setting. We introduce the notions of arguments and proofs of quantum
knowledge (AoQK/PoQK), and we show that our non-interactive argument system
satisfies the definition of an AoQK. In particular, we explicitly construct an
extractor which can recover a quantum witness from any prover which is
successful in our protocol. Finally, we show that any language in QMA has an

are further confirmed by magneto-optical spectra with a Zeeman splitting of the

Furthermore, the phonons participating in the interaction are demonstrated to
be the octahedra-twist vibrations which are transverse optical phonons, while
the interaction between trapped excitons and longitudinal optical phonons is
weak. Our work demonstrates that trapped excitons in perovskites prefer to
interact with transverse rather than longitudinal optical phonons. Since bulk

composed of a rotating Kerr BH of mass $M$ and dimensionless spin parameter
$\alpha$, a magnetic field of strength $B_0$ aligned and parallel to the

economics, risk assessment, and many other fields. Although there has been a
large amount of work on monotone-constrained univariate curve estimation,
multivariate shape-constrained problems are much more challenging, and fewer
advances have been made in this direction. With a focus on monotone regression
with multiple predictors, this current work proposes a projection approach to
estimate a multiple monotone regression function. An initial unconstrained
estimator -- such as a local polynomial estimator or spline estimator -- is
first obtained, which is then projected onto the shape-constrained space. A
shape-constrained estimate (with multiple predictors) is obtained by
sequentially projecting an (adjusted) initial estimator along each univariate
direction. Compared to the initial unconstrained estimator, the projection
estimate results in a reduction of estimation error in terms of both $L^p$
($p\geq 1$) distance and supremum distance. We also derive the asymptotic
distribution of the projection estimate. Simple computational algorithms are
available for implementing the projection in both the unidimensional and higher
dimensional cases. Our work provides a simple recipe for practitioners to use
in real applications, and is illustrated with a joint-action example from
environmental toxicology.

  1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with
Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features
contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven
on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels
unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different
types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A
basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature
Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such
as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local
residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective
information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA)
structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature
Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure
can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers.

bands typically assigned to acyl lipids and proteins. We also show that while a
stronger signal is obtained from some subcellular structures, other large

Giacomin, J. L. Lebowitz, ""Phase segregation dynamics in particle system with
long range interactions"", Journal of Statistical Physics 87(1) (1997)]. This is
the continuous limit of an Ising spin chain interacting at long range through
Kac potentials. The microscopic system is in contact with reservoirs of fixed
magnetization and infinite volume, so that their density is not affected by any
exchange with the bulk in the original Kawasaki dynamics. At the mesoscopic
level, this condition is mimicked by the adoption Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We derive the stationary equation of the model starting from the
Lebowitz-Penrose free energy functional defined on the interval
$[-\varepsilon^{-1},\varepsilon^{-1}]$, $\varepsilon>0$. For $\varepsilon$
small, we prove that below the critical temperature there exists a solution
that carries positive current provided boundary values are opposite in sign and
lie in the metastable region. Such profile is no longer monotone, connecting
the two phases through an antisymmetric interface localized around the origin.
This represents an analytic proof of the existence of diffusion along the
concentration gradient in one-component systems undergoing a phase transition,
a phenomenon generally known as uphill diffusion. However uniqueness is
lacking, and we have a clue that the stationary solution obtained is not
unique, as suggested by numerical simulations.

since high-quality and clean data is expensive as well as hard to collect. In
order to achieve high model performance with the least number of samples,
active learning is a technique that queries the most important subset of data
from the original dataset. In active learning domain, one of the mainstream
research is the heuristic uncertainty-based method which is useful for the
learning-based system. Recently, a few works propose to apply policy
reinforcement learning (PRL) for querying important data. It seems more general
than heuristic uncertainty-based method owing that PRL method depends on data
feature which is reliable than human prior. However, there have two problems -
sample inefficiency of policy learning and overconfidence, when applying PRL on
active learning. To be more precise, sample inefficiency of policy learning
occurs when sampling within a large action space, in the meanwhile, class
imbalance can lead to the overconfidence. In this paper, we propose a
bias-aware policy network called Heapified Active Learning (HAL), which
prevents overconfidence, and improves sample efficiency of policy learning by
heapified structure without ignoring global inforamtion(overview of the whole
unlabeled set). In our experiment, HAL outperforms other baseline methods on
MNIST dataset and duplicated MNIST. Last but not least, we investigate the
generalization of the HAL policy learned on MNIST dataset by directly applying
it on MNIST-M. We show that the agent can generalize and outperform
directly-learned policy under constrained labeled sets.

  Arrays","42 pages",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple approach to microphone- and speaker-arrays is described in which the
microphone array is regarded as a sampling grid for the acoustic field, and the
corresponding speaker-array is treated as a ""spatial digital to analog
converter"" that reconstructs the acoustic field from its spatial samples.
Advantages of this approach include ease of understanding and teaching, ease of
deployment, effective practical guidelines for deployment, and significant
computational savings in special cases. In particular, in the far-field case
(acoustic sources many wavelengths away from a linear array of speakers) it is
possible to quantize source angles slightly so that no processing per speaker
is required beyond pure integer delay. Smoothly moving sources are obtained
using well known delay-line interpolation techniques such as linear
(cross-fading) and Lagrange (polynomial) interpolation between/among speakers.
We call the far-field line-array case Planewave-Based Angle Panning (PBAP), in
reference to the well-known Vector-Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP) family of
techniques, some of which are derived here as special cases: When speakers
undersample the acoustic field, the result may be considered a form of VBAP,
and VBAP is also obtained as a limiting case of polygonal PBAP arrays truncated
to the polygon perimeter. Spatial samples need not be on a linear array,
leading to a simple spatial audio system we call Huygens Arrays (HA). HAs are
quite general for sources located behind the speaker array, which no longer
needs to be linear, and the sources are no longer restricted to the far field.
Multiband and hybrid arrays employing VBAP (or stereo) and subwoofer(s) are
discussed, using sampling theory to inform the choices of crossover
frequencies.

adapting sandpile (AAS) model, for which a site topples whenever it has two or
more grains, distributing three or two grains randomly on its neighboring
sites, respectively with probability $p$ and $(1-p)$. The toppling process is
independent of the actual number of grains $z_i$ of the toppling site, as long
as $z_i\ge2$. For a periodic lattice the model evolves into an inactive state
for small $p$, with the number of active sites becoming stationary for larger
values of $p$. In one and two dimensions we find that the absorbing phase
transition occurs for $p_c\!\approx\!0.717$ and $p_c\!\approx\!0.275$.
  The symmetry of bipartite lattices allows states in which all active sites
are located alternatingly on one of the two sublattices, A and B, respectively
for even and odd times. We show that the AB-sublattice symmetry is
spontaneously broken for the AAS model, an observation that holds also for the
Manna model. One finds that a metastable AB-symmetry conserving state is
transiently observable and that it has the potential to influence the width of
the scaling regime, in particular in two dimensions.
  The AAS model mimics the behavior of integrate-and-fire neurons which
propagate activity independently of the input received, as long as the
threshold is crossed. Abstracting from regular lattices, one can identify sites
with neurons and consider quenched networks of neurons connected to a fixed
number $G$ of other neurons, with $G$ being drawn from a suitable distribution.
The neuronal activity is then propagated to $G$ other neurons. The AAS model is
hence well suited for theoretical studies of nearly critical brain dynamics. We
also point out that the waiting-time distribution allows an avalanche-free
experimental access to criticality.

pressures while letting particle beams pass with little to no loss. It has been
introduced by A. Hershcovitch. In the course of this publication, the
properties of a PW with apertures of 3.3 mm and 5.0 mm are presented.
Especially the link between the pressure properties relevant for applications
in accelerator systems and the underlying plasma properties depending on
external parameters are presented. At the low pressure side around some mbar,
high-pressure values reached up to 750 mbar while operating with volume flows
between 1 slm and 4 slm (standard liter per minute) and discharge currents
ranging from 45 A to 60 A. Unique features of the presented PW include
simultaneous plasma parameter determination and the absence of ceramic
insulators between the cooling plates. Optical analysis reveals no significant
damage or wear to the components after an operation time well over 10 h,
whereas the cathode needle needs replacement after 5 h.

energy, and reserves of generators are pre-scheduled to minimize the
operational cost, responding to the worst line failure scenario in the
operating day. The failure, operation status, and repair of transmission lines
are depicted by a novel robust uncertainty set with chance constraint
considering the repair of failed lines. This chance constraint is reformulated
to its deterministic equivalence. Using both load shedding and generation
curtailment, a recourse problem is formulated in the second stage considering

is solved using a column-and-constraint generation scheme. Simulations are

demand is unmet as no public dataset of urban road user trajectories is
available in an appropriate size, quality and variety. By contrast, the highway
drone dataset (highD) has recently shown that drones are an efficient method
for acquiring naturalistic road user trajectories. Compared to driving studies
or ground-level infrastructure sensors, one major advantage of using a drone is
the possibility to record naturalistic behavior, as road users do not notice
measurements taking place. Due to the ideal viewing angle, an entire
intersection scenario can be measured with significantly less occlusion than
with sensors at ground level. Both the class and the trajectory of each road
user can be extracted from the video recordings with high precision using
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose the creation of a
comprehensive, large-scale urban intersection dataset with naturalistic road
user behavior using camera-equipped drones as successor of the highD dataset.

bicyclists and pedestrians at intersections in Germany and is called inD. The

information obtained through code syntax outperform token-based
representations. Furthermore, the performance metrics obtained when
pre-training on a loosely related pretext task with a very large dataset

stationary coherences -- off-diagonal elements in the reduced system density
matrix -- even at equilibrium. This work investigates the ``quantumness'' of
such phenomena by examining the ability of classical and semiclassical models
to describe equilibrium stationary coherence in the multi-level spin boson
(MLSB) model, a common model for light-harvesting systems. A well justified
classical harmonic oscillator model is found to fail to capture equilibrium
coherence. This failure is attributed to the effective weakness of classical
system-bath interactions due to the absence of a discrete system energy
spectrum and, consequently, of quantized shifts in oscillator coordinates.
Semiclassical coherences also vanish for a dimeric model with parameters
typical of biological light-harvesting, i.e., where both system sites couple to
the bath with the same reorganization energy. In contrast, equilibrium
coherence persists in a fully quantum description of the same system,
suggesting a uniquely quantum-mechanical origin for equilibrium stationary
coherence in, e.g., photosynthetic systems. Finally, as a computational tool, a
perturbative expansion is introduced that, at third order in $\hbar$, gives
qualitatively correct behavior at ambient temperatures for all configurations
examined.

from more in situ data for validation. This study presents wave measurements in
the marginal ice zone (MIZ) obtained from ship mounted sensors. The system
combines altimeter readings from the ship bow with ship motion correction data
to provide estimated single point ocean surface elevation. Significant wave
height and mean wave period, as well as one-dimensional wave spectra are
derived from the combined measurements. The results are compared with
integrated parameters from a spectral wave model over a period of eight days in
the open ocean, and with spectra and integrated parameters derived from motion
detecting instruments placed on ice floes inside the MIZ. Mean absolute errors
of the integrated parameters are in the range 15.0-18.9% when comparing with
the spectral wave model and 1.0-9.6% when comparing with valid motion detecting
instruments. The spatial wave damping coefficient is estimated by looking at
the change in spectral wave amplitude found at discrete frequency values as the
ship was moving along the longitudinal direction of the MIZ within time
intervals where the wave field is found to be approximately constant in time.
As expected from theory, high frequency waves are effectively dampened by the
presence of sea ice. The observed wave attenuation rates compare favourably
with a two-layer dissipation model. Our methodology can be regarded as a simple
and reliable way to collect more waves-in-ice data as it can be easily added to
any ship participating to ice expeditions, at little extra cost.

tangent kernel space around specialized initializations. However, there areno
theoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks

investigating such overparameterizeddeep neural networks when fully trained. We
generalize a new technique called neural feature repopulation, originally

deep neural networks. It is shown that under suitable representations,
overparameterized deep neural networks are inherently convex, and when
optimized, the system can learn effective features suitable for the underlying
learning task under mild conditions. This new analysis is consistent with
empirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning
efficient feature representations. Therefore, the highly unexpected result of
this paper can satisfactorily explain the practical success of deep neural
networks. Empirical studies confirm that predictions of our theory are

over-passes an entropic barrier at the entrance to it. This generic problem is
mathematically identical to that of a diffusion-mediated reaction with a
partially-reactive site on the container's boundary. Considerable knowledge is
available on the dependence of the mean first-reaction time (FRT) on the
pertinent parameters. We here go a distinct step further and derive the full
FRT distribution for the NEP. We demonstrate that typical FRTs may be orders of
magnitude shorter than the mean one, thus resulting in a strong defocusing of
characteristic temporal scales. We unveil the geometry-control of the typical
times, emphasising the role of the initial distance to the target as a decisive
parameter. A crucial finding is the further FRT defocusing due to the barrier,
necessitating repeated escape or reaction attempts interspersed with bulk

Recent deep reinforcement learning methods use recurrent neural networks (RNN)

have convergence difficulties, especially when dealing with high dimensional
input spaces. In this paper, we propose influence-aware memory (IAM), a
theoretically inspired memory architecture that tries to alleviate the training
difficulties by restricting the input of the recurrent layers to those

standard RNNs, in which every piece of information used for estimating Q values
is inevitably fed back into the network for the next prediction, our model
allows information to flow without being necessarily stored in the RNN's
internal memory. Results indicate that, by letting the recurrent layers focus
on a small fraction of the observation variables while processing the rest of
the information with a feedforward neural network, we can outperform standard
recurrent architectures both in training speed and policy performance. This
approach also reduces runtime and obtains better scores than methods that stack
multiple observations to remove partial observability.

$\lambda_{c}^{-2}$ were analyzed within the framework of a self-consistent

coupling was taken into account, instead of assuming it to be zero as it stated

training and testing processes, deep neural networks suffer a drop in their
performance. Domain generalization allows improvements in the generalization
performance for unseen target domains by using multiple source domains.
Conventional methods assume that the domain to which each sample belongs is
known in training. However, many datasets, such as those collected via web
crawling, contain a mixture of multiple latent domains, in which the domain of
each sample is unknown. This paper introduces domain generalization using a
mixture of multiple latent domains as a novel and more realistic scenario,
where we try to train a domain-generalized model without using domain labels.
To address this scenario, we propose a method that iteratively divides samples
into latent domains via clustering, and which trains the domain-invariant
feature extractor shared among the divided latent domains via adversarial
learning. We assume that the latent domain of images is reflected in their
style, and thus, utilize style features for clustering. By using these
features, our proposed method successfully discovers latent domains and
achieves domain generalization even if the domain labels are not given.
Experiments show that our proposed method can train a domain-generalized model
without using domain labels. Moreover, it outperforms conventional domain
generalization methods, including those that utilize domain labels.

receiver only gets the instance $z$. For any efficient quantum adversarial
sender (who follows the protocol but can choose its own randomness), there
exists a quantum extractor that can extract a witness $w'$ such that $(z,w')
\in \mathcal{R}$ while a malicious receiver should not be able to output any
valid witness. We study and construct two types of secure quantum extraction
protocols.
  (1) Quantum extraction protocols secure against quantum malicious receivers
based on quantum fully homomorphic encryption satisfying some mild properties
and quantum hardness of learning with errors. In this construction, we
introduce a non black box technique in the quantum setting. All previous
extraction techniques in the quantum setting were solely based on quantum
rewinding.

linear features in $\mathbb R^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit with
a uniform error of $\epsilon$, then searching for an action that is optimal up
to $O(\epsilon)$ requires examining essentially all actions. We use the
Kiefer-Wolfowitz theorem to prove a positive result that by checking only a few
actions, a learner can always find an action that is suboptimal with an error
of at most $O(\epsilon \sqrt{d})$. Thus, features are useful when the
approximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features.
The idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a
generative model where the learner has access to $d$-dimensional linear
features that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an
accuracy of $\epsilon$. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of
order $\sqrt{dn \log(k)} + \epsilon n \sqrt{d} \log(n)$ with $k$ the number of

can learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order $\epsilon

a generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the
features. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the

nano-scale material processing. In particular, propagation-invariant structured
light fields, such as Bessel beams, have enabled applications that require
robust intensity distributions. Their self-healing nature facilitates imaging
with enhanced resolution e.g. in light-sheet microscopy. The prominent
high-intensity features of propagation-invariant fields such as Airy, Bessel,
and Mathieu beams can be understood in terms of caustics. While these beams
have found many applications in material processing and trapping, these
technologies would greatly benefit from structured, controllable intensities in
a variety of shapes well beyond the standard families of propagation-invariant
beams. Here we generalize propagation-invariant beams by tailoring their
caustics through two different methods. We illustrate these approaches by
implementing various tailored propagation-invariant beams experimentally, whose
patterns range from simple geometric shapes to complex configurations such as
words. This approach clarifies that the known solutions are a small subset of a
far more general set of propagation-invariant fields with intensity maxima
concentrated around any desired curve.

the task of graph matching. It can integrate graph node feature embedding,
node-wise affinity learning and matching optimization together in a unified
end-to-end model. One important aspect of graph matching is the construction of
two matching graphs. However, the matching graphs we feed to existing graph
convolutional matching networks are generally fixed and independent of graph
matching, which thus are not guaranteed to be optimal for the graph matching
task. Also, existing GCN matching method employs several general
smoothing-based graph convolutional layers to generate graph node embeddings,
in which extensive smoothing convolution operation may dilute the desired
discriminatory information of graph nodes. To overcome these issues, we propose
a novel Graph Learning-Matching Network (GLMNet) for graph matching problem.
GLMNet has three main aspects. (1) It integrates graph learning into graph
matching which thus adaptively learn a pair of optimal graphs that best serve
graph matching task. (2) It further employs a Laplacian sharpening
convolutional module to generate more discriminative node embeddings for graph
matching. (3) A new constraint regularized loss is designed for GLMNet training
which can encode the desired one-to-one matching constraints in matching
optimization. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
GLMNet and advantages of its main modules.

  Trade-Off",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A problem of developing the consensus protocols in public blockchain systems
which spend a combination of energy and space resources is addressed. A
technique is proposed that provides a flexibility for selection of the energy

consensus procedure. The technique originates from the cryptographic
time-memory-data trade-off approaches for cryptanalysis. The proposed technique
avoids the limitations of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of Space (PoS) which
require spending of only energy and space, respectively. Also, it provides a
flexibility for adjusting the resources spending to the system budget. The
proposed consensus technique is based on a puzzle where the problem of
inverting one-way function is solved employing a dedicated Time-Memory-Data
Trade-Off (TMD-TO) paradigm. The algorithms of the consensus protocol are
proposed which employ certain unconstrained and constrained TMD-TO based
inversions. Security of the proposed technique is considered based on the
probability that the honest pool of nodes generate a longer extension of the
blockchain before its update, and a condition on the employed parameters in
order to achieve desired security have been derived. Implementation complexity
of the proposed consensus protocol is discussed and compared with the
complexities when PoW and PoS are employed.

operators is dense in $\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ in the sense of Hilbert-Schmidt
approximation. In a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$ with separable predual, an
operator $a\in \mathcal M$ is said to be {irreducible in} $\mathcal M$ if
$W^*(a)$ is an irreducible subfactor of $\mathcal M$, i.e., $W^*(a)'\cap
\mathcal M={\mathbb C} \cdot I$. In this paper, let $\Phi(\cdot)$ be a
$\Vert\cdot\Vert$-dominating, unitarily invariant norm (see Definition 2.1),
where by $\Vert\cdot\Vert$ we denote the operator norm. We prove that in every
semifinite von Neumann factor $\mathcal M$ with separable predual, if the norm
$\Phi(\cdot)$ satisfies a natural restriction introduced in (1.1), then
irreducible operators are $\Phi(\cdot)$-norm dense in $\mathcal M$. In
particular, the operator norm $\Vert\cdot\Vert$ and the $\max\{\Vert\cdot\Vert,
\Vert\cdot\Vert_p\}$-norm (for each $p>1$) naturally satisfy the condition in
(1.1), where $\tau$ is a faithful, normal, semifinite, tracial weight and
$\Vert x\Vert_p=\tau(|x|^p)^{1/p}$ for all $x\in \mathcal M \cap L^{p}(\mathcal
M,\tau)$ (see [18, Preliminaries]). This can be viewed as a (stronger) analogue
of a theorem of Halmos in [10], proved with different techniques developed in
semifinite, properly infinite von Neumann factors.
  Meanwhile, for every $\Vert\cdot\Vert$-dominating, unitarily invariant norm
$\Phi(\cdot)$, we develop another method to prove that each normal operator in
$\mathcal M$ is a sum of an irreducible operator in $\mathcal M$ and an
arbitrarily small $\Phi(\cdot)$-norm perturbation, where the $\Phi(\cdot)$-norm
isn't restricted by (1.1). Particularly, the $\Phi(\cdot)$-norm can be the
$\max\{\Vert\cdot\Vert, \Vert\cdot\Vert_1\}$-norm.

years, in particular, approaches based on deep learning (neural) techniques
have become dominant in the literature. For all of them, substantial progress
over the state-of-the-art is claimed. However, indications exist of certain
problems in today's research practice, e.g., with respect to the choice and
optimization of the baselines used for comparison, raising questions about the
published claims. In order to obtain a better understanding of the actual
progress, we have tried to reproduce recent results in the area of neural
recommendation approaches based on collaborative filtering. The worrying
outcome of the analysis of these recent works-all were published at prestigious
scientific conferences between 2015 and 2018-is that 11 out of the 12
reproducible neural approaches can be outperformed by conceptually simple
methods, e.g., based on the nearest-neighbor heuristics. None of the
computationally complex neural methods was actually consistently better than
already existing learning-based techniques, e.g., using matrix factorization or
linear models. In our analysis, we discuss common issues in today's research
practice, which, despite the many papers that are published on the topic, have
apparently led the field to a certain level of stagnation.

Unfortunately, previous work indicated that such mute buttons are rarely used.
In this paper, we present the Privacy Hat, a tangible device which can be
placed on the smart speaker to prevent the device from listening. We designed
the Privacy Hat based on the results of a focus group and developed a working

striking manifestation of macroscopic quantum coherence, with applications in
metrology and quantum information. This equilibrium current is related with the
formation of Andreev states localized in the junction, whose energy depends
periodically on the superconducting phase difference. Topology emerged as a
guide for predicting exotic properties of Andreev states. In particular,
topological superconductors host Majorana modes at their ends. Then, in a
junction with such leads, the hybridization of two Majorana modes results in an
Andreev state with a period-doubling of its energy-phase dependence.
Furthermore, topologically protected crossings between Andreev states in
junctions with more than two leads may be revealed through a quantized
transconductance. The prediction motivated recent efforts to fabricate
multi-terminal junctions. Here we combine both topological effects to predict a
robust non-vanishing quantized transconductance in trijunctions with
topological leads. Such devices are envisioned to reveal the anyonic nature of
Majorana states through their braiding. Our prediction can be used to assess
that a given junction is indeed suitable to perform its braiding function.

years. A core problem in such systems is to reposition the bikes so that the
distribution of bike supply is reshaped to better match the dynamic bike
demand. When the bike-sharing company or platform is able to predict the
revenue of each reposition task based on historic data, an additional
constraint is to cap the payment for each task below its predicted revenue. In
this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism called {\em TruPreTar} to
incentivize users to park bicycles at locations desired by the platform toward
rebalancing supply and demand. TruPreTar possesses four important economic and
computational properties such as truthfulness and budget feasibility.
Furthermore, we prove that even when the payment budget is tight, the total
revenue still exceeds or equals the budget. Otherwise, TruPreTar achieves
2-approximation as compared to the optimal (revenue-maximizing) solution, which
is close to the lower bound of at least $\sqrt{2}$ that we also prove. Using an

show that TruPreTar is effective in rebalancing bike supply and demand and, as
a result, generates high revenue that outperforms several benchmark mechanisms.

programs against attacks. Fuzzing has to be effective in producing inputs that
cover functionality and find vulnerabilities. But it also has to be efficient
in producing such inputs quickly. Random fuzzers are very efficient, as they
can quickly generate random inputs; but they are not very effective, as the
large majority of inputs generated is syntactically invalid. Grammar-based
fuzzers make use of a grammar (or another model for the input language) to
produce syntactically correct inputs, and thus can quickly cover input space
and associated functionality. Existing grammar-based fuzzers are surprisingly
inefficient, though: Even the fastest grammar fuzzer Dharma still produces
inputs about a thousand times slower than the fastest random fuzzer. So far,
one can have an effective or an efficient fuzzer, but not both.
  In this paper, we describe how to build fast grammar fuzzers from the ground
up, treating the problem of fuzzing from a programming language implementation
perspective. Starting with a Python textbook approach, we adopt and adapt
optimization techniques from functional programming and virtual machine
implementation techniques together with other novel domain-specific
optimizations in a step-by-step fashion. In our F1 prototype fuzzer, these
improve production speed by a factor of 100--300 over the fastest grammar
fuzzer Dharma. As F1 is even 5--8 times faster than a lexical random fuzzer, we
can find bugs faster and test with much larger valid inputs than previously
possible.

examines the method of ""search and isolation,"" which seeks to isolate MRSA
positive patients in a hospital so as to decrease infection potential. Although
this strategy is straightforward, the question of just whom to screen is of

visual tasks remain challenging for machines. Fleuret et al. (2011) introduced
the Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT) to highlight this point, which
required classification of images consisting of randomly generated shapes based
on hidden abstract rules using only a few examples. Ellis et al. (2015)
demonstrated that a program synthesis approach could solve some of the SVRT
problems with unsupervised, few-shot learning, whereas they remained
challenging for several convolutional neural networks trained with thousands of
examples. Here we re-considered the human and machine experiments, because they
followed different protocols and yielded different statistics. We thus proposed
a quantitative reintepretation of the data between the protocols, so that we
could make fair comparison between human and machine performance. We improved
the program synthesis classifier by correcting the image parsings, and compared
the results to the performance of other machine agents and human subjects. We
grouped the SVRT problems into different types by the two aspects of the core
characteristics for classification: shape specification and location relation.
We found that the program synthesis classifier could not solve problems
involving shape distances, because it relied on symbolic computation which
scales poorly with input dimension and adding distances into such computation
would increase the dimension combinatorially with the number of shapes in an
image. Therefore, although the program synthesis classifier is capable of
abstract reasoning, its performance is highly constrained by the accessible
information in image parsings.

geopolitics. Cyberspace is a space of strategic priority for many states.
Understanding and representing its geography remains an ongoing challenge.
Nevertheless, we need to comprehend Cyberspace as a space organized by humans
to analyse the strategies of the actors. This geography requires a
multidisciplinary dialogue associating geopolitics, computer science and
mathematics. Cyberspace is represented as three superposed and interacting
layers: the physical, logical, and informational layers. This paper focuses on
the logical layer through an analysis of the structure of connectivity and the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This protocol determines the routes taken by the
data. It has been leveraged by countries to control the flow of information,
and to block the access to contents (going up to full disruption of the
internet) or for active strategic purposes such as hijacking traffic or
attacking infrastructures. Several countries have opted for a BGP strategy. The
goal of this study is to characterize these strategies, to link them to current
architectures and to understand their resilience in times of crisis. Our
hypothesis is that there are connections between the network architecture
shaped through BGP, and strategy of stakeholders at a national level. We chose
to focus on the case of Iran because, Iran presents an interesting BGP
architecture and holds a central position in the connectivity of the Middle
East. Moreover, Iran is at the center of several ongoing geopolitical rifts.
Our observations make it possible to infer three ways in which Iran could have
used BGP to achieve its strategic goals: the pursuit of a self-sustaining
national Internet with controlled borders; the will to set up an Iranian
Intranet to facilitate censorship; and the leverage of connectivity as a tool
of regional influence.

handled as separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-task
adversarial learning method to localize facial landmark, estimate head pose and
recognize gender jointly or estimate multiple face attributes simultaneously
through exploring their dependencies from both image representation-level and
label-level. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a deep recognition
network R and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network is used to learn
the shared middle-level image representation and conducts multiple face
analysis tasks simultaneously. Through multi-task learning mechanism, the
recognition network explores the dependencies among multiple face analysis
tasks, such as facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, gender
recognition and face attribute estimation from image representation-level. The
discriminator is introduced to enforce the distribution of the multiple face
analysis tasks to converge to that inherent in the ground-truth labels. During
training, the recognizer tries to confuse the discriminator, while the
discriminator competes with the recognizer through distinguishing the predicted
label combination from the ground-truth one. Though adversarial learning, we
explore the dependencies among multiple face analysis tasks from label-level.
Experimental results on four benchmark databases, i.e., the AFLW database, the
Multi-PIE database, the CelebA database and the LFWA database, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method for multiple face analyses.

affects cosmological evolution in the early Universe. We begin by reviewing the
standard cosmological model and the tools used to understand it theoretically
and to compute its observational consequences. This includes a detailed
exposition of cosmological perturbation theory and the theory of inflation. We
then describe the results in this thesis, starting with the non-linear
evolution of the curvature perturbation in the presence of vector and tensor
fluctuations, in which we identify the version of that variable that is
conserved in the most general situation. Next, we use second order perturbation
theory to describe the most general initial conditions for the evolution of
scalar perturbations at second order in the standard cosmological model. We
compute approximate solutions valid in the initial stages of the evolution,
which can be used to initialize second order Boltzmann codes, and to compute
many observables taking isocurvature modes into account. We then move on to the
study of the inflationary Universe. We start by analysing a new way to compute
the consequences of a sudden transition in the evolution of a scalar during
inflation. We use the formalism of quantum quenches to compute the effect of
those transitions on the spectral index of perturbations. Finally, we detail
the results of the exploration of a multi-field model of inflation with a
non-minimal coupling to gravity. We study popular attractor models in this
regime in both the metric and the Palatini formulations of gravity and find all
results for both the power spectrum and bispectrum of fluctuations to closely
resemble those of the single-field case. In all systems under study we discuss
the effects of non-linear dynamics and their importance for the resolution of

domains named as (i) the interior domain, (ii) the intermediate shell and (iii)
the exterior domain. We analyze these domains for a specific $f(R,T)$ gravity
model conceding the conformal Killing vectors. In the interior domain, we
assume that pressure is equal to negative energy density which leads to the
existence of repulsive force on the spherical shell. The intermediate shell
consists of ultra-relativistic plasma and pressure which shows a direct
relation with energy density and counterbalances the repulsive force applied by
the interior domain. The exterior vacuum spherical domain is taken to be the de
Sitter spacetime illustrated by the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m metric. We conclude
that non-singular solutions of charged gravastar with various physical
properties such as length, energy, entropy and equation of state parameter are
physically consistent.

advantage of posing the detector for longer duration in the observations of
bright stars, otherwise observed within very short integration times. Then the
effect of the photon noise is diminished, which dominates in the short cadence
observations. Longer exposures also help in reducing the noise contribution of
the atmospheric scintillation. Noise contributions of the imperfect tracking
and flat-fielding are mitigated by integrating over a larger area on the
detector as well. Although fewer images can be acquired in a given time, we
argue that the timing precision is improved because of better photometric
precision. This contribution has been supported by T\""UB\.ITAK-3001 project

astonishing scale-free patterns. This scale-freeness can be shown, within the
maximum entropy formalism (MaxEnt), as the manifestation of a fluctuating
system that preserves on average some amount of information. Monte Carlo
methods that can further this perspective are cruelly missing. Here we adapt to
self-organized urban street networks the Metropolis algorithm. The ""coming to
equilibrium"" distribution is established with MaxEnt by taking scale-freeness
as prior hypothesis along with symmetry-conservation arguments. The equilibrium
parameter is the scaling; its concomitant extensive quantity is, assuming our
lack of knowledge, an amount of information. To design an ergodic dynamics, we
disentangle the state-of-the-art street generating paradigms based on
nonoverlapping walks into layout-at-junction dynamics. Our adaptation
reminisces the single-spin-flip Metropolis algorithm for Ising models. We thus
expect Metropolis simulations to reveal that self-organized urban street
networks, besides sustaining scale-freeness over a wide range of scalings,
undergo a crossover as scaling varies -- literature argues for a small-world
crossover. Simulations for Central London are consistent against the
state-of-the-art outputs over a realistic range of scaling exponents. Our
illustrative Watts-Strogatz phase diagram with scaling as rewiring parameter
demonstrates a small-world crossover curving within the realistic window 2-3;
it also shows that the state-of-the-art outputs underlie relatively large
worlds. Our Metropolis adaptation to self-organized urban street networks
thusly appears as a scaling variant of the Watts-Strogatz model. Such insights
may ultimately allow the urban profession to anticipate self-organization or
unplanned evolution of urban street networks.

controlled optically and we discuss the main properties of this single spin
system. The photoluminescence of individual Cr-doped QDs and their evolution in
magnetic field reveal a large magnetic anisotropy of the Cr spin induced by
local strain. This results in a splitting of the Cr spin states and in a
thermalization on the lower energy states states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\pm$1. The
magneto-optical properties of Cr-doped QDs can be modelled by an effective spin
Hamiltonian including the spin to strain coupling and the influence of the QD
symmetry. We also show that a single Cr spin can be prepared by resonant
optical pumping. Monitoring the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the
QD during this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical
initialization of the spin. Hole-Cr flip-flops induced by an interplay of the
hole-Cr exchange interaction and the coupling with acoustic phonons are the
main source of relaxation that explains the efficient resonant optical pumping.
The Cr spin relaxation time is measured in the $\mu s$ range. We evidence that
a Cr spin couples to non-equilibrium acoustic phonons generated during the
optical excitation inside or near the QD). Finally we show that the energy of
any spin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by a
resonant single mode laser through the optical Stark effect. All these
properties make Cr-doped QDs very promising for the development of hybrid
spin-mechanical systems where a coherent mechanical driving of an individual
spin in an oscillator is required.

centre is a polynomial algebra. We construct a set of algebraically independent
central elements, each associated with a fundamental weight of $\mathfrak{g}$,
and prove that they generate the entire centre of the quantum group. A key
ingredient in the proofs of these results is a quantum Harish-Chandra
isomorphism for the generalised quantum group, which is proven in some details.

recently introduced in [Wolpert, 1996b], along with a theorem showing that
small training set error does not guarantee small OTS error, unless assumptions
are made about the target function. Here it is shown that the applicability of
this theorem is limited to models in which the distribution generating training
data has no overlap with the distribution generating test data. It is argued
that such a scenario is of limited relevance to machine learning.

analysis can be extended to multilayer and multilevel networks as well as to
graphs with node and/or link categorical attributes. The analysis has been
adapted for two typical examples of multiplexes: economic trade data
represented as a 957-plex network and 75 social networks each represented as a
12-plex network. We show that wedges (open triads) occur more often in economic
trade networks than in social networks, indicating the tendency of a country to
produce/trade of a product in local structure of triads which are not closed.
Moreover, our analysis provides evidence that the countries with small
diversity tend to form correlated triangles. Wedges also appear in the social
networks, however the dominant graphlets in social networks are triangles
(closed triads). If a multiplex structure indicates a strong tie, the graphlet
analysis provides another evidence for the concepts of strong/weak ties and
structural holes. In contrast to Granovetter's seminal work on the strength of
weak ties, in which it has been documented that the wedges with only strong
ties are absent, here we show that for the analyzed 75 social networks, the
wedges with only strong ties are not only present but also significantly
correlated.

absorption of thermal energy from the channel region. The absorption of thermal
energy can be actuated by inelastic processes and may be accomplished by an
energy restrictive flow of electrons into the channel. The proposed design
strategy employs dual energy filters to inject and extract electrons through
the contact to channel interface. The first filter injects a compressed stream
of electrons from the hot contact, at an effective temperature much lower than
the channel temperature. The compressed stream of injected electrons, then,
absorb energy via inelastic scattering inside the channel and are finally
extracted via a second filter at the cold contact interface. Rigorous
mathematical derivations demonstrate that an optimized performance for the
proposed design strategy demands the implementation of a box-car transmission
function at the electron injecting terminal and a unit-step transmission
function at the electron extracting terminal. Numerical simulation show that in
the proposed design strategy, the heat engine performance, under optimal
conditions, can surpass the ballistic limit when the required output power is
low compared to the quantum bound. The proposed concept can be used to
construct high efficiency thermoelectric generators in situations where the
source of usable heat energy is limited, but insulated from environmental
dissipation.
