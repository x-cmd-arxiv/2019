works well even when labeled data is abundant. Noisy Student Training achieves
88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0% better than the
state-of-the-art model that requires 3.5B weakly labeled Instagram images. On
robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0% to
83.7%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces
ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2.
  Noisy Student Training extends the idea of self-training and distillation
with the use of equal-or-larger student models and noise added to the student
during learning. On ImageNet, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled
images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels for 300M unlabeled
images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the
combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by
putting back the student as the teacher. During the learning of the student, we
inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth, and data augmentation via
RandAugment to the student so that the student generalizes better than the
teacher. Models are available at

TOI 263.01 using ground-based multicolour transit photometry. The host star is
faint, which makes RV confirmation challenging, but the large transit depth
makes the candidate suitable for validation through multicolour photometry. Our
analysis combines three transits observed simultaneously in r', i', and z_s
bands using the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager, three LCOGT-observed transit light
curves in g, r', and i' bands, a TESS light curve from Sector 3, and a
low-resolution spectrum for stellar characterisation observed with the ALFOSC
spectrograph. We model the light curves with PyTransit using a transit model
that includes a physics-based light contamination component that allows us to
estimate the contamination from unresolved sources from the multicolour
photometry. This allows us to derive the true planet-star radius ratio
marginalised over the contamination allowed by the photometry, and, combined
with the stellar radius, gives us a reliable estimate of the object's absolute
radius. The ground-based photometry excludes contamination from unresolved
sources with a significant colour difference to TOI 263. Further, contamination
from sources of same stellar type as the host is constrained to levels where
the true radius ratio posterior has a median of 0.217. The median radius ratio
corresponds to an absolute planet radius of 0.87 RJup, which confirms the
substellar nature of the planet candidate. The object is either a giant planet
or a brown dwarf (BD) located deep inside the so-called ""brown dwarf desert"".
Both possibilities offer a challenge to current planet/BD formation models and
makes 263.01 an object deserving of in-depth follow-up studies.

Photonics offers an alternate route to simulating such nonclassical behavior in

increase to the depth of a continuous quantum walk requires modifying the
footprint of the system. Here we report continuous walks of a two-photon
quantum frequency comb with entanglement across multiple dimensions. The
coupling between frequency modes is mediated by electro-optic phase modulation,
which makes the evolution of the state completely tunable over a continuous
range. With arbitrary control of the phase across different modes, we
demonstrate a rich variety of behavior: from walks exhibiting ballistic
transport or strong energy confinement, to subspaces featuring bosonic or
fermionic character. We also explore the role of entanglement dimensionality
and demonstrate biphoton energy bound states, which are only possible with
multilevel entanglement. This suggests the potential for such walks to quantify

new methods were applied on the HI observations of the Small and Large
Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC). In the case of the SMC, we find highly uniform
turbulent properties of HI, with no evidence for local enhancements of
turbulence due to stellar feedback. Such properties could be caused by a
significant turbulent driving on large-scales. Alternatively, a significant
line-of-sight depth of the SMC could be masking out localized regions with a
steeper SPS slope caused by stellar feedback. In contrast to the SMC, the LMC
HI shows a large diversity in terms of its turbulent properties. Across most of
the LMC, the small-scale SPS slope is steeper than the large-scale slope due to
the presence of the HI disk. On small spatial scales, we find several areas of
localized steepening of the SPS slope around major HII regions, with the 30
Doradus region being the most prominent. This is in agreement with predictions
from numerical simulations which suggest steepening of the SPS slope due to
stellar feedback eroding and destroying interstellar clouds. We also find
localized steepening of the large-scale SPS slope in the outskirts of the LMC.
This is likely caused by the flaring of the HI disk, or alternatively
ram-pressure stripping of the LMC disk due to the interactions with the
surrounding halo gas.

liver toxicity after treatment with specific chemical compounds. This approach
has the potential to reduce invasive and expensive animal testing during

information about the magnetic state, very difficult to obtain otherwise. Here
we show that in CrCl$_3$ multilayers, the dependence of the tunnelling
conductance on applied magnetic field ($H$), temperature ($T$), and number of
layers ($N$) tracks the evolution of the magnetic state, enabling the magnetic
phase diagram of these systems to be determined experimentally. Besides a
high-field spin-flip transition occurring for all thicknesses, the in-plane
magnetoconductance exhibits an even-odd effect due to a low-field spin-flop
transition. If the layer number $N$ is even, the transition occurs at $\mu_0 H
\sim 0$ T due to the very small in-plane magnetic anisotropy, whereas for odd

behavioral attributes among social constituents and studied their effects on
social network evolution. We investigated, using a networked agent-based
simulation model, how the resulting network states and topologies would be
affected when individual constituents' cultural tolerance, cultural state
change rate, and edge weight change rate were systematically diversified. The
results showed that the diversity of cultural tolerance had the most direct
effect to keep the cultural diversity within the society high and
simultaneously reduce the average shortest path length of the social network,
which was not previously reported in the earlier literature. Diversities of
other behavioral attributes also had effects on final states of the social

broad distribution of cultural tolerance levels within society can help promote
the coexistence of cultural diversity and structural connectivity.

robust anomaly detection (RAD) in the presence of unreliable anomaly labels,

layer detects the anomaly patterns from the remaining data. To adapt to the
on-line nature of anomaly detection, we extend RAD with additional features of
repetitively cleaning, conflicting opinions of classifiers, and oracle
knowledge. We on-line learn from the incoming data streams and continuously
cleanse the data, so as to adapt to the increasing learning capacity from the
larger accumulated data set. Moreover, we explore the concept of oracle

activity over a group of trials and/or a period of time. This approach may be
particularly problematic when assessing the response patterns of neurons to
more than one simultaneously presented stimulus. In such cases, the brain must
represent each individual component of the stimuli bundle, but
trial-and-time-pooled averaging methods are fundamentally unequipped to address
the means by which multi-item representation occurs. We introduce and
investigate a novel statistical analysis framework that relates the firing
pattern of a single cell, exposed to a stimuli bundle, to the ensemble of its
firing patterns under each constituent stimulus. Existing statistical tools
focus on what may be called ""first order stochasticity"" in trial-to-trial
variation in the form of unstructured noise around a fixed firing rate curve
associated with a given stimulus. Our analysis is based upon the theoretical
premise that exposure to a stimuli bundle induces additional stochasticity in
the cell's response pattern, in the form of a stochastically varying
recombination of its single stimulus firing rate curves. We discuss challenges
to statistical estimation of such ""second order stochasticity"" and address them
with a novel dynamic admixture Poisson process (DAPP) model. DAPP is a
hierarchical point process model that decomposes second order stochasticity
into a Gaussian stochastic process and a random vector of interpretable
features, and, facilitates borrowing of information on the latter across
repeated trials through latent clustering. We present empirical evidence of the
utility of the DAPP analysis with synthetic and real neural recordings.

inter-orbital $s$-wave pairing, with both even-frequency spin-singlet and

targets, has emerged as the standard of care in the treatment of many cancers.
Nonetheless, due to the pace of therapy development and variability in patient
information, designing effective protocols for individual treatment assignment
in a sample-efficient way remains a major challenge. One promising approach to
this problem is to frame precision oncology treatment as a contextual bandit
problem and to apply sequential decision-making algorithms designed to minimize
regret in this setting. However, a clear prerequisite for considering this
methodology in high-stakes clinical decisions is careful benchmarking to
understand realistic costs and benefits. Here, we propose a benchmark dataset
to evaluate contextual bandit algorithms based on real in vitro drug response
of approximately 900 cancer cell lines. Specifically, we curated a dataset of
complete treatment responses for a subset of 7 treatments from prior in vitro
studies. This allows us to compute the regret of proposed decision policies
using biologically plausible counterfactuals. We ran a suite of Bayesian bandit
algorithms on our benchmark, and found that the methods accumulate less regret
over a sequence of treatment assignment tasks than a rule-based baseline
derived from current clinical practice. This effect was more pronounced when
genomic information was included as context. We expect this work to be a
starting point for evaluation of both the unique structural requirements and
ethical implications for real-world testing of bandit based clinical decision
support.

constrained expressions which are analytical expressions with embedded
constraints. These expressions are particularly suitable to transform a large
class of constrained optimization problems into unconstrained problems. The
initial and most useful application of this technique is in the solution of
differential equations where the problem can be posed as an unconstrained
optimization problem and solved with simple numerical techniques (i.e.
least-squares).
  A hybrid system is simply a sequence of different differential equations. The
approach developed in this work derives an analytical constrained expression
for the entire range of a hybrid system, enforcing both the boundary conditions
as well as the continuity conditions across the sequence of differential
equations. This reduces the searched solution space of the hybrid system to
only admissible solutions. The transformation allows for a least-squares
solution of the sequence for linear differential equations and a iterative
least-squares solution for nonlinear differential equations.
  Lastly, the general formulation for ""n"" segments is developed and validation
is provided through numerical tests for three differential equation sequences:
linear/linear, linear/nonlinear, and nonlinear/nonlinear. The accuracy level
obtained are all at machine-error, which is consistent with the accuracy
experienced in past studies on the application of the Theory of Functional

conduction electrons on ytterbium ions and the splitting of 4$f$-states by the

described as an increase of chemical pressure which reduces the exchange
coupling and the CEF splitting. The scaling analysis and numerical NCA solution
of the model show that the effective degeneracy of the 4$f$-state at a given

which favor a uniform occupation of the CEF states. The theoretical model
captures all the qualitative features of the experimental data and it explains

the object: purely visual, exploratory, and fixed-object. Each category is
analysed and discussed. To demonstrate the usefulness of inertial estimation
research, we describe a number of grasping and manipulation applications that
make use of the inertial parameters of objects. The aim of the paper is to
thoroughly review and categorise existing work in an important, but
under-explored, area of robotics research, present its background and
applications, and suggest future directions. Note that this paper does not
examine methods of identification of the robot's inertial parameters, but
rather the identification of inertial parameters of other objects which the
robot is tasked with manipulating.

Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cable for magnets has been to imitate Low
Temperature Superconducting (LTS) cable designs. However, requirements for LTS
materials are not valid for HTS materials, which are extremely stable. For
example, non-twisted multifilamentary Bi-2223 tapes have been successfully used
in several magnets. This paper review stability and analyse inductance and AC
losses in non-twisted stack of HTS tapes. Numerical calculations show that
twisting has negligible effect on inductance variations in a stack of tapes.
Regarding AC losses, any magnet built with coated conductors have larger losses
than LTS ones, because of the aspect ratio and large width of the tape. If a
wide tape is replaced by a non-twisted stack of narrow tapes, losses and
residual magnetisation could be reduced. In contrast with multifilamentary
wires, twisting a stack of tapes reduces losses only marginally. Therefore,
cables composed of non-twisted stack could be designed to have losses
comparable to the one of twisted stack concepts. Few examples of large cables
for fusion applications are discussed. Designs based on non-twisted stacks can
be simpler, more robust and cost effective than twisted ones.

extract more accurate segmentation masks. Image misregistrations are corrected
with a Spatial Transformer Network, which non-linearly aligns the anatomical
factors. The imaging factor captures signal intensity characteristics across
different modality data and is used for image reconstruction, enabling
semi-supervised learning. Temporal and slice pairing between inputs are learned

multiferroic states in free-standing, perovskite-based nanodots at their limit

We consider both A-O and B-O2 terminations for three families of nanodots: i)
A=Ba with B=Ti, Zr, and Hf; ii) A=Ca and Sr with B=Ti; and iii) A = Na and K
with B=Nb. We find all A-O terminated dots to be non-polar and to exhibit cubic
symmetry, regardless of the presence of ferroelectricity in the bulk. These
dots all carry a net magnetic moment, except Ca8TiO6. On the other hand, all
B-O2 terminated nanodots considered in this study relax to a non-cubic ground
state. Rather surprisingly, a subset of these structures (BaTi8O12, BaHf8O12,
BaZr8O12, SrTi8O12, CaTi8O12 and KNb8O12) exhibit polar ground states. We
propose a new structural parameter, the cluster tolerance factor (CTF), to
determine whether a particular combination of A and B will yield a polar ground
state in the nanodot geometry, analogous to the Goldschmidt factor in bulk
ferroelectrics. We also find that in all polar B-O2 terminated nanodots are
also magnetic. The multiferroic state originates from separation between spin
density in peripheral B atoms and polarity primarily caused by the off-center
central A atom. Our findings stress that surface termination plays a crucial
role in determining whether ferroelectricity is completely suppressed in
perovskite-based materials at their limit of miniaturization.

more detailed astrophysical simulations. Our approach is relevant to any

beyond the validity domain of the minimal frustration principle as to focus on
the role of system-environment interactions rather than on frustration in the

folding and unfolding dynamics. Namely, an asymmetric bath can (i) block the

atmospheric activity of different scales, from localized storms to
planetary-scale disturbances including convective activity confined inside a
larger meteorological system. In February 2018 a series of convective storms
erupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from
-23$^{\circ}$ to -29.5$^{\circ}$). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic
region known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval
BA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The
initial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring
turbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of
clouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent
activity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them
closely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west.
Here we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily
observations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations
obtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space
Telescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical
simulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the
phenomenology observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay
between the Ghost, the convective eruptions and Oval BA, and they demonstrate
that water moist convection was the source of the initial storms. A simple
scale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the
planet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that
most of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.

phase separation. This observation is at odds with the intuitive expectation of
an interparticle repulsion that decays monotonically with distance. Although
attraction between like-charged particles can be theoretically rationalised in
the strong-coupling regime, for example, in the presence of multivalent
counterions, recurring accounts of long-range attraction in aqueous solution

Here we show that the behaviour of molecular water at an interface -
traditionally disregarded in the continuum electrostatics picture, provides a
mechanism to explain attraction between like-charged objects in a broad
spectrum of experiments. This basic principle will have important ramifications
in the ongoing quest to better understand intermolecular interactions in

the use of machine-learning emulators, which are algorithms for
high-dimensional interpolation. These use a pre-calculated training dataset to
mimic the output of a complex code but with run times orders of magnitude
shorter. We present the application of such an emulator to synthetic type II

results show that with a relatively small training set of 780 spectra we can
generate emulated spectra with interpolation uncertainties of less than one
percent. We demonstrate the utility of this method by automatic spectral
fitting of two well-known type IIP supernovae; as an exemplary application, we
determine the supernova distances from the spectral fits using the
tailored-expanding-photosphere method. We compare our results to previous
studies and find good agreement. This suggests that emulation of TARDIS spectra
can likely be used to perform automatic and detailed analysis of many transient

found ubiquitous applications in semiconductor technologies such as dynamic

from the strong exchange interaction among the magnetic moments of d- or
f-shell electrons. Magnetism, however, can also emerge in perfect lattices from
non-magnetic elements. For instance, flat band systems with high density of
states (DOS) may develop spontaneous magnetic ordering, as exemplified by the
Stoner criterion. Here we report tunable magnetism in rhombohedral-stacked
few-layer graphene (r-FLG). At small but finite doping (n~10^11 cm-2), we
observe prominent conductance hysteresis and giant magnetoconductance that
exceeds 1000% as a function of magnetic fields. Both phenomena are tunable by
density and temperature, and disappears for n>10^12 cm-2 or T>5K. These results
are confirmed by first principles calculations, which indicate the formation of
a half-metallic state in doped r-FLG, in which the magnetization is tunable by
electric field. Our combined experimental and theoretical work demonstrate that
magnetism and spin polarization, arising from the strong electronic

new physics at very high energy scales. Meanwhile in fundamental realizations,
the inflationary field space typically has a curved geometry, which may leave
detectable imprints in primordial observables. In this paper we study an
extension of quasi-single field inflation where the inflaton and the massive
field belong to a curved field manifold. Because of the nontrivial field space
curvature, the massive field here can get significant mass corrections of order
the Hubble scale, thus the quasi-single field predictions on primordial
non-Gaussianity are affected. We derive the same result in an equivalent
approach by using the background effective field theory of inflation, where a
dimension-6 operator is identified to play an important role and its cutoff
scale is associated with the curvature scale of the field space. In addition,
due to the slow-roll evolution of the inflaton, this type of mass correction
has intrinsic time-dependence. Consequently, the running mass modifies the
scaling behaviour in the squeezed limit of the scalar bispectrum, while the
resulting running index measures the curvature of the internal field space.
Therefore the minimal setup of a massive field within curved field space during

path and timescale of the mass flows that create them. Based on extensive
numerical simulations, we propose a scenario where massive stars are assembled
by large-scale, converging, inertial flows that naturally occur in supersonic
turbulence. We refer to this scenario of massive-star formation as the
""Inertial-Inflow Model"". This model stems directly from the idea that the mass
distribution of stars is primarily the result of turbulent fragmentation. Under
this hypothesis, the statistical properties of the turbulence determine the
formation timescale and mass of prestellar cores, posing definite constraints
on the formation mechanism of massive stars. We quantify such constraints by
the analysis of a simulation of supernova-driven turbulence in a 250-pc region
of the interstellar medium, describing the formation of hundreds of massive
stars over a time of approximately 30 Myr. Due to the large size of our
statistical sample, we can say with full confidence that massive stars in
general do not form from the collapse of massive cores, nor from competitive
accretion, as both models are incompatible with the numerical results. We also
compute synthetic continuum observables in Herschel and ALMA bands. We find
that, depending on the distance of the observed regions, estimates of core mass
based on commonly-used methods may exceed the actual core masses by up to two
orders of magnitude, and that there is essentially no correlation between
estimated and real core masses.

inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a

how this analogy persists in the presence of matter by considering theories
with additional fields coupled to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar or the
special galileon in a way that is consistent with their symmetries. Using
purely on-shell arguments, we show that these theories obey analogues of the
S-matrix equivalence principle whereby all matter fields must couple to the DBI
scalar or the special galileon through a particular quartic vertex with a
universal coupling. These equivalence principles imply the universality of the
leading double soft theorems in these theories, which are scalar analogues of
Weinberg's gravitational soft theorem, and can be used to rule out interactions
with massless higher-spin fields when combined with analogues of the
generalized Weinberg-Witten theorem. We verify in several examples that
amplitudes with external matter fields nontrivially exhibit enhanced single
soft limits and we show that such amplitudes can be constructed using soft
recursion relations when they have sufficiently many external DBI or special
galileon legs, including amplitudes with massive higher-spin fields. As part of

paper, we highlight the power of this graph-theoretic approach by ""cutting
open"" the vertices and edges of the graphs, allowing us to systematically
classify linear relations among multiparticle correlators and develop faster

fast implementation of jet substructure observables like $C_2$ and $D_2$, which
are widely used at the Large Hadron Collider to identify boosted hadronic

that for dwarf galaxies the CMD-based average star formation rates (SFRs) are
generally higher than the FUV-based SFR. For half of the sample, the
60-Myr-average CMD-based SFR is more than two times the FUV SFR. In contrast,

dark matter. If dark matter does have self-interactions, we would expect this
to cause a separation between the collisionless stars and the dark matter halo
of a galaxy as it falls through a dark matter medium. For stars arranged in a
disk, this would generate a U-shaped warp. The magnitude of this warping
depends on the SIDM cross section, type of self-interaction, relative velocity
of galaxy and background, halo structure, and density of the dark matter
medium. In this paper, we set constraints on long-range (light mediator) dark
matter self-interaction by means of this signal. We begin by measuring U-shaped
warps in $3,213$ edge-on disk galaxies within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
then forward-model the expected warp from SIDM on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis by
combining models of halo structure, density and velocity field reconstructions,
and models for the dark matter interactions. We find no evidence for a
contribution to the warps from SIDM. Our constraints are highly dependent on
the uncertain velocities of our galaxies: for a normalized Rutherford-like
cross section we find $\tilde{\sigma}/m_{\rm{DM}} \lesssim 3\times
10^{-13}~\rm{cm}^2/\rm{g}$ at fixed velocity $v = 300~\rm{km/s}$ -- a bound
that scales roughly linearly with increasing $v$. In the appendix we translate
these bounds into limits on the momentum transfer cross section, finding
$\sigma_T(300~\rm{km/s})/m_{\rm{DM}} \lesssim 0.1~\rm{cm}^2/\rm{g}$. [abridged]

observes the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over 75% of the sky from the
Atacama Desert, Chile, at frequency bands centered near 40, 90, 150, and 220

telescope during its first observation era, from 2016 September to 2018
February. High signal-to-noise observations of the Moon establish the pointing
and beam calibration. The telescope boresight pointing variation is
$<0.023^\circ$ ($<1.6$% of the beam's full width at half maximum (FWHM)). We
estimate beam parameters per detector and in aggregate, as in the CMB survey
maps. The aggregate beam has an FWHM of $1.579^\circ\pm.001^\circ$ and a solid
angle of $838 \pm 6\ \mu{\rm sr}$, consistent with physical optics simulations.
The corresponding beam window function has a sub-percent error per multipole at
$\ell < 200$. An extended $90^\circ$ beam map reveals no significant far
sidelobes. The observed Moon polarization shows that the instrument
polarization angles are consistent with the optical model and that the
temperature-to-polarization leakage fraction is $<10^{-4}$ (95% C.L.). We find
that the Moon-based results are consistent with measurements of M42, RCW 38,

establish degree-level precision for instrument polarization angles.

in recent years, driven in large by the entertainment industry, and epitomized
by the emergence of consumer-grade, plug-and-play, room-scale VR devices. To
explore the scientific potential of this technology for the field of

E0102-VR. The specific scientific goal of this application is to facilitate the
characterization of the 3D structure of the oxygen-rich ejecta in the young
supernova remnant 1E 0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Using E0102-VR,
we measure the physical size of two large cavities in the system, including a

that drive the theoretical value of the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$,
the effective number of neutrinos in the early universe, away from 3. Our chief
focus is finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of the QED
plasma in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling at $T \sim 1$ MeV, where $T$ is
the photon temperature. Working in the instantaneous decoupling approximation,
we recover at ${\cal O}(e^2)$, where $e$ is the elementary electric charge, the
well-established correction of $\delta N_{\rm eff}^{(2)} \simeq 0.010$ across a
range of plausible neutrino decoupling temperatures, in contrast to an
erroneous claim in the recent literature which found twice as large an effect.
At ${\cal O}(e^3)$ we find a new and significant correction of $\delta N_{\rm
eff}^{(3)} \simeq -0.001$ that has so far not been accounted for in any
precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$, significant because this correction is
potentially larger than the change in $N_{\rm eff}$ induced between including
and excluding neutrino oscillations in the transport modelling. In addition to
the QED equation of state, we make a first pass at quantifying
finite-temperature QED corrections to the weak interaction rates that directly
affect the neutrino decoupling process, and find that the ${\cal O}(e^2)$
thermal electron mass correction induces a change of $\delta N_{\rm
eff}^{m_{\rm th}} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. A complete assessment of the various
effects considered in this work on the final value of $N_{\rm eff}$ will
necessitate an account of neutrino energy transport beyond the instantaneous
decoupling approximation. However, relative to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$ obtained
in the most recent such calculation, we expect the new effects found in this
work to lower the number to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.043$.

probe of dark matter halos around central galaxies. The method cross-correlates
central galaxies in spectroscopic galaxy samples with fainter galaxies detected
in photometric surveys. After background subtraction, the excess galaxies
around the central galaxies represent faint satellite galaxies within the dark
matter halo. Using abundance matching models, we show that the the total galaxy
luminosity, L_sat, scales linearly with host halo mass, making L_sat an
excellent proxy for M_h. L_sat is also sensitive to the formation time of the
halo, as younger halos have more substructure at fixed M_h. We demonstrate that
probes of galaxy large-scale environment can break this degeneracy. Although
this is an indirect probe of the halo, it can yield a high-S/N measurement for
galaxies expected to occupy halos at $<10^{12}$ M_sol, where other methods
suffer from larger errors. In this paper we focus on observational and
theoretical systematics in the L_sat method. We test the robustness of our
method of finding central galaxies and our methods of estimating the number of
background galaxies. We implement this method on central galaxies in SDSS data,
with satellites identified in faint imaging from the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys. We find excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and
the observational measurements. Finally, we compare our L_sat measurements to
weak lensing estimates of M_h for red and blue subsamples. In the stellar mass
range where the measurements overlap, we find consistent results, where red
galaxies live in larger halos. However, the L_sat approach allows us to probe
significantly lower mass galaxies. At these masses, the L_sat values are
equivalent. This example shows the potential of L_sat as a probe of dark halos.

high-eccentricity orbits with nearly the same orientation. In the absence of
relativistic precession, the spherical equilibrium is metastable below the

effects are important, the spherical equilibrium is linearly unstable below the
critical temperature and the phase transition is continuous. A similar phase
transition has recently been found in a model cluster composed of stars with a

explore the relationship between L$_{sat}$ and various observable galaxy
properties for a sample of 117,966 central galaxies out to $z = 0.15$. At fixed
stellar mass, every galaxy property we explore shows a correlation with
L$_{sat}$. This implies that dark matter halos play a possibly significant role
in determining these secondary galaxy properties. We quantify these
correlations by computing the mutual information between L$_{sat}$ and
secondary properties and explore how this mutual information varies as a
function of stellar mass and when separating the sample into star-forming and
quiescent central galaxies. We find that absolute r-band magnitude correlates
more strongly with L$_{sat}$ than stellar mass across all galaxy populations;
and that effective radius, velocity dispersion, and S\'ersic index do so as
well for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. L$_{sat}$ is sensitive to both
the mass of the host halo as well as the halo formation history, with younger
halos having higher L$_{sat}$. L$_{sat}$ by itself cannot distinguish between
these two effects, but measurements of galaxy large-scale environment can break
this degeneracy. For star-forming central galaxies, we find that r$_{\rm eff}$,
$\sigma_v$, and S\'ersic index all correlate with large-scale density, implying
that these halo age plays a role in determining these properties. For quiescent
galaxies, we find that all secondary properties are independent of environment,
implying that correlations with L$_{sat}$ are driven only by halo mass. These
results are a significant step forward in quantifying the full extent of the

driven photoevaporation. Of particular interest are the examination of the
transition region between photoevaporation and magnetically driven wind, the
possibility of emerging magneto-centrifugal wind effects, as well as the
morphology of the wind itself depending on the strength of the magnetic field.
We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5D axisymmetric configuration with additional
treatment of EUV-/ X-ray heating and dynamic ohmic diffusion based on a
semi-analytical chemical model. We identify the transition between both outflow
types to occur for values of the initial plasma beta $\beta \geq 10^7$, while
magnetically driven winds generally outperform photoevaporation for stronger
fields. In our simulations we observe irregular and asymmetric outflows for
stronger magnetic fields. In the weak field regime the photoevaporation rates
are slightly lowered by perturbations of the gas density in the inner regions
of the disk. Overall, our results predict a wind with a lever arm smaller than
1.5, consistent with a hot magneto-thermal wind. Stronger accretion flows are
present for values of $\beta < 10^7$.

information. Indeed, preventing the loss of coherence is one of the most
important technical challenges obstructing the development of large-scale
quantum computers. Recently, there has been substantial progress in developing
mathematical resource theories of coherence, paving the way towards its
quantification and control. To date however, these resource theories have only
been mathematically formalised within the realms of convex-geometry,
information theory, and linear algebra. This approach is limited in scope, and
makes it difficult to go beyond resource theories of coherence for single
system quantum states. In this paper we take a complementary perspective,
showing that resource theories of coherence can instead be defined purely
compositionally, that is, working with the mathematics of process theories,
string diagrams and category theory. This new perspective offers several
advantages: i) it unifies various existing approaches to the study of
coherence, for example, subsuming both speakable and unspeakable coherence; ii)
it provides a general treatment of the compositional multi-system setting; iii)
it generalises immediately to the case of quantum channels, measurements,
instruments, and beyond; iv) it can easily be generalised to the setting where
there are multiple distinct sources of decoherence; and, iv) it directly
extends to arbitrary process theories, for example, generalised probabilistic
theories and Spekkens toy model--providing the ability to operationally
characterise coherence rather than relying on specific mathematical features of
quantum theory for its description. More importantly, by providing a new,
complementary, perspective on the resource of coherence, this work opens the
door to the development of novel tools which would not be accessible from the
linear algebraic mind set.

Maxwell fields, computed using the stress-energy tensor, depends not only on
the radiative degrees of freedom, but also on the Coulombic parts. However, the
angular momentum also can be computed using other conserved currents associated
with a Killing field, such as the Noether current and the canonical current.
The flux computed using these latter two currents is purely radiative. A
priori, it is not clear which of these is to be considered the true flux of
angular momentum for Maxwell fields. This situation carries over to Maxwell
fields on non-dynamical, asymptotically flat spacetimes for fluxes associated
with the Lorentz symmetries in the asymptotic Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS)
algebra.
  We investigate this question of angular momentum flux in the full
Einstein-Maxwell theory. Using the prescription of Wald and Zoupas, we compute
the charges associated with any BMS symmetry on cross-sections of null
infinity. The change of these charges along null infinity then provides a flux.
For Lorentz symmetries, the Maxwell fields contribute an additional term,
compared to the Wald-Zoupas charge in vacuum general relativity, to the charge
on a cross-section. With this additional term, the flux associated with Lorentz
symmetries, e.g., the angular momentum flux, is purely determined by the
radiative degrees of freedom of the gravitational and Maxwell fields. In fact,
the contribution to this flux by the Maxwell fields is given by the radiative
Noether current flux and not by the stress-energy flux.

composite galaxy spectra, we find that both stellar mass and environment play a
role in the observed galactic properties. We find that the median [OII]

$2.0_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$ {\AA} and $D_n4000$ increases from $1.09\pm0.01$ to
$1.56\pm0.03$ with increasing stellar mass (from $\sim10^{9.25}$ to
$\sim10^{11.35}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). Concerning the dependence on the
environment, we find that at fixed stellar mass |EW$_\mathrm{[OII]}|$ is
tentatively lower in higher density environments. Regarding $D_n4000$, we find
that the increase with stellar mass is sharper in denser environments, hinting
that such environments may accelerate galaxy evolution. Moreover, we find
larger $D_n4000$ values in denser environments at fixed stellar mass,
suggesting that galaxies are on average older and/or more metal-rich in such
dense environments. This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most
massive galaxies have, on average, the lowest sSFRs and the oldest stellar
populations (age $\gtrsim1$ Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also
hypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher
EW$_\mathrm{[OII]|}$, higher sSFR) at intermediate densities may lead to
quenching since we find the quenched fraction to increase sharply from the
filament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.

effective field theory include the resummation of all-twist power corrections
$Q_s^2/Q^2$, where $Q_s$ is the saturation scale in the nucleus. We discuss the
structure of ultraviolet, collinear and soft divergences in the CGC, and
extract the leading logs in $x$; the structure of the corresponding rapidity
divergences gives a nontrivial first principles derivation of the JIMWLK
renormalization group evolution equation for multiparton lightlike Wilson line
correlators. Explicit expressions are given for the $x$-independent
$O(\alpha_s)$ contributions that constitute the NLO impact factor. These
results, combined with extant results on NLO JIMWLK evolution, provide the
ingredients to compute the inclusive photon $+$ dijet cross-section at small
$x$ to $O(\alpha_s^3 \ln(x))$. First results for the NLO impact factor in
inclusive dijet production are recovered in the soft photon limit. A byproduct
of our computation is the LO photon+ 3 jet (quark-antiquark-gluon)
cross-section.

the peculiarity of the outcome variable (set-difference) which takes discrete
values from $-3$ to $3$, we cannot consider standard models based on the usual
Poisson or binomial assumptions used for other sports such as football/soccer.
Hence, the first and foremost challenge was to build models appropriate for the
set-differences of each volleyball match. Here we consider two major
approaches:
  a) an ordered multinomial logistic regression model and
  b) a model based on a truncated version of the Skellam distribution.
  For the first model, we consider the set-difference as an ordinal response
variable within the framework of multinomial logistic regression models.
Concerning the second model, we adjust the Skellam distribution in order to
account for the volleyball rules. We fit and compare both models with the same
covariate structure as in Karlis & Ntzoufras (2003). Both models are fitted,
illustrated and compared within Bayesian framework using data from both the

Quantum corrections of the fourth order in acceleration to the energy-momentum

massless and massive fields are considered. The method for regularization of
discovered infrared divergences for scalar fields is proposed. The calculated
corrections make it possible to substantiate the Unruh effect from the point of

various quantum field theories of massless and massive fields. The obtained
results exactly coincide with the ones obtained earlier by calculation of the
vacuum average of energy-momentum tensor in a space with a conical singularity.
Thus, the duality of two methods for describing an accelerated medium is

graph on n vertices admits a path decomposition of cardinality at most (n+1)/2.
Seminal results towards its verification consider the graph obtained from G by
removing its vertices of odd degree, which is called the E-subgraph of G.
Lov\'asz (1968) verified Gallai's Conjecture for graphs whose E-subgraphs
consist of at most one vertex, and Pyber (1996) verified it for graphs whose
E-subgraphs are forests. In 2005, Fan verified Gallai's Conjecture for graphs
in which each block of their E-subgraph is triangle-free and has maximum degree
at most 3. Let calG be the family of graphs for which (i) each block has
maximum degree at most 3; and (ii) each component either has maximum degree at

generalize Fan's result by verifying Gallai's Conjecture for graphs whose
E-subgraphs are subgraphs of graphs in calG. This allows the components of the
E-subgraphs to contain any number of blocks with triangles as long as they are

question of whether the sciences are expanding into a fractured structure,
making cross-field communication difficult. On the other hand, scientists may
be motivated to learn extensively across fields to enhance their innovative
capacity, and this may offset the negative effects of fragmentation. Through an
investigation of the distances within and clustering of cross-sectional
citation networks, this study presents evidence that fields of science become
more integrated over time. The average citation distance between papers
published in the same year decreased from approximately 5.33 to 3.18 steps
between 1950 and 2018. This observation is attributed to the growth of
cross-field communication throughout the entire period as well as the growing
importance of high impact papers to bridge networks in the same year. Three
empirical findings support this conclusion. First, distances decreased between
almost all disciplines throughout the time period. Second, inequality in the
number of citations received by papers increased, and as a consequence the
shortest paths in the network depend more on high impact papers later in the
period. Third, the dispersion of connections between fields increased
continually. Moreover, these changes did not entail a lower level of clustering
of citations. Both within- and cross-field citations show a similar rate of
slowly growing clustering values in all years. The latter findings suggest that
domain spanning scholarly communication is partly enabled by new fields that

pairing between electrons is entirely dynamical in nature. Majorana zero modes
exhibit pure odd-frequency superconducting correlations due to their specific
properties. Thus, by tunnel-coupling an array of Majorana zero modes to a
spin-polarized wire, it is in principle possible to engineer a bulk
one-dimensional odd-frequency spinless $s$-wave superconductor. We here point
out that each tunnel coupling element, being dependent on a large number of
material-specific parameters, is generically complex with sample variability in
both its magnitude and phase. Using this, we demonstrate that, upon averaging
over phase-disorder, the induced superconducting, including odd-frequency,
correlations in the spin-polarized wire are significantly suppressed. We
perform both a rigorous analytical evaluation of the disorder-averaged
$T$-matrix in the wire, as well as numerical calculations based on a
tight-binding model, and find that the anomalous, i.e. superconducting, part of
the $T$-matrix is highly suppressed with phase disorder. We also demonstrate
that this suppression is concurrent with the filling of the single-particle
excitation gap by smearing the near-zero frequency peaks, due to formation of
bound states that satisfy phase-matching conditions between spatially separated
Majorana zero modes. Our results convey important constraints on the parameter
control needed in practical realizations of Majorana zero mode structures and
suggest that the achievement of a bulk 1D odd-$\omega$ superconductivity from
MZMs demand full control of the system parameters.

$A$ to an algebraic variety using the cohomology ring of $A$. An essential
assumption in this theory is the finite generation condition for the cohomology
ring of $A$ and that for the corresponding modules. In this paper, we introduce
various approaches to study the finite generation condition. First, for any
finite dimensional Hopf algebra $A$, we show that the finite generation
condition on $A$-modules can be replaced by a condition on any affine
commutative $A$-module algebra $R$ under the assumption that $R$ is integral
over its invariant subring $R^A$. Next, we use a spectral sequence argument to
show that a finite generation condition holds for certain filtered, smash and
crossed product algebras in positive characteristic if the related spectral
sequences collapse. Finally, if $A$ is defined over a number field over the
rationals, we construct another finite dimensional Hopf algebra $A'$ over a
finite field, where $A$ can be viewed as a deformation of $A'$, and prove that
if the finite generation condition holds for $A'$, then the same condition
holds for $A$.

of baryons induces a contraction of the dark matter (DM) distribution in the
inner regions, r<20 kpc. We provide an analytic expression that relates the
baryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the
contraction increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2
and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8 and 1 kpc, respectively compared to an
uncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic biases in
the inferred halo mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted
NFW halo model to the MW rotation curve that matches the data very well. The
best-fit has a DM halo mass, $M_{200}^{\rm

contraction of $9.4_{-2.6}^{+1.9}$, which lie close to the median halo

mass, $M_{200}^{\rm total}=1.08_{-0.14}^{+0.20} \times 10^{12} M_\odot$, is in
good agreement with recent measurements. The model gives a MW stellar mass of

diffuses over time. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations we reveal
rich aging behaviour of this dense active matter system: short persistence

noninterference: a program cannot leak private data to public channels.
However, in practice, programs need to selectively declassify information about
private data. Several approaches have provided a notion of relaxed
noninterference supporting selective and expressive declassification while
retaining a formal security property. The labels-as-functions approach provides
relaxed noninterference by means of declassification policies expressed as
functions. The labels-as-types approach expresses declassification policies
using type abstraction and faceted types, a pair of types representing the
secret and public facets of values. The original proposal of labels-as-types is
formulated in an object-oriented setting where type abstraction is realized by
subtyping. The object-oriented approach however suffers from limitations due to
its receiver-centric paradigm.
  In this work, we consider an alternative approach to labels-as-types,
applicable in non-object-oriented languages, which allows us to express
advanced declassification policies, such as extrinsic policies, based on a
different form of type abstraction: existential types. An existential type
exposes abstract types and operations on these; we leverage this abstraction
mechanism to express secrets that can be declassified using the provided
operations. We formalize the approach in a core functional calculus with
existential types, define existential relaxed noninterference, and prove that
well-typed programs satisfy this form of type-based relaxed noninterference.

estimation of space use and analysis of movement behavior. In these studies,
animal movement data are primarily collected at regular time intervals. We
propose an irregular sampling design which could lead to greater efficiency and
information gain in animal movement studies. Our novel sampling design, called
lattice and random intermediate point (LARI), combines samples at regular and
random time intervals. We compare the LARI sampling design to regular sampling
designs in an example with common black carpenter ant location data, an example
with guppy location data, and a simulation study of movement with a point of
attraction. We modify a general stochastic differential equation model to allow
for irregular time intervals and use this framework to compare sampling
designs. When parameters are estimated reasonably well, regular sampling
results in greater precision and accuracy in prediction of missing data.
However, in each of the data and simulation examples explored in this paper,
LARI sampling results in more accurate and precise parameter estimation, and
thus better prediction of missing data as well. This result suggests that
researchers might gain greater insight into underlying animal movement
processes by choosing LARI sampling over regular sampling.

first 10 days of evolution reveal a B-band light curve with an abrupt drop in
luminosity. Contemporaneously, the V-band light curve exhibits a rise towards a
first peak and the r- and i-band light curves show no early peak. The early
light-curve evolution of LSQ13abf is reminiscent of the post explosion cooling
phase observed in the Type Ib SN 2008D, and the similarity between the two
objects extends over weeks. Spectroscopically, LSQ13abf resembles SN 2008D with

simultaneously fitting an Arnett model to the UVOIR light curve and the
velocity evolution derived from spectral features, and a post-shock breakout
cooling model to the first two epochs of the bolometric evolution. This
combined model suggests an explosion energy of 1.3x10$^{51}$ ergs, a relatively
high ejecta mass of 5.94 M$_{\odot}$, a Ni mass of 0.16 M$_{\odot}$, and a

of topological protection, the surface states are robust and of high quality,
allowing the observation of the quantum Hall effect, where RG exhibits phase
transitions between gapless semimetallic phase and gapped quantum spin Hall

surface states by breaking their inversion symmetry via applying a

fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, with a generalised set of few-body
coherent states. In particular, model Hamiltonians of the FQH effect are
equivalent to the real space von Neumann lattice of local projection operators
imposed on a continuous system in the thermodynamic limit. It can be
analytically derived that tuning local one-body potentials in such lattices
amounts to the tuning of individual two or few-body pseudopotentials. For some
cases, we can realise pure few-body pseudopotentials important for stabilising
exotic non-Abelian topological phases. This new approach can thus potentially
lead to experimental realisation of coveted non-Abelian quantum fluids
including the Moore-Read state and the Fibonacci state. The reformulation of
the FQHE as a sum of local projections opens up new path for rigorously proving
the incompressibility of microscopic Hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit.

computation of European and American option prices in jump-diffusion stochastic
volatility models. We first focus on the Bates-Hull-White model. We consider a
backward hybrid algorithm which uses a Markov chain approximation (a ""multiple
jumps"" tree) in the direction of the volatility and the interest rate and a
(deterministic) finite-difference approach in order to handle the underlying
asset price process. We also provide a simulation scheme to be used for Monte
Carlo evaluations. Numerical results show the reliability and efficiency of the
methods. Finally, we analyse the rate of convergence of the hybrid algorithm
applied to general jump-diffusion models. We study first-order weak convergence
of Markov chains to diffusions under quite general assumptions. Then, we prove
the convergence of the algorithm, by studying the stability and the consistency
of the hybrid scheme, in a sense that allows us to exploit the probabilistic

on a finite-sized multilayer dielectric substrate. In our approach, we enclose
each element of the structure with a fictitious surface. By applying the
equivalence principle on each surface, we derive a macromodel for each element
of the array. This macromodel consists of a linear operator that relates the
equivalent electric and magnetic current densities introduced on the fictitious
surface. Mutual coupling between the elements of the structure is captured by
the equivalent current densities in a fully accurate way. The crux of the
proposed technique is to solve for equivalent current densities on the
fictitious surface instead of directly solving for the actual current densities
on the original scatterer. When simulating complex surfaces, this approach
leads to fewer unknowns and better conditioning. We also propose a rigorous
acceleration algorithm based on the fast Fourier transform to simulate
electrically large surfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed

be challenging due to a lack of suitable sensors and interference in the
environment. Motivated by research in molecular biology, we investigate an
indirect detection mechanism using chemical reactions between the signaling
molecules and a molecular probe to produce an easy-to-measure product at the
receiver. We consider two implementations of the proposed detection mechanism,
i.e., unrestricted probe movement and probes restricted to a volume around the
receiver. The reaction-diffusion equations describing the concentrations of the
reactant and product molecules in the system are non-linear and coupled, and
cannot be solved in closed form. Therefore, we develop an efficient iterative
algorithm by discretizing the time variable and solving for the space variables
of the equations in each time step. Our results show that the concentrations of
the product molecules and the signalling molecules share a similar
characteristic over time, i.e., a single peak and a long tail. The peak and
tail values of the product molecule concentration can be controlled by choosing
probes with suitable parameters. By carefully choosing the molecular probe and
optimizing the decision threshold, the BER can be improved significantly and
outperform that of a direct detection system.

setting. However, it's very challenging to preserve differential privacy under
multiparty setting, especially for the vertically partitioned case. In this
work, we propose a new framework for differential privacy preserving multiparty
learning in the vertically partitioned setting. Our core idea is based on the
functional mechanism that achieves differential privacy of the released model
by adding noise to the objective function. We show the server can simply
dissect the objective function into single-party and cross-party sub-functions,
and allocate computation and perturbation of their polynomial coefficients to
local parties. Our method needs only one round of noise addition and secure
aggregation. The released model in our framework achieves the same utility as
applying the functional mechanism in the centralized setting. Evaluation on
real-world and synthetic datasets for linear and logistic regressions shows the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

planets and is of key importance to the evolution of protoplanetary disks
(PPDs). Characteristics of dust, such as the diversity of particle size,
porosity, charge, and the manner in which dust couples to turbulent gas, affect
the collision outcome and the rate of dust growth. Here we present a numerical
model of the evolution of the dust population within a PPD which incorporates
all of these effects. The probability that any two particles collide depends on
the particle charge, cross-sectional area and their relative velocity. The
actual collision outcome is determined by a detailed collision model which
takes into account the aggregate morphology, trajectory, orientation, and
electrostatic forces acting between charged grains. The data obtained in this
research reveal the characteristics of dust populations in different
environments at the end of the hit-and-stick growth, which establishes the
foundation for the onset of the next growth stage where bouncing, mass transfer
and fragmentation become important. For a given level of turbulence, neutral
and weakly charged particles collide more frequently and grow faster than
highly charged particles. However, highly charged particles grow to a larger
size before reaching the bouncing barrier, and exhibit a ""Runaway"" growth, in
which a few large particles grow quickly by accreting smaller particles while
the rest of the population grows very slowly. In general, highly charged
aggregates have a more compact structure and are comprised of larger monomers
than neutral/weakly charged aggregates. The differences in the particle
structure/composition not only affect the threshold velocities for bouncing and
fragmentation, but also change the scattering and absorption opacity of dust,
influencing the appearance of PPDs.

implying an upper limit to the transient surface density of $2.5\times10^{-8}$

deeper than has been achieved at sub-100 MHz frequencies and comparable flux
densities to date. The nondetection of transients in the OVRO-LWA survey,
particularly at minutes-long timescales, allows us to place further constraints
on the rate of the potential population of transients uncovered by Stewart et
al. (2016). From their transient rate, we expect a detection of
$8.4^{+31.8}_{-8.0}$ events, and the probability of our null detection is
$1.9^{+644}_{-1.9}\times10^{-3}$, ruling out a transient rate

dimensional tensor networks that underlie the modern density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. The use of MPOs accounts for the high
level of generality and wide range of applicability of DMRG. However, current
algorithms for two dimensional (2D) tensor network states, known as projected
entangled-pair states (PEPS), rarely employ the associated 2D tensor network
operators, projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), due to their
computational cost and conceptual complexity. To lower these two barriers, we
describe how to reformulate a PEPO into a set of tensor network operators that
resemble MPOs by considering the different sets of local operators that are
generated from sequential bipartitions of the 2D system. The expectation value
of a PEPO can then be evaluated on-the-fly using only the action of MPOs and
generalized MPOs at each step of the approximate contraction of the 2D tensor
network. This technique allows for the simpler construction and more efficient
energy evaluation of 2D Hamiltonians that contain finite-range interactions,
and provides an improved strategy to encode long-range interactions that is
orders of magnitude more accurate and efficient than existing schemes.

loss (the distortion) and a KL term (the rate). The rate is an upper bound on
the mutual information, which is often interpreted as a regularizer that
controls the degree of compression. We here examine whether inclusion of the
rate also acts as an inductive bias that improves generalization. We perform
rate-distortion analyses that control the strength of the rate term, the
network capacity, and the difficulty of the generalization problem. Decreasing
the strength of the rate paradoxically improves generalization in most
settings, and reducing the mutual information typically leads to underfitting.
Moreover, we show that generalization continues to improve even after the
mutual information saturates, indicating that the gap on the bound (i.e. the KL
divergence relative to the inference marginal) affects generalization. This
suggests that the standard Gaussian prior is not an inductive bias that
typically aids generalization, prompting work to understand what choices of
priors improve generalization in VAEs.

In this work, we propose to overcome these two shortcomings by a Bayesian

can ensemble complicated output distribution, enabling rich family of
trajectory distribution. The embedded physical model ensures feasibility of the

direct optimization for better performance in long prediction horizon.
Furthermore, a particle-filter-based parameter adaptation algorithm is designed
to adapt the policy Bayesian neural network to the predicted target online.
Effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified with a toy example with

of empirically assembled M dwarf/subdwarf classification templates, based on
the measurements of the TiO and CaH molecular bands, to classify M

gravity of M dwarfs/subdwarfs using the latest version of BT-Settl model
atmospheres. We apply these methods to a set of low-to-medium resolution
optical spectra of 1,544 high proper-motion (> 0.4""/yr) M dwarfs/subdwarfs. Our
metallicity estimates appear to be consistent with the expected color-magnitude
variation of stars relative to atmospheric composition, as our sample shows a
clear stratification with respect to metallicity in the Gaia H-R diagram.
Furthermore, the measured chemical parameters of the two components in 48
binary systems are in a good agreement with each other, which suggest a
precision of 0.22 dex in [M/H], 0.08 dex in [alpha/Fe], and 0.16 dex in the
combined index [alpha/Fe]+[M/H]. There is also a good consistency between
metallicity class, obtained from the empirical classification templates, and
the index [alpha/Fe]+[M/H] (~ [alpha/H]), obtained from model-fitting, which
means that the more easily measured metallicity class can be used as a
relatively reliable indicator of absolute alpha-element abundance, [alpha/H],
in low-mass stars. Finally, we examine the distribution of our stars in the
[alpha/Fe] vs. [M/H] diagram, which shows evidence of clustering in chemical
abundance makeup, suggestive of discrete populations among the local disk and
halo stars.

scale, we study the continuous variable (CV) teleportation of the cat state via
a satellite in low-Earth-orbit. Past studies have shown that the quantum
character of the cat state can be preserved after CV teleportation, even when
taking into account the detector efficiency. However, the channel transmission
loss has not been taken into consideration. Traditionally, optical fibers with
fixed attenuation are used as teleportation channels. Our results show that in
such a setup, the quantum character of the cat state is lost after 5dB of
channel loss. We then investigate the free-space channel between the Earth and
a satellite, where the loss is caused by atmospheric turbulence. For a
down-link channel of less than 500km and 30dB of loss, we find that the
teleported state preserves higher fidelity relative to a fixed attenuation
channel. The results in this work will be important for deployments over
Earth-Satellite channels of protocols dependent on cat-state qubits.

selling or brokering drugs, weapons, stolen credit cards, and other illicit
goods. To combat illicit transactions in the cyberspace, it is important to
analyze the behaviors of participants in darknet markets. Currently, many
studies focus on studying the behavior of vendors. However, there is no much
work on analyzing buyers. The key challenge is that the buyers are anonymized
in darknet markets. For most of the darknet markets, We only observe the first
and last digits of a buyer's ID, such as ``a**b''. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a hidden buyer identification model, called UNMIX, which can group the
transactions from one hidden buyer into one cluster given a transaction
sequence from an anonymized ID. UNMIX is able to model the temporal dynamics
information as well as the product, comment, and vendor information associated
with each transaction. As a result, the transactions with similar patterns in
terms of time and content group together as the subsequence from one hidden
buyer. Experiments on the data collected from three real-world darknet markets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach measured by various clustering
metrics. Case studies on real transaction sequences explicitly show that our
approach can group transactions with similar patterns into the same clusters.

J. Daligault, Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 205001 (2019)]. Like other ab-initio
calculations, the approach offers a very useful comparison with the
experimental measurements and permits an extension into conditions not covered
by the experiments. The energy relaxation rate is related to the friction
coefficients felt by individual ions due to their non-adiabatic interactions
with electrons. Each coefficient satisfies a Kubo relation given by the time
integral of the autocorrelation function of the interaction force between an
ion and the electrons. These Kubo relations are evaluated using the output of
quantum molecular dynamics calculations in which electrons are treated in the
framework of finite-temperature density functional theory. The calculation
presents difficulties that are unlike those encountered with the Kubo formulas
for the electrical and thermal conductivities. In particular, the widely used
Kubo-Greenwood approximation is inapplicable here. Indeed, the friction
coefficients and the energy relaxation rate diverge in this approximation since
it does not properly account for the electronic screening of electron-ion
interactions. The inclusion of screening effects considerably complicates the
calculations. We discuss the physically-motivated approximations we applied to
deal with these complications in order to investigate a widest range of
materials and physical conditions.

Nishiwaki features practical pattern matching for non-free data types by
providing an extensible non-linear pattern-matching facility with backtracking.
However, they implemented their proposal only in an interpreter of the Egison
programming language, and a method for compiling pattern-matching expressions
of Egison was not discussed. This paper proposes a method for translating a
program that contains pattern-matching expressions of Egison to a program that
contains only the existing syntax constructs of functional programming
languages. This method is based on the three key ideas: (i) transformation of a
matcher to a function that takes a pattern and a target, and returns lists of
triples of a pattern, a matcher, and a target; (ii) compilation of match-all to
application of the map function; (iii) transformation of a value pattern to a
function that takes an intermediate pattern-matching result and returns a
value. This paper shows the proposed method works by showing Scheme macros that
provide the users the pattern-matching facility of Egison. This paper also

most existing works concern about the structural properties. To use machine
learning to detect phase transitions and accurately identify the critical
transition point associated with dynamical processes on complex networks thus
stands out as an open and significant problem. Here we develop a framework
combining supervised and unsupervised learning, incorporating proper sampling
of training data set. In particular, using epidemic spreading dynamics on
complex networks as a paradigmatic setting, we start from supervised learning
alone and identify situations that degrade the performance. To overcome the
difficulties leads to the idea of exploiting confusion scheme, effectively a
combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. We demonstrate that the
scheme performs well for identifying phase transitions associated with
spreading dynamics on homogeneous networks, but the performance deteriorates
for heterogeneous networks. To strive to meet this challenge leads to the
realization that sampling the training data set is necessary for heterogeneous
networks, and we test two sampling methods: one based on the hub nodes together
with their neighbors and another based on k-core of the network. The end result
is a general machine learning framework for detecting phase transition and
accurately identifying the critical transition point, which is robust,
computationally efficient, and universally applicable to complex networks of
arbitrary size and topology. Extensive tests using synthetic and empirical
networks verify the virtues of the articulated framework, opening the door to
exploiting machine learning for understanding, detection, prediction, and

a smooth, non-monotonic behavior of the thermal conductivity with respect to

catastrophic during or just after inflation, and yet no new physics has been
seen to alter this. Furthermore, modern developments in quantum gravity suggest
that the SM degrees of freedom are not unique; that a typical low energy
effective theory should include a large assortment of hidden sector degrees of
freedom. It is therefore puzzling that cosmological constraints from BBN and
CMB reveal that the early universe was almost entirely dominated by the SM,
when the inflaton $\phi$ could have decayed into many sectors. In this work we
propose the following explanation for all of this: we allow the lowest
dimension operators with natural coefficients between the inflaton and both the
Higgs and hidden sectors. Such hidden sectors are assumed to be entirely
natural; this means all unprotected masses are pushed up to high scales and
project out of the spectrum, while only massless (or protected) degrees of
freedom remain, and so the inflaton can only reheat these sectors through
higher dimension (and suppressed) operators. On the other hand, the SM
possesses a special feature: it includes a light Higgs $H$, presumably for life
to exist, and hence it allows a super-renormalizable coupling to the inflaton
$\phi H^\dagger H$, which allows rapid decay into the SM. We show that this
naturally (i) removes the instability in the Higgs potential both during and
after inflation due to a tree-level effect that increases the value of the
Higgs self-coupling from the IR to the UV when one passes the inflaton mass,
(ii) explains why the SM is dominant in the early universe, (iii) allows dark
matter to form in hidden sector/s through subsequent dynamics (or axions, etc),
(iv) allows for high reheating and baryogenesis, and (v) accounts for why there
so far has been no direct detection of dark matter or new physics beyond the
SM.

nodes in parallel, each computing parameter updates with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) and sharing them asynchronously through a central parameter

SGD updates in a cluster scales sublinearly, saturating as the number of nodes
increases. In this paper, we present a solution to predicting training
throughput from profiling traces collected from a single-node configuration.
Our approach is able to model the interaction of multiple nodes and the
scheduling of concurrent transmissions between the parameter server and each
node. By accounting for the dependencies between received parts and pending
computations, we predict overlaps between computation and communication and
generate synthetic execution traces for configurations with multiple nodes. We
validate our approach on TensorFlow training jobs for popular image
classification neural networks, on AWS and on our in-house cluster, using nodes
equipped with GPUs or only with CPUs. We also investigate the effects of data
transmission policies used in TensorFlow and the accuracy of our approach when
combined with optimizations of the transmission schedule.

common phenomena that cause significant human and economic losses every year.
Experts use heterogeneous features such as slope, elevation, land cover,
lithology, rock age, and rock family to predict landslides. To work with such
features, we adapted convolutional neural networks to consider relative spatial
information for the prediction task. Traditional filters in these networks
either have a fixed orientation or are rotationally invariant. Intuitively, the
filters should orient uphill, but there is not enough data to learn the concept
of uphill; instead, it can be provided as prior knowledge. We propose a model
called Locally Aligned Convolutional Neural Network, LACNN, that follows the
ground surface at multiple scales to predict possible landslide occurrence for
a single point. To validate our method, we created a standardized dataset of
georeferenced images consisting of the heterogeneous features as inputs, and
compared our method to several baselines, including linear regression, a neural
network, and a convolutional network, using log-likelihood error and Receiver
Operating Characteristic curves on the test set. Our model achieves 2-7%
improvement in terms of accuracy and 2-15% boost in terms of log likelihood

then fit their shapes and orientations with a triaxial ellipsoid model. While
the orientations of both DM haloes and CGs change significantly due to repeated
mergers and mass accretions, their relative orientations are well aligned at
each epoch even at high redshifts, $z>1$. The alignment becomes tighter with
cosmic time; the major axes of the CGs and their host DM haloes at present are
aligned on average within $\sim 30^{\circ}$ in the three dimensional space and
$\sim 20^{\circ}$ in the projected plane. The orientations of the major axes of
DM haloes on average follow one of the eigen-vectors of the surrounding tidal
field that corresponds to the {\it slowest collapsing} (or even stretching)

that the orientations of CGs and DM haloes at the present epoch are largely

that the broad inverted-pyramid structure of existing deep-learning based

criterion combined with two network pruning schemes is introduced to adaptively
shrink every involved convolutional layer in a data-driven manner. The
resulting network architecture presents a slender bottleneck-like structure. We
have conducted extensive experiments on BOSSBase+BOWS2 dataset, more diverse
ALASKA dataset and even a large-scale subset extracted from ImageNet CLS-LOC

our proposed CALPA-NET can achieve comparative performance with less than two

search is combined with two metaheuristics, namely iterated local search and
iterated tabu search, while non-dominance exploitation is embedded within the
iterated Lin-Kernighan metaheuristic. The resultant metaheuristics are called
ILS+NDS, ITS+NDS and ILK+NDE, respectively. Empirical studies on some TSP and

Recent work has shown that model covariance matrices can be precise, and that
at relatively large scales they can also be accurate. We introduce a
data-driven method that can identify features from a mock covariance matrix
that are missing from a corresponding model, then incorporate them into the
model without significantly degrading the model's precision. We apply this
method to a BOSS-like survey and extend a model covariance to be valid at

thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which places an inherent trade-off
between the precision of a desirable output and the amount of energy

lower bound, while the ribosome operates $\sim5$ times farther from this bound.
This difference originates from the enhanced binding discrimination of the
polymerase which allows it to operate effectively as a reduced reaction cycle
prioritizing correct product formation. We show that approaching this limit
also decouples the thermodynamic uncertainty factor from speed and error,
thereby relaxing the accuracy-speed trade-off of the system. Altogether, our
results show that operating near this reduced cycle limit not only minimizes
thermodynamic uncertainty, but also results in global performance enhancement

Sampling based motion planners are proven to be the most effective for such
high dimensional planning problems with real time constraints. Unluckily random
stochastic samplers suffer from the phenomenon of 'narrow passages' or
bottleneck regions which need targeted sampling to improve their convergence
rate. Also identifying these bottleneck regions in a diverse set of planning

excellent mechanical properties, generally refer to alloys with multiple
equimolar or nearly equimolar elements. According to this definition, Si-Ge-Sn
alloys with equal or comparable concentrations of the three Group IV elements
belong to the category of HEAs. As a result, the equimolar elements of Si-Ge-Sn
alloys likely cause their atomic structures to exhibit the same core effects of
metallic HEAs such as lattice distortion. Here we apply density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to show that the SiGeSn HEA indeed exhibits a large
local distortion effect. Unlike metallic HEAs, our Monte Carlo and DFT
calculations show that the SiGeSn HEA exhibits no chemical short-range order
due to the similar electronegativity of the constituent elements, thereby
increasing the configurational entropy of the SiGeSn HEA. Hybrid density
functional calculations show that the SiGeSn HEA remains semiconducting with a
band gap of 0.38 eV, promising for economical and compatible mid-infrared
optoelectronics applications. We then study the energetics of neutral single
Si, Ge, and Sn vacancies and (expectedly) find wide distributions of vacancy
formation energies, similar to those found in metallic HEAs. However, we also
find anomalously small lower bounds (e.g., 0.04 eV for a Si vacancy) in the
energy distributions, which arise from the bond reformation near the vacancy.
Such small vacancy formation energies and their associated bond reformations
retain the semiconducting behavior of the SiGeSn HEA, which may be a signature
feature of a semiconducting HEA that differentiates from metallic HEAs.

many industrial applications, such as recommendation systems and online
advertising. CTR prediction systems are usually based on multi-field
categorical features, i.e., every feature is categorical and belongs to one and
only one field. Modeling feature conjunctions is crucial for CTR prediction
accuracy. However, it requires a massive number of parameters to explicitly
model all feature conjunctions, which is not scalable for real-world production
systems. In this paper, we describe a novel Field-Leveraged Embedding Network
(FLEN) which has been deployed in the commercial recommender system in Meitu
and serves the main traffic. FLEN devises a field-wise bi-interaction pooling
technique. By suitably exploiting field information, the field-wise
bi-interaction pooling captures both inter-field and intra-field feature
conjunctions with a small number of model parameters and an acceptable time
complexity for industrial applications. We show that a variety of
state-of-the-art CTR models can be expressed under this technique. Furthermore,
we develop Dicefactor: a dropout technique to prevent independent latent
features from co-adapting. Extensive experiments, including offline evaluations
and online A/B testing on real production systems, demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of FLEN against the state-of-the-arts. Notably,
FLEN has obtained 5.19% improvement on CTR with 1/6 of memory usage and
computation time, compared to last version (i.e. NFM).

to model complex probability density functions in lower-dimensional space.
Also, applying such models to high-dimensional image data to model the PDF has
shown poor generalization, with out-of-distribution data being assigned equal
or higher likelihood than in-sample data. Methods to deal with this have been
proposed that deviate from a fully unsupervised approach, requiring large
ensembles or additional knowledge about the data, not commonly available in the
real-world. In this work, the previously offered reasoning behind these issues
is challenged empirically, and it is shown that data-sets such as MNIST
fashion/digits and CIFAR10/SVHN are trivially separable and have no overlap on
their respective data manifolds that explains the higher OoD likelihood. Models
like masked autoregressive flows and block neural autoregressive flows are
shown to not suffer from OoD likelihood issues to the extent of GLOW,
PixelCNN++, and real NVP. A new avenue is also explored which involves a change
of basis to a new space of the same dimension with an orthonormal unitary basis
of eigenvectors before modeling. In the test data-sets and models, this aids in
pushing down the relative likelihood of the contrastive OoD data set and
improve discrimination results. The significance of the density of the original
space is maintained, while invertibility remains tractable. Finally, a look to
the previous generation of generative models in the form of probabilistic
principal component analysis is inspired, and revisited for the same data-sets

proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue model that can generate

pre-trained language model is used to initialize an encoder and decoder, and
personal attribute embeddings are devised to model richer dialogue contexts by
encoding speakers' personas together with dialogue histories. Further, to
incorporate the target persona in the decoding process and to balance its
contribution, an attention routing structure is devised in the decoder to merge
features extracted from the target persona and dialogue contexts using
dynamically predicted weights. Our model can utilize persona-sparse dialogues
in a unified manner during the training process, and can also control the
amount of persona-related features to exhibit during the inference process.
Both automatic and manual evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for generating more coherent and persona
consistent responses with persona-sparse data.

neutrinos are of Dirac type, naturally acquiring sub-eV mass after electroweak

by choosing a different $B-L$ charge for right handed neutrinos than the usual
$-1$ so that the Dirac Yukawa coupling involves an additional neutrinophilic
scalar doublet instead of the usual Higgs doublet. The model can be made
anomaly free by considering four additional chiral fermions which give rise to
two massive Dirac fermions by appropriate choice of singlet scalars. The choice
of scalars not only helps in achieving the desired particle mass spectra via
spontaneous symmetry breaking, but also leaves a remnant $Z_2 \times Z'_2$
symmetry to stabilise the two dark matter candidates. Apart from this
interesting link between Dirac nature of light neutrinos and multi-component
dark matter sector, we also find that the dark matter parameter space is
constrained mostly by the cosmological upper limit on effective relativistic
degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ which gets enhanced in this model due
to the thermalisation of the light right handed neutrinos by virtue of their
sizeable $B-L$ gauge interactions.

SGM can converge challenging states where the Maximum Overlap Method (MOM) or

  perturbation","There are 6 figures and the draft is of 24 pages",,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Conformational change of a DNA molecule is frequently observed in multiple
biological processes and has been modelled using a chain of strongly coupled
oscillators with a nonlinear bistable potential. While the mechanism and
properties of conformational change in the model have been investigated and
several reduced order models developed, the conformational dynamics as a
function of the length of the oscillator chain is relatively less clear. To
address this, we used a modified Lindstedt-Poincare method and numerical
computations. We calculate a perturbation expansion of the frequency of the
model's nonzero modes, finding that approximating these modes with their
unperturbed dynamics, as in a previous reduced order model, may not hold when
the length of the DNA model increases. We investigate the conformational change
to local perturbation in models of varying lengths, finding that for chosen
input and parameters, there are two regions of DNA length in the model, first
where the minimum energy required to undergo the conformational change
increases with DNA length; and second, where it is almost independent of the
length of the DNA model. We analyze the conformational change in these models
by adding randomness to the local perturbation, finding that the tendency of
the system to remain in a stable conformation against random perturbation
decreases with an increase in the DNA length. These results should help to
understand the role of the length of a DNA molecule in influencing its
conformational dynamics.

other recent investigations based on the VVV data. In particular, we estimated
the bulge mass to be in the range 13 to 17 billion solar masses, the
X-component to be between 18% and 25% of the bulge mass, and the bulge angle

critical role in determining its sensitivity for the detection of point
$\gamma$-ray sources in the multi-TeV energy range. The GRAPES-3 an EAS array
located at Ooty in India (11.4$^{\circ}$N, 76.7$^{\circ}$E, 2200 m altitude) is
designed to study $\gamma$-rays in the TeV-PeV energy range. It comprises of a
dense array of 400 plastic scintillators deployed over an area of 25000 m$^2$
and a large area (560 m$^2$) muon telescope. A new statistical method allowed
real time determination of the propagation delay of each detector in the
GRAPES-3 array. The shape of shower front is known to be curved and here the
details of a new method developed for accurate measurement of the shower front
curvature is presented. These two developments have led to a sizable
improvement in the angular resolution of GRAPES-3 array. It is shown that the
curvature depends on the size and age of an EAS. By employing two different
techniques, namely, the odd-even and the left-right methods, independent
estimates of the angular resolution are obtained. The odd-even method estimates
the best achievable resolution of the array. For obtaining the angular
resolution, the left-right method is used after implementing the size and age
dependent curvature corrections. A comparison of the angular resolution as a
function of EAS energy by these two methods shows them be virtually
indistinguishable. The angular resolution of GRAPES-3 array is 47$^{\prime}$
for energies E$>$5 TeV and improves to 17$^{\prime}$ at E$>$100 TeV and finally
approaching 10$^{\prime}$ at E$>$500 TeV.

delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the
integrity of the server can be efficiently verified by the client. Recently, a
new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational
delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the
server, the client pays a reward to the server. The rational server sends
messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the
classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational
quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational
delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational
sumcheck protocol. The construction of the previous rational protocols depends
on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any
local gate set. Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward
function satisfies natural requirements. We also discuss the reward gap. Simply
speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the
server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept
an incorrect answer. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only
exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a
constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled
rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server
is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the
learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing.
Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence
between $rational$ and $ordinary$ delegated quantum computing protocols. This
equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method.

polarization fields using the shape and alignment parameters, $\beta$ and
$\alpha$, that are constructed from the contour Minkowski tensor. The primary
goal of our paper is to understand the effect of weak gravitational lensing on
the morphology of the CMB fields. In order to isolate different physical
effects that can be potentially confused with the effect of lensing, we first
study the effect of varying the cosmology on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and show
that they are relatively insensitive to variation of cosmological parameters.
Next we analyze the signatures of hemispherical anisotropy, and show that
information of such anisotropy in $\alpha$ gets washed out at small angular
scales and become pronounced only at large angular scales. For $\beta$ we find
characteristic distortions which vary with the field threshold. We then study
the effect of weak gravitational lensing using simulations of lensed
temperature and $E$ and $B$ modes. We quantify the distortion induced in the
fields across different angular scales. We find that lensing makes structures
of all fields increasingly more anisotropic as we probe down to smaller scales.
We find distinct behaviour of morphological distortions as a function of
threshold for the different fields. The effect is small for temperature and $E$
mode, while it is significantly large for $B$ mode. Further, we find that
lensing does not induce statistical anisotropy, as expected from the isotropic
distribution of large scale structure of matter. We expect that the results
obtained in this work will provide insights on the reconstruction of the
lensing potential.

In contrast to classical systems, the underlying quantum dynamics results not
only from atomic interactions but also from the long-range coherence of the
many-body wave function. Experimentally, nonequilibrium states of quantum
fluids are usually created using moving objects or laser potentials, directly
perturbing and detecting the system's density. However the fate of long-range
phase coherence for hydrodynamic motion of disordered quantum systems is less
explored, especially in three dimension. Here, we unravel how the density and
phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^6$Li$_2$ molecules respond
upon quenching on or off an optical speckle potential. We find that, as the
disorder is switched on, long-range phase coherence breaks down one order of
magnitude faster than the density of the quantum gas responds. After removing
it, the system needs two orders of magnitude longer times to reestablish
quantum coherence, compared to the density response. We compare our results
with numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on large
three-dimensional grids, finding an overall good agreement. Our results shed
light on the importance of long-range coherence and possibly long-lived phase
excitations for the relaxation of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems.

where individuals eventually take the correct action regardless of their
private information. Classical results identify classes of information

typically, even when asymptotic learning occurs, it takes a very long time. In
this paper related questions are referred. The paper studies whether there is a
natural family of information structures for which the time it takes until
individuals learn is uniformly bounded from above. Indeed, we propose a simple
bi-parametric criterion that defines the information structure, and on top of
that compute the time by which individuals learn (with high probability) for
any pair of parameters. Namely, we identify a family of information structures
where individuals learn uniformly fast. The underlying technical tool we deploy

supermartingales. This result extends an earlier result of Fudenberg and Levine

activity from the FSRQ PKS 0736+017 (z=0.189) with Fermi, the H.E.S.S. array of

goal of studying the gamma-ray emission in the VHE band. H.E.S.S. ToO

2015. Together with Fermi-LAT, the multi-wavelength coverage of the flare
includes Swift observations in soft-X-rays and optical/UV, and optical
monitoring (photometry and spectro-polarimetry) by the Steward Observatory, the
ATOM, the KAIT and the ASAS-SN telescope. VHE emission from PKS 0736+017 was

indicate the presence of a gamma-ray flare, peaking at the time of the H.E.S.S.
detection, with a flux doubling time-scale of around six hours. The gamma-ray
flare was accompanied by at least a 1 mag brightening of the non-thermal
optical continuum. No simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths are
available for the night of the H.E.S.S. detection. The gamma-ray observations
with H.E.S.S. and Fermi are used to put constraints on the location of the
gamma-ray emitting region during the flare: it is constrained to be just
outside the radius of the broad-line-region with a bulk Lorentz factor $\simeq
20$, or at the level of the radius of the dusty torus with Gamma > 60. PKS
0736+017 is the seventh FSRQ known to emit VHE photons and, at z=0.189, is the
nearest so far. The location of the gamma-ray emitting region during the flare
can be tightly constrained thanks to opacity, variability, and collimation
arguments.

exposure times into a single high-quality image. The image signal processing
pipeline (ISP) is a core component in digital cameras to perform these
operations. It includes demosaicing of raw color filter array (CFA) data at
different exposure times, alignment of the exposures, conversion to HDR domain,
and exposure merging into an HDR image. Traditionally, such pipelines cascade
algorithms that address these individual subtasks. However, cascaded designs
suffer from error propagation, since simply combining multiple steps is not
necessarily optimal for the entire imaging task. This paper proposes a
multi-exposure HDR image signal processing pipeline (Merging-ISP) to jointly
solve all these subtasks. Our pipeline is modeled by a deep neural network
architecture. As such, it is end-to-end trainable, circumvents the use of
hand-crafted and potentially complex algorithms, and mitigates error
propagation. Merging-ISP enables direct reconstructions of HDR images of
dynamic scenes from multiple raw CFA images with different exposures. We
compare Merging-ISP against several state-of-the-art cascaded pipelines. The
proposed method provides HDR reconstructions of high perceptual quality and it
quantitatively outperforms competing ISPs by more than 1 dB in terms of PSNR.

suggested as potential polluters. We investigate the spectral properties of
proto-GCs that would host a supermassive star. Our main goal is to quantify how
such a star would affect the integrated light of the cluster, and to study the
detectability of such objects. We computed non-LTE atmosphere models for SMS
with various combinations of stellar parameters (luminosity, effective
temperature, and mass) and metallicities appropriate for GCs, and we predict
their emergent spectra. Using these spectra, we calculated the total emission
of young proto-GCs with SMS as predicted in a previously reported scenario, and
we computed synthetic photometry in UV, optical, and near-IR bands, in
particular for the JWST. At an effective temperature of 10000 K, the spectrum
of SMSs shows a Balmer break in emission. This feature is due to strong non-LTE
effects (implied by the high luminosity) and is not observed in normal stars.
The hydrogen lines also show a peculiar behavior, with Balmer lines in emission
while higher series lines are in absorption. At 7000 K, the Balmer break shows
a strong absorption. At high effective temperatures, the Lyman break is found
in emission. Cool and luminous SMSs are found to dominate the integrated
spectrum of the cluster, except for the UV range. The predicted magnitudes of
these proto-GCs are m_AB~28-30 between 0.7 and 8 um and for redshifts z~4-10,
which is detectable with the JWST. The peculiar observational features of cool
SMSs imply that they might in principle be detected in color-color diagrams
that probe the spectral energy distribution below and above the Balmer break.

zero friction and wear between two contacted solid surfaces, provides a
revolutionary solution to the above challenge. We investigate three types of
superlubric nanogenerators (SLNGs), namely the capacitor-based, triboelectric,
and electret-based SLNGs, and systematically analyze the influences of material
and structural parameters to these SLNGs' performances. We demonstrate that
SLNGs can achieve not only enduring lifespans, but also superb performances -
three orders of magnitude in current densities and output powers higher than
those of conventional nanogenerators. Furthermore, SLNGs can be driven by very
weak external loads (down to ~1 ${\mu}$N) in very low frequencies (down to ~1
${\mu}$Hz), and are thus capable to harvest electric energies from an extremely
board spectrum of environments and biosystems. Among the three types of SLNGs,
the capacitor-based is synthetically most competitive in the senses of
performance, fabrication and maintaining. These results can guide designs and
accelerate fabrications of SLNGs toward real applications.

quasiparticle excitations resembling the long sought after Weyl fermions at
special band-crossing points in the band structure denoted as Weyl nodes. They
are predicted to exhibit a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) due to
the chiral anomaly if the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl
points. However, current jetting effects, i.e. current inhomogeneities caused
by a strong, field-induced conductivity anisotropy in semimetals, have a
similar experimental signature and therefore have hindered a determination of
the intrinsic LMR in the TaAs family so far. This work investigates the
longitudinal magnetoresistance of all four members of this family along the
crystallographic $a$ and $c$ direction. Our samples are of similar quality as
those previously studied in the literature and have a similar chemical
potential as indicated by matching quantum oscillation (QO) frequencies. Care
was taken to ensure homogeneous currents in all measurements. As opposed to
previous studies where this was not done, we find a positive LMR that saturates
in fields above 4 T in TaP, NbP and NbAs for $B||c$. Using Fermi-surface
geometries from band structure calculations that had been confirmed by
experiment, we show that this is the behaviour expected from a classical purely
orbital effect, independent on the distance of the Weyl node to the Fermi
energy. The TaAs family of compounds is the first to show such a simple LMR
without apparent influences of scattering anisotropy. In configurations where
the orbital effect is small, i.e. for $B||a$ in NbAs and NbP, we find a
non-monotonous LMR including regions of negative LMR. We discuss a weak
antilocalisation scenario as an alternative interpretation than the chiral
anomaly for these results, since it can fully account for the overall field
dependence.

light of recent findings about genome spatial organisation. By analogy with the
genetic code, we posit that the concept of code can only be used if the

an intermediary physical entity mediating the correspondence between codewords
and objects in a gratuitous and evolvable way. In the context of the gene
regulatory code, the encoded objects are the gene expression levels, while the
concentrations of specific transcription factors in the cell nucleus provide
the codewords. The notion of code is meaningful in the absence of direct
physicochemical relationships between the objects and the codewords, when the
mediation by an adaptor is required. We propose that a plausible adaptor for
this code is the gene domain, that is, the genome segment delimited by
topological insulators and comprising the gene and its enhancer regulatory
sequences. We review recent evidences, based on genome-wide chromosome
conformation capture experiments, showing that preferential contact domains
found in metazoan genomes are the physical traces of gene domains. Accordingly,
genome 3D folding plays a direct role in shaping the developmental gene
regulatory code.

theory of topological insulators. In particular it is shown that the Landau
Hamiltonian has a generalized even time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Secondly, a
new tool for the computation of the topological numbers associated with each
Landau level is introduced. The latter is obtained by combining the Dixmier
trace and the (resolvent of the) harmonic oscillator. Finally, these results
are extended to models with non-Abelian magnetic fields. Two models are
investigated in details: the Jaynes-Cummings model and the ""Quaternionic""

Despite significant improvement in some specific applications (e.g., medical

improves interaction robustness and motion dynamics. Passive controllers show
promising results in this direction; however, they often rely on virtual energy
tanks that can guarantee passivity as long as they do not run out of energy. In
this paper, a Fractal Attractor is proposed to implement a variable impedance
controller that can retain passivity without relying on energy tanks. The
controller generates a Fractal Attractor around the desired state using an
asymptotic stable potential field, making the controller robust to
discretization and numerical integration errors. The results prove that it can
accurately track both trajectories and end-effector forces during interaction.
Therefore, these properties make the controller ideal for applications
requiring robust dynamic interaction at the end-effector.

energy of an electron-hole pair is transferred to a third charge carrier. It is
a common effect in colloidal quantum dots that quenches the radiative emission
with an Auger recombination time below nanoseconds. In self-assembled QDs, the
Auger recombination has been observed with a much longer recombination time in
the order of microseconds. Here, we use two-color laser excitation on the
exciton and trion transition in resonance fluorescence on a single
self-assembled quantum dot to monitor in real-time every quantum event of the
Auger process. Full counting statistics on the random telegraph signal give
access to the cumulants and demonstrate the tunability of the Fano factor from
a Poissonian to a sub-Poissonian distribution by Auger-mediated electron

optically the charge carrier occupation of the dot by the incident laser

differential categories, which generalizes the exponential function $e^x$ from
classical differential calculus. A differential exponential map is an
endomorphism which is compatible with the differential combinator in such a way
that generalizations of $e^0 = 1$, $e^{x+y} = e^x e^y$, and $\frac{\partial
e^x}{\partial x} = e^x$ all hold. Every differential exponential map induces a
commutative rig, which we call a differential exponential rig, and conversely,
every differential exponential rig induces a differential exponential map. In
particular, differential exponential maps can be defined without the need of
limits, converging power series, or unique solutions of certain differential
equations -- which most Cartesian differential categories do not necessarily
have. That said, we do explain how every differential exponential map does
provide solutions to certain differential equations, and conversely how in the
presence of unique solutions, one can derivative a differential exponential
map. Examples of differential exponential maps in the Cartesian differential
category of real smooth functions include the exponential function, the complex
exponential function, the split complex exponential function, and the dual

also study differential exponential maps in the coKleisli category of a

optical and near-IR wavelengths using angular and polarimetric differential
imaging techniques. This provided the first images of scattered light from the
debris disk with a spatial resolution reaching 25 mas and an inner working

disk are constrained by fitting 3D models for the scattering of an optically
thin dust disk. Investigating the possible origin of the disk gap, we
introduced putative planets therein and modeled the planet-disk and
planet-planet dynamical interactions. The obtained planetary architectures are
compared with the detection limit curves. The debris disk has an axisymmetric
ring structure with a radius of $0.42(\pm 0.01)''$ or $\sim45$ au and an
inclination of $71(\pm 2.5)^\circ$ and exhibits a $0.4''$ ($\sim40$ au) wide
inner cavity. From the polarimetric data, we derive a polarized flux contrast
for the disk of $(F_{\rm pol})_{\rm disk}/F_{\rm \ast}> (3.1 \pm 1.2)\cdot
10^{-4}$ in the RI band. The fractional scattered polarized flux of the disk is
eight times smaller than the fractional infrared flux excess. This ratio is
similar to the one obtained for the debris disk HIP 79977 indicating that dust
radiation properties are not very different between these two disks. Inside the
disk cavity we achieve the high sensitivity limits on planetary companions with
a mass down to $\sim 4 M_{\rm J}$ at projected radial separations between

holomorphic primary operator only excites a right-moving quasiparticle and an
anti-holomorphic primary operator only excites a left-moving one. The reduced

the RDM of the interval without any quasiparticles. Moreover, the RDMs of two
intervals hosting quasiparticles at different positions are also orthogonal to

the photometric reverberation mapping technique. Oncoming LSST data will
decrease the uncertainties in the dark energy determination using
reverberating--mapped sources, particularly at high redshifts. We present the
first steps in modelling of light curves for H$\beta$ and MgII and discuss the
quasar selection in the context of photometric reverberation mapping with LSST.
With the onset of the LSST era, we expect a huge rise in the overall quasar
counts and redshift range covered ($z\leq7.0$), which will provide a better
constraint of AGN properties with cosmological purposes.

profile of distant galaxies and cosmological parameters. However, these
measurements could be affected by the surrounding environment of the lens
galaxy. Thus, it is important to evaluate the cluster-scale mass for detailed
mass modeling. We observed the {\it Eye of Horus}, a DSP system discovered by
the Subaru HSC--SSP, with XMM--Newton. We detected two X-ray extended
emissions, originating from two clusters, one centered at the {\it Eye of
Horus}, and the other located $\sim100$ arcsec northeast to the {\it Eye of
Horus}. We determined the dynamical mass assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, and
evaluated their contributions to the lens mass interior of the Einstein radius.
The contribution of the former cluster is
$1.1^{+1.2}_{-0.5}\times10^{12}~M_{\odot}$, which is $21-76\%$ of the total
mass within the Einstein radius. The discrepancy is likely due to the complex
gravitational structure along the line of sight. On the other hand, the
contribution of the latter cluster is only $\sim2\%$ on the {\it Eye of Horus}.
Therefore, the influence associated with this cluster can be ignored.

Recently, energy harvesting micro-devices that operate using the pyroelectric
effect gained attention due to their potential superior performance. Operation
of these devices is based on the cyclic motion of a pyroelectric capacitor that
operates between a high temperature and a low temperature reservoirs. In this
paper, we investigate the dynamics of oscillations of a pyroelectric capacitor
self sustained by thermally actuated bimetal micro-cantilevers, a topic which
is so far under investigated. In addition to highlighting key thermodynamic
aspects of the operation, we explore conditions for self-sustained oscillations
and discuss the viability of operation at the mechanical resonance frequency.
The analysis is presented for a new design inspired by the device proposed in
Refs.\cite{2011,2012}, where in contrast, our proposed design boasts the
following features: The pyroelectric capacitor remains parallel to the heat
reservoirs, by virtue of its symmetric support by two bimetallic cantilever
beams; In addition, the cyclic operation of the device does not require
physical contact, thus lowering the risk of mechanical failure; To adjust the
damping force imparted by the surrounding gas, the thermal reservoirs are
equipped with trenches. To study the dynamic operation of the device, we
developed a physically based reduced order, yet accurate, model that accounts
for the heat transfer between and within the different components, and for the
various forces including the gas damping force. The model is embedded within an
optimization algorithm to produce optimal designs over the range 26-38 C of
temperature difference between the two reservoirs. The corresponding range of
harvested power density is 0.4-0.65 mW/cm2.

the structure of hadronic matter. At low momentum transfers, the exchange of a
few Regge trajectories leads to a comprehensive account of the cross-sections.
Among these trajectories, which are related to the mass spectrum of families of
mesons, the Pomeron plays an interesting role as it is related to glue-ball
excitations. At high momentum transfers, the exchange of these collective
excitations is expected to reduce to the exchange of their simplest (quark or
gluon) components. However, contributions from unitarity rescattering cuts are
relevant even at high energies. In the JLab energy range, the asymptotic
regime, where the players in the game are current quarks and massless gluons
has not been reached yet. One has to rely on more effective degrees of freedom
adapted to the scale of the probe. A consistent picture, the Partonic
Non-Perturbative Regime, is emerging. The properties of its various components
(dressed propagators, effective coupling constants, quark wave functions, shape
of the Regge trajectories, etc) provide us with various links to hadron
properties. I will review the status of the field, will put in perspective the

depth. Here, we investigate the role of electron-phonon interaction in the
transient optical absorption of graphene by means of first-principles methods.
It is shown at equilibrium that the phonon-assisted transitions renormalize
significantly the electronic structure. As a result, absorption peak around the
Van Hove singularity broadens and redshifts by around 100\,meV. In addition,
temperature increase and chemical doping are shown to notably enhance these
phonon-assisted features. In the photoinduced transient response we obtain
spectral changes in close agreement with the experiments, and we associate them
to the strong renormalization of occupied and unoccupied $\pi$ bands, which
predominantly comes from the coupling with the zone-center $E_{2g}$ optical
phonon. Our estimation of the Coulomb interaction effects shows that the
phonon-assisted processes can have a dominant role even in the subpicosecond

three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of cloudlet encounters with a
Herbig star of mass 2.5 solar mass using the moving mesh code AREPO. To account
for the two possibilities of a star or a cloudlet traveling through the
interstellar medium (ISM), we put either the star or the cloudlet at rest with
respect to the background gas. For absent cooling in the adiabatic runs, almost
none of the cloudlet gas is captured due to high thermal pressure. However,
second-generation disks easily form when accounting for cooling of the gas. The
disk radii range from several 100 au to about 1000 au and associated arc-like
structures up to 10 000 au in length form around the star for runs with and
without stellar irradiation. Consistent with angular momentum conservation, the
arcs and disks are larger for larger impact parameters. Accounting for
turbulence in the cloudlet only mildly changes the model outcome. In the case
of the star being at rest with the background gas, the disk formation and mass
replenishment process is more pronounced and the associated arc-shaped
streamers are longer-lived. The results of our models confirm that late
encounter events lead to the formation of transitional disks associated with
arc-shaped structures such as observed for AB Aurigae or HD 100546. In
addition, we find that second-generation disks and their associated filamentary
arms are longer lived (>100 000 yrs) in infall events, when the star is at rest

it circulate around the body like vascular circulations besides a diffusive and

conventional physiological concept, interstitial space was the space between
cells and a micron-sized space. Fluid in interstitial spaces is thought to be
entrapped within interstitial matrix. However, our serial data have further
defined an interfacial transport zone on a solid fiber of interstitial matrix.
Within this fine space that is probably nanosized, fluid can transport along a
fiber under a driving power. Since 2006, our imaging data from volunteers and
cadavers have revealed a long-distance extravascular pathway for interstitial
fluid flow, comprising four types of anatomic distributions at least. The
framework of each extravascular pathway contains the longitudinally assembled

  The central complication this system then presents us with, apart from us

the logistic source term in the first equation. It is this interplay that still

  To illustrate how close the interaction of the $uv$ term in the second

classical global solvability, we further give a short argument showing that

$\beta$, the only relevant dimensionless parameter is the coupling constant

Phys. {\bf 80}, 811--824 (1995)] have derived an infinite sequence of sum rules
for the coefficients of the short-distance expansion of particle pair
correlation function. In the context of the equivalent fractional quantum Hall
effect, by using specific methods of quantum geometry Haldane [PRL {\bf 107},
116801 (2011) and arXiv:1112.0990v2] derived a self-dual relation for the
Landau-level guiding-center structure factor. In this paper, we establish the
relation between the guiding-center structure factor and the pair correlation
function of jellium particles. It is shown that the self-dual formula, which
provides an exact relation between the pair correlation function and its
Fourier component, comes directly from the short-distance symmetry of the bulk
jellium. The short-distant symmetry of pair correlations is extended to the
semi-infinite geometry of a rectilinear plain hard wall with a fixed surface
charge density, constraining particles to a half-space. The symmetry is derived
for the original jellium model as well as its simplified version with no
background charge (charged wall surface with ``counter-ions only''). The
obtained results are checked at the exactly solvable free-fermion coupling
$\Gamma=2$.

quantization $\hat{X}$ of $X$ to minimize the privacy leakage of $S$ to
$\hat{X}$ while maintaining a certain level of utility (or, inversely, the
quantization loss). The variables $S$ and $S$ are treated as bounded and
non-probabilistic, but are otherwise general. We consider two existing
non-stochastic privacy measures, namely the maximum uncertainty reduction
$L_0(S \rightarrow \hat{X})$ and the refined information $I_*(S; \hat{X})$
(also called the maximin information) of $S$. For each privacy measure, we
propose a corresponding agglomerative clustering algorithm that converges to a
locally optimal quantization solution $\hat{X}$ by iteratively merging elements
in the alphabet of $X$. To instantiate the solution to this problem, we
consider two specific utility measures, the worst-case resolution of $X$ by
observing $\hat{X}$ and the maximal distortion of the released data $\hat{X}$.
We show that the value of the maximin information $I_*(S; \hat{X})$ can be
determined by dividing the confusability graph into connected subgraphs. Hence,
$I_*(S; \hat{X})$ can be reduced by merging nodes connecting subgraphs. The
relation to the probabilistic information-theoretic privacy is also studied by
noting that the G{\'a}cs-K{\""o}rner common information is the stochastic

Zipf's law only temporarily and, therefore, spuriously. A truly Zipfian
dynamics is characterized by a dynamical constraint, or coherence, among the
parameters of the generating PDF, and the number of elements in the system. A
clear-cut example of such coherence is natural language. Our framework allows
us to derive some quantitative results that go well beyond the usual Zipf's

spuriously; this allows an assessment of the largest possible magnitude of an
earthquake occurring in a geographical region. ii) We prove that Zipfian

coherently, while world cities do not. iii) Our concept of coherence can be

decouple to form a new state of matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).
Such a state of matter existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang in which
the universe was created. Several experimental observables, sensitive to the
evolution of the system after the nuclear collisions, reveal important
information about the properties of the QGP. Among such observables is the
production rate of strange quarks. It is now confirmed that the strange quarks
would be produced with higher probability in a QGP scenario with respect to
that expected in a pure hadron gas scenario. Therefore, studies of strangeness
production can help to determine the properties of the created system. The
studies are now revised at much higher LHC energies and are compared with the
lower energy measurements to clarify the full picture. The work which will be
presented here is related to the strangeness production in p--Pb collisions
with ALICE detector. These collisions in particular, can contribute to the
understanding of the differences between small and large interacting systems.

holographic array to realize extreme spatial resolution, incredible energy
efficiency, and unprecedented spectral efficiency. At present, however, its
fundamental limits have not been conclusively established. A major challenge
for the analysis and understanding of such a paradigm shift is the lack of
mathematically tractable and numerically reproducible channel models that
retain some semblance to the physical reality. Detailed physical models are, in
general, too complex for tractable analysis. This paper aims to take a closer
look at this interdisciplinary challenge. Particularly, we consider the
small-scale fading in the far-field, and we model it as a zero-mean,
spatially-stationary, and correlated Gaussian scalar random field.
Physically-meaningful correlation is obtained by requiring that the random
field be consistent with the scalar Helmholtz equation. This formulation leads
directly to a rather simple and exact description of the three-dimensional
small-scale fading as a Fourier plane-wave spectral representation. Suitably
discretized, this leads to a discrete representation for the field as a Fourier
plane-wave series expansion, from which a computationally efficient way to
generate samples of the small-scale fading over spatially-constrained compact
spaces is developed. The connections with the conventional tools of linear
systems theory and Fourier transform are thoroughly discussed.

Hyperelasticity describes a nonlinear elastic behavior where the second
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is given as a derivative of a scalar function
representing the stored (strain) energy. Since the stored energy encodes all
mechanical properties of the underlying material, the inverse problem of
computing this energy from measurements of the displacement field is very
important regarding SHM. The mathematical model is represented by a
high-dimensional parameter identification problem for a nonlinear, hyperbolic
system with given initial and boundary values. Iterative methods for solving
this problem, such as the Landweber iteration, are very time-consuming. The
reason is the fact that such methods demand for several numerical solutions of
the hyperbolic system in each iteration step. In this contribution we present
an iterative method based on sequential subspace optimization (SESOP) which in
general uses more than only one search direction per iteration and explicitly
determines the step size. This leads to a significant acceleration compared to
the Landweber method, even with only one search direction and an optimized step
size. This is demonstrated by means of several numerical tests.

places for concurrent networks to daily exchange terabytes of data traffic.
Although very reliable, these facilities are not immune to failure and may
experience difficulties that can have significant impacts on exchanged traffic.
In this paper we devise a methodology to identify collocation facilities in
traceroute data and to monitor delay and routing patterns between facilities.
We also present an anomaly detection technique to report abnormal traffic
changes usually due to facilities outages. We evaluate this method with eight
months of traceroute data from the RIPE Atlas measurement platform and manually
inspect the most prominent events, that are: an IXP outage, a DDoS attack, and
a power failure in a facility. These case studies validate the benefits of the
proposed system to detect real world outages from traceroute data. We also
investigate the impact of anomalies at the metropolitan-level and identify
outages that span across up to eight facilities.

  Added Nodes by Inverse Cholesky Factorization of a Partitioned Matrix",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To accelerate the existing Broad Learning System (BLS) for new added nodes in
[7], we extend the inverse Cholesky factorization in [10] to deduce an
efficient inverse Cholesky factorization for a Hermitian matrix partitioned
into 2 * 2 blocks, which is utilized to develop the proposed BLS algorithm 1.
The proposed BLS algorithm 1 compute the ridge solution (i.e, the output
weights) from the inverse Cholesky factor of the Hermitian matrix in the ridge
inverse, and update the inverse Cholesky factor efficiently. From the proposed
BLS algorithm 1, we deduce the proposed ridge inverse, which can be obtained
from the generalized inverse in [7] by just change one matrix in the equation
to compute the newly added sub-matrix. We also modify the proposed algorithm 1
into the proposed algorithm 2, which is equivalent to the existing BLS
algorithm [7] in terms of numerical computations. The proposed algorithms 1 and
2 can reduce the computational complexity, since usually the Hermitian matrix
in the ridge inverse is smaller than the ridge inverse. With respect to the
existing BLS algorithm, the proposed algorithms 1 and 2 usually require about
13 and 2 3 of complexities, respectively, while in numerical experiments they
achieve the speedups (in each additional training time) of 2.40 - 2.91 and 1.36
- 1.60, respectively. Numerical experiments also show that the proposed
algorithm 1 and the standard ridge solution always bear the same testing
accuracy, and usually so do the proposed algorithm 2 and the existing BLS
algorithm. The existing BLS assumes the ridge parameter lamda->0, since it is
based on the generalized inverse with the ridge regression approximation. When
the assumption of lamda-> 0 is not satisfied, the standard ridge solution
obviously achieves a better testing accuracy than the existing BLS algorithm in
numerical experiments.

such a method does not require any expensive sensors. We show reduced order

efficiently with lattices of high connectivity. The basic idea is to fine-grain
the physical degrees of freedom, i.e., decompose them into more fundamental
units which, after a suitable coarse-graining, provide the original ones.
Thanks to this procedure, the original lattice with high connectivity is
transformed by an isometry into a simpler structure, which is easier to
simulate via usual tensor network methods. In particular this enables the use
of standard schemes to contract infinite 2d tensor networks - such as Corner
Transfer Matrix Renormalization schemes - which are more involved on complex
lattice structures. We prove the validity of our approach by numerically
computing the ground-state properties of the ferromagnetic spin-1
transverse-field Ising model on the 2d triangular and 3d stacked triangular
lattice, as well as of the hard-core and soft-core Bose-Hubbard models on the

improved performance in several regimes.

remains unchanged if pixels of width 25\AA are considered, and decreases by

rapidly grown in recent years providing high throughput and easy deployment.
Nowadays, Access Points (APs) can be found easily wherever we go, therefore
Wi-Fi sensing applications have caught a great deal of interest from the
research community. Since human presence and movement influence the Wi-Fi
signals transmitted by APs, it is possible to exploit those signals for person
Re-Identification (Re-ID) task. Traditional techniques for Wi-Fi sensing
applications are usually based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
measurement. However, recently, due to the RSSI instability, the researchers in
this field propose Channel State Information (CSI) measurement based methods.
In this paper we explain how changes in Signal Noise Ratio (SNR), obtained from
CSI measurements, combined with Neural Networks can be used for person Re-ID
achieving remarkable preliminary results. Due to the lack of available public
data in the current state-of-the-art to test such type of task, we acquired a
dataset that properly fits the aforementioned task.

anonymize the representation. In this paper, we focus on the protection of
speaker identity and study the extent to which users can be recognized based on
the encoded representation of their speech as obtained by a deep

and verification experiments on the Librispeech corpus with open and closed

propose to use adversarial training to learn representations that perform well

increased protection of the speaker identity in practice. We suggest several

Retrofit control can accomplish modular design of control systems, i.e.,
independent design of subcontrollers only with its corresponding subsystem
model in a dynamical network system. In the retrofit control framework, the
network system to be controlled is regarded as an interconnected system
composed of the subsystem of interest and an environment. Existing studies have
revealed that all retrofit controllers can be characterized as a constrained
Youla parameterization under the technical assumption that the subsystem of
interest is stable. It has also been discovered that all of the retrofit
controllers that belong to a particular tractable class have a distinctive
internal structure composed of a rectifier and an internal controller under the
additional technical assumption that the interconnection signal from the
environment to the subsystem of interest is measurable or that the internal
state of the subsystem of interest is measurable. Due to the internal
structure, the retrofit controller design problem under the assumptions can be
reduced to a standard controller design problem to which existing controller
synthesis techniques can be applied. The aim of this paper is to extend the
above results without the technical assumptions. It is found that the existing
developments can naturally be generalized through the Youla parameterization
for unstable systems and an explicit description of the inverse system with the
geometric control theory. The result leads to the conclusion that retrofit
controllers can readily be designed even in the general case.

of data, they often cannot process the data due to limited energy and
computational power. To empower MTC with intelligence, edge machine learning
has been proposed. However, power allocation in this paradigm requires
maximizing the learning performance instead of the communication throughput,
for which the celebrated water-filling and max-min fairness algorithms become
inefficient. To this end, this paper proposes learning centric power allocation
(LCPA), which provides a new perspective on radio resource allocation in
learning driven scenarios. By employing 1) an empirical classification error
model that is supported by learning theory and 2) an uncertainty sampling
method that accounts for different distributions at users, LCPA is formulated
as a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, and is solved using a
majorization minimization (MM) framework. To get deeper insights into LCPA,
asymptotic analysis shows that the transmit powers are inversely proportional
to the channel gains, and scale exponentially with the learning parameters.
This is in contrast to traditional power allocations where quality of wireless
channels is the only consideration. Last but not least, a large-scale
optimization algorithm termed mirror-prox LCPA is further proposed to enable
LCPA in large-scale settings. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed LCPA algorithms outperform traditional power allocation algorithms,
and the large-scale optimization algorithm reduces the computation time by
orders of magnitude compared with MM-based LCPA but still achieves competing
learning performance.

changing the Internet topology and economy, and has become the subject of a

different aspects of the remote peering ecosystem by applying our methodology

interest in fair machine learning. While plenty of fair algorithms have been
proposed recently to tackle this challenge for discrete variables, only a few
ideas exist for continuous ones. The objective in this paper is to ensure some
independence level between the outputs of regression models and any given
continuous sensitive variables. For this purpose, we use the
Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) maximal correlation coefficient as a fairness
metric. We propose two approaches to minimize the HGR coefficient. First, by
reducing an upper bound of the HGR with a neural network estimation of the
$\chi^{2}$ divergence. Second, by minimizing the HGR directly with an
adversarial neural network architecture. The idea is to predict the output Y
while minimizing the ability of an adversarial neural network to find the
estimated transformations which are required to predict the HGR coefficient. We
empirically assess and compare our approaches and demonstrate significant
improvements on previously presented work in the field.

been made in 3D hand pose estimation. Nevertheless, it is still far from being
solved for its cluttered circumstance and severe self-occlusion of hand. In
this paper, we propose a method that takes advantage of human hand
morphological topology (HMT) structure to improve the pose estimation
performance. The main contributions of our work can be listed as below.
Firstly, in order to extract more powerful features, we concatenate original
and last layer of initial feature extraction module to preserve hand
information better. Next, regression module inspired from hand morphological
topology is proposed. In this submodule, we design a tree-like network
structure according to hand joints distribution to make use of high order
dependency of hand joints. Lastly, we conducted sufficient ablation experiments
to verify our proposed method on each dataset. Experimental results on three
popular hand pose dataset show superior performance of our method compared with
the state-of-the-art methods. On ICVL and NYU dataset, our method outperforms
great improvement over 2D state-of-the-art methods. On MSRA dataset, our method
achieves comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods. To summarize,
our method is the most efficient method which can run at 220:7 fps on a single
GPU compared with approximate accurate methods at present. The code will be

context, as solar generators are geographically dispersed and ground
measurements are not always easy to obtain, it is very important to have
general models that can predict solar irradiance without the need of local

irradiance in any general location without the need of ground measurements is
proposed. To do so, the model considers satellite-based measurements and
weather-based forecasts, and employs a deep neural network structure that is
able to generalize across locations; particularly, the network is trained only
using a small subset of sites where ground data is available, and the model is
able to generalize to a much larger number of locations where ground data does
not exist. As a case study, 25 locations in The Netherlands are considered and
the proposed model is compared against four local models that are individually
trained for each location using ground measurements. Despite the general nature
of the model, it is shown show that the proposed model is equal or better than
the local models: when comparing the average performance across all the
locations and prediction horizons, the proposed model obtains a 31.31% rRMSE

properties.We use time-resolved photometry from the Rapid Eye Mount telescope
and Kepler2 data to study the multi-wavelength variability, and archival
optical and IR data to track accretion, rotation, and changes in disk
structure. The observations reveal details of the structure and matter
transport through the inner disk. The eclipses show 5d quasi-periodicity, with
the phase drifting in time and some periods showing increased/decreased eclipse
depth and frequency. Dips are consistent with extinction by slightly processed
dust grains in an inclined, irregularly-shaped inner disk locked to the star
through two relatively stable accretion structures. The grains are located near
the dust sublimation radius ($\sim$0.06 au) at the corotation radius, and can
explain the shadows observed in the outer disk. The total mass (gas and dust)
required to produce the eclipses and shadows is a few % of a Ceres mass. Such
amount of mass is accreted/replenished by accretion in days to weeks, which
explains the variability from period to period. Spitzer and WISE variability
reveal variations in the dust content in the innermost disk on a few years
timescale, which is consistent with small imbalances (compared to the stellar
accretion rate) in the matter transport from the outer to the inner disk. A
decrease in the accretion rate is observed at the times of less eclipsing
variability and low mid-IR fluxes, confirming this picture. The v$sini$=16km/s
confirms that the star cannot be aligned with the outer disk, but is likely
close to equator-on and to be aligned with the inner disk. This anomalous
orientation is a challenge for standard theories of protoplanetary disk
formation.

phenomenon visibly manifests in non-local transport measurement, where the
negative refraction generates a return peak in the real-space conductance. This
provides a unique signature of the Fermi arc surface states. We discuss the
appearance of this peak both in inversion and time-reversal symmetric Weyl
semimetals, where the latter exhibits conductance oscillations due to multiple

each layer, we learn a value dictionary and an assignment matrix to represent

the value dictionary, many different reduction problems such as non-uniform

CNN for segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) in radiotherapy treatment

target clinical use may be lacking. To overcome this issue, we use multi-label
instead of multi-class segmentation. We empirically assess how many clinical
delineations would be sufficient to train a CNN for the segmentation of OARs
and find that increasing the training set size beyond a limited number of

multi-label segmentation, missing structures in the reference standard do not
have a negative effect on overall segmentation accuracy. These results indicate
that segmentations obtained in a clinical workflow can be used to train an

Networks (CNNs) --- unlike brains --- are often highly sensitive to small
perturbations of their input, e.g. adversarial noise leading to erroneous
decisions. We propose to regularize CNNs using large-scale neuroscience data to
learn more robust neural features in terms of representational similarity. We
presented natural images to mice and measured the responses of thousands of
neurons from cortical visual areas. Next, we denoised the notoriously variable
neural activity using strong predictive models trained on this large corpus of
responses from the mouse visual system, and calculated the representational
similarity for millions of pairs of images from the model's predictions. We
then used the neural representation similarity to regularize CNNs trained on
image classification by penalizing intermediate representations that deviated
from neural ones. This preserved performance of baseline models when
classifying images under standard benchmarks, while maintaining substantially
higher performance compared to baseline or control models when classifying
noisy images. Moreover, the models regularized with cortical representations
also improved model robustness in terms of adversarial attacks. This
demonstrates that regularizing with neural data can be an effective tool to
create an inductive bias towards more robust inference.

transformation of the underlying microstructure triggered by its local
instabilities, rearrangements, and rotations. Depending on the presence and
magnitude of such a transformation, effective properties of a metamaterial may
change significantly. To capture this phenomenon accurately and efficiently,
homogenization schemes are required that reflect microstructural as well as
macro-structural instabilities, large deformations, and non-local effects. To
this end, a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has recently been
developed, which employs the particular microstructural transformation as a
non-local mechanism, magnitude of which is governed by an additional coupled
partial differential equation. Upon discretizing the resulting problem it turns
out that the macroscopic stiffness matrix requires integration of macro-element
basis functions as well as their derivatives, thus calling for a higher-order
integration rules. Because evaluation of constitutive law in multiscale schemes
involves an expensive solution of a non-linear boundary value problem,
computational efficiency can be improved by reducing the number of integration
points. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate reduced-order
schemes in computational homogenization, with emphasis on the stability of the
resulting elements. In particular, arguments for lowering the order of
integration from the expensive mass-matrix to a cheaper stiffness-matrix
equivalent are first outlined. An efficient one-point integration quadrilateral
element is then introduced and proper hourglass stabilization discussed.
Performance of the resulting set of elements is finally tested on a benchmark
bending example, showing that we achieve accuracy comparable to the full
quadrature rules.

Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the past decades. The EHR data can be
regarded as a collection of clinical events, including laboratory results,
medication records, physiological indicators, etc, which can be used for
clinical outcome prediction tasks to support constructions of intelligent
health systems. Learning patient representation from these clinical events for
the clinical outcome prediction is an important but challenging step. Most
related studies transform EHR data of a patient into a sequence of clinical
events in temporal order and then use sequential models to learn patient
representations for outcome prediction. However, clinical event sequence
contains thousands of event types and temporal dependencies. We further make an
observation that clinical events occurring in a short period are not
constrained by any temporal order but events in a long term are influenced by
temporal dependencies. The multi-scale temporal property makes it difficult for
traditional sequential models to capture the short-term co-occurrence and the
long-term temporal dependencies in clinical event sequences. In response to the
above challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-level Representation Model (MRM).
MRM first uses a sparse attention mechanism to model the short-term
co-occurrence, then uses interval-based event pooling to remove redundant
information and reduce sequence length and finally predicts clinical outcomes
through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experiments on real-world datasets
indicate that our proposed model largely improves the performance of clinical

processes the input using a bag-of-word model lacking the ability to recognize
important word sequences. This aspect could negatively affect the

to use word n-grams to try to overcome some of these limitations.
Unfortunately, when working with text streams, using n-grams is not trivial
since the system must learn and recognize which n-grams are important ""on the

recognize useful patterns over text streams dynamically. We evaluated our model

designers who wish to formalize their datatype declarations and also to
implementors keen to have principled inference of principal types.

adversarial example attack approaches, the GAN-based adversarial attack example
approach can generate the adversarial samples quickly using the GAN
architecture every time facing a new sample after training, but meanwhile needs
to perturb the attack samples in great quantities, which results in the
unpractical application in reality. To address this issue, we propose a new
approach, named Few-Feature-Attack-GAN (FFA-GAN). FFA-GAN has a significant
time-consuming advantage than the non-learning adversarial samples approaches
and a better non-zero-features performance than the GANbased adversarial sample
approaches. FFA-GAN can automatically generate the attack samples in the
black-box attack through the GAN architecture instead of the evolutional
algorithms or the other non-learning approaches. Besides, we introduce the mask
mechanism into the generator network of the GAN architecture to optimize the
constraint issue, which can also be regarded as the sparsity problem of the
important features. During the training, the different weights of losses of the
generator are set in the different training phases to ensure the divergence of
the two above mentioned parallel networks of the generator. Experiments are

in euclidean space. Real networks have complex structural features which play a
significant role in dynamics in them, and thus the structural and dynamical
information of complex networks can not be directly learned by existing neural

is used and, with the help of confusion scheme, we can identify precisely the
outbreak threshold of epidemic dynamics. To represent the high dimensional

network by using graph representation learning algorithms and discretize the
embedded space to convert it into an image-like structure. We then creatively
merge the nodal dynamical states with the structural embedding by multi-channel
images. In this manner, the proposed model can draw the conclusion from both
structural and dynamical information. A large number of simulations show a
great performance in both synthetic and empirical network data set. Our

inversion lemma, while the square-root BLS updates the upper-triangular inverse
Cholesky factor by multiplying it with an upper-triangular intermediate matrix.
When the added p training samples are more than the total k nodes in the
network, i.e., p>k, the inverse of a sum of matrices is applied to take a
smaller matrix inversion or inverse Cholesky factorization. For the distributed
BLS with data-parallelism, we introduce the parallel implementation of the
square-root BLS, which is deduced from the parallel implementation of the
inverse Cholesky factorization.
  The original BLS based on the generalized inverse with the ridge regression
assumes the ridge parameter lamda->0 in the ridge inverse. When lambda->0 is
not satisfied, the numerical experiments on the MNIST and NORB datasets show
that both the proposed ridge solutions improve the testing accuracy of the
original BLS, and the improvement becomes more significant as lambda is bigger.
On the other hand, compared to the original BLS, both the proposed BLS
algorithms theoretically require less complexities, and are significantly
faster in the simulations on the MNIST dataset. The speedups in total training
time of the recursive and square-root BLS algorithms over the original BLS are
4.41 and 6.92 respectively when p > k, and are 2.80 and 1.59 respectively when

population of over 100,000 people in low and middle-income countries do not
meet air quality standards, while in high-income countries, the number has
decreased by 52%. Industries and motor vehicles are the biggest contributors to
carbon monoxide (CO).Air pollution is a severe issue in the world. The object
of research to investigate is the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) levels in
an area mapped based on the current CO levels along with the location
coordinates via GPS and LBS technology with a microcontroller and sensor-based
device.The results of testing the CO level detection devices found that high CO
levels are in the afternoon with an average CO level of 49.59656 which means
classified as dangerous if we are outdoors more than 30 minutes, can interfere
with heart function.

wireless networks both spectral-efficiently and energy-efficiently. This paper
considers an IRS-assisted the Internet of Things network for massive
connectivity. We aim to solve the IRS-related activity detection and channel
estimation problem which has not been studied before. In this paper, we
formulate the IRS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as
sparse matrix factorization, matrix completion and Multiple Measurement Vector
problem and, we propose a three-stage framework based on the approximate
message passing. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

  Appendix B.4, full version available under ISBN 978-3-947208-20-3",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The Rosetta mission delivered images of comet 67P's nucleus at unprecedented
resolution which indicate the presence of a global layering system. By merging
techniques of structural geology, statistical image processing, and solar
system science, this thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of the
formation of the layerings, and thus of cometary nuclei as a whole. I describe
the two distinctive approaches to studying the layerings' orientation on comet
67P's nucleus. First, I mapped layering-related linear features on a 3D shape
model of the nucleus, onto which I projected high-res OSIRIS images. I selected
only lineaments of substantial curvature, and used a plane-fitting algorithm to
find the normals to the layering planes represented by these lineaments. I used
the normals to confirm previous authors' results, including that the layering
systems on the comet's two lobes are geometrically independent from each other.
My results rule out the proposal that 67P's lobes represent collisional
fragments of a much larger, layered body. Second, I developed a Fourier-based
image analysis algorithm to detect lineament structures at pixel-precision. I
analysed the layering-related features exposed on the Hathor cliff on the
comet's Small Lobe. I found my algorithm to be a broadly applicable, powerful
tool for automating the detection of layerings in images where conventional
edge-detection algorithms are not effective. When correctly configured to the
target conditions, I found the algorithm to have a higher signal-to-noise
detection sensitivity than a human, while reducing over-interpretation due to
bias. In summary, I studied the layerings in the nucleus of comet 67P using
several unconventional approaches and constrained their lateral extent,
curvature, and to a degree also their thickness. Finally, I nominated two
mechanisms that could have formed these layerings in cometary nuclei.

  Additive Modeling",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the ever increasing prominence of data in retail operations, sales
forecasting has become an essential pillar in the efficient management of
inventories. When facing high demand, the use of backroom storage and intraday
shelf replenishment is necessary to avoid stock-out. In that context, the
mandatory input for any successful replenishment policy to be implemented is
access to reliable forecasts for the sales at an intraday granularity. To that
end, we use quantile regression to adapt different patterns from one product to
the other, and we develop a stable and efficient quantile additive model
algorithm to compute sales forecasts in an intradaily context. Our algorithm is
computationally fast and is therefore suitable for use in real-time dynamic
shelf replenishment. As an illustration, we examine the case of a highly
frequented store, where the demand for various alimentary products is
accurately estimated over the day with the help of the proposed algorithm.
