fill degree of the filter most insertions and queries only need to access one
or two consecutive cache lines. This makes quotient filters fast compared to
the more commonly used Bloom filters that incur multiple cache misses. However,
concurrent Bloom filters are easy to implement and can be implemented lock-free
while concurrent quotient filters are not as simple. Usually concurrent
quotient filters work by using an external array of locks -- each protecting a
region of the table. Accessing this array incurs one additional cache miss per
operation. We propose a new locking scheme that has no memory overhead. Using
this new locking scheme we achieve 1.8 times higher speedups than with the
common external locking scheme.
  Another advantage of quotient filters over Bloom filters is that a quotient
filter can change its size when it is becoming full. We implement this growing
technique for our concurrent quotient filters and adapt it in a way that allows
unbounded growing while keeping a bounded false positive rate. We call the
resulting data structure a fully expandable quotient filter. Its design is
similar to scalable Bloom filters, but we exploit some concepts inherent to
quotient filters to improve the space efficiency and the query speed.
  We also propose quotient filter variants that are aimed to reduce the number
of status bits (2-status-bit variant) or to simplify concurrent implementations
(linear probing quotient filter). The linear probing quotient filter even leads
to a lock-free concurrent filter implementation. This is especially
interesting, since we show that any lock-free implementation of another common
quotient filter variant would incur significant overheads in the form of
additional data fields or multiple passes over the accessed data.

real-world datasets show that PRINCE provides more compact explanations than
intuitive baselines, and insights from a crowdsourced user-study demonstrate
the viability of such action-based explanations. We thus posit that PRINCE

  MuonTrap allows processors to continue to speculate, avoiding significant

isolates all parts of the system that can't be quickly cleared on any change in

  MuonTrap uses these speculative filter caches, which are cleared on context

a subset of massive, stripped envelope, rapidly rotating stars. Beyond this,
our knowledge of the progenitor systems is limited. Using the BPASS (Binary
Population and Spectral Synthesis) stellar evolution models, we investigate the
possibility that some massive stars in binaries can maintain the angular
momentum required for jet production, while still loosing their outer envelope
through winds or binary interactions. We find that a total hydrogen mass of
less than 0.0005 Msun and a helium ejecta mass fraction of less than 0.20
provide the best thresholds for the supernova type II/Ibc and Ib/Ic divisions
respectively. Tidal interactions in binaries are accounted for by applying a
tidal algorithm to post-process the stellar evolution models output by BPASS.
We show that the observed volumetric gamma-ray burst rate evolution can be
recreated using two distinct pathways and plausible distributions for burst
parameters. In the first pathway, stars are spun up by mass accretion into a
quasi-homogeneous state. In the second, tides maintain rotation where otherwise
the star would spin down. Both lead to type Ic supernova progenitors, and a
metallicity distribution consistent with the GRB host galaxy population. The
inferred core angular momentum threshold for jet production is consistent with
theoretical requirements for collapsars, given the assumptions made in our

Simulations are used to verify uncertainties and quantify selection biases in

recover the binary fraction to better than 7% in the mean, with no significant

incompleteness and systematics, we derive a mass ratio distribution that rises

introduced by the atmosphere. It is one of the instrumental errors that can
affect the position of the target as perceived on the sky and its flux
distribution. This effect will affect the results of astronomical observations
if not corrected by an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC). In
high-resolution spectrographs, in order to reach a radial velocity (RV)
precision of 10 cm/s, an ADC is expected to return residuals at only a few tens
of milli-arcseconds (mas). In fact, current state-of-the-art spectrographs
conservatively require this level of residuals, although no work has been done
to quantify the impact of atmospheric dispersion. In this work we test the
effect of atmospheric dispersion on astronomical observations in general, and
in particular on RV precision degradation and flux losses. Our scientific
objective was to quantify the amount of residuals needed to fulfill the
requirements set on an ADC during the design phase. We found that up to a
dispersion of 100 mas, the effect on the RV is negligible. However, on the flux
losses, such a dispersion can create a loss of ~2% at 380 nm, a significant
value when efficiency is critical. The requirements set on ADC residuals should
take into consideration the atmospheric conditions where the ADC will function,
and also all the aspects related with not only the RV precision requirements
but also the guiding camera used, the tolerances on the flux loss, and the

maps the asymptotic AdS boundary to the vicinity of a naked singularity in a

also a map in the parameter space of exponential potentials. The correspondence
can be extended to linear fluctuations, being akin to an S-duality, and can be
interpreted in terms of 'SUSY quantum mechanics' for the fluctuation modes. The
holographic implementation of CSFI relates the UV and IR regimes of a pair of

extinction and coexistence criteria when there are one or two interacting

extinction or persistence of species, as well as what the optimal harvesting
strategies, which maximize the expected long term yield, look like. For single
species systems, we show under certain conditions that the optimal harvesting
strategy is of bang-bang type: there is a threshold under which there is no
harvesting, while everything above this threshold gets harvested.
  The second part of the paper is concerned with the analysis of ecosystems
that have two interacting species which can be harvested. In particular, we
carefully study predator-prey and competitive Ricker models when there are two
species. In this setting we show how to find the optimal proportional
harvesting strategy. If the system is of predator-prey type the optimal
proportional harvesting strategy is, depending on the interaction parameters
and the price of predators relative to prey, either to harvest the predator to
extinction and maximize the asymptotic yield of the prey or to not harvest the
prey and to maximize the asymptotic harvesting yield of the predators. If the
system is competitive, in certain instances it is optimal to drive one species
extinct and to harvest the other one. In other cases it is best to let the two
species coexist and harvest both species while maintaining coexistence.
  In the setting of the competitive Ricker model we show that if one competitor

stiff differential equations efficiently. In this work, a novel framework to
handle stiff physical terms implicitly is proposed. Both physical and numerical
stiffness originating from convection, diffusion and source terms (typically
related to reaction) can be handled by a set of predefined Time-Accurate and
highly-Stable Explicit (TASE) operators in a unified framework. The proposed
TASE operators act as preconditioners on the stiff terms and can be deployed to
any existing explicit time-marching methods straightforwardly. The resulting
time integration methods remain the original explicit time-marching schemes,
yet with nearly unconditional stability. The TASE operators can be designed to
be arbitrarily high-order accurate with Richardson extrapolation such that the
accuracy order of original explicit time-marching method is preserved.
Theoretical analyses and stability diagrams show that the $s$-stages
$s$th-order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are unconditionally stable when
preconditioned by the TASE operators with order $p \leq s$ and $p \leq 2$. On
the other hand, the $s$th-order RK methods preconditioned by the TASE operators
with order of $p \leq s$ and $p > 2$ are nearly unconditionally stable. The
only free parameter in TASE operators can be determined a priori based on
stability arguments. Unlike classical implicit methods, the TASE methodology
allows for solving non-linear problems with arbitrary order without requiring
solving a nonlinear system of equations. A set of benchmark problems with
strong stiffness is simulated to assess the performance of the TASE method.
Numerical results suggest that the proposed framework preserves the high-order
accuracy of the explicit time-marching methods with very-large time steps for
all the considered cases.

happened in a certain scene. The generation error (GE)-based methods exhibit
excellent performance on this task. They firstly train a generative neural
network (GNN) to generate normal samples, then judge the samples with large GEs
as anomalies. Almost all the GE-based methods utilize frame-level GEs to detect
anomalies. However, anomalies generally occur in local areas, the frame-level
GE introduces GEs of normal areas to anomaly discriminations, that brings two
problems: i) The GE of normal areas reduces the anomaly saliency of the
anomalous frame. ii) Different videos have different normal-GE-levels, thus it
is hard to set a uniform threshold for all videos to detect anomalies. To
address these problems, we propose a promotion method: utilize the maximum of
block-level GEs on the frame to detect anomaly. Firstly, we calculate the
block-level GEs at each position on the frame. Then, we utilize the maximum of
the block-level GEs on the frame to detect anomalies. Based on the existed GNN
models, experiments are carried out on multiple datasets. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

($a_0$), and the induced saturation magnetization ($M_{s}$). As the lattice is
gradually disordered, a critical point occurs at 1-$S$=0.6 and $a_0$=291 pm,

that below the critical point the system magnetically behaves as it would still

`minimal' (nucleonic) composition of the stellar interior, a lot of observed
stars appear to be within the r-mode instability window. One of the possible
solutions to this problem is to account for hyperons in the neutron star core.
The presence of hyperons allows for a set of powerful (lepton-free)
non-equilibrium weak processes, which increase the bulk viscosity, and thus
suppress the r-mode instability. Existing calculations of the instability
windows for hyperon NSs generally use reaction rates calculated for the
$\Sigma^-\Lambda$ hyperonic composition via the contact $W$ boson exchange
interaction. In contrast, here we employ hyperonic equations of state where the
$\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-$ are the first hyperons to appear (the $\Sigma^-$'s, if
they are present, appear at much larger densities), and consider the meson
exchange channel, which is more effective for the lepton-free weak processes.
We calculate the bulk viscosity for the non-paired $npe\mu\Lambda\Xi^-$ matter
using the meson exchange weak interaction. A number of viscosity-generating
non-equilibrium processes is considered (some of them for the first time in the
neutron-star context). The calculated reaction rates and bulk viscosity are
approximated by simple analytic formulas, easy-to-use in applications. Applying
our results to calculation of the instability window, we argue that accounting
for hyperons may be a viable solution to the r-mode problem.

zero-sum games. Proposed by Brown in 1949, FP was shown to converge to a Nash
Equilibrium by Robinson in 1951, albeit at a slow rate that may depend on the
dimension of the problem. In 1959, Karlin conjectured that FP converges at the
more natural rate of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. However, Daskalakis and Pan disproved a
version of this conjecture in 2014, showing that a slow rate can occur,
although their result relies on adversarial tie-breaking. In this paper, we
show that Karlin's conjecture is indeed correct for the class of diagonal
payoff matrices, as long as ties are broken lexicographically. Specifically, we
show that FP converges at a $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ rate in the case when the payoff
matrix is diagonal. We also prove this bound is tight by showing a matching
lower bound in the identity payoff case under the lexicographic tie-breaking

efficiently detect the state of a logical qubit without destroying it. Here we
implement QND measurements in a Si/SiGe two-qubit system, with one qubit
serving as the logical qubit and the other serving as the ancilla. Making use
of a two-qubit controlled-rotation gate, the state of the logical qubit is
mapped onto the ancilla, followed by a destructive readout of the ancilla.
Repeating this procedure enhances the logical readout fidelity from $75.5\pm
0.3\%$ to $94.5 \pm 0.2\%$ after 15 ancilla readouts. In addition, we compare
the conventional thresholding method with an improved signal processing method
called soft decoding that makes use of analog information in the readout signal
to better estimate the state of the logical qubit. We demonstrate that soft
decoding leads to a significant reduction in the required number of repetitions
when the readout errors become limited by Gaussian noise, for instance in the
case of readouts with a low signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way

percolation problems. Various strategies to select the node to be deactivated
have been studied in the literature; for instance, a simple random failure or
high-degree adaptive (HDA) percolation. Recently a new attack strategy based on
a quantity called collective-influence (CI) has been proposed from the
perspective of optimal percolation. By successively deactivating the node
having the largest CI-centrality value, it was shown to be able to dismantle a
network more quickly and abruptly than many of the existing methods. In this
paper, we focus on the critical behaviors of the percolation processes
following degree-based attack and CI-based attack on random networks. Through
extensive Monte Carlo simulations assisted by numerical solutions, we estimate
various critical exponents of the HDA percolation and those of the CI
percolations. Our results show that these attack-type percolation processes,
despite displaying apparently more abrupt collapse, nevertheless exhibit
standard mean-field critical behaviors at the percolation transition point. We
further discover an extensive degeneracy in top-centrality nodes in both
processes, which may provide a hint for understanding the observed results

Specifically we demonstrate its relevance by showing that neglecting it leads
to the loss of gauge invariance, basis-set dependence, disintegration (loss of

phase. For increasing thermal driving, characterised by the Rayleigh number,
$Ra$, of the two analysed droplet volume fractions, $\alpha = 5\times10^{-3}$
and $\alpha = 2\times 10^{-2}$, we find non-monotonic responses to the overall
heat fluxes, characterised by the Nusselt number, $Nu$. The $Nu$ number is
larger when the droplets are thermally coupled to the liquid. However, $Nu$
retains the effective scaling exponents that are close to the ${1/4}$-laminar
VC scaling, suggesting that the heat transport is still modulated by thermal
boundary layers. Local analyses reveal the non-monotonic trends of local heat
fluxes and wall-shear stresses: Whilst regions of high heat fluxes are
correlated to increased wall-shear stresses, the spatio-temporal distribution
and magnitude of the increase is non-universal, implying that the overall heat
transport is obscured by competing mechanisms. Most crucially, we find that the
transport mechanisms inherently depend on the dominance of droplet driving to
thermal driving that can quantified by (i) the bubblance parameter $b$, which
measures the ratio of energy produced by the dispersed phase and the energy of
the background turbulence, and (ii) $Ra_d/Ra$, where $Ra_d$ is the droplet
Rayleigh number, which we introduce in this paper. When $b \lesssim O(10^{-1})$
and $Ra_d/Ra \lesssim O(100)$, the $Nu$ scaling is expected to recover to the
VC scaling without droplets, and comparison with $b$ and $Ra_d/Ra$ from our

For our computation we use an ensemble simulated with pion mass $m_\pi \approx
0.296 \, \textrm{GeV}$ and spatial volume of extent $2.90 \, \textrm{fm}$. We
find in addition to the expected spectrum of two-meson scattering states
another state around $60 \, \textrm{MeV}$ below the $D K$ threshold, which we
interpret as the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)$ meson. This state couples predominantly to
a quark-antiquark interpolating field and only weakly to a $D K$ two-meson
interpolating field. The coupling to the tetraquark interpolating fields is
essentially zero, rendering a tetraquark interpretation of the
$D_{s0}^\ast(2317)$ meson rather unlikely. Moreover, we perform a scattering
analysis using L\""uscher's method and the effective range approximation to
determine the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)$ mass for infinite spatial volume. We find
this mass $51 \, \textrm{MeV}$ below the $D K$ threshold, rather close to both
our finite volume result and the experimentally observed value.

Magnetic bright points (MBPs) are dynamic, small-scale magnetic
elements often found with field strengths of the order of a kilogauss within
intergranular lanes in the photosphere. Aims. Here we study the evolution of
various physical properties inferred from inverting high-resolution full Stokes
spectropolarimetry data obtained from ground-based observations of the quiet
Sun at disc centre. Methods. Using automated feature-tracking algorithms, we
studied 300 MBPs and analysed their temporal evolution as they evolved to
kilogauss field strengths. These properties were inferred using both the NICOLE
and SIR Stokes inversion codes. We employ similar techniques to study radiative
magnetohydrodynamical simulations for comparison with our observations.
Results. Evidence was found for fast (~30 - 100s) amplification of magnetic
field strength (by a factor of 2 on average) in MBPs during their evolution in
our observations. Similar evidence for the amplification of fields is seen in
our simulated data. Conclusions. Several reasons for the amplifications were
established, namely, strong downflows preceding the amplification (convective
collapse), compression due to granular expansion and mergers with neighbouring
MBPs. Similar amplification of the fields and interpretations were found in our
simulations, as well as amplification due to vorticity. Such a fast
amplification will have implications for a wide array of topics related to
small-scale fields in the lower atmosphere, particularly with regard to
propagating wave phenomena in MBPs.

that improves the precision by estimating separate treatment effects for three
latent strata defined by potential outcomes in the experiment -- customers who
would buy regardless of ad exposure, those who would buy only if exposed to ads
and those who would not buy regardless. The overall ATE is estimated by
averaging the strata-level effects, and this produces a more precise estimator
of the ATE over a wide range of conditions typical of marketing experiments.
Analytical results and simulations show that the method decreases the sampling
variance of the ATE most when (1) there are large differences in the treatment
effect between latent strata and (2) the model used to estimate the
strata-level effects is well-identified. Applying the procedure to 5 catalog

This leads to a substantial decrease in decision errors when the estimator is

real-time applications which have strict and short delivery deadline. To
recover the maximum number of lost packets within a short time, existing packet
recovery solutions often rely on instantly decodable network coding (IDNC).
Some of these solutions can recover nearly the maximum number of lost packets
possible at the cost of collecting feedback from all (or a large percentage of)
users. This is impractical in dense networks. In addition, their runtime grows
with the number of users, which is not desirable due to the urgent delivery
deadline of real-time applications. In this work, we introduce RIDNC, a random
encoding approach to IDNC. We propose RACE, a light RIDNC encoder that can
recover nearly as many lost packets as the optimal RIDNC encoder. We compare
RACE with the CrowdWiFi encoder, a high performing packet loss recovery
solution used in CrowdWiFi, a commercial system for broadcasting live video in
dense networks. We show that RACE is up to two orders of magnitude faster than
the CrowdWiFi encoder, and recovers more lost packets in practice, where there
is not enough time to collect feedback from many users.

the present-day stellar mass, the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation, the
stellar metallicity distribution function and the cumulative star formation
history. Our model follows in detail the evolution of several chemical species
(H, He, $\alpha$-elements and Fe). We take into account detailed

coupled with the very low star formation rate predicted by the model for these

the main chemical properties, because it implies a negligible number of
core-collapse SNe and even Type Ia SNe, the most important polluters of
galaxies. On the other hand, a constant classical Salpeter IMF gives the best
agreement with data, but we cannot exclude that other formulations of the IGIMF

acquire behaviors from low-level inputs directly, but often struggles with
temporally extended tasks. Can we utilize reinforcement learning to
automatically form the abstractions needed for planning, thus obtaining the
best of both approaches? We show that goal-conditioned policies learned with RL
can be incorporated into planning, so that a planner can focus on which states
to reach, rather than how those states are reached. However, with complex state
observations such as images, not all inputs represent valid states. We
therefore also propose using a latent variable model to compactly represent the
set of valid states for the planner, so that the policies provide an
abstraction of actions, and the latent variable model provides an abstraction
of states. We compare our method with planning-based and model-free methods and
find that our method significantly outperforms prior work when evaluated on

multiple timescales. We propose a new fast-slow switching model in order to
capture these processes on appropriate timescales within a conceptual modeling
framework based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations. The fast system
captures hydrological processes that occur on minute to hour timescales during
and shortly after major rainstorms, assuming a fixed vegetation distribution.
These include key feedbacks between vegetation biomass and downhill surface
water transport, as well as between biomass and infiltration rate. The slow
system acts between rain events, on a timescale of days to months, and evolves
vegetation and soil moisture. Modeling processes at the appropriate timescales
allows parameter values to be set by the actual processes they capture. This
reduces the number of parameters that are chosen expressly to fit pattern
characteristics, or to artificially slow down fast processes by the orders of
magnitude required to align their timescales with the biomass dynamics. We
explore the fast-slow switching model through numerical simulation on a
one-dimensional hillslope, and find agreement with certain observations about
the pattern formation phenomenon, including band spacing and upslope
colonization rates. We also find that the predicted soil moisture dynamics are
consistent with time series data that has been collected at a banded vegetation

In particular, we propose to describe such ""collection of SCFTs"" in terms of 3d
$N=2$ gauge theories with ""non-linear matter'' fields valued in complex group
manifolds. As a result, we are able to recover familiar 3-manifold invariants,
such as Turaev torsion and WRT invariants, from twisted indices and
half-indices of $T[M_3]$, and propose new tools to compute more recent
$q$-series invariants $\hat Z (M_3)$ in the case of manifolds with $b_1 > 0$.
Although we use genus-1 mapping tori as our ""case study,"" many results and
techniques readily apply to more general 3-manifolds, as we illustrate
throughout the paper.

networks by introducing a variant of the concept of multi-node Basin Stability,
which allows us to gauge the global stability of the collective dynamics of the
network in response to large perturbations localized on certain nodes. We
observe that in a star network, perturbing just the hub node has the capacity
to destroy the collective state of the entire system. On the other hand, even
when a majority of the peripheral nodes are strongly perturbed, the hub manages
to restore the system to its original state. This demonstrates the drastic
effect of the centrality of the perturbed node on the collective dynamics of
the full network. Further, we explore scale-free networks of such multi-stable
oscillators and demonstrate that targetted attacks on nodes with high
centrality can destroy the collective dynamics much more efficiently than
random attacks, irrespective of the nature of the nodal dynamics and type of
perturbation. We also find clear evidence that the betweeness centrality of the
perturbed node is most crucial for dynamical robustness, with the entire system
being more vulnerable to attacks on nodes with high betweeness. These results
are crucial for deciding which nodes to stringently safeguard in order to
ensure the recovery of the network after targetted localized attacks.

thanks to the heavy optimisation of the algorithms, we can obtain these
predictions for arbitrary baryonic models and cosmology (including massive
neutrinos and dynamical dark energy models) with an almost negligible CPU cost.
Therefore, this approach is efficient enough for cosmological data analyses.

lensing signatures. We calibrate theoretical expectations for the void-lensing
signal using mock catalogs generated in a suite of 108 full-sky lensing

measure the lensing amplitude parameter in the data to be $A_L=1.10 \pm 0.21$

implementing the subtractions differentially rather than through a global

shown in fluctuation channels associated with inversion symmetry. Thus, we
claim that the inversion symmetry instability is an intrinsic characteristic of
a BG-FS under generic attractive interactions between BG quasiparticles. In
drastic contrast to the standard BCS superconductivity, a Fermi-surface may
generically survive even with the instability. We propose the experimental
setup, a second harmonic generation experiment with a strain gradient, to
detect the instability. Possible applications to iron based superconductors and
heavy fermion systems including FeSe are also discussed.

low frequency GWs of $\sim3$ to $400$ nHz (periods of $\sim11$ yr $-$ $1$ mon).
Finding no evidence for GWs, we placed limits on the strain amplitude of GW
memory events during the observation period. We then used the strain upper
limits to place limits on the rate of GW memory causing events. At a strain of
$2.5\times10^{-14}$, corresponding to the median upper limit as a function of

formation of our Galaxy when it was still in its infancy. The common picture is
that these low-metallicity stars are distributed as an isotropic,
pressure-supported component since these stars were either accreted from the
early building blocks of the assembling Milky Way, or were later brought by the
accretion of faint dwarf galaxies. Combining the metallicities and radial
velocities from the Pristine and LAMOST surveys and Gaia DR2 parallaxes and
proper motions for an unprecedented large and unbiased sample of very

This sample shows strong statistical evidence (at the $5.0\sigma$ level) of
asymmetry in their kinematics, favouring prograde motion. Moreover, we find
that $31\%$ of the stars that currently reside in the disk do not venture
outside of the disk plane throughout their orbit. The discovery of this
population implies that a significant fraction of stars with iron abundances
$[Fe/H]\leq-2.5$ formed within or concurrently with the Milky Way disk and that
the history of the disk was quiet enough to allow them to retain their

motions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their orbits
around the Milky Way. Gru II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of
25 kpc and orbital eccentricity of 0.45. Tuc V likely has an apocenter beyond
100 kpc, and could be approaching the Milky Way for the first time. The current
orbit of Tuc IV is similar to that of Gru II, with a pericenter of 25 kpc and
an eccentricity of 0.36. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc
IV demonstrates that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact
parameter of 4 kpc ~120 Myr ago, deflecting its trajectory and possibly
altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and
metallicities, we classify Gru II and Tuc IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but the

full potential of future weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this
second paper in a series of two, we combine Euclid-like mock data of the cosmic
shear power spectrum with an eROSITA X-ray mock of the cluster gas fraction to
run a combined likelihood analysis including both cosmological and baryonic
parameters. Following the first paper of this series, the baryonic effects
(based on the baryonic correction model of Schneider et al. 2019) are included
in both the tomographic power spectrum and the covariance matrix. However, this
time we assume the more realistic case of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with massive
neutrinos, and we consider several extensions of the currently favoured
cosmological model. For the standard $\Lambda$CDM case, we show that including
X-ray data reduces the uncertainties on the sum of the neutrino mass by
$\sim30$ percent, while there is only a mild improvement on other parameters
such as $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. As extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, we consider
the cases of a dynamical dark energy model (wCDM), a $f(R)$ gravity model
(fRCDM), and a mixed dark matter model ($\Lambda$MDM) with both a cold and a
warm/hot dark matter component. We find that combining weak lensing with X-ray
data only leads to a mild improvement of the constraints on the additional
parameters of wCDM, while the improvement is more substantial for both fRCDM
and $\Lambda$MDM. Ignoring baryonic effects in the analysis pipeline leads to
significant false-detections of either phantom dark energy or a light
subdominant dark matter component. Overall we conclude that for all cosmologies
considered, a general parametrisation of baryonic effects is both necessary and
sufficient to obtain tight constraints on cosmological parameters.

outflows for scales $>$30$^{\prime\prime}$ ($>$9000 au) and to probe scales
down to $\sim$1$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$300 au). The protostars were observed
with the 1.3 mm and 850 $\mu$m receivers simultaneously to detect continuum at
both wavelengths and molecular line emission from CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1),
C$^{18}$O(2-1), N$_2$D$^+$(3-2), CO(3-2), HCO$^+$(4-3), and
H$^{13}$CO$^+$(4-3). Some of the observations also used the SMA's recently
upgraded correlator, SWARM, whose broader bandwidth allowed for several more
spectral lines to be observed (e.g., SO, H$_2$CO, DCO$^+$, DCN, CS, CN). Of the
main continuum and spectral tracers observed, 84% of the images and cubes had
emission detected. The median C$^{18}$O(2-1) linewidth is $\sim$1.0 km
s$^{-1}$, which is slightly higher than those measured with single-dish

merging plays in regulating dwarf star formation is uncertain. Using imaging
from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic program, we construct a sample of
dwarf-dwarf mergers and examine the star formation and host properties of the

algorithm from a sample of 6875 spectroscopically selected isolated dwarf
galaxies at $z<0.12$ and $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)<9.6$ from the Galaxy and Mass
Assembly (GAMA) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic campaigns. We
find a total tidal feature detection fraction of 3.29% (6.1% when considering
only galaxies at $z<0.05$). The tidal feature detection fraction rises strongly
as a function of star formation activity; 15%-20% of galaxies with extremely
high H$\alpha$ equivalent width (H$\alpha$ EW > 250 Angstrom) show signs of
tidal debris. Galaxies that host tidal debris are also systematically bluer
than the average galaxy at fixed stellar mass. These findings extend the
observed dwarf-dwarf merger sequence with a significant sample of dwarf
galaxies, indicating that star formation triggered in mergers between dwarf
galaxies continues after coalescence.

a major challenge to our understanding of black holes and galaxy formation and
evolution. Their luminosity is produced by extreme gas accretion onto black
holes, which already reached masses of 10$^9$ M$_\odot$ by z ~ 6.
Simultaneously, their host galaxies form hundreds of stars per year, using up
gas in the process. To understand which environments are able to sustain the
rapid formation of these extreme sources we started a VLT/MUSE effort aimed at
characterizing the surroundings of a sample of 5.7 < z < 6.6 quasars dubbed:
the Reionization Epoch QUasar InvEstigation with MUSE (REQUIEM) survey. We here
present results of our searches for extended Ly-Alpha halos around the first 31
targets observed as part of this program. Reaching 5-sigma surface brightness
limits of 0.1-1.1 x 10$^{-17}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$ over a 1 arcsec$^2$
aperture, we were able to unveil the presence of 12 Ly-Alpha nebulae, 8 of
which are newly discovered. The detected nebulae show a variety of emission
properties and morphologies with luminosities ranging from 8 x 10$^{42}$ to 2 x
10$^{44}$ erg/s, FWHMs between 300 and 1700 km/s, sizes < 30 pkpc, and
redshifts consistent with those of the quasar host galaxies. As the first
statistical and homogeneous investigation of the circum-galactic medium of
massive galaxies at the end of the reionization epoch, the REQUIEM survey
enables the study of the evolution of the cool gas surrounding quasars in the
first 3 Gyr of the Universe. A comparison with the extended Ly-Alpha emission
observed around bright (M$_{1450}$ < -25 mag) quasars at intermediate redshift
indicates little variations on the properties of the cool gas from z ~ 6 to z ~
3 followed by a decline in the average surface brightness down to z ~ 2.

an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening
effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a
quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound
states can exist, i.e., they ""melt"". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark
pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical
process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to
be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental
measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution
inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium
recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the
melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for
static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But
recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and
dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the
recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal
equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium
reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization.
Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started
being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium
quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently.
However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the
quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the
issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar
problem: $\alpha$-$\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an
$e^-e^+\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal
field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be
resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum
system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a
plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum
system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy
quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian
approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the
environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann
transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density
matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales,
which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the
scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann
equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport
equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using
Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound
heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the
QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on
bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the
in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the
doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions.

can construct a non-Fermi liquid within a considerable energy window based on
the unique physics of unconventional QCPs. We will focus on the

self-energy scales as $\Sigma_f(i \omega) \sim i

coupling an electron fermi surface to unconventional QCPs that are beyond the
Landau's paradigm. This mechanism relies on the observation that the anomalous

close to $1$, which is significantly larger than conventional Landau phase
transitions, for example the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. The fact that $\eta
\sim 1$ justifies a perturbative renormalization group calculation proposed

the lowest quintile of statistical frailty, a QRISK3 predicted risk of 10% for

provides tighter constraints for the cosmological parameters. Moreover we

although less accurate. Thanks to the speed of the inference process with BNNs,
the posterior distribution, outcome of the neural network, can be used as the

brain, amino acids in a protein, etc.) drive high-level biological features
(sensorimotor behavior, enzymatic function) represents the central challenge of
quantitative biology. The lack of general methods for doing so from the size of
datasets that can be collected experimentally severely limits our understanding
of the biological world. For example, in neuroscience, some sensory and motor
codes have been shown to consist of precisely timed multi-spike patterns.
However, the combinatorial complexity of such pattern codes have precluded
development of methods for their comprehensive analysis. Thus, just as it is
hard to predict a protein's function based on its sequence, we still do not
understand how to accurately predict an organism's behavior based on neural
activity. Here we derive a method for solving this class of problems. We
demonstrate its utility in an application to neural data, detecting precisely
timed spike patterns that code for specific motor behaviors in a songbird vocal
system. Our method detects such codewords with an arbitrary number of spikes,
does so from small data sets, and accounts for dependencies in occurrences of
codewords. Detecting such dictionaries of important spike patterns --- rather
than merely identifying the timescale on which such patterns exist, as in some
prior approaches --- opens the door for understanding fine motor control and
the neural bases of sensorimotor learning in animals. For example, for the
first time, we identify differences in encoding motor exploration versus
typical behavior. Crucially, our method can be used not only for analysis of
neural systems, but also for understanding the structure of correlations in
other biological and nonbiological datasets.

domain to 2D. In this work, we introduce a novel representation of motion as a
voxelized 3D vector field and demonstrate how it can be used to improve
performance of action recognition networks. This volumetric representation is a
natural fit for 3D CNNs, and allows out-of-plane data augmentation techniques
during training of these networks. Both the construction of this representation
from RGB-D video and inference can be run in real time. We demonstrate superior
results using this representation with our network design on the open-source
NTU RGB+D dataset where it outperforms state-of-the-art on both of the defined
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we experimentally show how the out-of-plane
augmentation techniques create viewpoint invariance and allow the model trained
using this representation to generalize to unseen camera angles. Code is

minimize communication. Since this problem of graph partitioning is known to be
NP-complete yet crucial to practical streaming systems, many heuristic-based

paper, we present a graph-aware encoder-decoder framework to learn a
generalizable resource allocation strategy that can properly distribute
computation tasks of stream processing graphs unobserved from training data.
We, for the first time, propose to leverage graph embedding to learn the
structural information of the stream processing graphs. Jointly trained with
the graph-aware decoder using deep reinforcement learning, our approach can
effectively find optimized solutions for unseen graphs. Our experiments show
that the proposed model outperforms both METIS, a state-of-the-art graph

applications. However, processing micropayments individually can be expensive,
with transaction fees exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating these
small transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today's
decentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees.
Unfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued
sequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs to create a
large number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes
incur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, which limit their
applicability in large-scale systems.
  In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic
framework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel
escrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a
fast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it
allows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it
aggregates the micropayments using a lottery protocol that requires only secure
hashing. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets
per second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art
sequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue
rate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would
need more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our
system to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by around
50%.

studied using a novel framework. The wall-pressure power spectral density (PSD)
$(\phi_{pp}(\omega))$ is expressed as an integrated contribution from all
wall-parallel plane pairs,
$\phi_{pp}(\omega)=\int_{-\delta}^{+\delta}\int_{-\delta}^{+\delta}\Gamma(r,s,\omega)\,\mathrm{dr}\,\mathrm{ds}$,
using the Green's function. Here, $\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$ is termed the net source
cross spectral density (CSD) between two wall-parallel planes, $y=r$ and $y=s$
and $\delta$ is the half channel height. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data
at friction Reynolds number of $180$ and $400$ are used to compute
$\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$. Analysis of the net source CSD, $\Gamma(r,s,\omega)$
reveals that the location of dominant sources responsible for the premultiplied
peak in the power spectra at $\omega^+\approx 0.35$ and the wavenumber spectra
at $\lambda^+\approx 200$ is in the buffer layer at $y^+\approx 16.5$ and
$18.4$ for $Re_{\tau}=180$ and $400$, respectively. The contribution from a
wall-parallel plane (located at distance $y^+$ from the wall) to wall-pressure
PSD is log-normal in $y^+$ for $\omega^+>0.35$. A dominant inner-overlap region
interaction of the sources is observed at low frequencies. Further, the
decorrelated features of the wall-pressure fluctuation sources are analyzed
using spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). We require the modes to
be orthogonal in an inner product with a symmetric positive definite kernel.
Spectral POD supports the case that the net source is composed of two
decorrelated components - active (dominant mode) and inactive (remaining
modes). The structure represented by the dominant POD mode at the premultiplied
wall-pressure PSD peak inclines in the downstream direction. At the

can be selected from vast chemical design spaces. Seeking the design that
optimizes a rate is a particularly challenging problem since the rate
calculation for any one design is itself a difficult computation. Toward this
end, we demonstrate a strategy based on transition path sampling to generate an
ensemble of designs and reactive trajectories with a preference for fast
reaction rates. Each step of the Monte Carlo procedure requires a measure of
how a design constrains molecular configurations, expressed via the reciprocal
of the partition function for the design. Though the reciprocal of the
partition function would be prohibitively expensive to compute, we apply
Booth's method for generating unbiased estimates of a reciprocal of an integral
to sample designs without bias. A generalization with multiple trajectories
introduces a stronger preference for fast rates, pushing the sampled designs
closer to the optimal design. We illustrate the methodology on two toy models
of increasing complexity: escape of a single particle from a Lennard-Jones
potential well of tunable depth and escape from a metastable tetrahedral
cluster with tunable pair potentials.

Inspired by the emerging information theoretic-based learning algorithm, in

have larger overdensities, are more populated by red galaxies, and have better

  CNN Features","diabetic retinopathy, mini lesion detection, FPN",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. DR is
a primary cause of blindness in working-age people and it is estimated that 3
to 4 million people with diabetes are blinded by DR every year worldwide. Early
diagnosis have been considered an effective way to mitigate such problem. The
ultimate goal of our research is to develop novel machine learning techniques
to analyze the DR images generated by the fundus camera for automatically DR
diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on identifying small lesions on DR fundus
images. The results from our analysis, which include the lesion category and
their exact locations in the image, can be used to facilitate the determination
of DR severity (indicated by DR stages). Different from traditional object
detection for natural images, lesion detection for fundus images have unique
challenges. Specifically, the size of a lesion instance is usually very small,
compared with the original resolution of the fundus images, making them
diffcult to be detected. We analyze the lesion-vs-image scale carefully and
propose a large-size feature pyramid network (LFPN) to preserve more image
details for mini lesion instance detection. Our method includes an effective
region proposal strategy to increase the sensitivity. The experimental results
show that our proposed method is superior to the original feature pyramid
network (FPN) method and Faster RCNN.

as knots, lassos, and other geometrical entanglements. How proteins can fold
quickly even in the presence of such topological obstacles is a debated
question in structural biology. Recently, the hypothesis that energetic
frustration might be a mechanism to avoid topological frustration has been put
forward based on the empirical observation that loops involved in entanglements
are stabilized by weak interactions between amino-acids at their extrema. To
verify this idea, we use a toy lattice model for the folding of proteins into
two almost identical structures, one entangled and one not. As expected, the
folding time is longer when random sequences folds into the entangled
structure. This holds also under an evolutionary pressure simulated by
optimizing the folding time. It turns out that optmized protein sequences in
the entangled structure are in fact characterized by frustrated interactions at
the closures of entangled loops. This phenomenon is much less enhanced in the
control case where the entanglement is not present. Our findings, which are in
agreement with experimental observations, corroborate the idea that an
evolutionary pressure shapes the folding funnel to avoid topological and
kinetic traps.

a very interesting noise reduction strategy for local magnetic sensor
measurements, which has not been reported experimentally so far. Here, we have
fabricated multi-GMR sensors (up to 12 repetitions) keeping good GMR ratio,
linearity and low roughness. From magnetotransport measurements, two different
resistance responses have been observed with a crossover around 5 GMR
repetitions: step-like (N<5) and linear (N>5) behavior, respectively. With the
help of micromagnetic simulations, we have analyzed in detail the two main
magnetic mechanisms: the Neel coupling distribution induced by the roughness
propagation and the additive dipolar coupling between the N free layers.
Furthermore we have correlated the dipolar coupling mechanism, controlled by
the number of GMRs (N) and lateral dimensions (width), to the sensor
performance (sensitivity, noise and detectivity) in good agreement with
analytical theory. The noise roughly decreases in multi-GMRs as 1/\sqrt{N} in
both regimes (low frequency 1/f and thermal noise). The sensitivity is even
stronger reduced, scaling as 1/N, in the strong dipolar regime (narrow devices)
while converges to a constant value in the weak dipolar regime (wide devices).
Very interestingly, they are more robust against undesirable RTN noise than
single GMRs at high voltages and the linearity can be extended towards much
larger magnetic field range without dealing with the size and the reduction of
GMR ratio. Finally, we have identified the optimal conditions for which
multi-GMRs exhibit lower magnetic field detectivity than single GMRs: wide
devices operating in the thermal regime where much higher voltage can be
applied without generating remarkable magnetic noise.

importance in the economic analysis. Communities are indeed characterized by
specific properties, that are different from those of both the individual node
and the whole network, and they can affect various processes on the network. In
the International Trade Network, community detection aims to search sets of
countries (or of trade sectors) which have a high intra-cluster connectivity
and a low inter-cluster connectivity. In general, exchanges among countries
occur according to preferential economic relationships ranging over different
sectors. In this paper, we combine community detection with specific
topological indicators, such as centrality measures. As a result, a new
weighted network is constructed by the original one, in which weights are
determined taking into account all the topological indicators in a
multi-criteria approach. To solve the resulting Clique Partitioning Problem and
find homogeneous group of nations, we use a new fast algorithm, based on quick
descents to a local optimal solution. The analysis allows to cluster countries
by interconnections, economic power and intensity of trade, giving an important
overview on the international trade patterns.

known Earth-size planets will be a prime target for atmospheric
characterization with JWST. However, the detectability of atmospheric molecular
species may be severely impacted by the presence of clouds and/or hazes. In
this work, we perform 3-D General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with the
LMD Generic model supplemented by 1-D photochemistry simulations at the
terminator with the Atmos model to simulate several possible atmospheres for
TRAPPIST-1e, 1f and 1g: 1) modern Earth, 2) Archean Earth, and 3) CO2-rich
atmospheres. JWST synthetic transit spectra were computed using the GSFC
Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that TRAPPIST-1e, 1f and 1g
atmospheres, with clouds and/or hazes, could be detected using JWST's NIRSpec
prism from the CO2 absorption line at 4.3 um in less than 15 transits at 3
sigma or less than 35 transits at 5 sigma. However, our analysis suggests that
other gases would require hundreds (or thousands) of transits to be detectable.
We also find that H2O, mostly confined in the lower atmosphere, is very
challenging to detect for these planets or similar systems if the planets'
atmospheres are not in a moist greenhouse state. This result demonstrates that
the use of GCMs, self-consistently taking into account the effect of clouds and
sub-saturation, is crucial to evaluate the detectability of atmospheric
molecules of interest as well as for interpreting future detections in a more
global (and thus robust and relevant) approach.

~2GPa), resulting in a clear and measurable quasi-uniaxial strain. To
demonstrate functionality, measurements of the elastoresistance (i.e., the
change of resistance of a sample as a response to quasi-uniaxial strain) under
finite hydrostatic pressure on the iron-based compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$ are
presented as a proof-of-principle example, and discussed in the framework of
electronic nematicity. Overall, this work introduces the combination of in situ

build an infinite family of just-renormalizable models, for tensor fields with
arbitrary rank $d$. Investigating the large $ d$ limit, we show that the
self-energy melonic amplitude is decomposed as a product of loop-vertex

survive in the large $d$-limit. These two key features allow us to resum the
perturbative expansion for self-energy, providing an explicit expression for
arbitrary external momenta in terms of Lambert function. Finally, inserting
this resumed solution into the Callan-Symanzik equations, and taking into
account the strong relation between two and four-point functions arising from
melonic Ward-Takahashi identities, we then deduce an explicit expression for
relevant and marginal $\beta$-functions, valid to all orders of the

causality violation can be achieved by a system of relays: we prove that from
any event $P$ in G\""{o}del's universe, there is a future-directed lightlike
path - a sequence of future-directed null geodesic segments, laid end to end -
which has $P$ as its past and future endpoints. By analysing the envelope of
the family of future directed null geodesics emanating from a point of the
spacetime, we show that this lightlike path must contain a minimum of eight
geodesic segments, and show further that this bound is attained. We prove a
related general result, that events of a time orientable spacetime are
connected by a (closed) timelike curve if and only if they are connected by a
(closed) lightlike path. This suggests a means of violating causality in

involves localizing anomalous regions within images with applications in
industrial inspection, surveillance, and medical imaging. This task is
challenging due to the small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in
real-world scenarios. Most prior works need to use anomalous training images to
compute a class-specific threshold to localize anomalies. Without the need of
anomalous training images, we propose Convolutional Adversarial Variational
autoencoder with Guided Attention (CAVGA), which localizes the anomaly with a
convolutional latent variable to preserve the spatial information. In the
unsupervised setting, we propose an attention expansion loss where we encourage
CAVGA to focus on all normal regions in the image. Furthermore, in the
weakly-supervised setting we propose a complementary guided attention loss,
where we encourage the attention map to focus on all normal regions while
minimizing the attention map corresponding to anomalous regions in the image.
CAVGA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly localization methods on
MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTAD), modified ShanghaiTech Campus (mSTC) and
Large-scale Attention based Glaucoma (LAG) datasets in the unsupervised setting
and when using only 2% anomalous images in the weakly-supervised setting. CAVGA
also outperforms SOTA anomaly detection methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10,

exponentially with time when the input rate exceeds a certain lattice-dependent

still much faster than the naive linear in time growth. We compute the critical
input rate for hyper-cubic lattices and find that it is positive in all

answering (VQA) task. It is challenging to provide supervision for attention.
An observation we make is that visual explanations as obtained through class
activation mappings (specifically Grad-CAM) that are meant to explain the
performance of various networks could form a means of supervision. However, as
the distributions of attention maps and that of Grad-CAMs differ, it would not
be suitable to directly use these as a form of supervision. Rather, we propose
the use of a discriminator that aims to distinguish samples of visual
explanation and attention maps. The use of adversarial training of the
attention regions as a two-player game between attention and explanation serves
to bring the distributions of attention maps and visual explanations closer.
Significantly, we observe that providing such a means of supervision also
results in attention maps that are more closely related to human attention
resulting in a substantial improvement over baseline stacked attention network
(SAN) models. It also results in a good improvement in rank correlation metric
on the VQA task. This method can also be combined with recent MCB based methods
and results in consistent improvement. We also provide comparisons with other
means for learning distributions such as based on Correlation Alignment
(Coral), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Mean Square Error (MSE) losses and
observe that the adversarial loss outperforms the other forms of learning the

attention maps improve using this form of supervision.

the Cache Timing Vulnerability Score which can be used to evaluate how
vulnerable a specific cache implementation is to different attacks. A smaller
Cache Timing Vulnerability Score means the design is more secure, and the
scores among different machines can be easily compared. Evaluation is conducted
on commodity Intel and AMD processors and shows the differences in processor

introduce a simple -- yet effective -- approach. We formulate the search as a
mapping from every visual domain to a common semantic space, where categories
are represented by hyperspherical prototypes. Open cross-domain visual search
is then performed by searching in the common semantic space, regardless of
which domains are used as source or target. Domains are combined in the common
space to search from or within multiple domains simultaneously. A separate
training of every domain-specific mapping function enables an efficient scaling
to any number of domains without affecting the search performance. We
empirically illustrate our capability to perform open cross-domain visual

  This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework and its

our method fulfills an end-to-end learning of anomaly scores by a neural
deviation learning, in which we leverage a few (e.g., multiple to dozens)
labeled anomalies and a prior probability to enforce statistically significant
deviations of the anomaly scores of anomalies from that of normal data objects

stars, which cover the wide [Fe/H]=$-$3.2 to $-$1.5 dex range. The abundances
of 10 other elements are derived: Mg, Ca, Ti, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu.
Despite its small mass, Sextans is a chemically evolved system, with evidence
for the contribution of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae as well as low
metallicity AGBs. This new FLAMES sample offers a sufficiently large number of
stars with chemical abundances derived at high accuracy to firmly establish the
existence of a plateau in [$\alpha$/Fe] at $\sim 0.4$ dex, followed by a
decrease above [Fe/H]$\sim-2$ dex. This is in stark similarity with the Fornax
and Sculptor dSphs despite their very different masses and star formation
histories. This suggests that these three galaxies had very similar star
formation efficiencies in their early formation phases, probably driven by the
early accretion of smaller galactic fragments, until the UV-background heating
impacted them in different ways. The parallel between the Sculptor and Sextans
dSph is also striking when considering Ba and Eu. Finally, as to the iron-peak
elements, the decline of [Co/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] above [Fe/H]$\sim -2$ implies that
the production yields of Ni and Co in SNeIa is lower than that of Fe. The

efficiently determine the ideal number of filters to prune in each layer of a
neural network. This is in contrast to prior methods that either prune all
layers uniformly or otherwise use resource-intensive methods such as manual
sensitivity analysis or reinforcement learning to determine the ideal number.
(2) Single-shot operation: We extend CUP to CUP-SS (for CUP single shot)
whereby pruning is integrated into the initial training phase itself. This
leads to large savings in training time compared to traditional pruning
pipelines. Through extensive evaluation on multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10,

recent state of the art. Specifically, CUP-SS achieves 2.2x flops reduction for

It saves over 14 hours in training time with respect to the original Resnet-50.

complex heap-based data structures. These logics build on so-called separation
algebras, which allow expressing properties of heap regions such that
modifications to a region do not invalidate properties stated about the
remainder of the heap. This concept is key to enabling modular reasoning and
also extends to concurrency. While heaps are naturally related to mathematical
graphs, many ubiquitous graph properties are non-local in character, such as
reachability between nodes, path lengths, acyclicity and other structural
invariants, as well as data invariants which combine with these notions.
Reasoning modularly about such graph properties remains notoriously difficult,
since a local modification can have side-effects on a global property that
cannot be easily confined to a small region.
  In this paper, we address the question: What separation algebra can be used
to avoid proof arguments reverting back to tedious global reasoning in such
cases? To this end, we consider a general class of global graph properties
expressed as fixpoints of algebraic equations over graphs. We present
mathematical foundations for reasoning about this class of properties, imposing
minimal requirements on the underlying theory that allow us to define a
suitable separation algebra. Building on this theory we develop a general proof
technique for modular reasoning about global graph properties over program
heaps, in a way which can be integrated with existing separation logics. To
demonstrate our approach, we present local proofs for two challenging examples:
a priority inheritance protocol and the non-blocking concurrent Harris list.

live systems. Historically, system budgets have been described by the Q-factor
converted from the bit error rate (BER) under binary modulation and direct
detection. The introduction of hard-decision forward error correction (FEC) did
not change this. In recent years technologies have changed significantly to
comprise coherent detection, multilevel modulation and soft FEC. In such
advanced systems, different metrics such as (nomalized) generalized mutual
information (GMI/NGMI) and asymmetric information (ASI) are regarded as being
more reliable. On the other hand, Q budgets are still useful because pre-FEC
BER monitoring is established in industry for live system monitoring.
  The pre-FEC BER is easily estimated from available information of the number
of flipped bits in the FEC decoding, which does not require knowledge of the
transmitted bits that are unknown in live systems. Therefore, the use of
metrics like GMI/NGMI/ASI for performance monitoring has not been possible in
live systems. However, in this work we propose a blind soft-performance
estimation method. Based on a histogram of log-likelihood-values without the
knowledge of the transmitted bits, we show how the ASI can be estimated.
  We examined the proposed method experimentally for 16 and 64-ary quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) and probabilistically shaped 16, 64, and 256-QAM in
recirculating loop experiments. We see a relative error of 3.6%, which
corresponds to around 0.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio difference for binary
modulation, in the regime where the ASI is larger than the assumed FEC
threshold. For this proposed method, the digital signal processing circuitry
requires only a minimal additional function of storing the L-value histograms
before the soft-decision FEC decoder.

collaborative robots were tasked with fighting wildfires, they may run out of
suppressants and be temporarily unavailable to assist their peers. We consider
the problem of planning in these contexts with the additional challenges that
the agents are unable to communicate with each other and that there are many of
them. Because an agent's optimal action depends on the actions of others, each
agent must not only predict the actions of its peers, but, before that, reason
whether they are even present to perform an action. Addressing openness thus
requires agents to model each other's presence, which becomes computationally
intractable with high numbers of agents. We present a novel, principled, and
scalable method in this context that enables an agent to reason about others'
presence in its shared environment and their actions. Our method extrapolates
models of a few peers to the overall behavior of the many-agent system, and
combines it with a generalization of Monte Carlo tree search to perform
individual agent reasoning in many-agent open environments. Theoretical
analyses establish the number of agents to model in order to achieve acceptable
worst case bounds on extrapolation error, as well as regret bounds on the
agent's utility from modeling only some neighbors. Simulations of multiagent

problems under uncertainty, very few have considered UCARP, and none consider
collaboration between vehicles to handle the negative effects of uncertainty.
This paper proposes a novel Solution Construction Procedure (SCP) that
generates solutions to UCARP within a collaborative, multi-vehicle framework.
It consists of two types of collaborative activities: one when a vehicle
unexpectedly expends capacity (\emph{route failure}), and the other during the
refill process. Then, we propose a Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH)
algorithm to evolve the routing policy used within the collaborative framework.
The experimental studies show that the new heuristic with vehicle collaboration

be especially true on instances with larger numbers of tasks and vehicles. This
clearly shows the advantage of vehicle collaboration in handling the uncertain

non-local functional of the velocity gradient field. This anisotropic pressure
Hessian plays a key role in the velocity gradient dynamics, for example in
preventing finite-time singularities, but it is difficult to understand and
model due to its non-locality and complexity. In this work a gauge symmetry for

the dynamics of the eigenframe variables remain unchanged. We then exploit this
gauge symmetry to perform a rank reduction on the three-dimensional anisotropic

dynamical activity of the newly introduced rank-reduced anisotropic pressure
Hessian is confined to two dimensional manifolds in the three dimensional flow,

in several application domains, robustness of these models to adversarial

robustness of flow-based generative models both theoretically (for some simple

flow-based generative model and compute optimal sample-specific and universal
adversarial perturbations that maximally decrease the likelihood scores. Using
this result, we study the robustness of the well-known adversarial training
procedure, where we characterize the fundamental trade-off between model
robustness and accuracy. Next, we empirically study the robustness of two
prominent deep, non-linear, flow-based generative models, namely GLOW and
RealNVP. We design two types of adversarial attacks; one that minimizes the
likelihood scores of in-distribution samples, while the other that maximizes
the likelihood scores of out-of-distribution ones. We find that GLOW and
RealNVP are extremely sensitive to both types of attacks. Finally, using a
hybrid adversarial training procedure, we significantly boost the robustness of

reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our
method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics,
such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic
energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of
turbulent flows.

The study of young solar type stars is fundamental for a better
understanding of the magnetic activity of the Sun. As a planet in transit
crosses in front of its host star, a darkspot on the stellar surface may be
occulted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve. Kepler-63 is a
young solar-like star withan age of only 210 Myr that exhibit photometric
variations compatible with spot signatures. Since its orbiting planet is in an
almostpolar orbit, different latitudes of the star can be probed by the method
of spot transit mapping. Methods. A total of 150 transits of Kepler-63b were
observed in the short cadence light curve, corresponding to a total duration of
about 4 years. Each transit light curve was fit by a model that simulates
planetary transits and allows the inclusion of starspots on the surface of the
host star. This enables the physical characterisation of the spots size,
intensity, and location. We determine the spot position in a reference frame
that rotates with the star, and thus obtain the latitudinal distribution of the
spots. Results. A total of 297 spots were fit and their sizes, intensities, and
positions determined. The latitude distribution of spots exhibits a bimodality
with a lack of spots around 34{\deg}. The high latitude spots dominate the
magnetic cycle of Kepler-63. For a mean stellar rotation period of 5.400d, 59
spots were found at approximately the same longitude and latitude on a later
transit. Conclusions. Due to the geometry of the Kepler-63 system, we were able
to build a starspot ""butterfly diagram"". It was also possible to infer
Kepler-63 differential rotation from the presence of spots at different
latitudes. This star was found to rotate almost rigidly with a period of 5.400d
and relative shear close to 0.01% for latitudes less than 34{\deg}, whereas the
high latitudes do not follow a well behaved pattern.

anti-crossing properties of the dimers coated by the thin dye films with
thicknesses greater than 0.1 nm and gap distances larger than 1.2 nm according
to the principles of classical electromagnetism. The plasmon resonance spectra
of these dimers are strongly affected by their coupling with the exciton
resonance of dye molecules. A comparison of the film thickness dependences of
dimer spectral changes with those of silver ellipsoidal NPs indicates that the
dipole plasmons localized in the dimer gap are coupled with molecular excitons
of the film much stronger than the dipole plasmons of ellipsoidal NPs.
Furthermore, the anti-crossing of coupled resonances is investigated while
tuning plasmon resonance by changing the morphology and refractive index of the
surrounding medium. The spectral changes observed for ellipsoidal NPs clearly
exhibit anti-crossing properties; however, the anti-crossing behavior of dimers
is more complex due to the strong coupling of dipoles and higher order plasmons
with multiple molecular excitons. We find that the anti-crossing for dimers is
clearly confirmed by the refractive index dependence of coupled resonance.

transition- and graph-based models. The former models enjoy high inference
efficiency with linear time complexity, but they rely on the stacking or
re-ranking of partially-built parse trees to build a complete parse tree and
are stuck with slower training for the necessity of dynamic oracle training.
The latter, graph-based models, may boast better performance but are
unfortunately marred by polynomial time inference. In this paper, we propose a
novel parsing order objective, resulting in a novel dependency parsing model
capable of both global (in sentence scope) feature extraction as in graph
models and linear time inference as in transitional models. The proposed global
greedy parser only uses two arc-building actions, left and right arcs, for
projective parsing. When equipped with two extra non-projective arc-building
actions, the proposed parser may also smoothly support non-projective parsing.
Using multiple benchmark treebanks, including the Penn Treebank (PTB), the
CoNLL-X treebanks, and the Universal Dependency Treebanks, we evaluate our
parser and demonstrate that the proposed novel parser achieves good performance
with faster training and decoding.

proposed model, actin filaments self-assembly and disassembly is used to create
flexible nanowires between nanomachines, and electrons are used as carriers of

analytical model of the physical layer using actin nanowire equivalent

Numerical results of the derived model are provided in terms of attenuation,
phase and delay as a function of the frequency and distances between

that the moving groups of Coma Berenices, Pleiades, and Hyades are associated

trapped by the spiral resonances in a timespan of ~ 1 Gyr, indicating the

noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness
to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the
labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean
data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data,
predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by
fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by
minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft
labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data
rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered
clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction

the setting of RA-DPL seamlessly integrates the robust projective dictionary
pair learning, locality-adaptive sparse representations and discriminative
coding coefficients learning into a unified learning framework. Specifically,
RA-DPL improves existing projective dictionary pair learning in four
perspectives. First, it applies a sparse l2,1-norm based metric to encode the
recon-struction error to deliver the robust projective dictionary pairs, and
the l2,1-norm has the potential to minimize the error. Sec-ond, it imposes the
robust l2,1-norm clearly on the analysis dictionary to ensure the sparse
property of the coding coeffi-cients rather than using the costly l0/l1-norm.
As such, the robustness of the data representation and the efficiency of the
learning process are jointly considered to guarantee the effi-cacy of our
RA-DPL. Third, RA-DPL conceives a structured reconstruction weight learning
paradigm to preserve the local structures of the coding coefficients within
each class clearly in an adaptive manner, which encourages to produce the
locality preserving representations. Fourth, it also considers improving the
discriminating ability of coding coefficients and dictionary by incorporating a
discriminating function, which can ensure high intra-class compactness and
inter-class separation in the code space. Extensive experiments show that our

examples. To robustify DNNs, adversarial training was proposed, which requires
large-scale but well-labeled data. However, it is quite expensive to annotate
large-scale data well. To compensate for this shortage, several seminal works
are utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In this paper, we observe that
seminal works do not perform well, since the quality of pseudo labels on
unlabeled data is quite poor, especially when the amount of unlabeled data is
significantly larger than that of labeled data. We believe that the quality of
pseudo labels is the bottleneck of adversarial learning with unlabeled data. To
tackle this bottleneck, we leverage deep co-training, which trains two deep
networks and encourages two networks diverged by exploiting peer's adversarial
examples. Based on deep co-training, we propose robust co-training (RCT) for
adversarial learning with unlabeled data. We conduct comprehensive experiments

that computing a PNE of linear weighted congestion games is PLS-complete either
for very restricted strategy spaces, namely when player strategies are paths on

restricted latency functions, namely when the latency on each resource is equal

generalization ability when the training and test data are from different
domains, e.g., with different styles. To address this problem, previous methods
mainly use holistic representations to align feature-level and pixel-level
distributions of different domains, which may neglect the instance-level
characteristics of objects in images. Besides, when transferring detection
ability across different domains, it is important to obtain the instance-level
features that are domain-invariant, instead of the styles that are
domain-specific. Therefore, in order to extract instance-invariant features, we
should disentangle the domain-invariant features from the domain-specific
features. To this end, a progressive disentangled framework is first proposed
to solve domain adaptive object detection. Particularly, base on disentangled
learning used for feature decomposition, we devise two disentangled layers to
decompose domain-invariant and domain-specific features. And the
instance-invariant features are extracted based on the domain-invariant
features. Finally, to enhance the disentanglement, a three-stage training

Computational results on a stochastic programming generalization of a facility

  Network and Shadow Matting GAN","Accepted by AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shadow removal is an essential task for scene understanding. Many studies
consider only matching the image contents, which often causes two types of
ghosts: color in-consistencies in shadow regions or artifacts on shadow
boundaries. In this paper, we tackle these issues in two ways. First, to
carefully learn the border artifacts-free image, we propose a novel network
structure named the dual hierarchically aggregation network~(DHAN). It contains
a series of growth dilated convolutions as the backbone without any
down-samplings, and we hierarchically aggregate multi-context features for
attention and prediction, respectively. Second, we argue that training on a
limited dataset restricts the textural understanding of the network, which
leads to the shadow region color in-consistencies. Currently, the largest
dataset contains 2k+ shadow/shadow-free image pairs. However, it has only 0.1k+
unique scenes since many samples share exactly the same background with
different shadow positions. Thus, we design a shadow matting generative
adversarial network~(SMGAN) to synthesize realistic shadow mattings from a
given shadow mask and shadow-free image. With the help of novel masks or
scenes, we enhance the current datasets using synthesized shadow images.
Experiments show that our DHAN can erase the shadows and produce high-quality
ghost-free images. After training on the synthesized and real datasets, our
network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The code

uniformly distributed. Checking for uniformity when a posterior density is
approximated numerically provides a diagnostic for algorithm validity.
Furthermore, adjustments to achieve uniformity can improve the quality of
approximate inference methods. A weakness of this general approach is that it
seems difficult to extend beyond scalar functions of interest. The present
article develops an alternative to quantile-based checking and adjustment
methods which is inherently multivariate. The new approach is based on use of
the tower property of conditional expectation and the law of total variance for
relating prior and posterior expectations and covariances. For adjustment,
approximate inferences are modified so that the correct prior to posterior
relationships hold. We illustrate the method in three examples. The first uses
an auxiliary model in a likelihood-free inference problem. The second considers
corrections for variational Bayes approximations in a deep neural network

of communication overheads. Yet, the gradient sparsification methods can only
initiate the communication after the backpropagation, and hence miss the
pipelining opportunity. In this paper, we propose a new distributed

layer-wise adaptive gradient sparsification (LAGS) scheme. In LAGS-SGD, every
worker selects a small set of ""significant"" gradients from each layer
independently whose size can be adaptive to the communication-to-computation
ratio of that layer. The layer-wise nature of LAGS-SGD opens the opportunity of
overlapping communications with computations, while the adaptive nature of
LAGS-SGD makes it flexible to control the communication time. We prove that
LAGS-SGD has convergence guarantees and it has the same order of convergence
rate as vanilla S-SGD under a weak analytical assumption. Extensive experiments
are conducted to verify the analytical assumption and the convergence
performance of LAGS-SGD. Experimental results on a 16-GPU cluster show that
LAGS-SGD outperforms the original S-SGD and existing sparsified S-SGD without

Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) allows us to learn models that
instead minimize the worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups.
However, we find that naively applying group DRO to overparameterized neural
networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model
with vanishing average training loss also already has vanishing worst-case
training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance arises from poor
generalization on some groups. By coupling group DRO models with increased
regularization---a stronger-than-typical L2 penalty or early stopping---we
achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10-40 percentage
point improvements on a natural language inference task and two image tasks,
while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that
regularization is important for worst-group generalization in the

corresponding Wilson coefficients up to operator dimension 6, the $\phi$ meson
QCD sum rules are analyzed with changing densities and momenta. The non-trivial

for the longitudinal and transverse modes. Specifically, the mass is reduced by
5 MeV for the longitudinal mode, while its increase amounts to 7 Mev for the
transverse mode, both at a momentum scale of 1 GeV. In an experiment which does
not distinguish between longitudinal and transverse polarizations, this could
in principle be seen as two separated peaks at large momenta. Taking however

multi-wavelength observational study of a giant molecular cloud hosting the
S147/S153 complex (size ~90 pc X 50 pc). The selected complex is located in the
Perseus arm, and contains at least five HII regions (S147, S148, S149, S152,

The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey 12CO line data (beam size ~100"".4) trace the
complex in a velocity range of [-59, -43] km/s, and also reveal the presence of
two molecular cloud components around -54 and -49 km/s in the direction of the
complex. Signatures of the interaction/collision between these extended cloud
components are investigated through their spatial and velocity connections.
These outcomes suggest the collision of these molecular cloud components about
1.6 Myr ago. Based on the observed overlapping zones of the two clouds, the
collision axis appears to be parallel to the line-of-sight. Deep near-infrared
photometric analysis of point-like sources shows the distribution of
infrared-excess sources in the direction of the overlapping zones of the
molecular cloud components, where all the HII regions are also spatially
located. All elements put together, the birth of massive OB stars and embedded
infrared-excess sources seems to be triggered by two colliding molecular clouds
in the selected site. High resolution observations of dense gas tracer will be
required to further confirm the proposed scenario.

responses of scattering bodies to circularly polarized light of opposite
handedness. Similar to the ubiquitous roles played by scattering theory across
different branches of photonics, scattering activities can serve as a
fundamental concept to clarify underlying mechanisms of various chiroptical
effects, both within and beyond scattering systems. In this work we investigate
scattering activities for reciprocal systems that exhibit various geometric
symmetries but are intrinsically achiral. We reveal how scattering activities
are generally bounded by reciprocity and parity conservation, demonstrating
that though extinction activity is usually eliminated by symmetry, scattering
activities in forms of distinct absorptions, scatterings or angular scattering
patterns can more widely emerge. Since our analyses are solely based on
fundamental laws of reciprocity and parity conservation, regardless of
geometric and optical parameters of the scattering systems studied, the
principles revealed are generically applicable. The intuitive and pictorial
framework we have established is beyond any specific coupling models, able to
reveal hidden connections between seemingly unrelated chiral manifestations,

procedure for the maximization of the determinant of the corresponding matrix
is proved to be mathematically the same as that of the previously proposed QR

for when the number of sensors is greater than that of state variables

using the monotone submodularity of the objective function. The effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm on the problem using real datasets is demonstrated by
comparing with the results of other algorithms. The numerical results show that
the proposed algorithm improves the estimation error by approximately 10%

estimation error is defined as the ratio of the difference between the
reconstructed data and the full observation data to the full observation. For

macroscopic and microscopic phenomena. The size of the nucleus is a window into
this duality: while the charge radii globally scale as $A^{1/3}$, their
evolution across isotopic chains reveals unanticipated structural phenomena
[1-3]. The most ubiquitous of these is perhaps the Odd-Even Staggering (OES)
[4]: isotopes with an odd number of neutrons are usually smaller in size than
the trend of their even-neutron neighbours suggests. This OES effect varies
with the number of protons and neutrons and poses a significant challenge for
nuclear theory [5-7]. Here, we examine this problem with new measurements of
the charge radii of short-lived copper isotopes up to the very exotic $^{78}$Cu
$(Z=29, N=49)$, produced at only 20 ions/s, using the highly-sensitive
Collinear Resonance Ionisation Spectroscopy (CRIS) method at ISOLDE-CERN. Due
to the presence of a single proton outside of the closed Z=28 shell, these
measurements provide crucial insights into the single-particle proton structure
and how this affects the charge radii. We observe an unexpected reduction in
the OES for isotopes approaching the $N=50$ shell gap. To describe the data, we
applied models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory [2,8] (DFT) and
ab-initio Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG)
theory [9,10]. Through these comparisons, we demonstrate a relation between the
global behavior of charge radii and the saturation density of nuclear matter,
and show that the local charge radii variations, which reflect the many-body
polarization effects due to the odd neutron, naturally emerge from the VS-IMSRG
calculations.

kernels and device drivers. CleanQ has strict semantics that not only clarify
both the implementation of the interface for different hardware devices and
software usecases, but also enable composition of modules as in more
heavyweight frameworks like Unix streams. We motivate CleanQ by showing that
loose specifications derived from implementation lead to security and
correctness bugs in production systems that a clean, formal, and
easilyunderstandable abstraction helps eliminate. We further demonstrate by
experiment that there is negligible performance cost for a clean design: we
show overheads in the tens of cycles for operations, and comparable end-to-end
performance to the highly-tuned Virtio and DPDK implementations on Linux.

Concretely, an HA module embedded in the HANet captures context information

nodes only if the correlation between them is high enough, which naturally
reduces the noisy attention information caused by the inter-class

can be flexibly inserted into the existing convolution neural networks. We
conduct experiments on three medical image segmentation tasks including optic

X-ray luminosity was very high, ~$1.4 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, larger than
those of ordinary SNe, and more consistent with those of SNe associated with
gamma-ray bursts. Variable hard X-ray emission hints at a long-lived ""central

scalability analysis increasingly important. This paper presents a quantitative
study for characterizing the scalability of sparse matrix-vector
multiplications (SpMV) on Phytium FT-2000+, an ARM-based many-core architecture
for HPC computing. We choose to study SpMV as it is a common operation in
scientific and HPC applications. Due to the newness of ARM-based many-core
architectures, there is little work on understanding the SpMV scalability on
such hardware design. To close the gap, we carry out a large-scale empirical
evaluation involved over 1,000 representative SpMV datasets. We show that,
while many computation-intensive SpMV applications contain extensive
parallelism, achieving a linear speedup is non-trivial on Phytium FT-2000+. To
better understand what software and hardware parameters are most important for
determining the scalability of a given SpMV kernel, we develop a performance
analytical model based on the regression tree. We show that our model is highly
effective in characterizing SpMV scalability, offering useful insights to help

present an extended emotion lexicon of 30,273 unique entries, which is a result

outperformed individual lexica, but contrary to our expectations, it did not
outperform a naive concatenation of lexica, although it did contribute to the
naive concatenation when added as an extra lexicon. Furthermore, using lexicon

in seismic data processing. In recent years, rank reduction operations are
being commonly utilized to overcome this problem, which require the rank of
seismic data to be a prior. However, the rank of field data is unknown; usually
it requires much time to manually adjust the rank and just obtain an
approximated rank. Methods based on deep learning require very large datasets
for training; however acquiring large datasets is difficult owing to physical
or financial constraints in practice. Therefore, in this work, we developed a
novel method based on unsupervised learning using the intrinsic properties of a
convolutional neural network known as U-net, without training datasets. Only
one undersampled seismic data was needed, and the deep seismic prior of input
data could be exploited by the network itself, thus making the reconstruction
convenient. Furthermore, this method can handle both irregular and regular
seismic data. Synthetic and field data were tested to assess the performance of
the proposed algorithm (DSPRecon algorithm); the advantages of using our method
were evaluated by comparing it with the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method
for irregular data reconstruction and de-aliased Cadzow method for regular data
reconstruction. Experimental results showed that our method provided better
reconstruction performance than the SSA or Cadzow methods. The recovered
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were 32.68 dB and 19.11 dB for the DSPRecon and
SSA algorithms, respectively. Those for the DSPRecon and Cadzow methods were

motivation is two-fold. One is to study the security of MDE systems, which has
not been actively considered in the community. The other is to improve our
understanding of the computational mechanism of CNNs performing MDE. Toward
this end, we apply the method recently proposed for visualization of MDE to
defending attacks. It trains another CNN to predict a saliency map from an
input image, such that the CNN for MDE continues to accurately estimate the
depth map from the image with its non-salient part masked out. We report the
following findings. First, unsurprisingly, attacks by IFGSM (or equivalently
PGD) succeed in making the CNNs yield inaccurate depth estimates. Second, the
attacks can be defended by masking out non-salient pixels, indicating that the
attacks function by perturbing mostly non-salient pixels. However, the
prediction of saliency maps is itself vulnerable to the attacks, even though it
is not the direct target of the attacks. We show that the attacks can be
defended by using a saliency map predicted by a CNN trained to be robust to the
attacks. These results provide an effective defense method as well as a clue to
understanding the computational mechanism of CNNs for MDE.

at a time when there will be gaps in screening due to limited resource
capacities. To capture this game between ports and adversaries, this problem
has been previously represented as a Stackelberg game, referred to as a Threat
Screening Game (TSG). Given the significant complexity associated with solving
TSGs and uncertainty in arrivals of customers, existing work has assumed that
screenees arrive and are allocated security resources at the beginning of the

correlated with flight time and are not bound by fixed time windows. To address
this, we propose an online threat screening model in which screening strategy
is determined adaptively as a passenger arrives while satisfying a hard bound
on acceptable risk of not screening a threat. To solve the online problem with
a hard bound on risk, we formulate it as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem

capacity utilization and quality of service (QoS) than what can be achieved
otherwise. However, conventional resource allocation for virtualized networks
would still follow a fixed pattern based on the predicted capacity needs of the
users, even though, in reality, the actual traffic demand of a user will always
tend to fluctuate. The mismatch between the fixed capacity allocation and the
actual fluctuating traffic would lead to degradation of provisioned network
services and inefficiency in the assigned network capacity. To overcome this,
we propose a new spectrum trading (ST) scheme between virtual optical networks
(VONs) in the context of an elastic optical network (EON). The key idea here is
to allow different VONs to trade their spectrum resources according to the
actual capacity they need at different time instants. A VON with unused spectra
can then trade away its unused spectra to other VONs that are short of spectrum
resources at that time. In exchange, it is rewarded with a certain amount of
credit for its contribution to the ST community, which it can then use later to
get extra bandwidth, if needed. The trust-worthiness of the trading records
between the VONs is ensured in a distributed fashion through a
blockchain-assisted account book that is updated whenever a new trade occurs.
For this, we develop a software-defined control plane to enable spectrum
trading in an EON. The performance of the ST scheme is evaluated and compared
with a scenario without such trading. Our results show that the proposed ST
scheme is effective in improving the QoS of each VON and significantly improves
the overall network capacity utilization.

and for establishing non-trivial electronic states. Using CsSnI$_3$ as the
prototype material, we show that in the cubic phase, the bandgap reduces
irrespective of the nature of strain. However, for the tetragonal phase, it
reduces with tensile strain and increases with compressive strain, while the
reverse is the case for the orthorhombic phase. The reduction can give rise to
negative bandgap in the cubic and tetragonal phases leading to normal to
topological insulator phase transition. Also, these halides tend to form a
stability plateau in a space spanned by strain and octahedral rotation. In this
plateau, with negligible cost to the total energy, the bandgap can be varied in
a range of 1eV. Furthermore, we present a descriptor model for the perovskite
to simulate their bandgap with strain and rotation. Analysis of band topology
through model Hamiltonians led to the conceptualization of topological
influencers that provide a quantitative measure of the contribution of each
chemical bonding towards establishing a normal or topological insulator phase.

a critical value of the detached length can be found, which is able to prevent
unstable peeling of the tape under a fixed applied load, thus resulting in
enhanced adhesion strength, with respect to the classical Kendall's solution

Published in QJRMS",,"10.1002/qj.3867",,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The response of a spherical moist shallow water system to tropical imbalances
in the presence of inhomogeneous saturation fields is examined. While the
initial moist response is similar to the dry reference run, albeit with a
reduced equivalent depth, the long time solution depends quite strikingly on
the nature of the saturation field. For a saturation field that only depends on
latitude, specifically, one with a peak at the equator and falls off
meridionally in both hemispheres, height imbalances adjust to large-scale,
low-frequency westward propagating modes. When the background saturation
environment is also allowed to vary with longitude, in addition to a westward
quadrupole, there is a distinct eastward propagating response at long times.
The nature of this eastward propagating mode is well described by moist
potential vorticity conservation and it consists of wave packets that arc out
to midlatitudes and return to the tropics and are predominantly rotational in
character. In all moist cases, initially formed Kelvin waves decay, and this
appears to be tied to the off-equatorial organization of moisture anomalies by
rotational modes. Many of these basic features carry over to the response in
the presence of realistic saturation fields derived from reanalysis based
precipitable water. In boreal summer, long time eastward response is restricted
to northern hemisphere and takes the form of a wavetrain that passes over
Indian landmass into the subtropics, reaching across the Pacific to North
America. In boreal winter, the eastward mode consists of a subtropically
confined rotational quadrupole along with midlatitudinal disturbances. Thus, in
addition to circumnavigating westward Rossby waves, slow eastward propagating
modes appear to be a robust feature of the shallow water system with
interactive moisture in the presence of saturation fields that vary with
latitude and longitude.

leakage. While the most popular exploitation of this channel is to recover
cryptographic keys from embedded devices, other applications such as mobile app
fingerprinting, reverse engineering of firmware, and password recovery are
growing threats. Countermeasures proposed so far are tuned to specific
applications, such as crypto-implementations. They are not scalable to the
large number and variety of applications that typically run on a general
purpose microprocessor.
  In this paper, we investigate the design of a microprocessor, called PARAM
with increased resistance to power based side-channel attacks. To design PARAM,
we start with identifying the most leaking modules in an open-source RISC V
processor. We evaluate the leakage in these modules and then add suitable
countermeasures. The countermeasures depend on the cause of leakage in each
module and can vary from simple modifications of the HDL code ensuring secure
translation by the EDA tools, to obfuscating data and address lines thus
breaking correlation with the processor's power consumption. The resultant
processor is instantiated on the SASEBO-GIII FPGA board and found to resist
Differential Power Analysis even after one million power traces. Compared to
contemporary countermeasures for power side-channel attacks, overheads in area
and frequency are minimal.

To further progress on the extraction and disambiguation of potentially

the area of data streams. Given a stream of $m$ data items in $\{1, 2, \dots,

threshold parameter $d$, and provably optimal algorithms are known today.
However, in many applications, knowing only the frequent elements themselves is
not enough: For example, an Internet router may not only need to know the most
frequent destination IP addresses of forwarded packages, but also the
timestamps of when these packages appeared or any other meta-data that
""arrived"" with the packages, e.g., their source IP addresses.
  In this paper, we introduce the witness version of the frequent elements
problem: Given a desired approximation guarantee $\alpha \ge 1$ and a desired
frequency $d \le \Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the frequency of the most frequent
item, the objective is to report an item together with at least $d / \alpha$
timestamps of when the item appeared in the stream (or any other meta-data that
arrived with the items). We give provably optimal algorithms for both the
insertion-only and insertion-deletion stream settings: In insertion-only
streams, we show that space $\tilde{O}(n + d \cdot n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ is

revision can be characterised in terms of changing beliefs about conditionals.
For iterated contraction a similar formulation is not known. This is especially
because for iterated belief change the connection between revision and
contraction via the Levi and Harper identity is not straightforward, and
therefore, characterisation results do not transfer easily between iterated
revision and contraction. In this article, we develop an axiomatisation of
iterated contraction in terms of changing conditional beliefs. We prove that
the new set of postulates conforms semantically to the class of operators like
the ones given by Konieczny and Pino P\'erez for iterated contraction.

$Chlamydomonas$ to vastly larger $Volvox$, are models for the study of the
evolution of multicellularity, flagellar dynamics, and developmental processes.
Phototactic steering in these organisms occurs without a central nervous
system, driven solely by the response of individual cells. All such algae spin
about a body-fixed axis as they swim; directional photosensors on each cell
thus receive periodic signals when that axis is not aligned with the light. The
flagella of $Chlamydomonas$ and $Volvox$ both exhibit an adaptive response to
such signals in a manner that allows for accurate phototaxis, but in the former
the two flagella have distinct responses, while the thousands of flagella on
the surface of spherical $Volvox$ colonies have essentially identical
behaviour. The planar 16-cell species $Gonium~pectorale$ thus presents a
conundrum, for its central 4 cells have a $Chlamydomonas$-like beat that
provide propulsion normal to the plane, while its 12 peripheral cells generate
rotation around the normal through a $Volvox$-like beat. Here, we combine
experiment, theory, and computations to reveal how $Gonium$, perhaps the
simplest differentiated colonial organism, achieves phototaxis. High-resolution
cell tracking, particle image velocimetry of flagellar driven flows, and
high-speed imaging of flagella on micropipette-held colonies show how, in the
context of a recently introduced model for $Chlamydomonas$ phototaxis, an
adaptive response of the peripheral cells alone leads to photo-reorientation of
the entire colony. The analysis also highlights the importance of local
variations in flagellar beat dynamics within a given colony, which can lead to
enhanced reorientation dynamics.

  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-20)",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On-demand ride-pooling (e.g., UberPool) has recently become popular because
of its ability to lower costs for passengers while simultaneously increasing
revenue for drivers and aggregation companies. Unlike in Taxi on Demand (ToD)
services -- where a vehicle is only assigned one passenger at a time -- in
on-demand ride-pooling, each (possibly partially filled) vehicle can be
assigned a group of passenger requests with multiple different origin and
destination pairs. To ensure near real-time response, existing solutions to the
real-time ride-pooling problem are myopic in that they optimise the objective
(e.g., maximise the number of passengers served) for the current time step
without considering its effect on future assignments. This is because even a
myopic assignment in ride-pooling involves considering what combinations of
passenger requests that can be assigned to vehicles, which adds a layer of
combinatorial complexity to the ToD problem.
  A popular approach that addresses the limitations of myopic assignments in
ToD problems is Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). Existing ADP methods for
ToD can only handle Linear Program (LP) based assignments, however, while the
assignment problem in ride-pooling requires an Integer Linear Program (ILP)
with bad LP relaxations. To this end, our key technical contribution is in
providing a general ADP method that can learn from ILP-based assignments.
Additionally, we handle the extra combinatorial complexity from combinations of
passenger requests by using a Neural Network based approximate value function
and show a connection to Deep Reinforcement Learning that allows us to learn
this value-function with increased stability and sample-efficiency. We show
that our approach outperforms past approaches on a real-world dataset by up to
16%, a significant improvement in city-scale transportation problems.

Another difficulty is that shapes and backgrounds sometimes become excessively
complicated to mistakenly reconstruct textures on object surfaces. To suppress
it, we propose using strong regularization and constraints on object surfaces

theoretically demonstrate that in the regime, where lattice profile is nearly

from the beating of a ground state condensate created in the lowest energy band
at very small momentum and a condensate simultaneously created in higher energy
states with large momentum. The spontaneous excitation of these two states in
the nonlinear regime due to competition between multiple eigenmodes becomes
possible since the spectrum of nearly PT-symmetric structure reveals
practically identical amplification for Bloch waves from the entire Brillouin

visualization and analysis of the dynamics of a complex biomedical system,
illustrated by the human stomatognathic system. The stomatognathic system
consists of the teeth and the skull bones with the maxilla and the mandible.
Its dynamics can be described by the change of mutual position of the
lower/mandibular part versus the upper/maxillary one due to the physiological
motion of opening, chewing and swallowing. In order to analyse the dynamics of
the stomatognathic system its morphology and motion has to be digitized, which
is done using static and dynamic multimodal imagery like CBCT and 3D scans data
and temporal measurements of motion. The integration of multimodal data
incorporates different direct and indirect methods of registration - aligning
of all the data in the same coordinate system. The integrated sets of data form
4D multimodal data which can be further visualized, modeled, and subjected to
multivariate time series analysis. Example results are shown. Although there is
no direct method of imaging the TMJ motion, the integration of multimodal data
forms an adequate tool. As medical imaging becomes ever more diverse and ever
more accessible, organizing the imagery and measurements into unified,
comprehensive records can deliver to the doctor the most information in the
most accessible form, creating a new quality in data simulation, analysis and
interpretation.

detection tasks. Correspondingly, we also design a light-head detection part to
match the backbone capability. Furthermore, by analyzing the drawbacks of
current one-stage detector training strategies, we also propose three
orthogonal training strategies---IOU-guided loss, classes-aware weighting

our proposed RefineDetLite achieves 26.8 mAP on the MSCOCO benchmark at a speed

increased to 29.6 mAP by integrating all the proposed training strategies,

corrected $H\alpha$ flux where possible, and via an empirical relationship
between specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the strength of the 4000
Angstrom break (D4000) in all other cases. We train a multi-layered artificial

forming' and `quenched' categories given various individual (and groups of)
parameters. We find that global parameters (pertaining to the galaxy as a
whole) perform collectively the best at predicting when spaxels will be
quenched, and are substantially superior to local/ spatially resolved and
environmental parameters. Central velocity dispersion is the best single
parameter for predicting quenching in central galaxies. We interpret this
observational fact as a probable consequence of the total integrated energy
from AGN feedback being traced by the mass of the black hole, which is well
known to correlate strongly with central velocity dispersion. Additionally, we
train both an ANN and RF to estimate $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ values directly via
regression in star forming regions. Local/ spatially resolved parameters are
collectively the most predictive at estimating $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in these
analyses, with stellar mass surface density at the spaxel location ($\Sigma_*$)

global process but star formation is governed locally by processes within each

information about the bulk compositions, formation pathways, and evolutionary
histories of planets. Exoplanets with large, relatively cloud-free atmospheres,

abundance measurements. For this reason, we measured the transmission spectrum
of the bright (V~10.2), large (1.37 R$_{J}$), sub-Saturn mass (0.19 M$_{J}$)
exoplanet WASP-127b across the near-UV to near-infrared wavelength range (0.3 -
5 $\mu$m), using the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. Our results show a
feature-rich transmission spectrum, with absorption from Na, H$_{2}$O, and
CO$_{2}$, and wavelength-dependent scattering from small-particle condensates.
We ran two types of atmospheric retrieval models: one enforcing chemical
equilibrium, and the other which fit the abundances freely. Our retrieved
abundances at chemical equilibrium for Na, O and C are all super-solar, with
abundances relative to solar values of 9$^{+15}_{-6}$, 16$^{+7}_{-5}$, and
26$^{+12}_{-9}$ respectively. Despite giving conflicting C/O ratios, both
retrievals gave super-solar CO$_{2}$ volume mixing ratios, which adds to the
likelihood that WASP-127b's bulk metallicity is super-solar, since CO$_{2}$
abundance is highly sensitive to atmospheric metallicity. We detect water at a
significance of 13.7 $\sigma$. Our detection of Na is in agreement with
previous ground-based detections, though we find a much lower abundance, and we
also do not find evidence for Li or K despite increased sensitivity. In the

Internet traffic regardless of its source, destination, content, application or
other related distinguishing metrics. Under net neutrality, ISPs are compelled
to charge all content providers (CPs) the same per Gbps rate despite the
growing profit achieved by CPs. In this paper, we study the impact of the
repeal of net neutrality on communication networks by developing a
techno-economic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to maximize the
potential profit ISPs can achieve by offering their services to CPs. We focus
on video delivery as video traffic accounts for 78% of the cloud traffic. We
consider an ISP that offers CPs different classes of service representing
typical video content qualities including standard definition (SD), high
definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) video. The MILP model maximizes
the ISP profit by optimizing the prices of the different classes according to
the users demand sensitivity to the change in price, referred to as Price
Elasticity of Demand (PED). We analyze how PED impacts the profit in different
CP delivery scenarios in cloud-fog architectures. The results show that the
repeal of net neutrality can potentially increase ISPs profit by a factor of 8
with a pricing scheme that discriminates against data intensive content. Also,
the repeal of net neutrality positively impacts the network energy efficiency
by reducing the core network power consumption by 55% as a result of
suppressing data intensive content compared to the net neutrality scenario.

which can be parallelized effectively to achieve higher throughput. However,
because of the presence of error floor due to cycles and stopping sets in the
factor graph, the performance of the BP decoder is far from the performance of
state of the art cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation
list (CA-SCL) decoders. It has been shown that successive BP decoding on
multiple permuted factor graphs, which is called the multi-trellis BP decoder,
can improve the error performance. However, when permuting the entire factor
graph, since the decoder dismisses the information from the previous
permutation, the number of iterations required is significantly larger than
that of the standard BP decoder. In this work, we propose a new variant of the
multi-trellis BP decoder which permutes only a subgraph of the original factor
graph. This enables the decoder to retain information of variable nodes in the
subgraphs, which are not permuted, reducing the required number of iterations
needed in-between the permutations. As a result, the proposed decoder can
perform permutations more frequently, hence being more effective in mitigating
the effect of cycles which cause oscillation errors. Experimental results show
that for a polar code with block length 1024 and rate 0.5 the error performance
gain of the proposed decoder at the frame error rate of 10^(-6) is 0.25 dB

in the rare decays $\bar B\to \bar K^{(*)}\ell^+\ell^-$, $\ell=\mu,e$ is
explained via the $SU(4)_C$ leptoquark gauge boson. The model predicts a new

low-level features extracted from the early layers of a network contain more

to bridge the gap between high and low-level features due to their difference

assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form.
Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships,
even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse
irradiation limit (around 1.1~times the insolation at Earth for planets
orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in
condensed form and would instead form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we
use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive new mass-radius
relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated
than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a
steam, water-dominated atmosphere. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these
new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than
calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using
traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than
the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate --
possibly by several orders of magnitude -- their bulk water content. In
particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can
accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08 %, respectively,
assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show
that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and
more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk
composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Finally,
we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness which
can be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky
planet more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.

possess large spin Berry curvatures and thus give rise to large spin Hall
effect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect (SNE), which may be used to generate pure
spin current for spintronics and spin caloritronics without applied magnetic
field or magnetic material. In this paper we study both SHE and SNE in ZrXY (X
= Si, Ge; Y = S, Se, Te) based on \textit{ab initio} relativistic band
structure calculations. Our theoretical calculations reveal that some of these
compounds exhibit large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and spin Nernst
conductivity (SNC). The calculated SHC of ZrSiTe is as large as -755
($\hbar$/e)(S/cm). Since the electric conductivity of these Dirac semimetals
are much smaller than that of platinum which has the largest intrinsic SHC of
$\sim$2200 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm), this indicates that they will have a larger spin
Hall angle than that of platinum. Remarkably, we find that both the magnitude
and sign of the SHE and SNE in these compounds can be significantly tuned by
changing either the electric field direction or spin current direction and may
also be optimized by slightly varying the Fermi level via chemical doping.
Analysis of the calculated band- and $k$-resolved spin Berry curvatures show
that the large SHE and SNE as well as their remarkable tunabilities originate
from the presence of many slightly spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac nodal lines
near the Fermi level in these Dirac semimetals. Our findings suggest that the
ZrSiS-type compounds are promising candidates for spintronic and spin
caloritronic devices, and will certainly stimulate further experiments on these

valuable insights into multicast beamforming: We show that the notion of
uplink-downlink duality can be generalized to the multicast beamforming
problem. The optimal multicast beamformer is a weighted MMSE filter based on a
group-channel direction: a generalized version of the optimal downlink
multi-user unicast beamformer. We also show that there is an inherent
low-dimensional structure in the optimal multicast beamforming solution
independent of the number of transmit antennas, leading to efficient numerical
algorithm design, especially for systems with large antenna arrays. We propose
efficient algorithms to compute the multicast beamformer based on the optimal
beamforming structure. Through asymptotic analysis, we characterize the
asymptotic behavior of the multicast beamformers as the number of antennas
grows, and in turn, provide simple closed-form approximate multicast
beamformers for both the QoS and MMF problems. This approximation offers
practical multicast beamforming solutions with a near-optimal performance at

up the computational procedure, as the parameter-to-data map can be very
expensive to evaluate. However, due to the curse of dimensionality and the
nonlinear concentration of the posterior, traditional surrogate approaches
(such us the polynomial-based surrogates) are still not feasible for large
scale problems. To this end, we present in this work an adaptive multi-fidelity
surrogate modeling framework based on deep neural networks (DNNs), motivated by
the facts that the DNNs can potentially handle functions with limited
regularity and are powerful tools for high dimensional approximations. More
precisely, we first construct offline a DNNs-based surrogate according to the
prior distribution, and then, this prior-based DNN-surrogate will be adaptively
\& locally refined online using only a few high-fidelity simulations. In
particular, in the refine procedure, we construct a new shallow neural network
that view the previous constructed surrogate as an input variable -- yielding a
composite multi-fidelity neural network approach. This makes the online
computational procedure rather efficient. Numerical examples are presented to
confirm that the proposed approach can obtain accurate posterior information

minimizing the intervention of the tactile reactive control. This way, the

occurs, the learning process is considered failed. We show the performance in
two tasks, which consist in reorienting a cup and a bottle only using the

reaching the goal in the Cartesian space and reduces significantly the

Successful treatment requires initial high-intensity chemotherapy, followed by

interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics

model to simulate the dynamics of different cell types, especially neutrophils,
would be a valuable contribution to improving treatment protocols (6MP and MTX
dosing regimens) and a further step to understanding the heterogeneity in

based on ANC were more accurate than those based on white blood cell counts.
Using the new cross-validated mathematical model, simulations of different

Chow ring, saturated prelog Chow group, as well as their counterparts for
numerical equivalence. Thinking of $X$ as the central fibre in a (strictly)
semistable degeneration, these objects can intuitively be thought of as
consisting of cycle classes on $X$ for which some initial obstruction to arise
as specializations of cycle classes on the generic fibre is absent. Cycle
classes in the generic fibre specialize to their prelog counterparts in the
central fibre, thus extending to Chow rings the method of studying smooth
varieties via strictly semistable degenerations. After proving basic properties
for prelog Chow rings and groups, we explain how they can be used in an
envisaged further development of the degeneration method by Voisin et al. to
prove stable irrationality of very general fibres of certain families of
varieties; this extension would allow for much more singular degenerations,
such as toric degenerations as occur in the Gross-Siebert programme, to be
usable. We illustrate that by looking at the example of degenerations of
elliptic curves, which, although simple, shows that our notion of prelog
decomposition of the diagonal can also be used as an obstruction in cases where
all components in a degeneration and their mutual intersections are rational.
  We also compute the saturated prelog Chow group of degenerations of cubic
surfaces.

straightforwardly and accurately, it is difficult to experimentally determine
its separate contributions from the translational and internal motions of gas
molecules. Yet this information is critical in rarefied gas dynamics as the
rarefaction effects corresponding to these motions are different. In this
paper, we propose a novel methodology to extract the translational thermal
conductivity (or equivalently, the translational Eucken factor) of molecular
gases from the Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (RBS) experimental data. From the
numerical simulation of the \cite{LeiJFM2015} model we find that, in the
kinetic regime, in addition to bulk viscosity, the RBS spectrum is sensitive to
the translational Eucken factor, even when the total thermal conductivity is
fixed. Thus it is not only possible to extract the bulk viscosity, but also the
translational Eucken factor of molecular gases from RBS light scattering
spectra measurements. Such experiments bear the additional advantage that
gas-surface interactions do not affect the measurements. For the first time,
bulk viscosities (due to the rotational relaxation of gas molecules only) and
translational Eucken factors of N2, CO2 and SF6 are simultaneously extracted
from RBS experiments.

relations of a KG into low-dimensional continuous vector spaces. Early KG
embedding methods only pay attention to structured information encoded in
triples, which would cause limited performance due to the structure sparseness
of KGs. Some recent attempts consider paths information to expand the structure
of KGs but lack explainability in the process of obtaining the path
representations. In this paper, we propose a novel Rule and Path-based Joint
Embedding (RPJE) scheme, which takes full advantage of the explainability and
accuracy of logic rules, the generalization of KG embedding as well as the
supplementary semantic structure of paths. Specifically, logic rules of
different lengths (the number of relations in rule body) in the form of Horn
clauses are first mined from the KG and elaborately encoded for representation
learning. Then, the rules of length 2 are applied to compose paths accurately
while the rules of length 1 are explicitly employed to create semantic
associations among relations and constrain relation embeddings. Besides, the
confidence level of each rule is also considered in optimization to guarantee
the availability of applying the rule to representation learning. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that RPJE outperforms other state-of-the-art
baselines on KG completion task, which also demonstrate the superiority of
utilizing logic rules as well as paths for improving the accuracy and
explainability of representation learning.

causes GNNs to yield different representations for them. To tackle this

mitigating the non-isomorphism of neighborhood structures in an end-to-end
manner. As the direct neighbors of counterpart entities are usually dissimilar
due to the schema heterogeneity, AliNet introduces distant neighbors to expand
the overlap between their neighborhood structures. It employs an attention
mechanism to highlight helpful distant neighbors and reduce noises. Then, it
controls the aggregation of both direct and distant neighborhood information
using a gating mechanism. We further propose a relation loss to refine entity
representations. We perform thorough experiments with detailed ablation studies

  authors are equally contributing",,"10.1007/s10664-021-10092-4",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: The SZZ algorithm is the de facto standard for labeling bug fixing
commits and finding inducing changes for defect prediction data. Recent
research uncovered potential problems in different parts of the SZZ algorithm.
Most defect prediction data sets provide only static code metrics as features,
while research indicates that other features are also important.
  Objective: We provide an empirical analysis of the defect labels created with
the SZZ algorithm and the impact of commonly used features on results.
  Method: We used a combination of manual validation and adopted or improved
heuristics for the collection of defect data. We conducted an empirical study
on 398 releases of 38 Apache projects.
  Results: We found that only half of the bug fixing commits determined by SZZ
are actually bug fixing. If a six-month time frame is used in combination with
SZZ to determine which bugs affect a release, one file is incorrectly labeled
as defective for every file that is correctly labeled as defective. In
addition, two defective files are missed. We also explored the impact of the
relatively small set of features that are available in most defect prediction
data sets, as there are multiple publications that indicate that, e.g., churn
related features are important for defect prediction. We found that the
difference of using more features is not significant.
  Conclusion: Problems with inaccurate defect labels are a severe threat to the
validity of the state of the art of defect prediction. Small feature sets seem
to be a less severe threat.

information. In order to deal with this intrinsic heterogeneity, regression
analyses have to be clustered for different groups of units. Up until now,
mixture model approaches assigned units to distinct and non-overlapping groups.
However, not rarely these units exhibit more complex organization and
clustering. It is our aim to define a mixture of generalized linear models with
overlapping clusters of units. This involves crucially an overlap function,
that maps the coefficients of the parent clusters into the the coefficient of
the multiple allocation units. We present a computationally efficient MCMC

eigenvalue. We further investigate the dependence of the generalised principal
eigenvalue on the frequency, the dispersal rate and the dispersal spread.
Finally, these qualitative results for time-periodic linear operators are
applied to time-periodic nonlinear KPP equations with nonlocal dispersal,
focusing on the effects of the frequency, the dispersal rate and the dispersal
spread on the existence and stability of positive time-periodic solutions to
nonlinear equations.

most energetic explosive phenomena in the Universe. The emission from GRBs
comprises a short (typically tens of seconds) and bright prompt emission,
followed by a much longer afterglow phase. During the afterglow phase, the
shocked outflow -- produced by the interaction between the ejected matter and
the circumburst medium -- slows down, and a gradual decrease in brightness is
observed. GRBs typically emit most of their energy via gamma-rays with energies
in the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt range, but a few photons with
energies of tens of gigaelectronvolts have been detected by space-based
instruments. However, the origins of such high-energy (above one
gigaelectronvolt) photons and the presence of very-high-energy (more than 100
gigaelectronvolts) emission have remained elussive. Here we report observations
of very-high-energy emission in the bright GRB 180720B deep in the GRB
afterglow -ten hours after the end of the prompt emission phase, when the X-ray
flux had already decayed by four orders of magnitude. Two possible explanations
exist for the observed radiation: inverse Compton emission and synchrotron
emission of ultrarelativistic electrons. Our observations show that the energy
fluxes in the X-ray and gamma-ray range and their photon indices remain
comparable to each other throughout the afterglow. This discovery places
distinct constraints on the GRB environment for both emission mechanisms, with
the inverse Compton explanation alleviating the particle energy requirements
for the emission observed at late times. The late timing of this detection has
consequences for the future observations of GRBs at the highest energies.

security against a varying profile of threat or prohibited items. Particular
interest lies in the automatic detection and classification of weapons such as

we address this problem by exploring various end-to-end object detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. We evaluate several leading
variants spanning the Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and RetinaNet architectures to
explore the transferability of such models between varying X-ray scanners with
differing imaging geometries, image resolutions and material colour profiles.
Whilst the limited availability of X-ray threat imagery can pose a challenge,
we employ a transfer learning approach to evaluate whether such inter-scanner
generalisation may exist over a multiple class detection problem. Overall, we
achieve maximal detection performance using a Faster R-CNN architecture with a
ResNet$_{101}$ classification network, obtaining 0.88 and 0.86 of mean Average
Precision (mAP) for a three-class and two class item from varying X-ray imaging
sources. Our results exhibit a remarkable degree of generalisability in terms
of cross-scanner performance (mAP: 0.87, firearm detection: 0.94 AP). In
addition, we examine the inherent adversarial discriminative capability of such
networks using a specifically generated adversarial dataset for firearms
detection - with a variable low false positive, as low as 5%, this shows both
the challenge and promise of such threat detection within X-ray security
imagery.

learning problem as an optimisation with respect to two variables, i.e.,
dictionary and sparse coefficients, and solve it by alternating between two
stages: sparse coding and dictionary update. The key contribution of this work
is a Rank-One Projection (ROP) formulation where dictionary learning is cast as
an optimisation with respect to a single variable which is a set of rank one
matrices. The resulting algorithm is hence single staged. An alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is derived to solve the optimisation
problem and guarantees a global convergence despite non-convexity of the
optimisation formulation. Also ROP reduces the number of tuning parameters
required in other benchmark algorithms. Numerical tests demonstrate that ROP
outperforms other benchmarks for both synthetic and real data especially when

CO(1--0) by the PAWS project. A large number of molecular clouds were
identified and we search for velocity gradients in two high signal-to-noise
subsamples, containing 682 and 376 clouds. The velocity gradients are found to
be systematically prograde oriented, as was previously found for the rather
flocculent spiral M~33. This strongly supports the idea that the velocity
gradients reflect cloud rotation, rather than more random dynamical forces,
such as turbulence. Not only are the gradients prograde, but their
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$
coefficients follow galactic shear in sign, although with a lower amplitude. No
link is found between the orientation of the gradient and the orientation of
the cloud. The values of the cloud angular momenta appear to be an extension of
the values noted for galactic clouds despite the orders of magnitude difference
in cloud mass. Roughly 30\% of the clouds show retrograde velocity gradients.
For a strictly rising rotation curve, as in M~51, gravitational contraction
would be expected to yield strictly prograde rotators within an axisymmetric
potential. In M~51, the fraction of retrograde rotators is found to be higher
in the spiral arms than in the disk as a whole. Along the leading edge of the
spiral arms, a majority of the clouds are retrograde rotators. While this work
should be continued on other nearby galaxies, the M~33 and M~51 studies have
shown that clouds rotate and that they rotate mostly prograde, although the
amplitudes are not such that rotational energy is a significant support
mechanism against gravitation. In this work, we show that retrograde rotation
is linked to the presence of a spiral gravitational potential.

Female Ae. aegypti mosquito species transmit Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. The

this population depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors including
temperature, vegetation condition, humidity and precipitation. To combat virus
outbreaks, information about vector population is required. To this aim, Earth
observation (EO) data provide fast, efficient and economically viable means to
estimate environmental features of interest. In this work, we present a
temporal distribution model for adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes based on
the joint use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalized
Difference Water Index, the Land Surface Temperature (both at day and night
time), along with the precipitation information, extracted from EO data. The
model was applied separately to data obtained during three different vector
control and field data collection condition regimes, and used to explain the
differences in environmental variable contributions across these regimes. To
this aim, a random forest (RF) regression technique and its nonlinear features
importance ranking based on mean decrease impurity (MDI) were implemented. To
prove the robustness of the proposed model, we compared it to other machine
learning techniques and statistical models. Our results show that machine
learning techniques perform better than linear statistical models for the task
at hand, and RF performs best. By ranking the importance of all features based
on MDI in RF and selecting the subset comprising the most informative ones, a
more parsimonious but equally effective and explainable model can be
obtained...

PK model for cytarabine (Ara-C), a subcutaneous absorption model for exogenous
G-CSF, and a two-compartment model for leukemic blasts. This model was fitted
to data of 44 AML patients during consolidation therapy with a novel Ara-C plus
G-CSF schedule from a phase II controlled clinical trial. Additionally, we were
able to optimize treatment schedules with respect to disease progression, WBC
nadirs, and the amount of Ara-C and G-CSF. The developed PK/PD model provided
good prediction accuracies and an interpretation of the interaction between

sequence of steps and is dependent on the success of several pipelines in its
execution. To overcome such limitations with the existing algorithm, we propose
a unified approach to solve this problem. We assume that a dynamic scene can be
approximated by numerous piecewise planar surfaces, where each planar surface
enjoys its own rigid motion, and the global change in the scene between two
frames is as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP). Consequently, our model of a dynamic
scene reduces to a soup of planar structures and rigid motion of these local
planar structures. Using planar over-segmentation of the scene, we reduce this
task to solving a ""3D jigsaw puzzle"" problem. Hence, the task boils down to
correctly assemble each rigid piece to construct a 3D shape that complies with
the geometry of the scene under the ARAP assumption. Further, we show that our
approach provides an effective solution to the inherent scale-ambiguity in
structure-from-motion under perspective projection. We provide extensive
experimental results and evaluation on several benchmark datasets. Quantitative
comparison with competing approaches shows state-of-the-art performance.

  This manuscript contents 29 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:1806.02210",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present essay we review the underlying physical information behind the
first concrete example describing a mass dimension one fermion - namely Elko
spinors. We start the program exploring the physical information by evaluating
the Elko bilinear forms, both within the proper orthochronous Lorentz subgroup
as well as within the VSR theory. As we shall see, such structures do not hold
the right observance of the Fierz-Pauli-Kofink quadratic relations. Thus, by
the aforementioned reasons, we develop a deformation of the Clifford algebra
basis. Such protocol can be accomplished by taking precisely the right Elko
dual structure during the construction of the bilinear forms related to these
spinors. With the appropriated bilinear forms at hands, we search for a real
physical interpretation in order to achieve a deeper understanding of such
spinor fields. Aiming an interesting application, we present a relation
concerning Elko spinors and the neutrino physics via the Heisenberg non-linear
theory by means of a bijective linear map between Elko spinors and the
so-called Restricted Inomata-McKinley (RIM) spinors. Thus, we describe some of
its properties. Some interesting results concerning the construction of
RIM-decomposable spinors emerge from such prescription.

  Segmentation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1906.01862",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whole brain segmentation using deep learning (DL) is a very challenging task
since the number of anatomical labels is very high compared to the number of
available training images. To address this problem, previous DL methods
proposed to use a single convolution neural network (CNN) or few independent
CNNs. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble method based on a large number
of CNNs processing different overlapping brain areas. Inspired by parliamentary
decision-making systems, we propose a framework called AssemblyNet, made of two
""assemblies"" of U-Nets. Such a parliamentary system is capable of dealing with
complex decisions, unseen problem and reaching a consensus quickly. AssemblyNet
introduces sharing of knowledge among neighboring U-Nets, an ""amendment""
procedure made by the second assembly at higher-resolution to refine the
decision taken by the first one, and a final decision obtained by majority
voting. During our validation, AssemblyNet showed competitive performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods such as U-Net, Joint label fusion and
SLANT. Moreover, we investigated the scan-rescan consistency and the robustness
to disease effects of our method. These experiences demonstrated the
reliability of AssemblyNet. Finally, we showed the interest of using
semi-supervised learning to improve the performance of our method.

  overlap with arXiv:1908.03093",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing a lightweight and robust portrait segmentation algorithm is an
important task for a wide range of face applications. However, the problem has
been considered as a subset of the object segmentation problem and less handled
in the semantic segmentation field. Obviously, portrait segmentation has its
unique requirements. First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in
the middle of a whole process of many real-world applications, it requires
extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in
this domain that contain a sufficient number of images with unbiased
statistics. To solve the first problem, we introduce the new extremely
lightweight portrait segmentation model SINet, containing an information
blocking decoder and spatial squeeze modules. The information blocking decoder
uses confidence estimates to recover local spatial information without spoiling
global consistency. The spatial squeeze module uses multiple receptive fields
to cope with various sizes of consistency in the image. To tackle the second
problem, we propose a simple method to create additional portrait segmentation
data which can improve accuracy on the EG1800 dataset. In our qualitative and
quantitative analysis on the EG1800 dataset, we show that our method
outperforms various existing lightweight segmentation models. Our method
reduces the number of parameters from 2.1M to 86.9K (around 95.9% reduction),
while maintaining the accuracy under an 1% margin from the state-of-the-art
portrait segmentation method. We also show our model is successfully executed
on a real mobile device with 100.6 FPS. In addition, we demonstrate that our
method can be used for general semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset.

segment copy detection. The objective of video segment copy detection is to
find the video (s) present in a large database, one of whose segments (cropped
in time) is a (transformed) copy of the given query video. This transformation
may be temporal (for example frame dropping, change in frame rate) or spatial
(brightness and contrast change, addition of noise etc.) in nature although the
primary focus of this report is detecting temporal attacks. The video hashing
method proposed by us uses a deep learning neural network to learn variable
length binary hash codes for the entire video considering both temporal and
spatial features into account. This is in contrast to most existing video
hashing methods, as they use conventional image hashing techniques to obtain
hash codes for a video after extracting features for every frame or certain key
frames, in which case the temporal information present in the video is not
exploited. Our hashing method is specifically resilient to time cropping making
it extremely useful in video segment copy detection. Experimental results
obtained on the large augmented dataset consisting of around 25,000 videos with
segment copies demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed video hashing method.

develop a miniature focus-adjustable PAE (FA-PAE) probe characterized by both
high resolution (in micrometers) and large depth of focus (DOF) via a novel
optomechanical design for focus adjustment. To realize high resolution and
large DOF in a miniature probe, a 2-mm plano-convex lens is specially adopted,
and the mechanical translation of a single-mode fiber is meticulously designed
to allow the use of multi-focus image fusion (MIF) for extended DOF. Compared
with existing PAE probes, our FA-PAE probe achieves high resolution of 3-5
{\mu}m within unprecedentedly large DOF of >3.2 mm, more than 27 times the DOF
of the probe without performing focus adjustment for MIF. The superior
performance is demonstrated by imaging both phantoms and animals including mice
and zebrafishes in vivo. Our work opens new perspectives for PAE biomedical
applications.

The question of how to apply these principles not just to the static input and

paper we describe our inclusive and overarching approach to apply the FAIR

semantic model consists of classes and relations from a number of existing

to formulate and answer new kinds of competency questions. Our evaluation shows

algorithm to address the problem of localizing sound sources in visual scenes.
In order to achieve this goal, a two-stream network structure which handles
each modality with attention mechanism is developed for sound source

without human annotation. In addition, a new sound source dataset is developed
for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, our empirical evaluation shows that
the unsupervised method generates false conclusions in some cases. Thereby, we
show that this false conclusion cannot be fixed without human prior knowledge
due to the well-known correlation and causality mismatch misconception. To fix
this issue, we extend our network to the supervised and semi-supervised network
settings via a simple modification due to the general architecture of our
two-stream network. We show that the false conclusions can be effectively
corrected even with a small amount of supervision, i.e., semi-supervised setup.

understanding of \NP-hard problems. Given this success with the TIME resource,
it seems but natural to use this approach for dealing with the SPACE resource.
First attempts in this direction have considered a few individual problems,
with some success: Fafianie and Kratsch [MFCS'14] and Chitnis et al. [SODA'15]
introduced the notions of streaming kernels and parameterized streaming
algorithms respectively. For example, the latter shows how to refine the
$\Omega(n^2)$ bit lower bound for finding a minimum Vertex Cover (VC) in the
streaming setting by designing an algorithm for the parameterized $k$-VC
problem which uses $O(k^{2}\log n)$ bits.
  In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of graph problems from the
paradigm of parameterized streaming algorithms. We first define a natural
hierarchy of space complexity classes of FPS, SubPS, SemiPS, SupPS and BrutePS,

sparse matrix $H$ that can exploit localization features of the eigenvector.
When the eigenvector to be computed is localized, meaning only a small number
of its components have large magnitudes, the proposed algorithm identifies the
location of these components in a greedy manner, and obtains approximations to
the desired eigenpairs of $H$ by computing eigenpairs of a submatrix extracted
from the corresponding rows and columns of $H$. Even when the eigenvector is
not completely localized, the approximate eigenvectors obtained by the greedy
algorithm can be used as good starting guesses to accelerate the convergence of
an iterative eigensolver applied to $H$. We discuss a few possibilities for
selecting important rows and columns of $H$ and techniques for constructing
good initial guesses for an iterative eigensolver using the approximate
eigenvectors returned from the greedy algorithm. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach with examples from nuclear quantum many-body
calculations, many-body localization studies of quantum spin chains and road
network analysis.

have been proven to be linked to increased risks of a multitude of negative
health outcomes and conditions when children reach adulthood and beyond.
  Objective: To better understand the relationship between ACEs and their
relevant risk factors with associated health outcomes and to eventually design
and implement preventive interventions, access to an integrated coherent
dataset is needed. Therefore, we implemented a formal ontology as a resource to
allow the mental health community to facilitate data integration and knowledge
modeling and to improve ACEs surveillance and research.
  Methods: We use advanced knowledge representation and Semantic Web tools and
techniques to implement the ontology. The current implementation of the
ontology is expressed in the description logic ALCRIQ(D), a sublogic of Web
Ontology Language (OWL 2).
  Results: The ACEs Ontology has been implemented and made available to the
mental health community and the public via the BioPortal repository. Moreover,
multiple use-case scenarios have been introduced to showcase and evaluate the
usability of the ontology in action. The ontology was created to be used by
major actors in the ACEs community with different applications, from the
diagnosis of individuals and predicting potential negative outcomes that they
might encounter to the prevention of ACEs in a population and designing
interventions and policies.
  Conclusions: The ACEs Ontology provides a uniform and reusable semantic
