from the performance of the visual images. The challenge is the extreme
non-rigid distortions of the caricatures introduced by exaggerating the facial
features to strengthen the characters. In this paper, we propose dynamic
multi-task learning based on deep CNNs for cross-modal caricature-visual face
recognition. Instead of the conventional multi-task learning with fixed weights
of the tasks, the proposed dynamic multi-task learning dynamically updates the
weights of tasks according to the importance of the tasks, which enables the
training of the networks focus on the hard task instead of being stuck in the
overtraining of the easy task. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the dynamic multi-task learning for caricature-visual face
recognition. The performance evaluated on the datasets CaVI and WebCaricature
show the superiority over the state-of-art methods. The implementation code is
available here.

using local frequency or phase angle measurement are derived. Using a
two-machine power system model, it is shown that improved damping of inter-area
oscillations must come at the cost of reduced transient stability margins,
regardless of the control design method. The control limitations stem from that
the excitation of an inter-area mode by external disturbances cannot be
estimated with certainty using local frequency information. The results are
validated on a modified Kundur four-machine two-area test system where the
active power is modulated on an embedded high-voltage dc link. Damping control
using local phase angle measurements, unavoidably leads to an increased rotor
angle deviation following certain load disturbances. For a highly stressed
system, it is shown that this may lead to transient instability. The
limitations derived in the paper may motivate the need for wide-area
measurements in power oscillation damping control.

In amorphous solids, structural disorder generates a number of poorly
understood phenomena that are absent in crystals. Starting from an effective
field theory description which accounts for disorder in terms of momentum
diffusion, we provide a unified theoretical description of the VDOS of
amorphous materials. The theory provides an excellent description of the
simulated/experimental VDOS of two quite different materials (silica glass and
amorphous Si) with very few non-trivial fitting parameters. In particular, the
phonons speeds and diffusive linewidths obtained from the fits are fully
consistent with the tabulated values from experiments. This semi-analytical
approach solves the long-standing problem of describing and explaining the
features of the VDOS and Raman spectra of amorphous solids in relation with the
underlying acoustic dispersion relations and acoustic attenuation. Furthermore,
it can be used in a reverse-engineered way to estimate phonon dispersion
relations, acoustic attenuation and dynamic structure factors from a simple
fitting of the VDOS with the presented model.

that employs a novel proof-of-stake byzantine consensus protocol to efficiently
scale the distributed transaction agreement problem to billions of users. In
addition to being more democratic and energy-efficient, compared to popular
protocols such as Bitcoin, Algorand also touts a much high transaction
throughput. This paper is the first attempt in the literature to study and
address this problem. By carefully modeling the participation costs and rewards
received within a strategic interaction scenario, we first empirically show
that even a small number of nodes defecting to participate in the protocol
tasks due to insufficiency of the available incentives can result in the
Algorand network failing to compute and add new blocks of transactions. We
further show that this effect can be formalized by means of a mathematical
model of interaction in Algorand given its participation costs and the current
(or planned) reward distribution/sharing approach envisioned by the Algorand
Foundation. Specifically, on analyzing this game model we observed that mutual
cooperation under the currently proposed reward sharing approach is not a Nash
equilibrium. This is a significant result which could threaten the success of
an otherwise robust distributed consensus mechanism. We propose a novel reward
sharing approach for Algorand and formally show that it is
incentive-compatible, i.e., it can guarantee cooperation within a group of
selfish Algorand users. Extensive numerical and Algorand simulation results
further confirm our analytical findings. Moreover, these results show that for
a given distribution of stakes in the network, our reward sharing approach can
guarantee cooperation with a significantly smaller reward per round.

between 5,300 \r{A}-9,000 \r{A} and an average photometric precision of 708 ppm
in 230 \r{A} bins. We perform an atmospheric retrieval of our transmission
spectrum combined with literature HST/WFC3 observations to search for the
presence of clouds/hazes as well as Na, K, H$\alpha$, and $\rm H_2O$ planetary
absorption and stellar spot contamination over a combined spectral range of

find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a
combination of heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a clear
planetary atmosphere with $\rm H_2O$. This model yields a log-evidence of
$8.26\pm0.42$ higher than a flat (featureless) spectrum. In particular, the

group closeness maximization, in turn, is more challenging: the objective is to
find a vertex group that is central as a whole and state-of-the-art heuristics
for it do not scale to very big graphs yet.
  In this paper, we present new local search heuristics for group closeness
maximization. By using randomized approximation techniques and dynamic data
structures, our algorithms are often able to perform locally optimal decisions
efficiently. The final result is a group with high (but not optimal) closeness
centrality.
  We compare our algorithms to the current state-of-the-art greedy heuristic
both on weighted and on unweighted real-world graphs. For graphs with hundreds
of millions of edges, our local search algorithms take only around ten minutes,
while greedy requires more than ten hours. Overall, our new algorithms are
between one and two orders of magnitude faster, depending on the desired group
size and solution quality. For example, on weighted graphs and $k = 10$, our
algorithms yield solutions of $12,4\%$ higher quality, while also being
$793,6\times$ faster. For unweighted graphs and $k = 10$, we achieve solutions

a right-handed neutrino superfield. We calculate the CP asymmetry,
$\varepsilon$, and find it to be non-zero at tree-level without using thermal
effects for the final state particles. This is in contrast to soft leptogenesis
in the MSSM extended by a right-handed neutrino superfield where thermal
effects are essential. The difference arises due to the presence of a 3-body
decay of the sneutrino in the NMSSM that violates lepton number at tree-level.
Apart from this, we also find that $\varepsilon\neq 0$ if the additional
singlet scalar has a complex vacuum expectation value while all the other NMSSM
parameters including the soft SUSY breaking ones relevant for CP asymmetry
remain real. We estimate the order of magnitudes of these parameters to produce
sufficient baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

network-on-chip (NoC), coalescing, memory and control divergence, and L1 cache
behavior. A GPU consists of several StreamingMulti-processors (SMs) that
collectively determine how shared resources are partitioned and accessed.
Recent years have seen divergent paths in SM scaling towards scale-up (fewer,
larger SMs) vs. scale-out (more, smaller SMs). However, neither scaling up nor
scaling out can meet the scalability requirement of all applications running on
a given GPU system, which inevitably results in performance degradation and
resource under-utilization for some applications. In this work, we investigate
major design parameters that influence GPU scaling. We then propose AMOEBA, a
solution to GPU scaling through reconfigurable SM cores. AMOEBA monitors and
predicts application scalability at run-time and adjusts the SM configuration
to meet program requirements. AMOEBA also enables dynamic creation of
heterogeneous SMs through independent fusing or splitting. AMOEBA is a
microarchitecture-based solution and requires no additional programming effort
or custom compiler support. Our experimental evaluations with application
programs from various benchmark suites indicate that AMOEBA is able to achieve
a maximum performance gain of 4.3x, and generates an average performance
improvement of 47% when considering all benchmarks tested.

discovering models of spatiotemporally complex dynamics directly from data. In
many instances, such models are in the form of nonlinear partial differential

various partial derivatives. However, accurate evaluation of derivatives,
especially of high order, is infeasible when the data are noisy, which has a
dramatic negative effect on the result of regression. We present a novel and
rather general approach that addresses this difficulty by using a weak
formulation of the problem. For instance, it allows accurate reconstruction of
PDEs involving high-order derivatives, such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation, from data with a considerable amount of noise. The flexibility of our
approach also allows reconstruction of PDE models that involve latent variables
which cannot be measured directly with acceptable accuracy. This is illustrated
by reconstructing a model for a weakly turbulent flow in a thin fluid layer,
where neither the forcing nor the pressure field is known.

Boucksom provided a characterization of his divisorial Zariski decomposition in
terms of the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki quadratic form. Different variants of
singular holomorphic symplectic varieties have been extensively studied in
recent years. In this note we first show that the ""Boucksom-Zariski""
decomposition holds for effective divisors in the largest possible framework of
varieties with symplectic singularities. On the other hand in the case of
projective surfaces, it was recently shown that there is a strict relation
between the boundedness of coefficients of Zariski decompositions of
pseudoeffective integral divisors and the bounded negativity conjecture. In the
present note, we show that an analogous phenomenon can be observed in the case
of projective irreducible symplectic manifolds. We furthermore prove an
effective analog of the bounded negativity conjecture in the smooth case.
Combining these results we obtain information on the denominators of
""Boucksom-Zariski"" decompositions for holomorphic symplectic manifolds. From
such a bound we easily deduce a result of effective birationality for big line

the bottleneck for the large-scale deployments of indoor networks. On one hand,
the size of beacon devices is required to be small enough for easy deployment,
which further limits the size of battery. On the other hand, replacing the
batteries of the beacon devices could lead to high maintenance costs. It is
important to provide them with full energy autonomy. To tackle this problem we
propose BEH: an indoor beacon system aimed at operating perpetually without
batteries. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose four methods to
increase the utilization efficiency of harvested RF energy in the beacon
system, by which the energy consumption level becomes low enough to fit within
the energy harvesting budget. Secondly, we implement BEH using Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) and Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting devices, and test BEH
extensively in a laboratory environment. Our test results show that BEH can

  Preservation","Accepted as a long paper at INLG 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the success of style transfer in image processing, it has seen
limited progress in natural language generation. Part of the problem is that
content is not as easily decoupled from style in the text domain. Curiously, in
the field of stylometry, content does not figure prominently in practical
methods of discriminating stylistic elements, such as authorship and genre.
Rather, syntax and function words are the most salient features. Drawing on
this work, we model style as a suite of low-level linguistic controls, such as
frequency of pronouns, prepositions, and subordinate clause constructions. We
train a neural encoder-decoder model to reconstruct reference sentences given
only content words and the setting of the controls. We perform style transfer
by keeping the content words fixed while adjusting the controls to be
indicative of another style. In experiments, we show that the model reliably
responds to the linguistic controls and perform both automatic and manual
evaluations on style transfer. We find we can fool a style classifier 84% of
the time, and that our model produces highly diverse and stylistically
distinctive outputs. This work introduces a formal, extendable model of style
that can add control to any neural text generation system.

Ostwald Ripening. Specifically, we look at a discrete droplet population model,
which in the limit of an infinite droplet population reduces to the classical
Lifshitz--Slyozov--Wagner model. We also look at the Cahn--Hilliard equation
with constant mobility. We define the coarsening rate as $\beta=-(t/F)(d F/d
t)$, where $F$ is the total free energy of the system and $t$ is time. There is
a conjecture that the long-time average value of $\beta$ should not exceed
$1/3$ -- this result is summarized here as $\langle \beta\rangle\leq 1/3$. We
explore this conjecture for the two considered models. Using large-scale
computational resources (specifically, GPU computing employing thousands of
threads), we are able to construct ensembles of simulations and thereby build
up a statistical picture of $\beta$. Our results show that the droplet
population model and the Cahn--Hilliard equation (asymmetric mixtures) are
demonstrably in agreement with $\langle\beta\rangle\leq 1/3$. The results for
the Cahn--Hilliard equation in the case of symmetric mixtures show
$\langle\beta\rangle$ sometimes exceeds $1/3$ in our simulations. However, the
possibility is left open for the very long-time average values of $\langle
\beta\rangle$ to be bounded above by $1/3$. The theoretical methodology laid
out in this paper sets a path for future more intensive computational studies
whereby this conjecture can be explored in more depth. \end{abstract}

ever since they were discovered. Numerous enhancements are proposed in
literature and it is often overwhelming as to which would be the best for
implementation. A certain enhancement can take far too long to fine tune its
hyper parameters or to decide whether it is going to not make much of a
difference due to the memory limitations. On the other hand are the best first
pruning techniques, mostly the counterparts of the infamous SSS* algorithm, the
algorithm which proved out to be disruptive at the time of its discovery but
gradually became outcast as being too memory intensive and having a higher time
complexity. Later research doesn't see the best first approaches to be
completely different from the depth first based enhancements but both seem to
be transitionary in the sense that a best first approach could be looked as a
depth first approach with a certain set of enhancements and with the growing
power of the computers, SSS* didn't seem to be as taxing on the memory either.
Even so, there seems to be quite difficulty in understanding the nature of the
SSS* algorithm, why it does what it does and it being termed as being too
complex to fathom, visualize and understand on an intellectual level. This
article tries to bridge this gap and provide some experimental results
comparing the two with the most promising advances.

dark matter coupled to a dark photon that mixes with the photon and dark matter
coupled to photons through an electric or magnetic dipole moment. We discuss
contributions to the freeze-in production of such dark matter particles from
standard model fermion-antifermion annihilation and plasmon decay. We also
derive constraints on such dark matter from the cooling of red giant stars and

the bremsstrahlung process that dominates for masses above the plasma

value of the dark gauge coupling constant for the dark photon portal model, and
below a few keV, depending on the reheating temperature for dark matter with an

mathematical model. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.
Mathematical models were sought as more trustworthy as their prediction is
based on the laws of physics expressed in the form of mathematical equations.
However, the majority of existing mathematical models include different
empirical parameters, and both approaches inherit inevitable experimental
errors. At the same time, the approximation of neural networks can reproduce
the solution extremely well if fed with a sufficient amount of data. The
difference is that an ANN requires big data to build its accurate approximation
whereas a typical mathematical model needs just several data points to estimate
an empirical constant. Therefore, the common problem that developer meet is the
inaccuracy of mathematical models and artificial neural network. An another
common challenge is the computational complexity of the mathematical models, or
lack of data for a sufficient precision of the Artificial Neural Networks. In
the presented paper those problems are addressed using the integration of a
mathematical model with an artificial neural network. In the presented
analysis, an ANN predicts just a part of the mathematical model and its weights
and biases are adjusted based on the output of the mathematical model. The
performance of Integrated Mathematical modeling - Artificial Neural Network

IC 63 at high resolution from the UV to the NIR (275 nm to 1.6 $\mu$m), using
the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3. Using a Bayesian SED fitting tool, we
simultaneously derive a set of stellar ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log(g)$, distance)

The extinction properties vary across the PDR, with values for $A_V$ between
0.5 and 1.4 mag, and a decreasing trend in $R_V$, going from 3.7 at the front
of the nebula to values as low as 2.5 further in. This provides evidence for
evolution of the dust optical properties. We fit two modified blackbodies to
the MIR and FIR SED, obtained by combining the $A_V$ map with data from Spitzer

Traditionally these approaches are model-based, i.e., assuming a network or
channel model they are focused on stability analysis and appropriate controller
designs. However the availability of such wireless channel modeling is
fundamentally challenging in practice as channels are typically unknown a
priori and only available through data samples. In this work we aim to develop
algorithms that rely on channel sample data to determine the stability and
performance of networked control tasks. In this regard our work is the first to
characterize the amount of channel modeling that is required to answer such a
question. Specifically we examine how many channel data samples are required in
order to answer with high confidence whether a given networked control system
is stable or not. This analysis is based on the notion of sample complexity
from the learning literature and is facilitated by concentration inequalities.
Moreover we establish a direct relation between the sample complexity and the
networked system stability margin, i.e., the underlying packet success rate of
the channel and the spectral radius of the dynamics of the control system. This
illustrates that it becomes impractical to verify stability under a large range
of plant and channel configurations. We validate our theoretical results in
numerical simulations.

  Surfaces and Manifolds",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How good is a triangulation as an approximation of a smooth curved surface or
manifold? We provide bounds on the {\em interpolation error}, the error in the
position of the surface, and the {\em normal error}, the error in the normal
vectors of the surface, as approximated by a piecewise linearly triangulated
surface whose vertices lie on the original, smooth surface. The interpolation
error is the distance from an arbitrary point on the triangulation to the
nearest point on the original, smooth manifold, or vice versa. The normal error
is the angle separating the vector (or space) normal to a triangle from the
vector (or space) normal to the smooth manifold (measured at a suitable point
near the triangle). We also study the {\em normal variation}, the angle
separating the normal vectors (or normal spaces) at two different points on a
smooth manifold. Our bounds apply to manifolds of any dimension embedded in
Euclidean spaces of any dimension, and our interpolation error bounds apply to
simplices of any dimension, although our normal error bounds apply only to
triangles. These bounds are expressed in terms of the sizes of suitable medial
balls (the {\em empty ball size} or {\em local feature size} measured at
certain points on the manifold), and have applications in Delaunay
triangulation-based algorithms for provably good surface reconstruction and
provably good mesh generation. Our bounds have better constants than the prior
bounds we know of---and for several results in higher dimensions, our bounds
are the first to give explicit constants.

benefits. On the other hand, asynchrony implies inherent challenges in
understanding the execution of the algorithm and its convergence, stemming from

Tikhonov-Fenichel parameters and their respective critical manifolds. By
combining Tikhonov-Fenichel parameters with scaling analysis and energy
methods, we derive improved upper bounds on the approximation error for the

previous analyses suggest that the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation is
only valid when initial enzyme concentrations greatly exceed initial substrate
concentrations. However, our results indicate that this approximation can be
valid when initial enzyme and substrate concentrations are of equal magnitude.
Using energy methods, we find that the condition for the validity of the
reverse quasi-steady-state approximation is far less restrictive than was
previously assumed, and we derive a new ""small"" parameter that determines the
validity of this approximation. In doing so, we extend the established domain
of validity for the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation. Consequently,
this opens up the possibility of utilizing the reverse quasi-steady-state
approximation to model enzyme catalyzed reactions and estimate kinetic
parameters in enzymatic assays at much lower enzyme to substrate ratios than
was previously thought. Moreover, we show for the first time that the critical
manifold of the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation contains a singular

transcritical bifurcation, and the corresponding normal form of this
bifurcation is recovered through scaling analysis.

experimental observations of relaxation in such simulations, measured on up to
1440 qubits with microsecond resolution. By initializing the system in a state
with topological obstruction, we observe quantum annealing (QA) relaxation
timescales in excess of one microsecond. Measurements indicate a dynamical
advantage in the quantum simulation over the classical approach of
path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) fixed-Hamiltonian relaxation with multiqubit
cluster updates. The advantage increases with both system size and inverse
temperature, exceeding a million-fold speedup over a CPU. This is an important
piece of experimental evidence that in general, PIMC does not mimic QA dynamics

highest. One example of such a cluster is NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic

characterize the massive star content of the core of NGC 330 which contains
more than 200 B stars, 2 O stars, 6 A-type supergiants and 11 red supergiants.
We find a lower limit on the Be star fraction of $32 \pm 3\%$ in the whole

However, binding strengths vary widely in the literature, even when using
almost identical computational methods. To address this issue, we investigate
the adsorption of a variety of metals onto graphene, carbon nanotubes, and
boron nitride nanotubes. As is well-known, calculations on periodic structures
require a sufficiently large system size to remove interactions between
periodic images. Our results indicate that there are both direct and indirect
mechanisms for this interaction, where the latter can require even larger
system sizes than typically employed. The magnitude and distance of the effect
depend on the electronic state of the substrate and the open- or closed-shell
nature of the adsorbate. For instance, insulating substrates (e.g., boron
nitride nanotubes) show essentially no dependence on system size, whereas
metallic or semi-metallic systems can have a substantial effect due to the
delocalized nature of the electronic states interacting with the adsorbate. We
derive a scaling relation for the length dependence with a representative
tight-binding model. These results demonstrate how to extrapolate the binding
energies to the isolated-impurity limit.

pc) star formation and feedback, describing how galaxies convert gas into stars
as a function of the galactic environment. Progress has been hampered by a lack
of robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifecycle.
We address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for
measuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and
feedback to a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the
PHANGS-ALMA survey. We measure the spatially-resolved ($\sim100$ pc)
CO-to-H$\alpha$ flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between
molecular gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the
underlying evolutionary timeline. GMC lifetimes are short, typically 10-30 Myr,
and exhibit environmental variation, between and within galaxies. At kpc-scale
molecular gas surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm
H_2}\geqslant8$M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$, the GMC lifetime correlates with
time-scales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at $\Sigma_{\rm
H_2}\leqslant8$M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and
live for an internal dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without
massive star formation traced by H$\alpha$ (75-90% of the cloud lifetime), GMCs
disperse within just 1-5 Myr once massive stars emerge. The dispersal is most
likely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star
formation efficiencies of 4-10% These results show that galactic star formation
is governed by cloud-scale, environmentally-dependent, dynamical processes
driving rapid evolutionary cycling. GMCs and HII regions are the fundamental
units undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations of 100-300 pc in
star-forming discs. Future work should characterise the multi-scale physics and
mass flows driving these lifecycles.

the lack of a universal star formation law, that could univocally link the gas

recent paper, we used a sample of nearby disc galaxies to infer the volumetric
star formation (VSF) law, a tight correlation between the gas and the SFR
volume densities derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium for
the gas disc. However, due to the dearth of information about the vertical
distribution of the SFR in these galaxies, we could not find a unique slope for
the VSF law, but two alternative values. In this paper, we use the scale height
of the SFR density distribution in our Galaxy adopting classical Cepheids
(age$\lesssim 200$ Myr) as tracers of star formation. We show that this latter
is fully compatible with the flaring scale height expected from gas in
hydrostatic equilibrium. These scale heights allowed us to convert the observed
surface densities of gas and SFR into the corresponding volume densities. Our
results indicate that the VSF law $\rho_\mathrm{SFR} \propto
\rho_\mathrm{gas}^\alpha$ with $\alpha \approx 2$ is valid in the Milky Way as

small clusters of ~30 objects in the absence of initial binaries. Binaries form
dynamically through Newtonian gravitational interactions. These binaries act as
heat sources for the cluster, increasing the cluster's velocity dispersion,
which inhibits direct mergers through gravitational-wave two-body captures.
Meanwhile, three-body encounters of tight binaries are too rare to tighten
binaries sufficiently to allow them to merge through gravitational-wave
emission. We conclude that in the absence of initial binaries, merger rates of
primordial black holes in the Bird et al. (2016) initial cluster configuration
are at least an order of magnitude lower than previously suggested, which makes
gravitational-wave detections of such sources improbable.

relationship can also be established for tensor network models of AdS/CFT based
on regular bulk geometries, leading to an analytical form of the maximal
central charges exhibited by the boundary states. We identify a class of
tensors based on Majorana dimer states that saturate these bounds in the large
curvature limit, while also realizing perfect and block-perfect holographic
quantum error correcting codes. Furthermore, the renormalization group
description of the resulting model is shown to be analogous to the strong
disorder renormalization group, thus giving the first example of an exact
quantum error correcting code that gives rise to a well-understood critical
system. These systems exhibit a large range of fractional central charges,
tunable by the choice of bulk tiling. Our approach thus provides a precise
physical interpretation of tensor network models on regular hyperbolic
geometries and establishes quantitative connections to a wide range of existing
models.

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of multiple H$_2$CS $J=7-6$
and $J=10-9$ lines from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) to
create a temperature map for the inner $\sim$200 AU of the disk-like structure.
This molecule is a particularly useful temperature probe because transitions
between energy levels with different $K_{\rm{a}}$ quantum numbers operate only
through collisions. Based on the H$_2$CS line ratios, the temperature is
between $\sim$100$-$175 K in the inner $\sim$150 AU, and drops to $\sim$75 K at
$\sim$200 AU. At the current resolution (0.5$^{\prime\prime} \sim$70 AU), no
jump is seen in the temperature at the disk-envelope interface. The temperature
structure derived from H$_2$CS is consistent with envelope temperature profiles
that constrain the temperature from 1000 AU scales down to $\sim$100 AU, but
does not follow the temperature rise seen in these profiles at smaller radii.
Higher angular resolution observations of optically thin temperature tracers
are needed to establish whether cooling by gas-phase water, the presence of a
putative disk or the dust optical depth influences the gas temperature at
$\lesssim$100 AU scales. The temperature at 100 AU is higher in IRAS 16293A

on the nature of these early objects. In particular, transmission of Lyman
alpha (Ly$\alpha$) from galaxies through the intergalactic medium (IGM) is
sensitive to neutral hydrogen in the IGM, so can be used to probe the
reionization timeline. In this work, we implement an improved model of the
galaxy UV luminosity to dark matter halo mass relation to infer the
volume-averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM from Ly$\alpha$
observations. Many models assume that UV-bright galaxies are hosted by massive
dark matter haloes in overdense regions of the IGM, so reside in relatively
large ionized regions. However, observations and N-body simulations indicate
that scatter in the UV luminosity-halo mass relation is expected. Here, we
model the scatter (though we assume the IGM topology is unaffected) and assess
the impact on Ly$\alpha$ visibility during reionization. We show that UV
luminosity-halo mass scatter reduces Ly$\alpha$ visibility compared to models
without scatter, and that this is most significant for UV-bright galaxies. We
then use our model with scatter to infer the neutral fraction,
$\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}}$, at $z \sim 7$ using a sample of Lyman-break
galaxies in legacy fields. We infer $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}} =
0.55_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ with scatter, compared to $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}} =
0.59_{-0.14}^{+0.12}$ without scatter, a very slight decrease and consistent

detectors, and chromatic photon sorting have opened up the possibility for
building a large-scale detector that can discriminate between Cherenkov and

to observe particle direction and species using Cherenkov light while also
having the excellent energy resolution and low threshold of a scintillator
detector. Situated in a deep underground laboratory, and utilizing new
techniques in computing and reconstruction techniques, such a detector could
achieve unprecedented levels of background rejection, thus enabling a rich
physics program that would span topics in nuclear, high-energy, and
astrophysics, and across a dynamic range from hundreds of keV to many GeV. The
scientific program would include observations of low- and high-energy solar
neutrinos, determination of neutrino mass ordering and measurement of the
neutrino CP violating phase, observations of diffuse supernova neutrinos and
neutrinos from a supernova burst, sensitive searches for nucleon decay and,
ultimately, a search for NeutrinoLess Double Beta Decay (NLDBD) with
sensitivity reaching the normal ordering regime of neutrino mass phase space.

number density of polarised source components is comparable with recent

that those sources coincident with X-ray clusters are consistent in their

different numbers of trapped particles is studied, and it is shown that the

theories has both theoretical and practical motivation. From the theoretical
point of view, it answers the question of whether a hypothetical computer that
utilizes quantum field theory would be more powerful than other quantum
computers. From the practical point of view, when reliable quantum computers
are eventually built, these algorithms can help us better understand the
underlying physics that govern our world.
  In the best known quantum algorithms for simulating quantum field theories,
the time scaling is dominated by initial state preparation. In this paper, we
exclusively focus on state preparation and present a heuristic algorithm that
can prepare the vacuum of fermionic systems in more general cases and more
efficiently than previous methods. With our method, state preparation is no
longer the bottleneck, as its runtime has the same asymptotic scaling with the
desired precision as the remainder of the simulation algorithm. We numerically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for the 1+1 dimensional
Gross-Neveu model.

called {\it synaptosomes}, which possess multiple interaction sites. Despite
the critical importance of synaptosomes, the mechanisms of their formation
remain not well understood. Because of the multi-site nature of participating
proteins, it is widely believed that their search for specific sites on DNA
involves the formation and breaking of DNA loops and sliding in the looped
configurations. In reality, DNA in live cells is densely covered by other
biological molecules that might interfere with the formation of synaptosomes.
In this work, we developed a theoretical approach to evaluate the role of
obstacles in the target search of multi-site proteins when the formation of DNA
loops and the sliding in looped configurations are possible. Our theoretical
method is based on analysis of a discrete-state stochastic model that uses a
master equations approach and extensive computer simulations. It is found that
the obstacle slows down the search dynamics in the system when DNA loops are
long-lived, but the effect is minimal for short-lived DNA loops. In addition,
the relative positions of the target and the obstacle strongly influence the
target search kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of the obstacle might
increase the noise in the system. These observations are discussed using
physical-chemical arguments. Our theoretical approach clarifies the molecular
mechanisms of formation of protein-DNA complexes with multiple interactions
sites.

general $K$-contractions, as their spectra can be properly contained in the
support. Nevertheless, the ""localizable"" portion of the support always consists
of spectral points. When the support is assumed to be small in an appropriate

devise a systematic methodology to actively cloak swimming objects within any

to conceal the target swimmer throughout its motion using cooperative flocks of
swimming agents equipped with adaptive decision-making intelligence. Through a
reinforcement learning algorithm, the cloaking agents experientially learn
optimal adaptive behavioral policy in the presence of flow-mediated
interactions. This artificial intelligence enables them to dynamically adjust
their swimming actions, so as to optimally form and robustly retain any desired
arrangement around the moving object without disturbing it from its original
path. Therefore, the presented active cloaking approach not only is robust
against disturbances, but also is non-invasive to motion of the cloaked object.
We then further generalize the proposed approach and demonstrate how our
cloaking agents can be readily used, in any region of interest, to realize
hydrodynamic invisibility cloaks around any number of arbitrary intruders.

bottom-TJ device throughout 5 orders of current density (0.015 - 1000

of this paper is to control the torque and consequently the speed of a PMSM

a fast transient response, low ripples and small steady-state error. The
control algorithm uses two neural networks, called critic and actor. The former
is utilized to evaluate the cost and the latter is used to generate control

Simulations and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides
desirable results under both accurate and uncertain modeled dynamics. Although
the performance of FOC method is comparable with ADP under nominal conditions,
the torque and speed response of ADP is better than FOC under realistic

proposed, involving the splitting of filaments at each step into pairs of
daughter filaments with differing properties, in effect two distinct
simultaneous cascades. Neither of these cascades has the Richardson-Kolmogorov
exponent of 1/3. This bimodal structure is also different from bifractal models
as vorticity volume is conserved. If cascades are assumed to be initiated
continuously and throughout space we obtain a model of the inertial range of
stationary turbulence. We impose the constraint associated with Kolmogorov's
four-fifths law and then adjust the splitting to achieve good agreement with
the observed structure exponents $\zeta_p$. The presence of two elements to the
cascade is responsible for the nonlinear dependence of $\zeta_p$ upon $p$.
  A single cascade provides a model for the initial-value problem of the
Navier--Stokes equations in the limit of vanishing viscosity. To simulate this

millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be
prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require
the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of

point processes, so-called resource selection analyses are among the most
common way to statistically treat animal telemetry data. However, most resource
selection analyses provide inference based on approximations of point process

of formulating a joint demosaicing and super-resolution (JDSR) problem. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end optimization solution to the JDSR problem and
demonstrate its practical significance in computational imaging. Our technical
contributions are mainly two-fold. On network design, we have developed a
Residual-Dense Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (RDSEN) supported by a
pre-demosaicing network (PDNet) as the pre-processing step. We address the
issue of spatio-spectral attention for color-filter-array (CFA) data and
discuss how to achieve better information flow by concatenating Residue-Dense
Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks (RDSEBs) for JDSR. Experimental results have
shown that significant PSNR/SSIM gain can be achieved by RDSEN over previous
network architectures including state-of-the-art RCAN. On perceptual
optimization, we propose to leverage the latest ideas including relativistic
discriminator and pre-excitation perceptual loss function to further improve
the visual quality of textured regions in reconstructed images. Our extensive
experiment results have shown that Texture-enhanced Relativistic average
Generative Adversarial Network (TRaGAN) can produce both subjectively more
pleasant images and objectively lower perceptual distortion scores than
standard GAN for JDSR. Finally, we have verified the benefit of JDSR to
high-quality image reconstruction from real-world Bayer pattern data collected

are built from a whitening transformation to generate univariate orthonormal

to produce the multivariate version. SCE, as it stems from compactly supported
B-splines, tackles locally prominent responses more effectively than the

demonstrated in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the output function,
leading to the mean-square convergence of SCE to the correct limit. Analytical
formulae are proposed to calculate the mean and variance of an SCE

cavitation numbers for both laminar and turbulent regimes. We observe
non-cavitating, cyclic and transitional cavitation regimes with reduction in
freestream $\sigma$. The cavitation inside the Karman vortices in the cyclic
regime, is significantly altered by the onset of ""condensation front""
propagation in the transitional regime. At the transition, an order of
magnitude jump in shedding Strouhal number is observed as the dominant
frequency shifts from periodic vortex shedding in the cyclic regime, to
irregular-regular vortex shedding in the transitional regime. In addition, a
peak in pressure fluctuations, and a maximum in St versus $\sigma$ based on
cavity length are observed at the transition. Shedding characteristics in each
regime are discussed using dynamic mode decomposition. It is demonstrated that
the condensation fronts observed in the transitional regime are supersonic
(referred as ""condensation shocks""). In the presence of NCG, multiple
condensation shocks in a given cycle are required for complete cavity
condensation and detachment, as compared to a single condensation shock when
only vapor is present. This is explained by the reduction in pressure ratio
across the shock in the presence of NCG effectively reducing its strength. In
addition, at $\sigma=0.85$ (near transition from the cyclic to the transitional
regime), presence of NCG suppresses the low frequency irregular-regular vortex
shedding. Vorticity transport at $Re=3900$, in the transitional regime,
indicates that the region of attached cavity is nearly two-dimensional with
very low vorticity, affecting Karman shedding in the near wake. In addition,
the boundary-layer separation point is found to be strongly dependent on the

approach, however, shows only moderate accuracy. In this paper, we investigate
whether deep learning can provide a more accurate solution. We propose
PatchNet, a hierarchical deep learning-based approach capable of automatically
extracting features from commit messages and commit code and using them to
identify stable patches. PatchNet contains a deep hierarchical structure that
mirrors the hierarchical and sequential structure of commit code, making it
distinctive from the existing deep learning models on source code. Experiments
on 82,403 recent Linux patches confirm the superiority of PatchNet against
various state-of-the-art baselines, including the one recently-adopted by Linux

quantify the number of effective parameters of vastly over-parameterized
models. The degrees of freedom is a mathematically convenient way to define
this number of parameters. Its computation and properties are well understood
when dealing with discretized linear models, possibly regularized using
sparsity. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking is plagued when
dealing with models having very large parameter spaces. In this case it makes
more sense to consider ""off-the-grid"" approaches, using a continuous parameter
space. This type of approach is the one favoured when training multi-layer
perceptrons, and is also becoming popular to solve super-resolution problems in
imaging. Training these off-the-grid models with a sparsity inducing prior can
be achieved by solving a convex optimization problem over the space of
measures, which is often called the Beurling Lasso (Blasso), and is the
continuous counterpart of the celebrated Lasso parameter selection method. In
previous works, the degrees of freedom for the Lasso was shown to coincide with
the size of the smallest solution support. Our main contribution is a proof of
a continuous counterpart to this result for the Blasso. Our findings suggest
that discretized methods actually vastly over-estimate the number of intrinsic
continuous degrees of freedom. Our second contribution is a detailed study of
the case of sampling Fourier coefficients in 1D, which corresponds to a
super-resolution problem. We show that our formula for the degrees of freedom
is valid outside of a set of measure zero of observations, which in turn
justifies its use to compute an unbiased estimator of the prediction risk using
the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE).

significance for understanding human brain organization, for investigating

brain network (e.g. DTI) and functional brain network (e.g. fMRI) are the
primary networks of interest. Most existing works in brain network analysis
focus on either structural or functional connectivity, which cannot leverage
the complementary information from each other. Although multi-view learning
methods have been proposed to learn from both networks (or views), these
methods aim to reach a consensus among multiple views, and thus distinct
intrinsic properties of each view may be ignored. How to jointly learn
representations from structural and functional brain networks while preserving
their inherent properties is a critical problem. In this paper, we propose a
framework of Siamese community-preserving graph convolutional network (SCP-GCN)
to learn the structural and functional joint embedding of brain networks.
Specifically, we use graph convolutions to learn the structural and functional
joint embedding, where the graph structure is defined with structural
connectivity and node features are from the functional connectivity. Moreover,
we propose to preserve the community structure of brain networks in the graph
convolutions by considering the intra-community and inter-community properties
in the learning process. Furthermore, we use Siamese architecture which models
the pair-wise similarity learning to guide the learning process. To evaluate
the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two real brain
network datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed approach in structural and functional joint embedding for
neurological disorder analysis, indicating its promising value for clinical
applications.

when a monochromatic plane-wave (frequency {\omega}={\omega}_s) suddenly
arrives, at time t=0 and at normal incidence, at the surface of a dispersive
dielectric medium of refractive index n({\omega}). Deep inside the dielectric
host at a distance z0 from the surface, no signal arrives until t=z0/c, where c
is the speed of light in vacuum. Immediately after this point, a weak but
extremely high frequency signal is observed at z=z0. This so-called Sommerfeld
forerunner (or precursor) is highly chirped, meaning that its frequency, which
is much greater than {\omega}_s immediately after t=z0/c, declines rapidly with
the passage of time. The incident light with its characteristic frequency
{\omega}_s eventually arrives at t~z0/vg , where vg is the group velocity of
the incident light inside the host medium. Brillouin has identified a second
forerunner that occupies the interval between the end of the Sommerfeld
forerunner at t~n(0)z0/c and the beginning of the steady signal. This second
forerunner is commonly referred to as the Brillouin forerunner (or precursor).
Given that the incident wave has a sudden start at t=0, its frequency spectrum
spans the entire range of frequencies from minus infinity to infinity.
Consequently, the high-frequency first forerunner cannot be considered a
superoscillation, nor can the low-frequency second forerunner be regarded as a
suboscillation. The goal of the present paper is to extend the
Sommerfeld-Brillouin theory of precursors to bandlimited incident signals, in
an effort to determine the conditions under which these precursors would
continue to exist, and to answer the question as to whether or not such
precursors, upon arising from a bandlimited incident signal, constitute super-
or sub-oscillations.

assembly. In current practice, the structures are adjusted to the design shape
in terms of the $\ell_2$ loss for further assembly without considering the
existing dimensional gap between two structures. Such practice has two
limitations: (1) the design shape may not be the optimal shape in terms of a
pair of incoming fuselages with different incoming dimensions; (2) the maximum
gap is the key concern during the fuselage assembly process. This paper
proposes an optimal shape control methodology via the $\ell_\infty$ loss for
composite fuselage assembly process by considering the existing dimensional gap
between the incoming pair of fuselages. Besides, due to the limitation on the
number of available actuators in practice, we face an important problem of
finding the best locations for the actuators among many potential locations,
which makes the problem a sparse estimation problem. We are the first to solve
the optimal shape control in fuselage assembly process using the $\ell_\infty$
model under the framework of sparse estimation, where we use the $\ell_1$
penalty to control the sparsity of the resulting estimator. From statistical
point of view, this can be formulated as the $\ell_\infty$ loss based linear
regression, and under some standard assumptions, such as the restricted
eigenvalue (RE) conditions, and the light tailed noise, the non-asymptotic
estimation error of the $\ell_1$ regularized $\ell_\infty$ linear model is
derived to be the order of $O(\sigma\sqrt{\frac{S\log p}{n}})$, which meets the
upper-bound in the existing literature. Compared to the current practice, the
case study shows that our proposed method significantly reduces the maximum gap

N-body+hydrodynamics simulations to reproduce the dynamics of the observed
system AM 2229-735 that is a minor merger whose interaction signals are those
of a progenitor for a polar ring galaxy. We used the observational information
of the system to get initial conditions for the orbit and numerical
realisations of the galaxies to run the simulations. Our simulations reproduce
the global characteristics of interaction observed in the system such as arms
and a material bridge connecting the galaxies. As a merger remnant, we found a
quasi-stable and self gravitating planar tidal stream with dark matter, stars
and gas orbiting in a plane approximately perpendicular to the main galaxy disk
leading in the future to a polar ring galaxy. We studied the dynamical
conditions of the polar structure and found evidence suggesting that this kind
of merger remnant can settle down in a disk-like structure with isothermal
support, providing inspiring evidence about the process of formation of
galactic disks and providing a potentially independent scenario to study the
presence of dark matter in this kind of galaxies.

modulating the ratio between imaginary and real refractive indices. In this
paper, a rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) has been developed to analyze
the diffraction properties of acoustic PT-symmetric gratings with two kinds of
modulating approaches, including modulating the effective modulus and the
effective density. Asymmetric diffraction with both Bragg incident angles and
perpendicular incident angles is discussed by using the RCWA method. Results
show that the modulation ratio for the diffraction vanishing point changes with
the modulation amplitude differently for two kinds of modulating approaches.
Moreover, the sound energy will be weaken or be enhanced at Bragg incident
angles depending on the sign of incident angles and the modulation ratio.

has drawn much attention as size of high-quality paraphrase corpus is limited.
Round-trip translation, also known as the pivoting method, is a typical
approach to this end. However, we notice that the pivoting process involves
multiple machine translation models and is likely to incur semantic drift
during the two-step translations. In this paper, inspired by the
Transformer-based language models, we propose a simple and unified paraphrasing
model, which is purely trained on multilingual parallel data and can conduct
zero-shot paraphrase generation in one step. Compared with the pivoting
approach, paraphrases generated by our model is more semantically similar to
the input sentence. Moreover, since our model shares the same architecture as
GPT (Radford et al., 2018), we are able to pre-train the model on large-scale
unparallel corpus, which further improves the fluency of the output sentences.
In addition, we introduce the mechanism of denoising auto-encoder (DAE) to
improve diversity and robustness of the model. Experimental results show that
our model surpasses the pivoting method in terms of relevance, diversity,
fluency and efficiency.

the computation and communication resources from cloud to the network edge to

mobile devices with small memory footprint can run composite microservice-based

to heal container failures, high availability cannot be ensured due to
heterogeneity and variability of edge sites. To deal with these problems, we
propose a distributed redundant placement framework SAA-RP and a GA-based
Server Selection (GASS) algorithm for microservice-based applications with
sequential combinatorial structure. We formulate a stochastic optimization
problem with the uncertainty of microservice request considered, and then
decide for each microservice, how it should be deployed and with how many
instances as well as on which edge sites to place them. Benchmark policies are
implemented in two scenarios, where redundancy is allowed and not,
respectively. Numerical results based on a real-world dataset verify that GASS

as tunnel inspection. Owing to its versatility to fly inside the tunnels, it
can quickly identify defects and potential problems related to safety. However,
long tunnels, especially with repetitive or uniform structures pose a
significant problem for UAV navigation. Furthermore, post-processing visual
data from the camera mounted on the UAV is required to generate useful
information for the inspection task. In this work, we design a UAV with a
single rotating camera to accomplish the task. Compared to other platforms, our
solution can fit the stringent requirement for tunnel inspection, in terms of
battery life, size and weight. While the current state-of-the-art can estimate
camera pose and 3D geometry from a sequence of images, they assume large
overlap, small rotational motion, and many distinct matching points between
images. These assumptions severely limit their effectiveness in tunnel-like
scenarios where the camera has erratic or large rotational motion, such as the
one mounted on the UAV. This paper presents a novel solution which exploits
Structure-from-Motion, Bundle Adjustment, and available geometry priors to
robustly estimate camera pose and automatically reconstruct a fully-dense 3D
scene using the least possible number of images in various challenging
tunnel-like environments. We validate our system with both Virtual Reality
application and experimentation with a real dataset. The results demonstrate
that the proposed reconstruction along with texture mapping allows for remote
navigation and inspection of tunnel-like environments, even those which are

of how samples are collected but makes no distributional assumptions on the

$[n]={1,\ldots,n}$ with corresponding data values $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. We observe
the values for a ""sample"" set $A \subset [n]$ and wish to estimate some
statistic of the values for a ""target"" set $B \subset [n]$ where $B$ could be
the entire set. Crucially, we assume that the sets $A$ and $B$ are drawn
according to some known distribution $P$ over pairs of subsets of $[n]$. A
given estimation algorithm is evaluated based on its ""worst-case, expected
error"" where the expectation is with respect to the distribution $P$ from which
the sample $A$ and target sets $B$ are drawn, and the worst-case is with
respect to the data values $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. Within this framework, we give an
efficient algorithm for estimating the target mean that returns a weighted

explaining the complicated phenomenological forms of the effective fluid

show that at late times the effective fluid may drive the universe acceleration
even in the absence of an explicit cosmological constant, and even if the
initial fluid is the standard dust matter one. Similarly, at early times we
obtain an effective cosmological constant which is enhanced through screening,

deep convolutional neural network, for pixel-level cloud mask generation. The
algorithm is trained and evaluated on the Landsat 8 Cloud Cover Assessment
Validation Dataset distributed across 8 different land types. Compared with
CFMask, the most widely used cloud detection algorithm, land-type-specific
DeepMask models achieve higher accuracy across all land types. The average
accuracy is 93.56%, compared with 85.36% from CFMask. DeepMask also achieves
91.02% accuracy on all-land-type dataset. Compared with other CNN-based cloud
mask algorithms, DeepMask benefits from the parsimonious architecture and the
residual connection of ResNet. It is compatible with input of any size and
shape. DeepMask still maintains high performance when using only red, green,
blue, and NIR bands, indicating its potential to be applied to other satellite
platforms that only have limited optical bands.

reversibility and randomness. To address reversibility of finite CAs, we
develop a mathematical tool, named reachability tree, which can efficiently
characterize those CAs. A decision algorithm is proposed using minimized
reachability tree which takes a CA rule and size n as input and verifies
whether the CA is reversible for that n. To decide reversibility of a finite
CA, we need to know both the rule and the CA size. However, for infinite CAs,
reversibility is decided based on the local rule only. Therefore, apparently,
these two cases seem to be divergent. This dissertation targets to construct a
bridge between these two cases. To do so, reversibility of CAs is redefined and
the notion of semi-reversible CAs is introduced. Hence, we propose a new
classification of finite CAs -(1) reversible CAs, (2) semi-reversible CAs and
(3) strictly irreversible CAs. Finally, relation between reversibility of
finite and infinite CAs is established. This dissertation also explores CAs as
source of randomness and build pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) based on
CAs. We identify a list of properties for a CA to be a good source of
randomness. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to synthesize candidate
(decimal) CAs which have great potentiality as PRNGs. Two schemes tare
developed o use these CAs as window-based PRNGs - (1) as decimal number
generators and as (2) binary number generators. We empirically observe that in
comparison to the best PRNG SFMT19937-64, average performance of our proposed

direction, there can be antisymmetric standing waves (ASWs) that are
symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). The BICs have found
many applications, mainly because they give rise to resonant modes of extremely
large quality-factors ($Q$-factors). The ASWs are robust to symmetric
perturbations of the structure, but they become resonant modes if the
perturbation is non-symmetric. The $Q$-factor of a resonant mode on a perturbed
structure is typically $O(1/\delta^2)$ where $\delta$ is the amplitude of the
perturbation, but special perturbations can produce resonant modes with larger
$Q$-factors. For two-dimensional (2D) periodic structures with a 1D
periodicity, we derive conditions on the perturbation profile such that the
$Q$-factors are $O(1/\delta^4)$ or $O(1/\delta^6)$. For the unperturbed
structure, an ASW is surrounded by resonant modes with a nonzero Bloch wave
vector. For 2D periodic structures, the $Q$-factors of nearby resonant modes
are typically $O(1/\beta^2)$, where $\beta$ is the Bloch wavenumber. We show
that the $Q$-factors can be $O(1/\beta^6)$ if the ASW satisfies a simple
condition.

modular design produces a highly versatile platform as it is reconfigurable by
the addition or removal of flight modules, adjustment of the modules'
arrangement, or change of payloads. To facilitate the flight control, we
propose an IMU-based estimation strategy for rapid computation of the robot's
configuration. When combined with the adaptive geometric controller for further
refinement of uncertain parameters, stable flights are accomplished with
minimal manual intervention or tuning required by a user. To this end, we
demonstrate hovering and trajectory tracking flights through various robot's
configurations with different dummy payloads, weighing ~200-800 grams, using
four to eight propelling modules. The results reveal that stable flights are
attainable thanks to the proposed IMU-based estimation method. The flight
performance is markedly improved over time through the adaptive scheme, with
the position errors of a few centimeters after the parameter convergence.

The learned policy can map the same state to different actions depending on the
propensity for risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the

learned controller can dynamically select actions along a continuous axis,

interface-regularization (diffusion--sharpening) terms in such a way that the
resulting model maintains the conservative property of the underlying baseline
model; and lets us use a central-difference scheme for the discretization of
all the operators in the model, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation
that is crucial for the simulation of turbulent flows and acoustics.
Furthermore, the provable strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model
maintains the boundedness property of the volume fraction field, which is a
physical realizability requirement for the simulation of two-phase flows, (b)
the proposed model is such that the transport of volume fraction field
inherently satisfies the total-variation-diminishing property without having to
add any flux limiters that destroy the non-dissipative nature of the scheme,

contribute to the kinetic energy of the system and therefore do not affect the
non-linear stability of the numerical simulation, and (d) the model is
consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, we present numerical
simulations using the model and assess (a) the accuracy of evolution of the
interface shape, (b) implementation of surface tension effects, (c) propagation

machine learning and artificial intelligence. In such problems, the goal is to
design an interactive policy that plans for an action to take, from a finite
set of $n$ actions, given some partial observations. It has been shown that in
many applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental
design, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive
submodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to
policies. In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an
adaptive monotone submodular function. We propose an efficient semi adaptive
policy that with $O(\log n \times\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can
achieve an almost tight $1-1/e-\epsilon$ approximation guarantee with respect
to an optimal policy that carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential manner.
To complement our results, we also show that it is impossible to achieve a
constant factor approximation with $o(\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We also extend
our result to the case of adaptive stochastic minimum cost coverage where the
goal is to reach a desired utility $Q$ with the cheapest policy. We first prove
the conjecture of the celebrated work of Golovin and Krause by showing that the
greedy policy achieves the asymptotically tight logarithmic approximation
guarantee without resorting to stronger notions of adaptivity. We then propose
a semi adaptive policy that provides the same guarantee in polylogarithmic
adaptive rounds through a similar information-parallelism scheme. Our results
shrink the adaptivity gap in adaptive submodular maximization by an exponential

arising from the structural inversion asymmetry of the wells and, differently
from zincblende structures, a bulk Rashba-type term induced by the inversion
asymmetry of the wurtzite lattice. We also find linear- and cubic-in-momentum
Dresselhaus contributions. Both the bulk Rashba-type term and the Dresselhaus
terms originate exclusively from the admixture of $s$- and $p_z$-like states in
wurtzites structures. Interestingly, in these systems the linear Rashba and the
Dresselhaus terms have the same symmetry and can in principle cancel each other
out completely, thus making the spin a conserved quantity. We determine the
intrasubband (intersubband) Rashba $\alpha_\nu$ ($\eta$) and linear Dresselhaus
$\beta_\nu$ ($\Gamma$) SO strengths of GaN/AlGaN single and double wells with
one and two occupied subbands ($\nu=1,2$). We believe our general effective

  explicability of classification systems","25 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine several aspects of explicability of a classification system built
from neural networks. The first aspect is the pairwise explicability, which is
the ability to provide the most accurate prediction when the range of
possibilities is narrowed to just two. Next we consider explicability in
development, which means ability to make incremental improvement in prediction
accuracy based on observed deficiency of the system. Inherent stochasticity of
neural network based classifiers can be interpreted using likelihood randomness
explicability. Finally, sureness explicability indicates confidence of the
classifying system to make any prediction at all.
  These concepts are examined in the framework of pairwise coupling, which is a
non-trainable metamodel that originated during development of support vector
machines. Several methodologies are evaluated, of which the key one is shown to
be the choice of the pairwise coupling method. We compare two methods: the
established Wu-Lin-Weng method with the recently proposed Bayes covariant
method. Our experiments indicate that the Wu-Lin-Weng method gives more weight
to a single pairwise classifier, whereas the latter tries to balance
information from the whole matrix of pairwise likelihoods. This translates into
higher accuracy, and better sureness predictions for the Bayes covariant
method.
  Pairwise coupling methodology has its costs, especially in terms of the
number of parameters (but not necessarily in terms of training costs). However,
when additional explicability aspects beyond accuracy are desired in an
application, the pairwise coupling models are a promising alternative to the
established methodology.

$J$-transversal totally real submanifold $S$. It is said to be strongly visible
if there exists an orbit-preserving anti-holomorphic diffeomorphism $\sigma $
such that $\sigma |_S = \operatorname{id}_S$. Let $G$ be the Heisenberg group
and $H$ a non-trivial connected closed subgroup of $G$. We prove that any
complex homogeneous space $D = G^{\mathbb{C}}/H^{\mathbb{C}}$ admits a strongly
visible $L$-action, where $L$ stands for a connected closed subgroup of $G$
explicitly constructed through a co-exponential basis of $H$ in $G$. This leads
in turn that $G$ itself acts strongly visibly on $D$. The proof is carried out
by finding explicitly an orbit-preserving anti-holomorphic diffeomorphism and a
totally real submanifold $S$, for which the dimension depends upon the
dimensions of $G$ and $H$. As a direct application, our geometric results
provide a proof of various multiplicity-free theorems on continuous
representations on the space of holomorphic sections on $D$. Moreover, we also
generate as a consequence, a geometric criterion for a quasi-regular
representation of $G$ to be multiplicity-free.

crossing from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to a
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecular bosons in the presence of a
tunable-range interaction among the fermions and of an artificial magnetic
field, which can be used to simulate a pseudo-spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and to
produce topological states. We find that the crossover is affected by a
competition between the finite range of the interaction and the SOC and that
the threshold $\lambda_B$ for the topological transition is affected by the
interactions only in the small pair size, BEC-like, regime. Below $\lambda_B$,
we find persistence of universal behavior in the critical temperature, chemical
potential, and condensate fraction, provided that the pair correlation length
is used as a driving parameter. Above threshold, universality is lost in the
regime of large pair sizes. Here, the limiting ground state departs from a
weakly-interacting BCS-like, so that a different description is required. Our
results can be relevant in view of current experiments with cold atoms in
optical cavities, where tunable-range effective atomic interactions can be
engineered.

traditional methods such as k-NN, linear regression, and MICE compared to
modern imputation methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and gradient

performed on both real world and artificial datasets with continuous features

missing. The results show that MICE and linear regression are generally good
imputers regardless of the conditions. On the other hand, the performance of
MLP and XGBT is strongly dataset dependent. Their performance is the best in
some cases, but more often they perform worse than MICE or linear regression.

without considering these factors. The factors combine and co-vary in complex
ways to form styles. Studying the nature of the co-varying combinations sheds
light on stylistic language in general, sometimes called cross-style language
understanding. This paper provides the benchmark corpus (xSLUE) that combines
existing datasets and collects a new one for sentence-level cross-style
language understanding and evaluation. The benchmark contains text in 15
different styles under the proposed four theoretical groupings: figurative,
personal, affective, and interpersonal groups. For valid evaluation, we collect
an additional diagnostic set by annotating all 15 styles on the same text.
Using xSLUE, we propose three interesting cross-style applications in
classification, correlation, and generation. First, our proposed cross-style
classifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall
classification performance against individually-trained style classifiers.
Second, our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in
human-written text. Finally, we find that combinations of some contradictive
styles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text. We believe our
benchmark and case studies help explore interesting future directions for
cross-style research. The preprocessed datasets and code are publicly

restriction. Then, the corresponding Lagrange-D'Alembert equations are
formulated by employing two descriptions, the first one relying on rotations
and a splitting approach, and the second one relying on constrained directors.
For vanishing external moments, we prove that the new model possesses
conservation laws, i.e., the kinetic energy and two nonholonomic momenta that
substantially differ from the holonomic momenta preserved by the standard rigid
body model. Additionally, we propose a new specialization of a class of
energy-momentum integration schemes that exactly preserves the kinetic energy
and the nonholonomic momenta replicating the continuous counterpart. Finally,

variables in a labeled CRF structure in order to model the latent dynamics
within class labels, thus improving the labeling performance. Such a model is
known as Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF). We present Factored LDCRF (FLDCRF), a
structure that allows multiple latent dynamics of the class labels to interact
with each other. Including such latent-dynamic interactions leads to improved
labeling performance on single-label and multi-label sequence modeling tasks.
We apply our FLDCRF models on two single-label (one nested cross-validation)
and one multi-label sequence tagging (nested cross-validation) experiments
across two different datasets - UCI gesture phase data and UCI opportunity
data. FLDCRF outperforms all state-of-the-art sequence models, i.e., CRF,
LDCRF, LSTM, LSTM-CRF, Factorial CRF, Coupled CRF and a multi-label LSTM model
in all our experiments. In addition, LSTM based models display inconsistent
performance across validation and test data, and pose diffculty to select
models on validation data during our experiments. FLDCRF offers easier model
selection, consistency across validation and test performance and lucid model
intuition. FLDCRF is also much faster to train compared to LSTM, even without a
GPU. FLDCRF outshines the best LSTM model by ~4% on a single-label task on UCI
gesture phase data and outperforms LSTM performance by ~2% on average across
nested cross-validation test sets on the multi-label sequence tagging

capturing the aligned parts (i.e., the similar segments) in the sentence pairs,
which imply the perspective of entailment and contradiction. However, these
aligned parts will sometimes mislead the judgment of neutral relations.
Intuitively, NLI should rely more on multiple perspectives to form a holistic
view to eliminate bias. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Perspective
Inferrer (MPI), a novel NLI model that reasons relationships from multiple
perspectives associated with the three relationships. The MPI determines the
perspectives of different parts of the sentences via a routing-by-agreement
policy and makes the final decision from a holistic view. Additionally, we
introduce an auxiliary supervised signal to ensure the MPI to learn the
expected perspectives. Experiments on SNLI and MultiNLI show that 1) the MPI
achieves substantial improvements on the base model, which verifies the
motivation of multi-perspective inference; 2) visualized evidence verifies that
the MPI learns highly interpretable perspectives as expected; 3) more
importantly, the MPI is architecture-free and compatible with the powerful

requires some averaging, and this could involve one over initial conditions or
over time or spatial averaging. Here we consider averaging over initial
conditions chosen from a narrow distribution in phase space. We examine in
detail the effect of the width of the initial phase space distribution, and of
integrability and chaos, on the time scales for thermalization. We show how
thermalization properties of the system, quantified by its equilibration time,
defined in this work, can be related to chaos, given by the maximal Lyapunov

fractal dimensions for the umbral and penumbral regions of the magnetograms.
The fractal dimensions were found to be 1.79 \pm 0.49 and 1.96 \pm 0.29 for
strong and weak magnetic fields respectively. When compared to the umbral and
penumbral fractal dimensions determined by (Rajkumar, Haque and Hrudey, 2017)
using white light images, an inverse relationship was found, with the umbra
showing lower fractal dimensions than the penumbra for the magnetic field
groups compared to the intensity images. This directly implies that there is
greater complexity in the penumbral magnetic field groupings than the umbral
region. This has implications for models that constrain how the magnetic field
groups are contained in the cooler umbral regions.

disjoint scenario in which there is no overlap between the images in

The method works by first training a model on the disjoint data, and then
creating new triples across datasets using sentence similarity under the
learned model. Experiments show that pseudopairs improve image--sentence

  saturation algorithm",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important class of decidable first-order logic fragments are those
satisfying a guardedness condition, such as the guarded fragment (GF). Usually,
decidability for these logics is closely linked to the tree-like model property
- the fact that satisfying models can be taken to have tree-like form. Decision
procedures for the guarded fragment based on the tree-like model property are
difficult to implement. An alternative approach, based on restricting
first-order resolution, has been proposed, and this shows more promise from the
point of view of implementation. In this work, we connect the tree-like model
property of the guarded fragment with the resolution-based approach. We derive
efficient resolution-based rewriting algorithms that solve the Quantifier-Free
Query Answering Problem under Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (GTGDs) and
Disjunctive Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (DisGTGDs). The Query
Answering Problem for these classes subsumes many cases of GF satisfiability.
Our algorithms, in addition to making the connection to the tree-like model
property clear, give a natural account of the selection and ordering strategies
used by resolution procedures for the guarded fragment. We also believe that
our rewriting algorithm for the special case of GTGDs may prove itself valuable
in practice as it does not require any Skolemisation step and its theoretical
runtime outperforms those of known GF resolution procedures in case of fixed
dependencies. Moreover, we show a novel normalisation procedure for the widely
used chase procedure in case of (disjunctive) GTGDs, which could be useful for
future studies.

when data are collected over space. Recently, a number of approaches has been
proposed to include spatial information in entropy. The aim of entropy is to
synthesize the observed data in a single, interpretable number. In other
studies the objective is, instead, to use data for entropy estimation; several
proposals can be found in the literature, which basically are corrections of
the estimator based on substituting the involved probabilities with
proportions. In this case, independence is assumed and spatial correlation is
not considered. We propose a path for spatial entropy estimation: instead of
correcting the global entropy estimator, we focus on improving the estimation
of its components, i.e. the probabilities, in order to account for spatial
effects. Once probabilities are suitably evaluated, estimating entropy is
straightforward since it is a deterministic function of the distribution.
Following a Bayesian approach, we derive the posterior probabilities of a
multinomial distribution for categorical variables, accounting for spatial
correlation. A posterior distribution for entropy can be obtained, which may be
synthesized as wished and displayed as an entropy surface for the area under

to experimentally test for BSM manifestation(s) via the direct and competitive
exploration of the PMNS matrix unitarity for the first time. Any significant

new neutrino) and/or interactions, thus allowing for direct discovery

condition. The boundary of phase is analytically given as
$\kappa_1\geq\kappa+\sqrt{2}$ and $1\leq\gamma\leq2$, where there exists a pair
of zero-energy edge states with purely imaginary energy eigenvalues localized
at the left boundary, whereas other $4N-2$ eigenvalues are real. Especially,
the domain of the exotic phase can be manipulated narrow and even disappeared
by tuning modulation parameter. More interestingly, whether or not the array
has initial global $PT$ symmetry, periodic modulation not only can restore the
broken global $PT$ symmetry, but also can control it by tuning modulation
amplitude. Therefore, the global property of transverse periodic structure of

topological insulators, in presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, driven by
two external time-dependent voltages and connected to a thin superconductor. We
focus on the case of a train of Lorentzian-shaped pulses, which are known to
generate coherent single-electron excitations in two-dimensional electron gas,
and prove that they are minimal excitations for charge transport also in
helical edge states, even in the presence of spin-orbit interaction.
Importantly, these properties of Lorentzian-shaped pulses can be tested
computing charge noise generated by the scattering of particles at the thin
superconductor. This represents a novel setup where electron quantum optics
experiments with helical states can be implemented, with the superconducting
contact as an effective beamsplitter. By elaborating on this configuration, we
also evaluate charge noise in a collisional Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration,
showing that, due to the peculiar effects induced by Rashba interaction, a
non-vanishing dip at zero delay appears.

optimally train and control the generation of intent-specific sentences using a
conditional variational autoencoder. Then we introduce a novel protocol called
query transfer that allows to leverage a broad, unlabelled dataset to extract
relevant information. Comparison with two different baselines shows that our
method, in the appropriate regime, consistently improves the diversity of the

comparing the observed main-sequence luminosity function to simulations, we
determine the best-fitting IMF to have a power law slope $\alpha=-2.35 \pm 0.3$

consistent with the observed H$\alpha$ emission, which we use to provide
additional constraints on the IMF. We explore the influence of deviations from
the constant SFR assumption, finding that our IMF conclusions are robust
against all but strong recent variations in SFR, but these are excluded by
causality arguments. These results, along with our similar studies of other
nearby galaxies, indicate that some XUV disks are deficient in high-mass stars

many already observed with HST, thus allowing a more comprehensive
investigation of the IMF, and how it varies, using the techniques developed

powerful tool across physics and quantum information. A unitary $t$-design is
designed to tackle this challenge in an efficient way, yet constructions to
date rely on heavy constraints. In particular, they are composed of ensembles
of unitaries which, for technical reasons, must contain inverses and whose
entries are algebraic. In this work, we reduce the requirements for generating
an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $t$-design. To do so, we first construct a
specific $n$-qubit random quantum circuit composed of a sequence of, randomly
chosen, 2-qubit gates, chosen from a set of unitaries which is approximately
universal on $U(4)$, yet need not contain unitaries and their inverses, nor are
in general composed of unitaries whose entries are algebraic; dubbed $relaxed$
seed. We then show that this relaxed seed, when used as a basis for our
construction, gives rise to an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $t$-design
efficiently, where the depth of our random circuit scales as $poly(n, t,
log(1/\varepsilon))$, thereby overcoming the two requirements which limited
previous constructions.
  We suspect the result found here is not optimal, and can be improved.
Particularly because the number of gates in the relaxed seeds introduced here
grows with $n$ and $t$. We conjecture that constant sized seeds such as those
in ( Brand\~ao, Harrow, and Horodecki; Commun. Math. Phys. (2016) 346: 397) are
sufficient.

help of effective Lagrangians, the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction is
described within the one-boson-exchange model with $\eta$, $\eta'$, $\omega$,
$\phi$, and $\sigma$ exchanges considered. After inserting the potential kernel
into the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation, the bound states from the
$\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction can be studied by searching for the pole of
the scattering amplitude. Two loosely bound states with spin parities
$I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$ and $0^-(1^{--})$ appear near the threshold almost
with the same parameter. The $0^-(1^{--})$ state can be assigned to the
$X(2239)$ observed at BESIII, which is very close to the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$
threshold. The scalar meson $\eta(2225)$ can be interpreted as a $0^+(0^{-+})$
state from the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction. The annihilation effect is
also discussed through a coupled-channel calculation plus a phenomenological
optical potential. It provides large widths to two bound states produced from
the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction. The mass of the $1^-$ state is a little
larger than the mass of the $0^-$ state after including the annihilation
effect, which is consistent with our assignment of these two states as
$X(2239)$ and $\eta(2225)$, respectively. The results suggest that further
investigation is expected to understand the structures near the

However, adulterated red chili data annotation is a big challenge for
classification because the acquisition of labeled data for real-time supervised

very first time proposes a novel approach to annotate the red chili samples

classified into pure or adulterated using one-class SVM. The classification
performance achieves 99% in case of pure adulterants or red chili whereas 85%

making is incorporating real time information that reflects immediate status of
the system. This type of decision making, which may apply to any dynamic

dynamic data driven planning framework. Performance of dynamic data driven
planning frameworks relies on the decision making process which in return is
relevant to the quality of the available data. This means that the planning
framework should be able to set the level of decision making based on the
current status of the system, which is learned through the continuous readings
of sensory data. In this work, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method is
proposed to determine the optimal fidelity of decision making in a dynamic data
driven framework. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an
experiment is conducted, where the impact of workers performance on the

some Fefferman--Stein vector-valued maximal inequality on $X$ and is bounded on
the associated space, the authors establish various Littlewood--Paley function
characterizations of the Hardy space $H_X({\mathbb R}^n)$ associated with $X$,
under some weak assumptions on the Littlewood--Paley functions. To this end,
the authors also establish a useful estimate on the change of angles in tent

Particularly, when $X:=M_r^p({\mathbb R}^n)$ (the Morrey space),
$X:=L^{\vec{p}}({\mathbb R}^n)$ (the mixed-norm Lebesgue space),
$X:=L^{p(\cdot)}({\mathbb R}^n)$ (the variable Lebesgue space),
$X:=L_\omega^p({\mathbb R}^n)$ (the weighted Lebesgue space) and
$X:=(E_\Phi^r)_t({\mathbb R}^n)$ (the Orlicz-slice space), the

the Littlewood--Paley functions and widening the range of $\lambda$ in the

However, large heterogeneity exists in donations across cases, and fundraisers
face significant uncertainty in whether their crowdfunding campaigns can meet
fundraising goals. Therefore, it is important to provide early warnings for
fundraisers if such a channel will eventually fail. In this study, we aim to
develop novel algorithms to provide accurate and timely predictions of
fundraising performance, to better inform fundraisers. In particular, we
propose a new approach to combine time-series features and time-invariant
features in the deep learning model, to process diverse sources of input data.
Compared with baseline models, our model achieves better accuracy and requires
a shorter observation window of the time-varying features from the campaign
launch to provide robust predictions with high confidence. To extract
interpretable insights, we further conduct a multivariate time-series
clustering analysis and identify four typical temporal donation patterns. This
demonstrates the heterogeneity in the features and how they relate to the
fundraising outcome. The prediction model and the interpretable insights can be
applied to assist fundraisers with better promoting their fundraising campaigns
and can potentially help crowdfunding platforms to provide more timely feedback
to all fundraisers. Our proposed framework is also generalizable to other

the safety and efficiency of railway networks around the globe. Over the past
decade, computer vision and pattern recognition based techniques have gained
traction for such inspection and defect detection tasks. An automated
end-to-end trained system can potentially provide a low-cost, high throughput,
and cheap alternative to manual visual inspection of these components. However,
such systems require a huge amount of defective images for networks to
understand complex defects. In this paper, a multi-phase deep learning based
technique is proposed to perform accurate fault detection of rail-valves. Our
approach uses a two-step method to perform high precision image segmentation of
rail-valves resulting in pixel-wise accurate segmentation. Thereafter, a
computer vision technique is used to identify faulty valves. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach results in improved detection performance when
compared to current state-of-theart techniques used in fault detection.
