three sets of cyclic trajectories corresponding to the worm's basic stereotyped

stereotypy, we find variability in the presence of locally-unstable dynamics,
and this unpredictability shows signatures of deterministic chaos: a collection
of unstable periodic orbits together with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent.
The full Lyapunov spectrum is symmetric with positive, chaotic exponents
driving variability balanced by negative, dissipative exponents driving
stereotypy. The symmetry is indicative of damped, driven Hamiltonian dynamics

  Assessment",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) has received increasing
attention in the IQA community since reference image is not always available.
Real-world images generally suffer from various types of distortion.
Unfortunately, existing NR-IQA methods do not work with all types of
distortion. It is a challenging task to develop universal NR-IQA that has the
ability of evaluating all types of distorted images. In this paper, we propose
a universal NR-IQA method based on controllable list-wise ranking (CLRIQA).
First, to extend the authentically distorted image dataset, we present an
imaging-heuristic approach, in which the over-underexposure is formulated as an
inverse of Weber-Fechner law, and fusion strategy and probabilistic compression
are adopted, to generate the degraded real-world images. These degraded images
are label-free yet associated with quality ranking information. We then design
a controllable list-wise ranking function by limiting rank range and
introducing an adaptive margin to tune rank interval. Finally, the extended
dataset and controllable list-wise ranking function are used to pre-train a
CNN. Moreover, in order to obtain an accurate prediction model, we take
advantage of the original dataset to further fine-tune the pre-trained network.
Experiments evaluated on four benchmark datasets (i.e. LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013, and
LIVE-C) show that the proposed CLRIQA improves the state of the art by over 9%
in terms of overall performance. The code and model are publicly available at

out. First, the two APPJ have been benchmarked in regard to their electrical
and physico-chemical properties while interacting with material targets:
dielectric plate, liquid sample, metal plate and an equivalent electrical
circuit of human body. The propagation properties of the ionization wave
interacting with these targets are discussed, in particular the profile of the

survey is performed so as to define an experimental operating window where

their exposure to plasma and without inducing any electrical hazards (burnings,
ventricular fibrillation). Optimal conditions are identified discarding the
conditions where slight alterations may be evidenced by histology (e.g.
prenecrotic aspect of keratinocytes, alterations in the collagen structure).
Hence, for the two APPJ plasma parameters these conditions are as follow: duty
cycle=14 %, repetition frequency=30 kHz, magnitude=7 kV, gap=10 mm and exposure
time=1 min. In a third step, the two plasma jets are utilized on

obtained primarily with Keck/NIRC2 together with astrometry from the literature
to test for differences in the population-level eccentricity distributions of
27 long-period giant planets and brown dwarf companions between 5-100 AU using
hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Orbit fits are performed in a uniform manner
for companions with short orbital arcs; this typically results in broad
constraints for individual eccentricity distributions, but together as an
ensemble these systems provide valuable insight into their collective
underlying orbital patterns. The shape of the eccentricity distribution
function for our full sample of substellar companions is approximately flat
from e=0-1. When subdivided by companion mass and mass ratio, the underlying
distributions for giant planets and brown dwarfs show significant differences.
Low mass ratio companions preferentially have low eccentricities, similar to
the orbital properties of warm Jupiters found with radial velocities and
transits. We interpret this as evidence for in situ formation on largely
undisturbed orbits within massive, extended disks. Brown dwarf companions
exhibit a broad peak at e $\approx$ 0.6-0.9 with evidence for a dependence on
orbital period. This closely resembles the orbital properties and
period-eccentricity trends of wide (1-200 AU) stellar binaries, suggesting that
brown dwarfs in this separation range predominantly form in a similar fashion.
We also report evidence that the ""eccentricity dichotomy"" observed at small
separations extends to planets on wide orbits: the mean eccentricity for the
multi-planet system HR 8799 is lower than for systems with single planets.

length scale termed the macroscale using Darcy's law. Standard approaches for
modeling macroscale single fluid phase flow of non-Newtonian fluids extend
Darcy's law, using an effective viscosity and assuming that the permeability is
invariant. This approach results in a need to determine the effective viscosity
for every fluid and flow rate. We use the thermodynamically constrained
averaging theory (TCAT) to examine the formulation and closure of a macroscale
model for non-Newtonian flow that is consistent with microscale conservation
principles and the second law of thermodynamics. A connection between
microscale and macroscale quantities is used to calculate interphase momentum
transfer for non-Newtonian flow in porous medium systems. Darcy's law is shown
to approximate momentum transfer from the fluid phase to the solid phase. This
momentum transfer is found to depend on the viscosity at the solid surface. As
a consequence of the derived equation for momentum transfer, the commonly
called intrinsic permeability is not invariant for non-Newtonian flow, which is
an assumption that underlies standard effective viscosity approaches. TCAT is
used to derive a macroscale equation relating the flow rate and the pressure
gradient dependent upon fluid properties and medium characterization, breaking
the need to investigate all flow and composition conditions currently required.
This new approach is validated for model systems and used to interpret results
from the literature, including an evaluation of conditions under which a
transition occurs away from the strictly laminar flow conditions. The results
from this work form a basis for more rigorous and realistic modeling of
non-Newtonian flow in porous medium systems.

improved by using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the
Heatmap Regression Models (HRMs). Although their performance on common
benchmark datasets has reached a high level, the robustness of these models
still remains a challenging problem in the practical use under noisy conditions
of realistic environments. Contrary to most existing work focusing on the
design of new models, we argue that improving the robustness requires
rethinking many other aspects, including the use of datasets, the format of
landmark annotation, the evaluation metric as well as the training and
detection algorithm itself. In this paper, we propose a novel method for robust
facial landmark detection, using a loss function based on the 2D Wasserstein
distance combined with a new landmark coordinate sampling relying on the
barycenter of the individual probability distributions. Our method can be
plugged-and-play on most state-of-the-art HRMs with neither additional
complexity nor structural modifications of the models. Further, with the large
performance increase, we found that current evaluation metrics can no longer

improvements to the standard evaluation protocol. Extensive experimental
results on both traditional evaluation metrics and our evaluation metrics
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the robustness of

the suggested algorithm in simulation and on differential drive robots in

functions, and characterizing functions that have small total influence is one
of the most fundamental questions associated with it. The KKL theorem and the
Friedgut junta theorem give a strong characterization of such functions
whenever the bound on the total influence is $o(\log n)$. However, both results
become useless when the total influence of the function is $\omega(\log n)$.
The only case in which this logarithmic barrier has been broken for an
interesting class of functions was proved by Bourgain and Kalai, who focused on
functions that are symmetric under large enough subgroups of $S_n$.
  In this paper, we build and improve on the techniques of the Bourgain-Kalai
paper and establish new concentration results on the Fourier spectrum of
Boolean functions with small total influence. Our results include:
  1. A quantitative improvement of the Bourgain--Kalai result regarding the
total influence of functions that are transitively symmetric.
  2. A slightly weaker version of the Fourier--Entropy Conjecture of Friedgut
and Kalai. This weaker version implies in particular that the Fourier spectrum
of a constant variance, Boolean function $f$ is concentrated on $2^{O(I[f]\log
I[f])}$ characters, improving an earlier result of Friedgut. Removing the $\log
I[f]$ factor would essentially resolve the Fourier--Entropy Conjecture, as well
as settle a conjecture of Mansour regarding the Fourier spectrum of polynomial
size DNF formulas.
  Our concentration result has new implications in learning theory: it implies
that the class of functions whose total influence is at most $K$ is
agnostically learnable in time $2^{O(K\log K)}$, using membership queries.

young planets are dimmer in the optical than in the infrared, they can still be

high-precision photometric imaging and spectroscopy of young self-luminous

when reflected light may contribute to a degree comparable to that of thermal

R\'enyi--Parry arithmetical dynamical systems ($\beta$-shift), for $\alpha$ a
reciprocal algebraic integer of house $\house{\alpha}$ greater than 1, (ii) the
discovery of lenticuli of poles of $\zeta_{\house{\alpha}}(z)$ which uniformly
equidistribute at the limit on a limit ""lenticular"" arc of the unit circle,
when $\house{\alpha}$ tends to $1^+$, giving rise to a continuous lenticular
minorant ${\rm M}_{r}(\house{\alpha})$ of the Mahler measure ${\rm M}(\alpha)$,
(iii) the Poincar\'e asymptotic expansions of these poles and of this minorant
${\rm M}_{r}(\house{\alpha})$ as a function of the dynamical degree. The
Conjecture of Schinzel-Zassenhaus is proved to be true. A Dobrowolski type
minoration of the Mahler measure M$(\alpha)$ is obtained. The universal
minorant of M$(\alpha)$ obtained is $\theta_{\eta}^{-1} > 1$, for some integer
$\eta \geq 259$, where $\theta_{\eta}$ is the positive real root of
$-1+x+x^{\eta}$. The set of Salem numbers is shown to be bounded from below by
the Perron number $\theta_{31}^{-1} = 1.08545\ldots$, dominant root of the
trinomial $-1 - z^{30} + z^{31}$. Whether Lehmer's number is the smallest Salem
number remains open. For sequences of algebraic integers of Mahler measure
smaller than the smallest Pisot number $\Theta = 1.3247\ldots$, whose houses
have a dynamical degree tending to infinity, the Galois orbit measures of
conjugates are proved to converge towards the Haar measure on $|z|=1$ (limit
equidistribution).The dynamical zeta function is used to investigate the domain
of very small Mahler measures of algebraic integers in the range (1, 1.176280 .

observing a key constraint in the application of self-supervision using a

reducing the usefulness of the representation. The VTSS hypothesis helps us
identify transformations that have the potential to be effective as a

between properly designed control pulses and statistically informative
measurement data on a specific quantum-probe observable. To enhance the
information content of the data and reduce as much as possible the number of
measurements on the probe, the filter orthogonalization method has been
recently introduced. The latter is able to transform the control filter
functions on an orthogonal basis allowing for the optimal reconstruction of the
noise power spectral density. In this paper, we formalize this method within
the standard formalism of minimum mean squared error estimation and we show the
equivalence between the solutions of the two approaches. Then, we introduce a
non-negative least squares formulation that ensures the non-negativeness of the
estimated noise spectral density. Moreover, we also propose a novel protocol
for the design in the frequency domain of the set of filter functions. The
frequency-designed filter functions and the non-negative least squares
reconstruction are numerically tested on noise spectra with multiple components
and as a function of the estimation parameters.

the complexity of transferring knowledge between different tasks. In contrast
to existing techniques such as Task2Vec and Taskonomy, which measure
similarities between pre-trained models, our approach employs a novel
self-supervised learning strategy to discover these relationships in the
training loop and at the same time utilizes them to update task-specific models
in the meta-update step. Using challenging task and domain databases, under
few-shot learning settings, we show that Invenio can discover intricate

semantic structure between tasks/domains from Invenio is interpretable and can
be used to construct meaningful priors for tasks or domains.

exceptions that (1) it is a fully convolutional network and does not use
strided convolution; (2) it is shallow and compact which minimizes over-fitting

which allows training to be done without image downsizing; (4) the model

detect the underlying shape of the anomalies despite the weak annotation as
well as preserves the spatial localization of the anomaly. Pre-seeding AnoNet
with an engineered filter bank initialization technique reduces the total

maximizing the information encoded in the compilation considered. We find that
the level of tension increases from about $3.5\sigma$ for the $f\sigma_8$ data

Typically,
algorithmic work is on total counting, where we wish to count the total
frequency of a (small) pattern subgraph in a large input data set. But many
applications require local counts (also called vertex orbit counts) wherein,
for every vertex $v$ of the input graph, one needs the count of the pattern
subgraph involving $v$. This provides a rich set of vertex features that can be
used in machine learning tasks, especially classification and clustering. But
getting local counts is extremely challenging. Even the easier problem of
getting total counts has received much research attention. Local counts require
algorithms that get much finer grained information, and the sheer output size
makes it difficult to design scalable algorithms.
  We present EVOKE, a scalable algorithm that can determine vertex orbits
counts for all 5-vertex pattern subgraphs. In other words, EVOKE exactly
determines, for every vertex $v$ of the input graph and every 5-vertex subgraph
$H$, the number of copies of $H$ that $v$ participates in. EVOKE can process
graphs with tens of millions of edges, within an hour on a commodity machine.
EVOKE is typically hundreds of times faster than previous state of the art
algorithms, and gets results on datasets beyond the reach of previous methods.
  Theoretically, we generalize a recent ""graph cutting"" framework to get vertex
orbit counts. This framework generate a collection of polynomial equations
relating vertex orbit counts of larger subgraphs to those of smaller subgraphs.
EVOKE carefully exploits the structure among these equations to rapidly count.
We prove and empirically validate that EVOKE only has a small constant factor
overhead over the best (total) 5-vertex subgraph counter.

the cause of diminished electron-injection through the 1,3-azulene, a

with the increasing usage of DNN models in safety-critical domains such as
autonomous cars. The traditional approach of testing DNNs is to create a test
set, which is a random subset of the dataset about the problem of interest.
This kind of approach is not enough for testing most of the real-world
scenarios since these traditional test sets do not include corner cases, while
a corner case input is generally considered to introduce erroneous behaviors.
Recent works on adversarial input generation, data augmentation, and
coverage-guided fuzzing (CGF) have provided new ways to extend traditional test
sets. Among those, CGF aims to produce new test inputs by fuzzing existing ones
to achieve high coverage on a test adequacy criterion (i.e. coverage
criterion). Given that the subject test adequacy criterion is a
well-established one, CGF can potentially find error inducing inputs for
different underlying reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel CGF solution
for structural testing of DNNs. The proposed fuzzer employs Monte Carlo Tree

goal is to criticize the construction of standard arithmetic models as
providing grounds for arithmetic truth (even in a relative sense). Our method
is to emphasize the incomplete picture of both theories and treat models as
their syntactical counterparts. Insisting on the incomplete picture will allow
us to argue in favor of the revisability of the standard model interpretation.
We then show that it is hopeless to expect that the relative grounding provided
by a standard interpretation can resist being revisable. We start briefly
characterizing the expansion of arithmetic truth provided by the interpretation
in a set theory. Further, we show that, for every well-founded interpretation
of recursive extensions of PA in extensions of ZF, the interpreted version of
arithmetic has more theorems than the original. This theorem expansion is not
complete however. We continue by defining the coordination problem. The problem
can be summarized as follows. We consider two independent communities of
mathematicians responsible for deciding over new axioms for ZF and PA. How
likely are they to be coordinated regarding PAs interpretation in ZF? We prove
that it is possible to have extensions of PA not interpretable in a given set
theory ST. We further show that the probability of a random extension of
arithmetic being interpretable in ST is zero.

address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We
also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these
algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several
new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form
games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime,
(non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of
the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our
overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the
current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research
directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as
continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting
while challenging topic.

preferred networking technology for large-scale Internet of Things deployments
(e.g., smart cities). Due to long communication range and ultra low power
consumption, LPWAN-enabled sensors are today being deployed in a variety of
application scenarios where sensitive information is wirelessly transmitted. In
this work, we study the privacy guarantees of LPWANs, in particular LoRa. We
show that, although the event-based duty cycling of radio communication, i.e.,
transmission of radio signals only when an event occurs, saves power, it
inherently leaks information. This information leakage is independent of the
implemented crypto primitives. We identify two types of information leakage and
show that it is hard to completely prevent leakage without incurring
significant additional communication and computation costs.

direct measurements, and yet the subsequent evolution of these stars depends
critically on how much mass is lost during the RSG phase. In 2012 the Geneva
evolutionary group updated their mass-loss prescription for RSGs with the
result that a 20 solar mass star now loses 10x more mass during the RSG phase
than in the older models. Thus, higher mass RSGs evolve back through a second
yellow supergiant phase rather than exploding as Type II-P supernovae, in
accord with recent observations (the so-called ""RSG Problem""). Still, even much
larger mass-loss rates during the RSG phase cannot be ruled out by direct
measurements of their current dust-production rates, as such mass-loss is
episodic. Here we test the models by deriving a luminosity function for RSGs in
the nearby spiral galaxy M31 which is sensitive to the total mass loss during
the RSG phase. We carefully separate RSGs from asymptotic giant branch stars in
the color-magnitude diagram following the recent method exploited by Yang and
collaborators in their Small Magellanic Cloud studies. Comparing our resulting
luminosity function to that predicted by the evolutionary models shows that the
new prescription for RSG mass-loss does an excellent job of matching the
observations, and we can readily rule out significantly larger values.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there has been significant progress in
the field. However, almost all existing GAN-based works are prone to address
the mapping from human motions to video scenes, with scene appearances are
encoded individually in the trained models. Therefore, each trained model can
only generate videos with a specific scene appearance, new models are required
to be trained to generate new appearances. Besides, existing works lack the
capability of appearance control. For example, users have to provide video
records of wearing new clothes or performing in new backgrounds to enable
clothes or background changing in their synthetic videos, which greatly limits
the application flexibility. In this paper, we propose GAC-GAN, a general
method for appearance-controllable human video motion transfer. To enable
general-purpose appearance synthesis, we propose to include appearance
information in the conditioning inputs. Thus, once trained, our model can
generate new appearances by altering the input appearance information. To
achieve appearance control, we first obtain the appearance-controllable
conditioning inputs and then utilize a two-stage GAC-GAN to generate the
corresponding appearance-controllable outputs, where we utilize an ACGAN loss
and a shadow extraction module for output foreground and background appearance
control respectively. We further build a solo dance dataset containing a large
number of dance videos for training and evaluation. Experimental results show
that, our proposed GAC-GAN can not only support appearance-controllable human
video motion transfer but also achieve higher video quality than state-of-art

whole task, although each sub-network is responsible for learning optimal
control policy for its own stage. This modularized architecture offers
considerable flexibility in terms of environment and policy modeling, as it
allows choices of different state spaces, action spaces, reward structures, and
Q networks for each stage, Further, the backward stage-wise training procedure
of SDQL can offers additional transparency, stability, and flexibility to the
training process, thus facilitating model fine-tuning and hyper-parameter
search. We demonstrate that SDQL is capable of learning competitive strategies
for problems with characteristics of high-dimensional state space,
heterogeneous action space(both discrete and continuous), multiple scales, and
sparse and delayed rewards.

increase of peak load and power consumption during the peak demand period,
which is an undesirable outcome from grid operation perspective. Total

manipulation actions and some videos even involve multiple persons, who
collaborate by sharing and exchanging objects and tools. Furthermore, the
learned representations need to be general enough to be transferable to robotic
systems. On the other hand, previous work has shown that the space of human
manipulation actions has a linguistic, hierarchical structure that relates
actions to manipulated objects and tools. Building upon this theory of language
for action, we propose a system for understanding and executing demonstrated
action sequences from full-length, real-world cooking videos on the web. The
system takes as input a new, previously unseen cooking video annotated with
object labels and bounding boxes, and outputs a collaborative manipulation
action plan for one or more robotic arms. We demonstrate performance of the
system in a standardized dataset of 100 YouTube cooking videos, as well as in
six full-length Youtube videos that include collaborative actions between two

state-of-the-art action detection baseline and show our system achieves higher

that softmax cross-entropy can estimate mutual information approximately. When
applied to image classification, this relation helps approximate the point-wise
mutual information between an input image and a label without modifying the

activation map, which highlights regions of the input image that are the most

spatial noise specified in the form of a multimode random process at each
iteration and selecting the stable wave configurations. The nonlinear wave

Furthermore, the sparse regularizer and weighted random sample strategy are

to spintronics. However, key challenges remain, such as how to manipulate the
nucleation of skyrmion bubbles to exclude the trivial bubbles or metastable
skyrmion bubbles that usually coexist with skyrmion bubbles in the
centrosymmetric magnets. Here, we report having successfully performed this
task by applying spatially geometric confinement to a centrosymmetric
frustrated Fe3Sn2 magnet. We demonstrate that the spatially geometric
confinement can indeed stabilize the skyrmion bubbles, by effectively
suppressing the formation of trivial bubbles and metastable skyrmion bubbles.
We also show that the critical magnetic field for the nucleation of the
skyrmion bubbles in the confined Fe3Sn2 nanostripes is drastically less, by an
order of magnitude, than that what is required in the thin plate without
geometrical confinement. By analyzing how the width and thickness of the
nanostripes affect the spin textures of skyrmion bubbles, we infer that the
topological transition of skyrmion bubbles is closely related to the
dipole-dipole interaction, which we find is consistent with theoretical
simulations. The results presented here represent an important step forward in
manipulating the topological spin textures of skyrmion bubbles, making us
closer to achieving the fabrication of skyrmion-based racetrack memory devices.

skyrmions, have been identified as promising candidates for the transport and
storage of information for spintronic applications, notably magnetic racetrack
memory devices. The design and realization of single skyrmion chain at room
temperature (RT) and above in the low-dimensional nanostructures are of great
importance for future practical applications. Here, we report the creation of a
single skyrmion bubble chain in a geometrically confined Fe3Sn2 nanostripe with
a width comparable to the featured size of a skyrmion bubble. Systematic
investigations on the thermal stability have revealed that the single chain of
skyrmion bubbles can keep stable at temperatures varying from RT up to a
record-high temperature of 630 K. This extreme stability can be ascribed to the
weak temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropy and the formation of edge states
at the boundaries of the nanostripes. The realization of the highly stable
skyrmion bubble chain in a geometrically confined nanostructure is a very
important step towards the application of skyrmion-based spintronic devices.

of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). Specifically, we rule out regions of
X-ray spectral parameter space that do not reproduce the CXB in the energy
range 1-100 keV. The key X-ray spectral parameters are the photon index,
{\Gamma}; the cutoff energy, Ecutoff; and the reflection scaling factor, R.
Assuming each parameter follows a Gaussian distribution, we first explore the
parameter space using a Bayesian approach and a fixed X-ray luminosity function
(XLF). For {\sigma}_E = 36 keV and {\sigma}_R = 0.14, fixed at the observed
values from the Swift-BAT 70-month sample, we allow <R>, <Ecutoff > and
<{\Gamma}> to vary subject to reproducing the CXB. We report results for
{\sigma}_{\Gamma} = 0.1-0.5. In an alternative approach, we define the
parameter distributions, then forward model to fit the CXB by perturbing the
XLF using a neural network. This approach allows us to rule out parameter
combinations that cannot reproduce the CXB for any XLF. The marginalized
conditional probabilities for the four free parameters are: <R> =
0.99^{+0.11}_{-0.26}, <Ecutoff> = 118^{+24}_{-23}, {\sigma}_{\Gamma} =
0.101^{+0.097}_{-0.001} and <{\Gamma}> = 1.9^{+0.08}_{-0.09}. We provide an
interactive online tool for users to explore any combination of <Ecutoff>,
{\sigma}_E, <{\Gamma}>, {\sigma}_{\Gamma}, <R> and {\sigma}_R including
different distributions for each absorption bin, subject to the integral CXB
constraint. The distributions observed in many AGN samples can be ruled out by
our analysis, meaning these samples can not be representative of the full AGN
population. The few samples that fall within the acceptable parameter space are
hard X-ray-selected, commensurate with their having fewer selection biases.

game relationship cause great difficulty for policy learning. Therefore,
simplifying the learning process is an important research issue. In many
multi-agent systems, the interactions between agents often happen locally,
which means that agents neither need to coordinate with all other agents nor
need to coordinate with others all the time. Traditional methods attempt to use
pre-defined rules to capture the interaction relationship between agents.
However, the methods cannot be directly used in a large-scale environment due
to the difficulty of transforming the complex interactions between agents into
rules. In this paper, we model the relationship between agents by a complete
graph and propose a novel game abstraction mechanism based on two-stage
attention network (G2ANet), which can indicate whether there is an interaction
between two agents and the importance of the interaction. We integrate this
detection mechanism into graph neural network-based multi-agent reinforcement
learning for conducting game abstraction and propose two novel learning
algorithms GA-Comm and GA-AC. We conduct experiments in Traffic Junction and

implicitly via a set of inequality constraints over all the pairs of adjacent
labels. Based on (c-1) constraints for c labels, our model is non-parametric
and, therefore, more flexible than the existing deep ordinal classification
techniques. Unlike these, it does not restrict the learned representation to a
single and specific parametric model (or penalty) imposed on all the labels.
Therefore, it enables the training to explore larger spaces of solutions, while
removing the need for ad hoc choices and scaling up to large numbers of labels.
It can be used in conjunction with any standard classification loss and any
deep architecture. To tackle the ensuing challenging optimization problem, we
solve a sequence of unconstrained losses based on a powerful extension of the
log-barrier method.
  This handles effectively competing constraints and accommodates standard SGD
for deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive Lagrangian dual
steps and outperforming substantially penalty methods. Furthermore, we propose
a new performance metric for ordinal classification, as a proxy to measure
distribution uni-modality, referred to as the Sides Order Index (SOI). We
report comprehensive evaluations and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods on
benchmark public datasets for several ordinal classification tasks, showing the
merits of our approach in terms of label consistency, classification accuracy
and scalability. Importantly, enforcing label consistency with our model does
not incur higher classification errors, unlike many existing ordinal
classification methods. A public reproducible PyTorch implementation is

19%(8%) and 27%(14%), revealing unprecedented potential boosts of the megamaser
and disk maser detection rates by a factor of 7-15 relative to the current
rates, depending on the chosen sample selection criteria. A noteworthy aspect
of these new predictions is that the completeness rates are only compromised
mildly, with the rates remaining at the level of ~95%(~50%) for sources with
N_H >= 10^{23} cm^{-2} (N_H >= 10^24 cm^-2). Applying these selection methods
to the current X-ray AGN surveys predicts the detection of >~15 new megamaser

face-centre-cubic (fcc) cerium (Ce) remains controversial until now. In this
work, high quality single crystalline fcc-Ce thin films were grown on
Graphene/6$H$-SiC(0001) substrate, and explored by XRD and ARPES measurement.
XRD spectra showed a clear $\gamma$-$\alpha$ phase transition at
$T_{\gamma-\alpha}\approx$ 50 K, which is retarded by strain effect from
substrate comparing with $T_{\gamma-\alpha}$ (about 140 K) of the bulk Ce
metal. However, APRES spectra did not show any signature of $\alpha$-phase
emerging in the surface-layer from 300 K to 17 K, which implied that
$\alpha$-phase might form at the bulk-layer of our Ce thin films. Besides, an
evident Kondo dip near Fermi energy was observed in the APRES spectrum at 80 K,
indicting the formation of Kondo singlet states in $\gamma$-Ce. Furthermore,
the DFT+DMFT calculations were performed to simulate the electronic structures
and the theoretical spectral functions agreed well with the experimental ARPES
spectra. In $\gamma$-Ce, the behavior of the self-energy's imaginary part at
low frequency not only confirmed that the Kondo singlet states emerged at
$T_{\rm KS} \geq 80$ K, but also implied that they became coherent states at a
lower characteristic temperature ($T_{\rm coh}\sim 40$ K) due to the indirect
RKKY interaction among $f$-$f$ electrons. Besides, $T_{\rm coh}$ from the
theoretical simulation was close to $T_{\gamma-\alpha}$ from the XRD spectra.
These issues suggested that the Kondo scenario might play an important role in
the $\gamma$-$\alpha$ phase transition of cerium thin films.

Computing (MEC) enhanced cache update strategy, which takes into account the
client's playback status and transmission state, MEC cache capacity and the
popularity of each segment, to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of
clients and the use ratio of MEC cache. In each cache update period, the
segments which cannot bring significant QoE improvement will be deleted and
meanwhile more suitable representations of the segments will be cahed instead.
First, we divide the MEC cache space into three parts based on segment
popularity and segment importance level. In addition, the size of different
cache parts can be transformed to each other to further exploit the MEC cache
space. For different parts, the corresponding deleted strategy and caching
strategy are formulated, where the deleted strategy combines the requested
times of segment and transmission capability of clients, and the caching
strategy utilizes the playback state of clients to calculate the caching
priority. Furthermore, we formulate the cache update problem to maximize the
utility function of clients subject to the constraint of MEC cache size and
transmission capacity. The brand and branch method is emplyed to obatain the
optimal solution. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can
improve system throughput and hit ratio of video segment, and at the same time
decrease playback frozen time and system backhaul traffic compared with other
existing algorithms.

this work, we give some strategies to teach mathematics, especially to gifted

more advanced, more elegant and more beautiful aspects of the subject early.
The proposed integrated approach takes advantage of the fascinating
interconnections between various subfields of mathematics, and even borrows
from advanced topics such as number theory and topology. Combining the teaching
of computer programming with the teaching of mathematics is another key focus
of this work. This opens up the door to explore, not only the beautiful topics
such as fractals, computer math art and computer graphics in general, but also
real-life applications resulting from computer simulations in engineering and
physics and other natural sciences. We will also discuss the use of
storytelling, explorations and experimenting, puzzles and creative problem
solving etc., to make learning interesting for students. It is important to
show students that the `true' essence of mathematics goes beyond the dry
procedural drill of learning arithmetic. Students must be provided with the
opportunities to experience the `aha moment' resulting from the joy of solving
a difficult problem, or from the understanding of a deep concept with complete

illustrate how this could be achieved, taking into account the emotional and

the dataset often occurs, and the diagnostic performance on real unseen data

problem has not been sufficiently explored, since many systems have shown
excellent diagnostic performance due to the bias caused by the similarities in

more than 50,000 images of cucumber leaves, and propose an anti-overfitting
pretreatment (AOP) for realizing practical image-based plant diagnosis systems.
The AOP detects the area of interest (leaf, fruit etc.) and performs brightness

our AOP can improve the accuracy of diagnosis for unknown test images from

number of influenced nodes in the social network, referred to as the
\textit{influence maximization} (IM) problem. We assume that the topology of
the social network is prescribed while the influence probabilities among edges
are unknown. In order to learn the influence probabilities and simultaneously
maximize the influence spread, we consider the tradeoff between exploiting the
current estimation of the influence probabilities to ensure certain influence
spread and exploring more nodes to learn better about the influence
probabilities. The exploitation-exploration trade-off is the core issue in the
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. If we regard the influence spread as the
reward, then the IM problem could be reduced to the combinatorial multi-armed
bandits. At each round, the learner selects a limited number of seed nodes in
the social network, then the influence spreads over the network according to
the real influence probabilities. The learner could observe the activation
status of the edge if and only if its start node is influenced, which is
referred to as the edge-level semi-bandit feedback. Two classical bandit
algorithms including Thompson Sampling and Epsilon Greedy are used to solve
this combinatorial problem. To ensure the robustness of these two algorithms,
we use an automatic ensemble learning strategy, which combines the exploration
strategy with exploitation strategy. The ensemble algorithm is self-adaptive
regarding that the probability of each algorithm could be adjusted based on the
historical performance of the algorithm. Experimental evaluation illustrates
the effectiveness of the automatically adjusted hybridization of exploration

In this paper, we propose Shenjing, a configurable SNN architecture which fully
exposes all on-chip communications to software, enabling software mapping of
SNN models with high accuracy at low power. Unlike prior SNN architectures like
TrueNorth, Shenjing does not require any model modification and retraining for
the mapping. We show that conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) such as
multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, as well as the latest
residual neural networks can be mapped successfully onto Shenjing, realizing

Previous studies pointed out that real-world multiplex networks display
significant inter-layer correlations -- degree-degree correlation, edge
overlap, node similarities -- able to make them robust against random and
targeted failures of their individual components. Here, we show that
inter-layer correlations are important also in the characterization of their
$\mathbf{k}$-core structure, namely the organization in shells of nodes with
increasingly high degree. Understanding $k$-core structures is important in the
study of spreading processes taking place on networks, as for example in the
identification of influential spreaders and the emergence of localization
phenomena. We find that, if the degree distribution of the network is
heterogeneous, then a strong $\mathbf{k}$-core structure is well predicted by
significantly positive degree-degree correlations. However, if the network
degree distribution is homogeneous, then strong $\mathbf{k}$-core structure is
due to positive correlations at the level of node similarities. We reach our
conclusions by analyzing different real-world multiplex networks, introducing
novel techniques for controlling inter-layer correlations of networks without
changing their structure, and taking advantage of synthetic network models with
tunable levels of inter-layer correlations.

concentration leads to enhanced evaporation rates, whereas on superhydrophobic
surfaces, it first enhances and reduces with concentration. Also, the nature
and extents of the evaporation regimes constant contact angle or constant
contact radius are dependent on the salt concentration. The reduced evaporation
on superhydrophobic surfaces has been explained based on observed via
microscopy crystal nucleation behaviour within the droplet. Purely diffusion
driven evaporation models are noted to be unable to predict the modulated
evaporation rates. Further, the changes in the surface tension and static
contact angles due to solvated salts also cannot explain the improved
evaporation behaviour. Internal advection is observed using PIV to be generated
within the droplet and is dependent on the salt concentration. The advection
dynamics has been used to explain and quantify the improved evaporation
behaviour by appealing to the concept of interfacial shear modified Stefan
flows around the evaporating droplet. The analysis leads to accurate
predictions of the evaporation rates. Further, another scaling analysis has
been proposed to show that the thermal and solutal Marangoni advection within
the system leads to the advection behaviour. The analysis also shows that the
dominant mode is the solutal advection and the theory predicts the internal

to the domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations between videos
and images, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be
dramatically degraded when directly deployed to videos. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, named Deep Image-to-Video Adaptation and Fusion

knowledge from images using video keyframes as a bridge. The DIVAFN is a
unified deep learning model, which integrates domain-invariant representations
learning and cross-modal feature fusion into a unified optimization framework.
Specifically, we design an efficient cross-modal similarities metric to reduce
the modality shift among images, keyframes and videos. Then, we adopt an
autoencoder architecture, whose hidden layer is constrained to be the semantic
representations of the action class names. In this way, when the autoencoder is
adopted to project the learned features from different domains to the same
space, more compact, informative and discriminative representations can be
obtained. Finally, the concatenation of the learned semantic feature
representations from these three autoencoders are used to train the classifier
for action recognition in videos. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world

performance evaluations and parameter studies for novel anticipatory vehicular

However, due to the required simplifications and the wide range of unknown

optimizing anticipatory vehicular communication systems. Different machine

a hierarchical feature: higher-order complexity implies more chaotic dynamics.
Conventional ergodicity in thermalization processes is a manifestation of the
lowest order complexity, which is represented by the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis (ETH) stating that individual energy eigenstates are thermal. Here,
we propose a higher-order generalization of the ETH, named the $ k $-ETH ($
k=1,2,\dots $), to quantify higher-order complexity of quantum many-body
dynamics at the level of individual energy eigenstates, where the lowest order
ETH (1-ETH) is the conventional ETH. As a non-trivial contribution of the
higher-order ETH, we show that the $ k $-ETH with $ k\geq 2 $ implies a
universal behavior of the $ k $th Renyi entanglement entropy of individual
energy eigenstates. In particular, the Page correction of the entanglement
entropy originates from the higher-order ETH, while as is well known, the
volume law can be accounted for by the 1-ETH. We numerically verify that the
2-ETH approximately holds for a nonintegrable system, but does not hold in the
integrable case. To further investigate the information-theoretic feature
behind the $ k $-ETH, we introduce a concept named a partial unitary $ k
$-design (PU $ k $-design), which is an approximation of the Haar random
unitary up to the $ k $th moment, where partial means that only a limited
number of observables are accessible. The $ k $-ETH is a special case of a PU $
k $-design for the ensemble of Hamiltonian dynamics with random-time sampling.
In addition, we discuss the relationship between the higher-order ETH and
information scrambling quantified by out-of-time-ordered correlators. Our
framework provides a unified view on thermalization, entanglement entropy, and
unitary $ k $-designs, leading to deeper characterization of higher-order
quantum complexity.

consistent with a companion with an orbital period of $\approx$330 yrs and a
separation of less than 70 AU. The kinematics of the bipolar outflow is
consistent with it being created during a mass-loss eruption where the
mass-loss rate from the system increased by at least a factor of 5 during 10-15

point-like heat source, an optically trapped metal oxide particle absorbing
light. We find that thermophoresis increases the number density of colloids
around the oxide particle, leading to the appearance of solid clusters. Our
analysis based on thermophoresis reveals that the solid-fluid interface
position is purely determined by the relationship of the particle concentration
profile in the fluid state with the volume fraction of the phase transition,
and no other effect of thermodynamics is seen in the cluster sizes. In this
system, we observe the formation of face-centered cubic crystals, amorphous
states, and structures with icosahedral order. This shows a rich possibility of
non-trivial orderings under spatially controlled heterogeneous growth in
external ""semi-soft"" potentials that are softer than walls but with substantial
variations at the scale of a few particle diameters. Because of the tuneable
rate of addition of particles to the clusters, we propose this method could be
used to study the complex interplay of densification with local spatial
confinement effects, kinetics, and ordering.

industrial applications, where even modest improvements in mixing efficiency
could translate into considerable power savings or enhanced product quality. We
propose a gradient-based nonlinear optimization scheme to minimize the mix-norm
of a passive scalar. The velocities of two cylindrical stirrers, moving on
concentric circular paths inside a circular container, represent the control
variables, and an iterative direct-adjoint algorithm is employed to arrive at
enhanced mixing results. The associated stirring protocol is characterized by a
complex interplay of vortical structures, generated and promoted by the
stirrers' action. Full convergence of the optimization process requires
constraints that penalize the acceleration of the moving bodies. Under these
conditions, considerable mixing enhancement can be accomplished, even though an
optimum cannot be guaranteed due to the non-convex nature of the optimization
problem. Various challenges and extensions of our approach are discussed.

The resent development of speech enhancement is brought by using DNN. The
ordinary DNN-based speech enhancement employs T-F transform, typically the
short-time Fourier transform~(STFT), and estimates a T-F mask using DNN. On the
other hand, some methods have considered end-to-end networks which directly
estimate the enhanced signals without T-F transform. While end-to-end methods
have shown promising results, they are black boxes and hard to understand.
Therefore, some end-to-end methods used a DNN to learn the linear T-F transform
which is much easier to understand. However, the learned transform may not have
a property important for ordinary signal processing. In this paper, as the
important property of the T-F transform, perfect reconstruction is considered.
An invertible nonlinear T-F transform is constructed by DNNs and learned from

ground set $V$, compute a set $S\in\I_{1}\cap\I_{2}$ of largest possible
cardinality, denoted by $r$. We consider this problem both in the setting where
each $\M_{i}$ is accessed through an independence oracle, i.e. a routine which
returns whether or not a set $S\in\I_{i}$ in $\indep$ time, and the setting
where each $\M_{i}$ is accessed through a rank oracle, i.e. a routine which
returns the size of the largest independent subset of $S$ in $\M_{i}$ in
$\rank$ time.
  In each setting we provide faster exact and approximate algorithms. Given an
independence oracle, we provide an exact $O(nr\log r \indep)$ time algorithm.
This improves upon the running time of $O(nr^{1.5} \indep)$ due to Cunningham
in 1986 and $\tilde{O}(n^{2} \indep+n^{3})$ due to Lee, Sidford, and Wong in

improves over the $\tilde{O}(nr \rankt+n^{3})$-time algorithm by Lee, Sidford,

spectral indices in GeV and sub TeV regimes for 10 blazars as inputs to predict
their redshifts. The comparison of predicted redshifts by the ANN with the
known redshift suggests that both the values are consistent within $\sim$
18$\%$ uncertainty. The method proposed in the present work would be helpful in

question answering with textual sources. State-of-the-art models on RC still do
not have general linguistic intelligence; i.e., their accuracy worsens for
out-domain datasets that are not used in the training. We hypothesize that this

the out-domain. The UDARC task allows models to use supervised RC training data
in the source domain and only unlabeled passages in the target domain. To solve
the UDARC problem, we provide two domain adaptation models. The first one
learns the out-domain LM and in-domain RC task sequentially. The second one is
the proposed model that uses a multi-task learning approach of LM and RC. The
models can retain both the RC capability acquired from the supervised data in
the source domain and the LM capability from the unlabeled data in the target
domain. We evaluated the models on UDARC with five datasets in different
domains. The models outperformed the model without domain adaptation. In
particular, the proposed model yielded an improvement of 4.3/4.2 points in

face recognition is widely applied. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been
proposed, but most of them ignore the generalization ability to unseen attacks.
To overcome the limitation, this work casts face anti-spoofing as a domain
generalization (DG) problem, and attempts to address this problem by developing
a new meta-learning framework called Regularized Fine-grained Meta-learning. To
let our face anti-spoofing model generalize well to unseen attacks, the
proposed framework trains our model to perform well in the simulated domain
shift scenarios, which is achieved by finding generalized learning directions
in the meta-learning process. Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates
the domain knowledge of face anti-spoofing as the regularization so that
meta-learning is conducted in the feature space regularized by the supervision
of domain knowledge. This enables our model more likely to find generalized
learning directions with the regularized meta-learning for face anti-spoofing
task. Besides, to further enhance the generalization ability of our model, the
proposed framework adopts a fine-grained learning strategy that simultaneously
conducts meta-learning in a variety of domain shift scenarios in each
iteration. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

techniques in the generative adversarial networks to produce photo-realistic
images for image super-resolution. Firstly, instead of producing a single score
to discriminate images between real and fake, we propose a variant, called
Fine-grained Attention Generative Adversarial Network for image
super-resolution (FASRGAN), to discriminate each pixel between real and fake.
FASRGAN adopts a Unet-like network as the discriminator with two outputs: an
image score and an image score map. The score map has the same spatial size as
the HR/SR images, serving as the fine-grained attention to represent the degree
of reconstruction difficulty for each pixel. Secondly, instead of using
different networks for the generator and the discriminator in the SR problem,
we use a feature-sharing network (Fs-SRGAN) for both the generator and the
discriminator. By network sharing, certain information is shared between the
generator and the discriminator, which in turn can improve the ability of
producing high-quality images. Quantitative and visual comparisons with the
state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority
of our methods. The application of super-resolution images to object

previous conflicting studies by showing that a consistent mid-latitude climate

maps to detect the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with dedicated methods, e.g.,
by applying (i) component separation to construct a full sky map of the y
parameter or (ii) matched multi-filters to detect galaxy clusters via their hot

detection of the sources or in the reconstruction of the SZ signal due to prior
knowledge (e.g., the use of the GNFW profile model as a proxy for the shape of
galaxy clusters, which is accurate on average but not on individual clusters).
In this study, we use deep learning algorithms, more specifically a U-Net
architecture network, to detect the SZ signal from the Planck HFI frequency
maps. The U-Net shows very good performance, recovering the Planck clusters in
a test area. In the full sky, Planck clusters are also recovered, together with
more than 18,000 other potential SZ sources, for which we have statistical
hints of galaxy cluster signatures by stacking at their positions several full
sky maps at different wavelengths (i.e., the CMB lensing map from Planck, maps
of galaxy over-densities, and the ROSAT X-ray map). The diffuse SZ emission is
also recovered around known large-scale structures such as Shapley, A399-A401,
Coma, and Leo. Results shown in this proof-of-concept study are promising for
potential future detection of galaxy clusters with low SZ pressure with this

the controller is activated at each time instant and features an arbitrary but
fixed prediction horizon. We consider in more detail two specific setups from

the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. A long short-time memory (LSTM)
network takes as input a sequence of STFT coefficients associated with a
frequency bin of multichannel noisy-speech signals. The network's output is the
corresponding sequence of single-channel cleaned speech. We propose several
clean-speech network targets, namely, the magnitude ratio mask, the complex
STFT coefficients and the (smoothed) spatial filter. A prominent feature of the
proposed model is that the same LSTM architecture, with identical parameters,
is trained across frequency bins. The proposed method is referred to as
narrow-band deep filtering. This choice stays in contrast with traditional
wide-band speech enhancement methods. The proposed deep filtering is able to
discriminate between speech and noise by exploiting their different temporal
and spatial characteristics: speech is non-stationary and spatially coherent
while noise is relatively stationary and weakly correlated across channels.
This is similar in spirit with unsupervised techniques, such as spectral
subtraction and beamforming. We describe extensive experiments with both mixed
signals (noise is added to clean speech) and real signals (live recordings). We
empirically evaluate the proposed architecture variants using speech
enhancement and speech recognition metrics, and we compare our results with the
results obtained with several state of the art methods. In the light of these
experiments we conclude that narrow-band deep filtering has very good speech
enhancement and speech recognition performance, and excellent generalization
capabilities in terms of speaker variability and noise type.

reduction and multivariate statistical techniques. From a probabilistic
perspective, PCA seeks a low-dimensional representation of data in the presence
of independent identical Gaussian noise. Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and its
variants have been extensively studied for decades. Most of them assume the
underlying noise follows a certain independent identical distribution. However,
the noise in the real world is usually complicated and structured. To address
this challenge, some variants of PCA for data with non-IID noise have been
proposed. However, most of the existing methods only assume that the noise is
correlated in the feature space while there may exist two-way structured noise.
To this end, we propose a powerful and intuitive PCA method (MN-PCA) through
modeling the graphical noise by the matrix normal distribution, which enables
us to explore the structure of noise in both the feature space and the sample
space. MN-PCA obtains a low-rank representation of data and the structure of
noise simultaneously. And it can be explained as approximating data over the
generalized Mahalanobis distance. We develop two algorithms to solve this

Wasserstein distance, which is more robust. Extensive experiments on various

The helical hinge modes are sustainable to inelastic scattering and
TRS-breaking disorder, which can be observed in macroscopic samples. We show
that this HQSH effect can be understood as a three-dimensional generalization
of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and its topology is characterized by the spin

  savanna ecosystems",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The savanna biome is characterised by a continuous vegetation cover,
comprised of herbaceous and woody plants. The coexistence of species in arid
savannas, where water availability is the main limiting resource for plant
growth, provides an apparent contradiction to the classical principle of
competitive exclusion. Previous theoretical work using nonspatial models has
focussed on the development of an understanding of coexistence mechanisms
through the consideration of resource niche separation and ecosystem
disturbances. In this paper, we propose that a spatial self-organisation
principle, caused by a positive feedback between local vegetation growth and
water redistribution, is sufficient for species coexistence in savanna
ecosystems. We propose a spatiotemporal ecohydrological model of partial
differential equations, based on the Klausmeier reaction-advection-diffusion
model for vegetation patterns, to investigate the effects of spatial
interactions on species coexistence on sloped terrain. Our results suggest that
species coexistence is a possible model outcome, if a balance is kept between
the species' average fitness (a measure of a species' competitive abilities in
a spatially uniform setting) and their colonisation abilities. Spatial
heterogeneities in resource availability are utilised by the superior coloniser
(grasses), before it is outcompeted by the species of higher average fitness
(trees). A stability analysis of the spatially nonuniform coexistence solutions
further suggests that grasses act as ecosystem engineers and facilitate the
formation of a continuous tree cover for precipitation levels unable to support
a uniform tree density in the absence of a grass species.

first study the sparse priors of rainy images, which have been verified to
preserve unbroken edges in image decomposition. However, its mathematical
formulation usually leads to an intractable solution, we propose quasi-sparsity
priors to decrease complexity, so that our network can be trained under the
supervision of sparse properties of rainy images. Quasi-sparsity supervises
network training in different gradient domain which is still ill-posed to
decompose a rainy image into rain layer and background layer. We develop
another $L_1$ loss based on the intrinsic low-value property of rain layer to
restore image contents together with the commonly-used $L_1$ similarity loss.
Multi-scale features are further explored via a multi-scale auxiliary decoding
structure to show which kinds of features contribute the most to the deraining

investigating the role of CME-CME interactions as source of the associated
intense geomagnetic storm (Dst_min=-142 nT on September 7). To quantify the

perform global heliospheric simulations with the EUHFORIA model, using
observation-based initial parameters with the additional purpose of validating
the predictive capabilities of the model for complex CME events. The
simulations show that around 0.45 AU, the shock driven by the September 6 CME
started compressing a preceding magnetic ejecta formed by the merging of two
CMEs launched on September 4, significantly amplifying its Bz until a maximum
factor of 2.8 around 0.9 AU. The following gradual conversion of magnetic
energy into kinetic and thermal components reduced the Bz amplification until
its almost complete disappearance around 1.8 AU. We conclude that a key factor
at the origin of the intense storm triggered by the September 4-6, 2017 CMEs
was their arrival at Earth during the phase of maximum Bz amplification. Our
analysis highlights how the amplification of the magnetic field of individual
CMEs in space-time due to interaction processes can be characterised by a
growth, a maximum, and a decay phase, suggesting that the time interval between
the CME eruptions and their relative speeds are critical factors in determining

often addressed with the graph cut algorithm. However, solving an unconstrained
graph cut problem is NP-hard. For tractable optimization, pairwise potentials
have to fulfill the submodularity inequality. In our learning paradigm,
pairwise potentials are created as the dot product of a learned vector w with
positive feature vectors. In order to constrain such a model to remain
tractable, previous approaches have enforced the weight vector to be positive
for pairwise potentials in which the labels differ, and set pairwise potentials
to zero in the case that the label remains the same. Such constraints are
sufficient to guarantee that the resulting pairwise potentials satisfy the
submodularity inequality. However, we show that such an approach unnecessarily
restricts the capacity of the learned models. Guaranteeing submodularity for
all possible inputs, no matter how improbable, reduces inference error to
effectively zero, but increases model error. In contrast, we relax the
requirement of guaranteed submodularity to solutions that are probably
approximately submodular. We show that the conceptually simple strategy of
enforcing submodularity on the training examples guarantees with low sample
complexity that test images will also yield submodular pairwise potentials.
Results are presented in the binary and muticlass settings, showing substantial
improvement from the resulting increased model capacity.

the fine-structure constant and local tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle

factor of two. At the one sigma level the current data already excludes dark

microfluidic system for flowing particles is proposed to increase the
maneuverability of longitudinal dynamic self-assembly of particles and achieve
real-time control of the interparticle spacings and the frequency of particles
passing through the outlet. Two kinds of functional microstructures and a
side-channel were designed to preprocessing the randomly distributed particles
to make particles no aggregation and evenly distributed and realize real-time
control of the particle volume concentration. Randomly distributed particles
could be focused into a line and become equally spaced in the center axis of a
straight microchannel under the balance of the elastic force and the
viscoelasticity-induced effective repulsive force. Besides, a finite element
method model is established to analyze the processes of particles flowing in
each functional microstructure. Therefore, a step forward in this microfluidic

so-called token bucket traffic specification, with a rollout (i.e., predictive)
controller that both schedules transmissions and computes the corresponding
control values. In the token bucket specification, a transmission is allowed if
the current level of tokens is above a certain threshold. Recently, it has been
shown that having a full bucket at the time of a set point change significantly
improves the control performance as compared to when the bucket level is low.
In this work, we develop mechanisms that guarantee that the bucket fills up
after the controlled plant has converged to a set point. To do this, we
consider two different setups. First, we consider that all transmissions over
the network must fulfill the token bucket specification and show convergence to
the upper sector of the bucket by adding a slight terminal cost on the bucket
level. Afterwards, we consider a modified network which additionally features a
direct link over which transmissions need not fulfill the token bucket
specification. In this setup, we prove convergence of the bucket level exactly
to the upper rim. These mechanisms enable a similar level of flexibility as
event-triggered control: In converged state, little communication is used while
in precarious operating conditions, a burst of transmissions is possible. Other
than event-triggered approaches, the proposed methods allow to specify the
network traffic beforehand by means of the token bucket. Lastly, we validate
the proposed approaches in a numerical example.

system, using nuclear potential based on the Skyrme-SLy4 nucleon-nucleon

cluster is mostly formed in the pre-surface region of the nucleus, under the
effect of Pauli blocking from the saturated core density. The deeper
$\alpha$-formation distance inside the nucleus gives rise to less preformation
probability, and indicates more stable nucleus of longer half-life. Also, the
$\alpha$-particle tends to be formed at a bit deeper region inside the nuclei
having larger isospin asymmetry and in the closed shell nuclei. Regarding the
emitted nuclei heavier than $\alpha$-particle, we find that the formation
distance of the emitted clusters heavier than $\alpha$-particle increases with
increasing the isospin asymmetry of the formed cluster, rather than with
increasing its mass number. The partial half-life of a certain cluster-decay
mode increases upon increasing either the mass number or the isospin asymmetry
of the emitted cluster.

substructures that might be due to the interaction with (forming) planets. The
available census is strongly biased toward massive disks around old stars,
however. The DARTTS program aims at alleviating this bias by imaging a large
number of T Tauri stars with diverse properties. In this work, we present new
SPHERE images of 21 circumstellar disks, which is the largest sample released
to date. The targets of this work are significantly younger than those
published thus far with polarimetric near-IR (NIR) imaging. Scattered light is
unambiguously resolved in 11 targets, and some polarized unresolved signal is
detected in 3 additional sources. Some disk substructures are detected.
However, the paucity of spirals and shadows from this sample reinforces the
trend according to which these NIR features are associated with Herbig stars,
either because they are older or more massive. Furthermore, disk rings that are
apparent in ALMA observations of some targets do not appear to have
corresponding detections with SPHERE. Inner cavities larger than 15 au are also
absent from our images, even though they are expected from the spectral energy
distribution. On the other hand, 3 objects show extended filaments at larger
scale that are indicative of strong interaction with the surrounding medium.
All but one of the undetected disks are best explained by their limited size
(less than 20 au), and the high occurrence of stellar companions in these
sources suggests an important role in limiting the disk size. One undetected
disk is massive and very large at millimeter wavelengths, implying that it is
self-shadowed in the NIR. This work paves the way toward a more complete and
less biased sample of scattered-light observations, which is required to
interpret how disk features evolve throughout the disk lifetime.

requirements and the huge architecture space. To address these issues, we
introduce channel sampling and operation space reduction into a differentiable
NAS to significantly reduce the cost of searching. This is accomplished through
a performance-based strategy used to abandon less potential operations. Two
optimization methods for binarized neural networks are used to validate the
effectiveness of our BNAS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
BNAS achieves a performance comparable to NAS on both CIFAR and ImageNet
databases. An accuracy of $96.53\%$ vs. $97.22\%$ is achieved on the CIFAR-10
dataset, but with a significantly compressed model, and a $40\%$ faster search
than the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS.

energy in atoms and molecules and often leads to highly accurate results.
However, due to its single-reference nature, standard CC in its projected form
fails to describe quantum states characterized by strong electronic
correlations and multi-reference projective methods become necessary. On the
other hand, quantum algorithms for the solution of many-electron problems have
also emerged recently. The quantum UCC with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) is a
popular wavefunction Ansatz for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
algorithm. The variational nature of this approach can lead to significant
advantages compared to its classical equivalent in the projected form, in
particular for the description of strong electronic correlation. However, due
to the large number of gate operations required in q-UCCSD, approximations need
to be introduced in order to make this approach implementable in a
state-of-the-art quantum computer. In this work, we evaluate several variants
of the standard q-UCCSD Ansatz in which only a subset of excitations is
included. In particular, we investigate the singlet and pair q-UCCD approaches
combined with orbital optimization. We show that these approaches can capture
the dissociation/distortion profiles of challenging systems such as H$_4$,
H$_2$O and N$_2$ molecules, as well as the one-dimensional periodic
Fermi-Hubbard chain. These results promote the future use of q-UCC methods for
the solution of challenging electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry.

probably most well-known problem if this type is knapsack and many
generalizations of it have been studied in the literature like Two-dimensional
Geometric Knapsack (2DKP) and Unsplittable Flow on a Path (UFP). For the latter
two problems, recently the first polynomial time approximation algorithms with
better approximation ratios than 2 were presented [G\'alvez et al., FOCS
2017][Grandoni et al., STOC 2018].
  In this paper we break the barrier of 2 for the Storage Allocation Problem
(SAP) which is a natural intermediate problem between 2DKP and UFP. We are
given a path with capacitated edges and a set of tasks where each task has a
start vertex, an end vertex, a size, and a profit. We seek to select the most
profitable set of tasks that we can draw as non-overlapping rectangles
underneath the capacity profile of the edges where the height of each rectangle
equals the size of the corresponding task.
  This problem is motivated by settings of allocation resources like memory,
bandwidths, etc. where each request needs a contiguous portion of the resource.
The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for SAP has an
approximation ratio of 2+epsilon$ [M\""omke and Wiese, ICALP 2015] and no better
quasi-polynomial time algorithm is known. We present a polynomial time (63/32)
< 1.969-approximation algorithm for the case of uniform edge capacities and a
quasi-polynomial time (1.997)-approximation algorithm for non-uniform
quasi-polynomially bounded edge capacities. Finally, we show that under slight
resource augmentation we can obtain approximation ratios of 3/2 + epsilon in

the equilibration time (in the c.m. frame of colliding nuclei) rises from
$\sim$5 fm/c at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.3 GeV to $\sim$1 fm/c at 39 GeV. The
chemical equilibration, and thus thermalization, takes longer. We argue that
the presented time evolution of the net-baryon and energy densities in the

observables in midrapidity. We suggest that for informative comparison of
predictions of different models it is useful to calculate an invariant 4-volume

value. The advantage of this 4-volume is that it does not depend on specific
choice of the 3-volume in different studies and takes into account the lifetime
of the high-density region, which also matters. The 4-volume $V_4=$ 100
fm$^4$/c is chosen to compare the baryon densities attainable at different
different energies. It is found that the highest proper baryon density
increases with the collision energy rise, from $n_B/n_0\approx$ 4 at 3.3 GeV to

Our investigation focuses on the parameter region in which a transition between
uniform and patterned vegetation occurs. Results show that decay-type processes
associated with a low frequency of precipitation pulses inhibit the onset of
patterns and that under intermittent rainfall regimes, a spatially uniform
solution is sustained at lower total precipitation volumes than under
continuous rainfall, if plant species are unable to efficiently use low soil
moisture levels. Unlike in the classical setting of a reaction-diffusion model,
patterns are not caused by a diffusion-driven instability but by a combination
of sufficiently long periods of droughts between precipitation pulses and water
diffusion. Our results further indicate that the introduction of pulse-type
seed dispersal weakens the effects of changes to width and shape of the plant
dispersal kernel on the onset of patterns.

signal around a bright QSO at $z \sim 10$. Due to its powerful UV and X-ray
radiation, the QSO quickly increases the extent of the fully ionized bubble
produced by the pre-existing stellar type sources, in addition to partially
ionize and heat the surrounding gas. As expected, a longer QSO lifetime,
$t_{\rm QSO}$, results in a 21~cm signal in emission located at increasingly
larger angular radii, $\theta$, and covering a wider range of $\theta$. Similar
features can be obtained with a higher galactic emissivity efficiency, $f_{\rm
UV}$, so that determining the origin of a large ionized bubble (i.e. QSO vs
stars) is not straightforward. Such degeneracy could be reduced by taking
advantage of the finite light traveltime effect, which is expected to affect an
HII region produced by a QSO differently from one created by stellar type
sources. From an observational point of view, we find that the 21 cm signal
around a QSO at various $t_{\rm QSO}$ could be detected by SKA1-low with a high
signal-noise ratio (S/N). As a reference, for $t_{\rm QSO} = 10\,\rm Myr$, a
S/N $\sim 8$ is expected assuming that no pre-heating of the IGM has taken
place due to high-$z$ energetic sources, while it can reach value above 10 in

produce generations from the individual modalities of data originating from
mixture distributions. This is primarily due to the use of a simple isotropic
Gaussian as the prior for the latent code in the ancestral sampling procedure
for the data generations. We propose a novel formulation of variational
autoencoders, conditional prior VAE (CP-VAE), which learns to differentiate
between the individual mixture components and therefore allows for generations
from the distributional data clusters. We assume a two-level generative process
with a continuous (Gaussian) latent variable sampled conditionally on a
discrete (categorical) latent component. The new variational objective
naturally couples the learning of the posterior and prior conditionals, and the
learning of the latent categories encoding the multimodality of the original
data in an unsupervised manner. The data-dependent conditional priors are then
used to sample the continuous latent code when generating new samples from the
individual mixture components corresponding to the multimodal structure of the
original data. Our experimental results illustrate the generative performance
of our new model comparing to multiple baselines.

series can substantially impact predictions of mixed causal-noncausal (MAR)
models, namely dynamic processes that depend not only on their lags but also on
their leads. MAR models have been successfully implemented on commodity prices
as they allow to generate nonlinear features such as locally explosive episodes
(denoted here as bubbles) in a strictly stationary setting. We consider
multiple detrending methods and investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, to
what extent they preserve the bubble patterns observed in the raw data. MAR
models relies on the dynamics observed in the series alone and does not require
economical background to construct a structural model, which can sometimes be
intricate to specify or which may lack parsimony. We investigate oil prices and
estimate probabilities of crashes before and during the first 2020 wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three different mechanical detrending methods
and compare them to a detrending performed using the level of strategic
petroleum reserves.

it is unclear whether certain automation (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane

investigate driver awareness, use, perceived safety, knowledge, training, and
attitudes toward ADAS with different automation systems/features. Results of
our online survey (n=1018) reveal that there is a significant difference in
frequency of use and perceived safety for different ADAS features. Furthermore,
we find that at least 70% of drivers activate an ADAS feature ""most or all of
the time"" when driving, yet we find that at least 40% of drivers report feeling
that ADAS often compromises their safety when activated. We also find that most
respondents learn how to use ADAS in their vehicles by trying it out on the
road by themselves, rather than through any formal driver education and
training. These results may mirror how certain ADAS features are often
activated by default resulting in high usage rates. These results also suggest
a lack of driver training and education for safely interacting with, and
operating, ADAS, such as turning off systems/features. These findings
contribute to a critical discussion about the overall safety implications of
current ADAS, especially as they enable higher-level automation features to
creep into personal vehicles without a lockstep response in training,
regulation, and policy.

  Information",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing works on disentangled representation learning are solely built
upon an marginal independence assumption: all factors in disentangled
representations should be statistically independent. This assumption is
necessary but definitely not sufficient for the disentangled representations
without additional inductive biases in the modeling process, which is shown
theoretically in recent studies. We argue in this work that disentangled
representations should be characterized by their relation with observable data.
In particular, we formulate such a relation through the concept of mutual
information: the mutual information between each factor of the disentangled
representations and data should be invariant conditioned on values of the other
factors. Together with the widely accepted independence assumption, we further
bridge it with the conditional independence of factors in representations
conditioned on data. Moreover, we note that conditional independence of latent
variables has been imposed on most VAE-type models and InfoGAN due to the
artificial choice of factorized approximate posterior $q(\rvz|\rvx)$ in the
encoders. Such an arrangement of encoders introduces a crucial inductive bias
for disentangled representations. To demonstrate the importance of our proposed
assumption and the related inductive bias, we show in experiments that
violating the assumption leads to decline of disentanglement among factors in
the learned representations.

present throughout the photosphere and chromosphere. It has been suggested that
these events could contribute to the heating of the upper solar atmosphere, via
exciting Alfv\'en pulses, which could carry significant amounts of energy.
However, the conjectured necessary physical conditions for their excitation,
that the magnetic field rotates co-spatially and co-temporally with the
velocity field, has not been verified. Aims. We aim to understand whether
photospheric velocity swirls exist co-spatially and co-temporally with
photospheric magnetic swirls, in order to demonstrate the link between swirls
and pulses. Methods. The automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA) is applied
to the photospheric horizontal velocity and vertical magnetic fields obtained
from a series of realistic numerical simulations using the RMHD code Bifrost.
The spatial relationship between the detected velocity and magnetic swirls is
further investigated via a well-defined correlation index (CI) study. Results.
On average, there are ~63 short-lived photospheric velocity swirls (with
lifetimes mostly less than 20 s, and average radius of ~37 km and rotating
speeds of ~2.5 km/s) detected in a field of view (FOV) of 6\times6 Mm^{-2},
implying a total population of velocity swirls of ~1.06\times10^7 in the solar
photosphere. More than 80% of the detected velocity swirls are found to be
accompanied by local magnetic concentrations in intergranular lanes. On
average, ~71% of the detected velocity swirls have been found to co-exist with
photospheric magnetic swirls with the same rotating direction. Conclusions. The
co-temporal and co-spatial rotation in the photospheric velocity and magnetic
fields provide evidence that the conjectured condition for the excitation of
Alfv\'en pulses by photospheric swirls is fulfilled.

For very large corpora where the number of documents can be in the order of

the following results: (a) The in-plane unit cell changes its area in going
from the bulk to a monolayer. The change of in-plane distances implies that
bonds weaker than covalent or ionic ones are at work within the monolayers
themselves. This observation is relevant for the prediction of the critical
temperature $T_c$. (b) There is a hierarchy of independent parameters that
uniquely define a ground state ferroelectric unit cell (and square and
rectangular paraelectric unit cells as well): only 5 optimizable parameters are
needed to establish the unit cell vectors and the four basis vectors of the
ferroelectric ground state unit cell, while square and rectangular paraelectric
structures are defined by only 3 or 2 independent optimizable variables,
respectively. (c) The reduced number of independent structural variables
correlates with larger elastic energy barriers on a rectangular paraelectric
unit cell when compared to the elastic energy barrier of a square paraelectric
structure. This implies that $T_c$ obtained on a structure that keeps the
lattice parameters fixed (for example, using an NVT ensemble) should be larger
than the transition temperature on a structure that is allowed to change
in-plane lattice vectors (for example, using the NPT ensemble). (d) The
dissociation energy (bulk cleavage energy) of these materials is similar to the

disks, which are strongly misaligned from each other. The circumsecondary disk
is circumbinary in nature. Interestingly, both disks are interacting, and they
possibly rotate in opposite directions. To investigate the nature of this
unique twin disk system, we present 0.''1 resolution near-infrared polarized
intensity images of the circumstellar structures around SR24, obtained with
HiCIAO mounted on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. Both the circumprimary disk and
the circumsecondary disk are resolved and have elongated features. While the
position angle of the major axis and radius of the NIR polarization disk around
SR24S are 55$^{\circ}$ and 137 au, respectively, those around SR24N are
110$^{\circ}$ and 34 au, respectively. With regard to overall morphology, the
circumprimary disk around SR24S shows strong asymmetry, whereas the
circumsecondary disk around SR24N shows relatively strong symmetry. Our NIR
observations confirm the previous claim that the circumprimary and
circumsecondary disks are misaligned from each other. Both the circumprimary
and circumsecondary disks show similar structures in $^{12}$CO observations in
terms of its size and elongation direction. This consistency is because both
NIR and $^{12}$CO are tracing surface layers of the flared disks. As the radius
of the polarization disk around SR24N is roughly consistent with the size of
the outer Roche lobe, it is natural to interpret the polarization disk around
SR24N as a circumbinary disk surrounding the SR24Nb-Nc system.

only solution of the partial differential equation $\Delta f(t) =
(\|t\|^2-d)f(t)$, $t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, subject to the condition $f(0) = 1$. By

with the dry season or the beginning of the wet season. We reformulate the
Klausmeier model, a reaction-advection-diffusion system that describes the
plant-water dynamics in semi-arid environments, as an integrodifference model
to account for the temporal separation of plant growth processes during the wet
season and seed dispersal processes during the dry season. The model further
accounts for nonlocal processes involved in the dispersal of seeds. Our
analysis focusses on the onset of spatial patterns. The Klausmeier partial
differential equations (PDE) model is linked to the integrodifference model in
an appropriate limit, which yields a control parameter for the temporal
separation of seed dispersal events. We find that the conditions for pattern
onset in the integrodifference model are equivalent to those for the continuous
PDE model and hence independent of the time between seed dispersal events. We
thus conclude that in the context of seed dispersal, a PDE model provides a
sufficiently accurate description, even if the environment is seasonal. This
emphasises the validity of results that have previously been obtained for the
PDE model. Further, we numerically investigate the effects of changes to seed
dispersal behaviour on the onset of patterns. We find that long-range seed
dispersal inhibits the formation of spatial patterns and that the seed
dispersal kernel's decay at infinity is a significant regulator of patterning.

this definition, equivariant sheaves can be glued from an ""open cover"".
Precisely, we show that an equivariant sheaf can be uniquely recovered from the
following data: the restriction to the complement of a point, the local type at
the point itself, and an isomorphism between the two over the punctured
neighborhood of said point.
  We study symmetric elliptic difference equations (""elliptic equations"" from

algebraic version of symmetric elliptic difference equations, i.e. symmetric
elliptic difference modules (""elliptic modules""). We show that different
versions are not equivalent, but we detail how they are related: all the
versions embed fully faithfully into the same category of equivariant sheaves.
This implies that we can use the theory for equivariant sheaves to study
singularities of elliptic equations as well.
  One reason to study elliptic equations is that they generalize, and
degenerate to, (q-)difference equations (i.e. equivariant sheaves) and
differential equations (i.e. D-modules) on the projective line. We discuss this
from the elliptic module point of view, which requires studying elliptic
modules on singular curves. We study the relation between elliptic modules on
singular curves and their normalization. We show that for modules which are
flat at the singular points there is an equivalence and we give examples

the dielectric spectra of glycerol. Recently it was demonstrated for
monohydroxy alcohols that a detailed comparison of the dynamic susceptibilities
of photon correlation and broadband dielectric spectroscopy allows to
unambiguously disentangle a collective relaxation mode known as the Debye
process, which could arises due to supramolecular structures, and the
$\alpha$-relaxation, which proves to be identical in both methods. In the
present paper, we apply the same idea and analysis to the paradigmatic glass
former glycerol. For that purpose we present new light scattering data from
photon correlation spectroscopy measurements and combine these with literature
data to obtain a data set covering a dynamic range from $10^{-4}-10^{13}\,$Hz.
Then we apply the above mentioned analysis by comparing this data set with a
corresponding set of broadband dielectric data. Our finding is that even in a
polyalcohol self- and cross-correlation contributions can approximately be
disentangled in that way and that the emerging picture is very similar to that
in monohydroxy alcohols. This is further supported by comparing the data with
fast field cycling NMR measurements and dynamic shear relaxation data from the
literature, and it turns out that, within the described approach, the
$\alpha$-process appears very similar in all methods, while the pronounced
differences observed in the spectral density are due to a different expression
of the slow collective relaxational contribution. In the dielectric spectra the
strength of this peak is reasonably well estimated by the Kirkwood correlation
factor, which supports the view that it arises due to dynamic
cross-correlations, which were previously often assumed to be negligible in
dielectric measurements.

massless scalar perturbation in 5- and 6-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter black holes. Our numerical results
exhibit that the higher derivative term plays a different role in the d = 5
case than it does in the d = 6 case. For d = 5, the SCC violation region
increases as the strength of the higher derivative term increases. For d = 6,
the SCC violation region first increases and then decreases as the higher
derivative correction becomes stronger, and SCC can always be restored for a
black hole with a fixed charge ratio when the higher derivative correction is
strong enough. Finally, we find that the C2 version of SCC is respected in the
d = 6 case, but can be violated in some near-extremal regime in the d = 5 case.

(H2CO) absorption towards the Galactic Center (GC) point-source `N3'. Both
absorption features are unresolved and spatially aligned with N3. The 6.7 GHz
CH3OH contains a single velocity component (centered at ~10 km/s) while the 4.8
GHz H2CO shows two velocity components (centered at ~-3 and +8 km/s). We find
that the velocity of these absorption components are similar to that of
emission lines from other molecules (e.g., SiO and H3CN) detected toward this
compact-source (-13 to +25 km/s; `N3 cloud'). The detection of these absorption
features is a firm indication that some of the molecular gas in the N3
molecular cloud is on the near-side of the continuum source. Analysis of the
CH3OH absorption kinematics shows a relatively large velocity dispersion (3.8
km/s) for the size scale of this feature (<0.1'', <0.01 pc at the GC; Ludovici
et al. 2016), when compared with other similar size GC clouds in the Larson
linewidth-size relationship. Further, this linewidth is closer to velocity
dispersion measurements for size scales of 1.3 pc, which is roughly the width
of the N3 cloud (25''; 1.0 pc). We argue that this relatively broad linewidth,
over a small cross-sectional area, is due to turbulence through the depth of
the cloud, where the cloud has a presumed line-of-sight thickness of ~1 pc.

read-back process, on granular media becomes computationally expensive if the
magnetization dynamics of each grain are explicitly computed. In addition, in
heat-assisted magnetic recording, the writing of a single track becomes a
random process since the temperature must be considered and thermal noise is
involved. Further, varying grain structures of various granular media must also
be taken into account to obtain correct statistics for the final read-back
signal. Hence, it requires many repetitions of the write process to investigate
the mean signal as well as the noise. This work presents a method that improves
the statistical evaluation of the whole recording process. The idea is to avoid
writing the magnetization to one of its binary states. Instead, we assign each
grain its probability of occupying one of its stable states, which can be
calculated in advance in terms of a switching probability phase diagram. In the
read-back process, we combine the probabilities to calculate a mean signal and
its variance. Afterwards, repetitions on different media lead to the final
read-back signal. Using a recording example, we show that the statistical
behavior of the evaluated signal-to-noise ratio can be significantly improved
by applying this probability mapping method, while the computational effort
remains low.

obtain some novel ones, in particular for the Keller-Segel chemiotaxis model. 1
Short introduction The goal of this paper is to present some estimates on
evolution PDEs in the space of probability densities which share two important
features: they include a linear diffusion term, and they are gradient flows in
the Wasserstein space W2. These PDEs will be of the form $\partial$t$\rho$ --
$\Delta$$\rho$ -- $\nabla$ $\times$ ($\rho$$\nabla$u[$\rho$]) = 0, complemented
with no-flux boundary conditions and an intial condition on $\rho$0. We will in
particular concentrate on the Fokker-Plack case, where u[$\rho$] = V and V is a
fixed function (with possible regularity assumptions) independent of $\rho$, on
the case where u[$\rho$] = W * $\rho$ is obtained by convolution and models
interaction between particles, and on the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel case
where u[$\rho$] is related to $\rho$ via an elliptic equation. This last case
models the evolution of a biological population $\rho$ subject to diffusion but
attracted by the concentration of a chemo-attractant, a nutrient which is
produced by the population itself, so that its distribution is ruled by a PDE
where the density $\rho$ appears as a source term. Under the assumption that
the production rate of this nutrient is much faster than the motion of the
cells, we can assume that its distribution is ruled by a statical PDE with no
explicit time-dependence, and gives rise to a system which is a gradient flow
in the variable $\rho$ (the parabolic-parabolic case, where the time scale for
the cells and for the nutrient are comparable, is also a gradient flow, in the
product space W2 x L 2 , but we will not consider this case). Since we mainly
concentrate on the case of bounded domains, in the Keller-Segel case the term
u[$\rho$] cannot be expressed as a convoluton and requires ad-hoc computations.
In all the paper, the estimates will be studied on a time-discretized version
of these PDEs, consisting in the so-called JKO (Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto)
scheme, based on iterated optimization problems involving the Wasserstein
distance W2. We will first present 0-order estimates, on the L p and L $\infty$
norms of the solution. This is just a translation into the JKO language of
well-known properties of these equations. The main goal of this part is hence

relevant compressed representations $T$ of some random variable $X$ for the
task of predicting $Y$. It is defined as a constrained optimization problem
which maximizes the information the representation has about the task,
$I(T;Y)$, while ensuring that a certain level of compression $r$ is achieved
(i.e., $ I(X;T) \leq r$). For practical reasons, the problem is usually solved
by maximizing the IB Lagrangian (i.e., $\mathcal{L}_{\text{IB}}(T;\beta) =
I(T;Y) - \beta I(X;T)$) for many values of $\beta \in [0,1]$. Then, the curve
of maximal $I(T;Y)$ for a given $I(X;T)$ is drawn and a representation with the
desired predictability and compression is selected. It is known when $Y$ is a
deterministic function of $X$, the IB curve cannot be explored and another
Lagrangian has been proposed to tackle this problem: the squared IB Lagrangian:
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{sq-IB}}(T;\beta_{\text{sq}})=I(T;Y)-\beta_{\text{sq}}I(X;T)^2$.
In this paper, we (i) present a general family of Lagrangians which allow for
the exploration of the IB curve in all scenarios; (ii) provide the exact
one-to-one mapping between the Lagrange multiplier and the desired compression
rate $r$ for known IB curve shapes; and (iii) show we can approximately obtain
a specific compression level with the convex IB Lagrangian for both known and
unknown IB curve shapes. This eliminates the burden of solving the optimization
problem for many values of the Lagrange multiplier. That is, we prove that we
can solve the original constrained problem with a single optimization.

a system of ten telephoto Canon lenses designed for low surface brightness
imaging in the Southern sky. Based upon the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, the
refractive lens-based system provides an obstruction free optical path, which
reduces the number of scattering surfaces and allows easier access to lower
surface brightness levels.
  In this proceeding, we present an analysis of the impact of flat fielding
uncertainty on the limiting low surface brightness levels. We show that a
fairly standard set of flat-field data can be well-characterised to a
$\sim0.1\%$ level. This corresponds to a 5-$\sigma$ lower limit of $\sim33$
magnitude per arcsecond$^2$, which means that flat fielding is not likely going
to set Huntsman's low surface brightness limit.
  We also present early results of an exoplanet transient mode for Huntsman
where all lenses work together to detect subtle variations in the luminosity of
relatively bright $V=8-12$ magnitude stars. High-precision exoplanet imaging is
ultimately limited by systematic uncertainties, so we anticipate multiple
lenses will help to mitigate issues related to pixel-to-pixel and intra-pixel
sensitivity variations. Our initial results show we can easily get $\sim0.4\%$
photometric precision with a single, defocused lens.

decomposing the error term into approximation error and estimation error, we
are able to conduct the following analysis: First of all, we establish the
universal consistency under $L_1(\mu)$-norm. Secondly, under the assumption
that the underlying density function resides in the H\""{o}lder space
$C^{0,\alpha}$, we prove almost optimal convergence rates for both single and
ensemble density estimators under $L_1(\mu)$-norm and $L_{\infty}(\mu)$-norm

$C^{1,\alpha}$ consisting of smoother functions, almost optimal convergence
rates can only be established for the ensembles and the lower bound of the
single estimators illustrates the benefits of ensembles over single density
estimators. In the experiments, we first carry out simulations to illustrate
that histogram transform ensembles surpass single histogram transforms, which
offers powerful evidence to support the theoretical results in the space
$C^{1,\alpha}$. Moreover, to further exert the experimental performances, we
propose an adaptive version of HTE and study the parameters by generating
several synthetic datasets with diversities in dimensions and distributions.

$\mathbf{K}$ an adequate category if for any $T_0$ space $X$,
$P_H(\mathbf{K}(X))$ is a $\mathbf{K}$-space. Therefore, if $\mathbf{K}$ is
adequate, then $\mathbf{K}$ is reflective in $\mathbf{Top}_0$. It is shown that
the category of all sober spaces, that of all $d$-spaces, that of all
well-filtered spaces and the Keimel and Lawson's category are all adequate, and
hence are all reflective in $\mathbf{Top}_0$. Some major properties of
$\mathbf{K}$-spaces and $\mathbf{K}$-reflections of $T_0$ spaces are

important implications for relief operations and improving preparedness or
planning for future events. Conventionally, the assessment is done followed by
data collection from post-event surveys, which are economically costly,
suffering low-response rate, time-consuming and usually delayed for months (or
even years) after an event, leading to inefficient and unreliable assessment
and creating obstacles for relief organizations to reach people in need.
Penetration of smartphones and services enabled by them continuously generate
large amount of trajectory data (e.g., Call Records Data, App-based data),
containing trajectories of massive users. These trajectory data are passively
and timely collected and without additional cost and contain information of
travel patterns of the massive number of individuals in a region for a
prolonged time period (e.g., months to years). We propose a framework to
assessing the impacts on travel patterns using these data. Utilizing the
passively collected trajectory data, the proposed framework seeks to capturing
and understanding the full spectrum of travel pattern changes, which helps to
assess who, when and how people in a certain area were impacted. The proposed
framework is applied to a mobile phone trajectory dataset containing about
half-year trajectories of a million anonymous users to assess the impacts of
Hurricane Harvey (the second-costliest hurricane in US history). The results
are validated and show that the proposed framework can provide a comprehensive
assessment of impacts of Harvey on travel patterns, which could guide the
response to and the recovery from the impacts.

with DecreaseKey and Meld interface in assymptotically optimal worst case times
(based on key comparisons). In the paper [2], the ideas were elaborated and it
was shown that the same asymptotical times could be achieved with a strategy
loosing much less information from previous comparisons. There is big overhead
with maintainance of violation lists in these heaps. We propose simple
alternative reducing this overhead. It allows us to implement fast amortized
Fibonacci heaps, where user could call some methods in variants guaranting
worst case time. If he does so, the heaps are not guaranted to be Fibonacci
until an amortized version of a method is called. Of course we could call worst
case versions all the time, but as there is an overhead with the guarantee,
calling amortized versions is prefered choice if we are not concentrated on
complexity of the separate operation.
  We have shown, we could implement full DecreaseKey-Meld interface, but Meld
interface is not natural for these heaps, so if Meld is not needed, much
simpler implementation suffices. As I don't know application requiring Meld, we
would concentrate on noMeld variant, but we will show the changes could be
applied on Meld including variant as well. The papers [1], [2] shown the heaps
could be implemented on pointer machine model. For fast practical
implementations we would rather use arrays. Our goal is to reduce number of
pointer manipulations. Maintainance of ranks by pointers to rank lists would be
unnecessary overhead.

  Neural Network",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated ICD coding, which assigns the International Classification of
Disease codes to patient visits, has attracted much research attention since it
can save time and labor for billing. The previous state-of-the-art model
utilized one convolutional layer to build document representations for
predicting ICD codes. However, the lengths and grammar of text fragments, which
are closely related to ICD coding, vary a lot in different documents.
Therefore, a flat and fixed-length convolutional architecture may not be
capable of learning good document representations. In this paper, we proposed a
Multi-Filter Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MultiResCNN) for ICD
coding. The innovations of our model are two-folds: it utilizes a multi-filter
convolutional layer to capture various text patterns with different lengths and
a residual convolutional layer to enlarge the receptive field. We evaluated the
effectiveness of our model on the widely-used MIMIC dataset. On the full code
set of MIMIC-III, our model outperformed the state-of-the-art model in 4 out of
6 evaluation metrics. On the top-50 code set of MIMIC-III and the full code set

encoder and the language model are entangled that doesn't allow language model
to be trained separately from external text data. To address this problem, in
this work, we propose a new architecture that separates the decoder subnet from
the encoder output. In this way, the decoupled subnet becomes an independently
trainable LM subnet, which can easily be updated using the external text data.
We study two strategies for updating the new architecture. Experimental results
show that, 1) the independent LM architecture benefits from external text data,
achieving 9.3% and 22.8% relative character and word error rate reduction on

their usefulness if we do not understand how they relate to other metrics that
take human cognition into account. Here we investigate the quality of
interpretable computer vision algorithms using techniques from psychophysics.
In crowdsourced annotation tasks we study the impact of different
interpretability approaches on annotation accuracy and task time. In order to
relate these findings to quality measures for interpretability without humans

results demonstrate that psychophysical experiments allow for robust quality

verifying the validity of this information is becoming even more important yet
quite challenging. Rumors spread a large quantity of misinformation on
microblogs. In this study we address two common issues within the context of
microblog social media. First we detect rumors as a type of misinformation
propagation and next we go beyond detection to perform the task of rumor
classification. WE explore the problem using a standard data set. We devise
novel features and study their impact on the task. We experiment with various
levels of preprocessing as a precursor of the classification as well as
grouping of features. We achieve and f-measure of over 0.82 in RDC task in
mixed rumors data set and 84 percent in a single rumor data set using a
two-step classification approach.

the quality of the learning resource's content, it is essential to discover the
most relevant and suitable video in order to support the learning process most
effectively. Video summarization techniques facilitate this goal by providing a
quick overview over the content. It is especially useful for longer recordings
such as conference presentations or lectures. In this paper, we present an
approach that generates a visual summary of video content based on semantic
word embeddings and keyphrase extraction. For this purpose, we exploit video
annotations that are automatically generated by speech recognition and video
OCR (optical character recognition).

generation it not only had a worldwide span, in the area of computer modelling,
for example, its proponents such as John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Warren
McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also came up with models and methods such as
cellular automata and artificial neural networks, which are still the
foundation of most modern modelling approaches. At the same time, cybernetics
also got the attention of philosophers, such as the Frenchman Gilbert Simondon,
who made use of cybernetical concepts in order to establish a metaphysics and a
natural philosophy of individuation, giving cybernetics thereby a philosophical
interpretation, which he baptised allagmatic. In this paper, we emphasise this
allagmatic theory by showing how Simondon's philosophical concepts can be used
to formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems
modelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic
programming. We also present how the developed allagmatic metamodel is capable
of building simple cellular automata and artificial neural networks.
