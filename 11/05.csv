directional similarity is often more effective in tasks such as word similarity
and document clustering, which creates a gap between the training stage and
usage stage of text embedding. To close this gap, we propose a spherical

jointly learned. To learn text embeddings in the spherical space, we develop an
efficient optimization algorithm with convergence guarantee based on Riemannian

polynomial of degree $k$ to the set of matrix polynomials having the elementary
divisor $(\lambda-\lambda_0)^j, \, j \geqslant r,$ for a fixed scalar
$\lambda_0$ and $2 \leqslant r \leqslant kn$ is considered. It is established
that polynomials that are not regular are arbitrarily close to a regular matrix
polynomial with the desired elementary divisor. For regular matrix polynomials
the problem is shown to be equivalent to finding minimal structure preserving
perturbations such that a certain block Toeplitz matrix becomes suitably rank
deficient. This is then used to characterize the distance via two different
optimizations. The first one shows that if $\lambda_0$ is not already an
eigenvalue of the matrix polynomial, then the problem is equivalent to
computing a generalized notion of a structured singular value. The distance is
computed via algorithms like BFGS and Matlab's globalsearch algorithm from the
second optimization. Upper and lower bounds of the distance are also derived
and numerical experiments are performed to compare them with the computed
values of the distance.

stochastic differential equations driven by independent Brownian motions and
indexed by the vertices of a locally finite graph $G = (V,E)$. The drift of the
process at each vertex is influenced by the states of that vertex and its
neighbors, and the diffusion coefficient depends on the state of only that
vertex. Such processes arise in a variety of applications including statistical
physics, neuroscience, engineering and math finance. Under general conditions
on the coefficients, we show that if the initial conditions form a second-order
Markov random field on $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, then at any positive
time, the collection of histories of the processes at different vertices forms
a second-order Markov random field on path space. We also establish a bijection
between (second-order) Gibbs measures on $(\R^d)^V$ (with finite second
moments) and a set of space-time (second-order) Gibbs measures on path space,
corresponding respectively to the initial law and the law of the solution to
the stochastic differential equation. As a corollary, we establish a Gibbs
uniqueness property that shows that for infinite graphs the joint distribution
of the paths is completely determined by the initial condition and the
specifications, namely the family of conditional distributions on finite vertex
sets given the configuration on the complement. Along the way, we establish
various approximation and projection results for Markov random fields on
locally finite graphs that may be of independent interest.

Submitted to Astroparticle Physics",,"10.1016/j.astropartphys.2020.102441",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent observations of cosmic ray protons in the energy range
$10^2$--$10^5$~GeV have revealed that the spectrum cannot be described by a
simple power law. A hardening of the spectrum around an energy of order few
hundred~GeV, first observed by the magnetic spectrometers PAMELA and AMS02, has
now been confirmed by several calorimeter detectors (ATIC, CREAM, CALET,
NUCLEON and DAMPE). These new measurements reach higher energy and indicate
that the hardening corresponds to a larger step in spectral index than what
estimated by the magnetic spectrometers. Data at still higher energy (by CREAM,
NUCLEON and DAMPE) show that the proton spectrum undergoes a marked softening
at $E \approx 10^4$~GeV. Understanding the origin of these unexpected spectral
features is a significant challenge for models of the Galactic cosmic rays. An
important open question is whether additional features are present in the
proton spectrum between the softening and the ""Knee"". Extensive Air Shower
detectors, using unfolding procedures that require the modeling of cosmic ray
showers in the atmosphere, estimated the proton flux below and around the Knee
(at $E \simeq 3$~PeV). These results however have large systematic
uncertainties and are in poor agreement with each other. The measurement in the
PeV energy range, recently presented by IceTop/IceCube, indicates a proton flux
higher than extrapolations of the direct measurements calculated assuming a
constant slope, and therefore requires the existence of an additional spectral
hardening below the Knee. A clarification of this point is very important for
an understanding of the origin of the Galactic cosmic rays, and is also
essential for a precise calculation of the spectra of atmospheric neutrinos in
the energy range ($E \gtrsim 10$~TeV) where they constitute the foreground for
the emerging astrophysical $\nu$ signal.

The repulsion simulates the pressure in a polytropic gas of polytropic index
$3/2$. We take the total angular momentum $L$ to be conserved, but not the

system. The rotational energy is $L^2/(2I)$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia.
Configurations where the energy $E$ has a local minimum are stable. In the

speeds to the model's input parameter list. Furthermore, based on several kinds
of linear and artificial machine learning algorithms, a list of models were
constructed, trained, validated and tested with 42-month MeV electron
observations from Van Allen Probes. Out-of-sample test results from these

combinations, the top performer from each category of models has the similar
capability of making reliable 1-day (2-day) forecasts with Lshell-averaged

precipitating electrons is dominated by linear components. It is also shown
that PreMevE 2.0 can reasonably predict the onsets of MeV electron events in

longstanding space infrastructure (a NOAA satellite in low-Earth-orbit, the
solar wind monitor at the L1 point, and one LANL satellite in geosynchronous

Lov\'{a}sz local lemma in approximate counting. Our main technical contribution
is to use the local lemma to bypass the connectivity barrier in traditional
Markov chain approaches, which makes the well developed MCMC method applicable
on disconnected state spaces such as SAT solutions. The benefit of our approach
is to avoid the enumeration of local structures and obtain fixed polynomial
running times, even if $k=\omega(1)$ or $d=\omega(1)$.

progress in this field, both, in terms of providing enough data for the
training of these models, and, for benchmarking competing algorithms. However,
it is becoming increasingly difficult to generate enough labelled data for

introduce a framework capable of generating photo-realistic videos that have
labelled hand bounding box and fingertip that can help in designing, training,

multiple individuals. In eusocial insect colonies, such multi-body processes
are tightly integrated, involving social communication mechanisms that regulate
the physiology of colony members. As a result, conserved physiological
mechanisms, for example related to pheromone detection and neural signaling
pathways, are deployed in novel contexts and regulate emergent colony traits
during the evolutionary origin and elaboration of social complexity. Here we
review conceptual frameworks for organismal and colony physiology, and
highlight functional genomic, physiological, and behavioral research exploring
how colony-level traits arise from physical and chemical interactions among
nestmates. We highlight mechanistic work exploring how colony traits arise from
physical and chemical interactions among physiologically-specialized nestmates
of various developmental stages. We consider similarities and differences
between organismal and colony physiology, and make specific predictions based
on a decentralized perspective on the function and evolution of colony traits.
Integrated models of colony physiological function will be useful to address
fundamental questions related to the evolution and ecology of collective

as local role densities, are unique to the setting of annotated hypergraphs. We
illustrate our techniques on six digital social networks, and present a

low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) in the SIMBA simulation, with a focus
on the Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux decrement $D_A$. Without jet feedback, we
confirm the Photon Underproduction Crisis (PUC) in which $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ at
$z=0$ must be increased by $\times6$ over the Haardt & Madau value in order to
match the observed $D_{A}$. Turning on jet feedback lowers this discrepancy to
$\sim\times 2.5$, and additionally using the recent Faucher-Gigu\`ere
background mostly resolves the PUC, along with producing a flux probability
distribution function in accord with observations. The PUC becomes apparent at
late epochs ($z \lesssim 1$) where the jet and no-jet simulations diverge; at
higher redshifts SIMBA reproduces the observed $D_{A}$ with no adjustment, with
or without jets. The main impact of jet feedback is to lower the cosmic baryon
fraction in the diffuse IGM from 39% to 16% at $z=0$, while increasing the
warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) baryon fraction from 30% to 70%; the
lowering of the diffuse IGM content directly translates into a lowering of
$D_{A}$ by a similar factor. Comparing to the older MUFASA simulation that
employs different quenching feedback but is otherwise similar to SIMBA, MUFASA
matches $D_{A}$ less well than SIMBA, suggesting that low-redshift measurements
of $D_{A}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ could provide constraints on feedback
mechanisms. Our results suggest that widespread IGM heating at late times is a
plausible solution to the PUC, and that SIMBA's jet AGN feedback model,
included to quench massive galaxies, approximately yields this required
heating.

gap that depends on the twist angle, that can be tuned by an external electric
field. The gap is consistent with TDBG symmetry and its magnitude is related to
surface effects, driving electron transfer from outer to inner layers. The
surface effect competes with an energy upshift of localized states at inner

reduces at low angles. For these low twist angles, the TDBG develops flat

return the value associated with $x$ if $x\in S$, or return $\bot$ if $x\notin

$\log n$ \texttt{Count} sketches or \texttt{CountMin} sketches with a constant
number of columns (i.e., buckets) can be implicitly maintained in
\emph{worst-case} $O(\log^{0.582} n)$ update time using $O(\log n)$ words of
space, on a standard word RAM with word-size $w=\Theta(\log n)$. The exponent
$0.582\approx 2\omega/3-1$, where $\omega$ is the current matrix multiplication
exponent. Due to the numerous applications of linear sketches, our algorithm
improves the update time for many streaming problems in turnstile streams, in
the high success probability setting, without using more space, including
$\ell_2$ norm estimation, $\ell_2$ heavy hitters, point query with $\ell_1$ or
$\ell_2$ error, etc. Our algorithm generalizes, with the same update time and
space, to maintaining $\log n$ linear sketches, where each sketch partitions
the coordinates into $k<\log^{o(1)} n$ buckets using a $c$-wise independent
hash function for constant $c$, and maintains the sum of coordinates for each
bucket. Moreover, if arbitrary word operations are allowed, the update time can
be further improved to $O(\log^{0.187} n)$, where $0.187\approx \omega/2-1$.
Our update algorithm is adaptive, and it circumvents the non-adaptive
cell-probe lower bounds for turnstile streaming algorithms by Larsen, Nelson
and Nguy{\^{e}}n (STOC'15).
  On the other hand, our result also shows that proving unconditional
cell-probe lower bound for the update time seems very difficult, even if the
space is restricted to be (nearly) the optimum. If $\omega=2$, the cell-probe
update time of our algorithm would be $\log^{o(1)} n$. Hence, proving any
higher lower bound would imply $\omega>2$.

generating more labeled data over new instances, while the annotation time only
doubles. However, directly applying them for augmenting model learning
encounters two challenges: (1) NL explanations are unstructured and inherently
compositional, which asks for a modularized model to represent their semantics,
(2) NL explanations often have large numbers of linguistic variants, resulting
in low recall and limited generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a
novel Neural Execution Tree (NExT) framework to augment training data for text

motion of a pulsar which is locked in a binary system causes a frequency shift
(a Doppler shift) in their normally very periodic pulse emissions. These shifts
cause a reduction in the sensitivity of traditional periodicity searches. To
correct this smearing Ransom [2001], Ransom et al. [2002] developed the Fourier

Andersen and Ransom [2018] broadened the Fourier domain acceleration search to

a new family of error detecting subsystem codes whose gauge generators and a

computations - can be implemented using two-body interactions. Logical
operators of the code are used to encode any given computational Hamiltonian,
and the gauge operators are used to construct a penalty Hamiltonian whose
ground subspace is protected against local-errors. In contrast to previous
approaches, the constructed penalty Hamiltonian does not necessarily commute
with the encoded computational Hamiltonians, but for our construction, the
undesirable effect of the penalty Hamiltonian on the computation can be
compensated by a simple modification of the implemented Hamiltonians. We also
investigate whether a similar scheme can be constructed by encoding the
computational Hamiltonian using only bare-logical operators of subsystem codes,
to guarantee that computational Hamiltonian commutes with the penalty
Hamiltonian. We prove a no-go theorem showing that restricting to two-body
interactions and using any general CSS-type subsystem codes, such a
construction cannot encode systems beyond an Ising chain in a transverse field.
We point out that such a chain is universal for Hamiltonian-based quantum

compression method. However, to the best of our knowledge, no works have used a
video-based solution to compress the plenoptic point cloud yet. In this paper,
we first extend the V-PCC to support the plenoptic point cloud compression by
generating multiple attribute videos. Then based on the observation that these

them using multiview high efficiency video coding. We further propose a
block-based padding method that unifies the unoccupied attribute pixels from

experimental K-edge XANES with minimal loss in accuracy (82.1%) due to the use
of data augmentation. A drop-out feature importance analysis highlights the key
roles that the pre-edge and main-peak regions play in coordination environment
identification, with the post-peak region becoming increasingly important at
higher coordination numbers. This work provides a general strategy to identify

individuals follow their friends, the one predetermined leader, or whomever

of multiple individuals moves in a coordinated manner towards a target path.
Each individual uses a specific strategy to follow others (e.g. nearest
neighbors, pre-defined leaders, preferred friends). Given a set of time series
that includes coordinated movement and a set of candidate strategies as inputs,
we provide the first methodology (to the best of our knowledge) to infer
whether each individual uses local-agreement-system or dictatorship-like
strategy to achieve movement coordination at the group level. We evaluate and
demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework by predicting the
direction of movement of an individual in a group in both simulated datasets as

Moreover, since there is no prior methodology for inferring individual-level
strategies, we compare our framework with the state-of-the-art approach for the
task of classification of group-level-coordination models. The results show
that our approach is highly accurate in inferring the correct strategy in

the counterclockwise (CCW) rotation of their flagella bundle and perform
tumbles when at least one of their flagella rotates clockwise (CW), moving away
from the bundle. The flagella are hooked to molecular rotary motors of
nanometric diameter able to make transitions between CCW and CW rotations that
last up to one hundredth of a second. At the same time, flagella move or rotate
the bacteria's body microscopically during lapses that range between a tenth
and ten seconds. We assume that the transitions between CCW and CW rotations
occur solely by fluctuations of CheY-P molarity in the presence of two
threshold values, and that a veto rule selects the run or tumble motions. We
present Langevin eqs for the CheY-P molarity in the vicinity of each molecular
motor. This model allows to obtain the run- or tumble-time distribution as a
linear combination of decreasing exponentials that is a function of the steady
molarity of CheY-P in the neighbourhood of the molecular motor, which fits
experimental data. In turn, if the internal signaling system is unstimulated,
we show that the runtime distributions reach power-law behaviour, a
characteristic of self-organized systems, in some time range and, afterwards,
exponential cutoff. In addition, our model explains without any fitting
parameters the ultrasensitivity of the flagella motors as a function of the
steady state of CheY-P molarity. In addition, we show that the tumble bias for
peritrichous bacterium has a similar sigmoid-shape to the CW bias, although
shifted to lower concentrations when the flagella number increases. Thus, the
increment in the flagella number allows lower operational values for each motor

range of spatial, temporal, and energetic scales. The ubiquitous but relatively
small and weak fields of the so-called quiet Sun are believed today to be
crucial for answering many open questions in solar physics, some of which have
substantial practical relevance due to the strong Sun-Earth connection.
However, such fields are very challenging to detect because they require
spectropolarimetric measurements with high spatial (sub-arcsec), spectral (<100

the devices employed to encode the incoming polarization state into intensity

segmentation models, researchers have extensively investigated
weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. In the current weakly-supervised
segmentation methods, the most widely adopted approach is based on
visualization. However, the visualization results are not generally equal to
semantic segmentation. Therefore, to perform accurate semantic segmentation
under the weakly supervised condition, it is necessary to consider the mapping
functions that convert the visualization results into semantic segmentation.
For such mapping functions, the conditional random field and iterative
re-training using the outputs of a segmentation model are usually used.
However, these methods do not always guarantee improvements in accuracy;
therefore, if we apply these mapping functions iteratively multiple times,
eventually the accuracy will not improve or will decrease.
  In this paper, to make the most of such mapping functions, we assume that the
results of the mapping function include noise, and we improve the accuracy by
removing noise. To achieve our aim, we propose the self-supervised difference
detection module, which estimates noise from the results of the mapping
functions by predicting the difference between the segmentation masks before
and after the mapping. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by
performing experiments on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes 2012 dataset, and we
achieved 64.9\% in the val set and 65.5\% in the test set. Both of the results
become new state-of-the-art under the same setting of weakly supervised

Multiple-Interval Graphs. Subsequent work by Kammer et al. in Approx 2010 also

previously known bound of $t^2$ . We also show that it is NP-hard to obtain an
$o(t)$-approximation in this case. In fact, our results hold for the
intersection graph of a set of t-pseudo-disks which is a much larger class. We
obtain an ${\Omega}(1/t)$-approximation for the maximum weight independent set

thus is of vital importance in the clinical practice. However, prior works
either grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its

soft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading. Such
annotations are costly to obtain, hence it is desirable to develop automatic
grading methods with only image-level supervision. In this paper, we present a
novel cross-disease attention network (CANet) to jointly grade DR and DME by
exploring the internal relationship between the diseases with only image-level

module to selectively learn useful features for individual diseases, and the
disease-dependent attention module to further capture the internal relationship
between the two diseases. We integrate these two attention modules in a deep

simulations (and other applications) because of the long-range nature of the
Coulomb interaction. A standard approach is to decompose the Coulomb potential
into a near part, typically evaluated by direct summation up to a cutoff
radius, and a far part, typically evaluated in Fourier space. In practice, all
decomposition approaches involve approximations---such as cutting off the
near-part direct sum---but it may be possible to find new decompositions with
improved tradeoffs between accuracy and performance. Here we present the
$\textit{u-series}$, a new decomposition of the Coulomb potential that is more
accurate than the standard (Ewald) decomposition for a given amount of
computational effort, and achieves the same accuracy as the Ewald decomposition
with approximately half the computational effort. These improvements, which we
demonstrate numerically using a lipid membrane system, arise because the
$\textit{u}$-series is smooth on the entire real axis and exact up to the
cutoff radius. Additional performance improvements over the Ewald decomposition
may be possible in certain situations because the far part of the
$\textit{u}$-series is a sum of Gaussians, and can thus be evaluated using
algorithms that require a separable convolution kernel; we describe one such
algorithm that reduces communication latency at the expense of communication
bandwidth and computation, a tradeoff that may be advantageous on modern

depends on the shape of the profile, which can be distinguished.

automatically tune their computational complexity by evaluating online certain
predictive statistics which are invariant for a broad class of state-space
models. To be specific, we propose a family of block-adaptive PFs based on the
methodology of Elvira et al (2017). In this class of algorithms, the number of
Monte Carlo samples (known as particles) is adjusted periodically, and we prove
that the theoretical error bounds of the PF actually adapt to the updates in
the number of particles. The evaluation of the predictive statistics that lies
at the core of the methodology is done by generating fictitious observations,
i.e., particles in the observation space. We study, both analytically and
numerically, the impact of the number $K$ of these particles on the performance
of the algorithm. In particular, we prove that if the predictive statistics
with $K$ fictitious observations converged exactly, then the particle
approximation of the filtering distribution would match the first $K$ elements
in a series of moments of the true filter. This result can be understood as a
converse to some convergence theorems for PFs. From this analysis, we deduce an
alternative predictive statistic that can be computed (for some models) without
sampling any fictitious observations at all. Finally, we conduct an extensive
simulation study that illustrates the theoretical results and provides further
insights into the complexity, performance and behavior of the new class of

Hence, an important
issue for such systems is how to acquire the knowledge needed for their
inference. This paper assesses active learning methods for acquiring knowledge
for ""static code warnings"".
  Static code analysis is a widely-used method for detecting bugs and security
vulnerabilities in software systems. As software becomes more complex, analysis
tools also report lists of increasingly complex warnings that developers need
to address on a daily basis. Such static code analysis tools are usually
over-cautious; i.e. they often offer many warnings about spurious issues.
Previous research work shows that about 35% to 91% of warnings reported as bugs
by SA tools are actually unactionable (i.e., warnings that would not be acted
on by developers because they are falsely suggested as bugs).
  Experienced developers know which errors are important and which can be
safely ignored. How can we capture that experience? This paper reports on an
incremental AI tool that watches humans reading false alarm reports. Using an
incremental support vector machine mechanism, this AI tool can quickly learn to
distinguish spurious false alarms from more serious matters that deserve
further attention.
  In this work, nine open-source projects are employed to evaluate our proposed
model on the features extracted by previous researchers and identify the
actionable warnings in a priority order given by our algorithm. We observe that
our model can identify over 90% of actionable warnings when our methods tell
humans to ignore 70 to 80% of the warnings.

characterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the

mitigating behavioral biases in the risk profile communicated by the client. We
argue that the optimal portfolio's Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve

produce large moving groups in the disk. Our analysis also suggests that some
of the moving groups in the Milky Way may have formed due to dynamical

pericentric passages for satellite galaxies and the mass-loading factor for
galactic winds are not free parameters of the chemical evolution model. The
former is determined by the N-body simulation used to construct the merger
trees, the latter by the requirement that GalICS 2.0 should reproduce the

metallicity difference only if quenching is preceded by a burst of star
formation, which contributes to the chemical enrichment of the stellar

variables and their dependencies are carefully chosen where the Metropolis
Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate the
posterior distributions. The model is trained with 85 percent of experimental

different grid services frequencies, and different climates are explored to

that captures the best known polynomial time algorithms for a broad range of
problems including MaxCut, Sparsest Cut, all MaxCSPs and tensor PCA. Despite
being an explicit algorithm with relatively low computational complexity, the
limits of degree-$4$ SoS SDP are not well understood. For example, existing
integrality gaps do not rule out a $(2-\varepsilon)$-algorithm for Vertex Cover
or a $(0.878+\varepsilon)$-algorithm for MaxCut via degree-$4$ SoS SDPs, each
of which would refute the notorious Unique Games Conjecture.
  We exhibit an explicit mapping from solutions for degree-$2$ Sum-of-Squares
SDP (Goemans-Williamson SDP) to solutions for the degree-$4$ Sum-of-Squares SDP
relaxation on boolean variables. By virtue of this mapping, one can lift lower
bounds for degree-$2$ SoS SDP relaxation to corresponding lower bounds for
degree-$4$ SoS SDPs. We use this approach to obtain degree-$4$ SoS SDP lower
bounds for MaxCut on random $d$-regular graphs, Sherington-Kirkpatrick model
from statistical physics and PSD Grothendieck problem.
  Our constructions use the idea of pseudocalibration towards candidate SDP
vectors, while it was previously only used to produce the candidate matrix
which one would show is PSD using much technical work. In addition, we develop
a different technique to bound the spectral norms of _graphical matrices_ that
arise in the context of SoS SDPs. The technique is much simpler and yields
better bounds in many cases than the _trace method_ -- which was the sole
technique for this purpose.

nonparametric statistics. It is therefore desirable to count them more

  This work proposes new algorithms for counting patterns. We show that all

call corner tree formulas. Our approach generalizes the existing methods and

  Using the machinery of corner trees, we find twenty-three independent linear

describe an algorithm that counts one of the remaining 4-patterns, and hence
all 4-patterns, in time ~O(n^(3/2)).

shaping and enables policies to efficiently solve sparse reward tasks. Our
augmented objective does not require any additional reward engineering or

seen within and at the ends of an arch filament system in the core of the AR.
Although type Is (not reported before) resemble IRIS-bombs (in size, and
brightness wrt surroundings), our dot-like events are apparently much hotter,
and shorter in span (70s). We complement the 5-minute-duration Hi-C2.1 data
with SDO/HMI magnetograms, SDO/AIA EUV images, and IRIS UV spectra and slit-jaw
images to examine, at the sites of these events, brightenings and flows in the
transition-region and corona and evolution of magnetic flux in the photosphere.
Most, if not all, of the events are seated at sites of opposite-polarity
magnetic flux convergence (sometimes driven by adjacent flux emergence),
implying likely flux cancellation at the microflare's polarity inversion line.
In the IRIS spectra and images, we find confirming evidence of field-aligned
outflow from brightenings at the ends of loops of the arch filament system. In
types I and II the explosion is confined, while in type III the explosion is
ejective and drives jet-like outflow. The light-curves from Hi-C, AIA and IRIS
peak nearly simultaneously for many of these events and none of the events
display a systematic cooling sequence as seen in typical coronal flares,
suggesting that these tiny brightening-events have
chromospheric/transition-region origin.

explored using numerical simulations, which typically treat the disk

the locally isothermal approximation, in which the disk temperature is a fixed
function of the stellocentric distance. We explore the dynamics of
planet-driven density waves in disks with more general thermodynamics, in which
the temperature is relaxed towards an equilibrium profile on a finite cooling
timescale $t_{\rm c}$. We use both linear perturbation theory and direct
numerical simulations to examine the global structure of density waves launched
by planets in such disks. A key diagnostic used in this study is the behavior
of the wave angular momentum flux (AMF), which directly determines the
evolution of the underlying disk. The AMF of free waves is constant for slowly
cooling (adiabatic) disks, but scales with the disk temperature for rapidly
cooling (and locally isothermal) disks. However, cooling must be extremely
fast, with $\beta = \Omega t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ for the locally
isothermal approximation to provide a good description of density wave dynamics
in the linear regime (relaxing to $\beta \lesssim 10^{-2}$ when nonlinear
effects are important). For intermediate cooling timescales, density waves are
subject to a strong linear damping. This modifies the appearance of
planet-driven spiral arms and the characteristics of axisymmetric structures
produced by massive planets: in disks with $\beta \approx 0.1$ -- $1$, a
near-thermal mass planet opens only a single wide gap around its orbit, in
contrast to the several narrow gaps produced when cooling is either faster or
slower.

only a portion of it can rotate at the orbital period, so the rotation period
at the surface may not match the orbital period. The difference between the
rotation and orbital periods can therefore be used to infer the extent of the
differential rotation. We use a simple parameterization of differential
rotation in stars with convective envelopes in circular orbits to predict the
difference between the surface rotation period and the orbital period.
Comparing this parameterization to observed eclipsing binary systems, we find
that in the surface convection zones of stars in short-period binaries there is
very little radial differential rotation, with $|r\partial_r \ln \Omega| <
0.02$. This holds even for longer orbital periods, though it is harder to say
which systems are synchronized at long periods, and larger differential
rotation is degenerate with asynchronous rotation.

systems (i.e., consistent with intrinsic axis ratios$<0.3$) and systems
including a prominent dispersion-supported bulge. We show that fast rotators
account for more than $80\%$ of the stellar mass budget of nearby galaxies,
confirming that their number density overwhelms that of slow rotators at almost
all masses from $10^{9}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M_\odot}$. Most importantly,
dynamically cold disks contribute to at least $25\%$ of the stellar mass budget

morphology alone. For stellar masses up to $10^{10.5}{\rm M_\odot}$, this class
makes up $>=30\%$ of the galaxy population in each stellar mass bin. The fact
that many galaxies that are visually classified as having two-components have

mode pattern in a carefully selected, representative sample of stars, we find
that slow core rotation rates in the range reported by prior studies are a
general phenomenon and not a selection effect. We show that the core rotation
rates of these stars decline strongly with decreasing surface gravity during
the core He-burning phase. We argue that this is a model-independent indication
of significant rapid angular momentum transport between the cores and envelopes
of these stars. We see a significant range in core rotation rates at all
surface gravities, with little evidence for a convergence towards a uniform
value. We demonstrate using evolutionary models that measured surface rotation
periods are a biased tracer of the true surface rotation distribution, and
argue for using stellar models for interpreting the contrast between core and
surface rotation rates. The core rotation rates we measure do not have a strong
mass or metallicity dependence. We argue that the emerging data strongly favors
a model where angular momentum transport is much more efficient during the core

of interstellar gas given the stochastic nature of stellar enrichment events.
We assume that an enrichment progenitor is formed at every time interval
$\gamma$. For each progenitor, we randomly sample the delay time between its
formation and its enrichment event, based on several delay-time distribution
(DTD) functions that cover a wide range of astrophysical sites. For each set of
$\tau$, $\gamma$, and DTD function, we follow the abundances of SLRs for 15
Gyr, and repeat this process thousands of times to derive their probability
distributions. For $\tau/\gamma\gtrsim2$, the distributions depend on the DTD
function and we provide tabulated values and analytical expressions to quantify
the spread. The relative abundance uncertainty reaches a maximum of $\sim$ 60%
for $\tau/\gamma=1$. For $\tau/\gamma\lesssim1$, we provide the probability for
the SLR abundance to carry the signature of only one enrichment event, which is
greater than 50% when $\tau/\gamma\lesssim0.3$. For
$0.3\lesssim\tau/\gamma\lesssim 2$, a small number of events contributed to the
SLR abundance. This case needs to be investigated with a separate statistical
method. We find that an isolation time for the birth of the Sun of roughly
$9-13$ Myr is consistent with the observed abundances of $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd,
and $^{182}$Hf in the early Solar System, when assuming $\tau/\gamma\sim3$ for

($T_{c}$) for both compounds are modified in the absence of any external laser
field. For YBCO, $T_{c}$ decreases from 92 K to 86 K while for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$,
it increases from 30 K to 45 K at normal pressures. In the latter case, a
simple theoretical framework is provided to understand these results based on
an enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling. This proof-of-principle study
opens a new tool box to not only modify superconducting materials but also to
understand the mechanistic details of different superconductors.

  Solution",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aspect-based sentiment classification (ASC) is an important task in
fine-grained sentiment analysis.~Deep supervised ASC approaches typically model
this task as a pair-wise classification task that takes an aspect and a
sentence containing the aspect and outputs the polarity of the aspect in that
sentence. However, we discovered that many existing approaches fail to learn an
effective ASC classifier but more like a sentence-level sentiment classifier
because they have difficulty to handle sentences with different polarities for
different aspects.~This paper first demonstrates this problem using several
state-of-the-art ASC models. It then proposes a novel and general adaptive
re-weighting (ARW) scheme to adjust the training to dramatically improve ASC
for such complex sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed
framework is effective \footnote{The dataset and code are available at

  1. Finding a ReLU with square-loss $\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$ is as hard as
the problem of learning sparse parities with noise, widely thought to be

  2. There exists an efficient approximation algorithm for finding the

in network science. Community detection aims to partition the network into sets
of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other
dense sets of nodes. Current work on community detection mostly focuses on
static networks. However, many real world networks are dynamic, i.e. their
structure and properties change with time, requiring methods for dynamic
community detection. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic block model
(SBM) for modeling the evolution of community membership. Unlike existing SBMs,
the proposed model allows each community to evolve at a different rate. This
new model is used to derive a maximum a posteriori estimator for community
detection, which can be written as a constrained spectral clustering problem.
In particular, the transition probabilities for each community modify the graph
adjacency matrix at each time point. This formulation provides a relationship
between statistical network inference and spectral clustering for dynamic

Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPD). Reset time in
commonly employed large area SNSPDs,5-10ns,is known to be limited by the
nanowires kinetic inductance.On the other hand, reduction of the kinetic
inductance in small area (waveguide integrated) SNSPDs prevents biasing them
close to the critical current due to latching into a permanent resistive
state.In order to reduce the reset time in SNSPDs, superconducting nanowires
with both low kinetic inductance and fast electron energy relaxation are
required. In this paper, we report on narrow (15-100nm) and long (up to 120
$\mu$m) superconducting $MgB_{2}$ nanowires offering such combination of
properties.In 5 nm-thick $MgB_{2}$ films, grown using Hybrid Physical Chemical
Vapor Deposition, the electron relaxation time was 12ps, the critical
temperature was 32K, and the critical current density was 5x$10^{7}$ A/$cm^{2}$
(at 4.8K). Using microwave reflectometry, we measured a kinetic inductance of
Lk0(4.8K)=1.3-1.6 pH/sqr regardless of the nanowire width, which results in a
magnetic field penetration depth of 90 nm. These values are very close to those
in pristine $MgB_{2}$. For 120 $\mu$m long nanowires the response time was only
100ps, i.e. 1/80 of that in previously reported NbN nanowire photon detectors
of similar dimensions.

Two control laws are considered: the former forces the solution to reach a

the phase variable; the latter forces the phase variable to reach a prescribed

these two techniques experimentally on real datasets and have found that they

since many problems share the physical properties of phase identification
exploited in this paper, the techniques can be applied to a wide range of

ranging from demonstrations of bias in a multitude of applications, curating

exist in context-free word embeddings. Recently, contextual word
representations have outperformed word embeddings in several downstream NLP
tasks. These word representations are conditioned on their context within a
sentence, and can also be used to encode the entire sentence. In this paper, we
analyze the extent to which state-of-the-art models for contextual word
representations, such as BERT and GPT-2, encode biases with respect to gender,
race, and intersectional identities. Towards this, we propose assessing bias at
the contextual word level. This novel approach captures the contextual effects
of bias missing in context-free word embeddings, yet avoids confounding effects
that underestimate bias at the sentence encoding level. We demonstrate evidence
of bias at the corpus level, find varying evidence of bias in embedding
association tests, show in particular that racial bias is strongly encoded in
contextual word models, and observe that bias effects for intersectional
minorities are exacerbated beyond their constituent minority identities.
Further, evaluating bias effects at the contextual word level captures biases
that are not captured at the sentence level, confirming the need for our novel
approach.

numerical way, that the Bessel rings, i.e., the regions of high energy
concentration can trap particles of positive polarizability (atoms in
red-detuned beams). This trapping occurs only in the plane perpendicular to the
wave propagation, and the motion along the beam is unrestricted. When the beam
is superposed with the plane wave of the same frequency propagating in the same
direction, the particles are guided along helices, fixed in space. The shape of
these helices depends on the parameters characterizing the electromagnetic
fields but not on the initial state of guided particles. Depending on the
vorticity of the Bessel beam, these helices can be made left or right-handed.
In the special case of zero vorticity, the helices get degenerated to the true,
three-dimensional rings, which can serve as $3D$ traps. The emerging structure
of potential valleys can be applied to parallel guidance or capture several
independent atoms, each in its own trap.

structure. Due to their very short lifetime, they are often studied through
reactions. Breakup reactions are of particular interest since their cross
sections are large for these loosely-bound nuclei. Inclusive measurements of
breakup--also called knockout reactions--have even higher statistics. In this
proceeding, we study which nuclear-structure information can be inferred from
the parallel-momentum distribution of the core of one-neutron halo nuclei after
the knockout of its halo neutron. In particular, we analyse the influence of
the ground-state wavefunction, the presence of excited states within the
halo-nucleus spectrum and resonances in the core-neutron continuum. Our
analysis shows that such observables are sensitive to the tail of the
ground-state wavefunction. The presence of excited state decreases the breakup
strength, and this flux is transferred to the inelastic-scattering channel.
This indicates a conservation of the flux within each partial wave. We also
show that the parallel-momentum distributions are insensitive to the existence
of resonances within the continuum, they can thus be ignored in practice. This
independence on the continuum argues that the parallel-momentum distributions
are ideal observables to extract very precisely the ANCs of halo nuclei.

rotators is predicted by theory. Of these slow rotators we find none requiring
significant internal strength to resist rotational reshaping. We find our

opportunities at the CERN accelerator complex complementary to collider
experiments. Three new collaborations aim to exploit the M2 beamline in the
North Area with existing high-intensity muon and hadron beams, but also aspire
to go beyond the current M2 capabilities with a RF-separated, high intensity
hadron beam, under study. The AMBER/COMPASS++ collaboration proposes an
ambitious program with a measurement of the proton radius with muon beams, as
well as QCD-related studies from pion PDFs / Drell-Yan to cross section
measurements for dark sector searches. Assuming feasibility of the RF-separated
beam, the spectrum of strange mesons would enter a high precision era while
kaon PDFs as well as nucleon TMDs would be accessible via Drell-Yan reactions.
The NA64mu collaboration proposes to search for dark sector mediators such as a
dark scalar A' or a hypothetical Z_mu using the M2 muon beam and complementing
their on-going A' searches with electron beams. The MuonE collaboration intends
to assess the hadronic component of the vacuum polarization via elastic mu-e
scattering, the dominant uncertainty in the determination of (g-2)_mu. An
overview of the three new experimental programs will be presented together with
implications for the M2 beamline and the experimental area EHN2, based on the
studies of the PBC ""Conventional Beams"" Working Group.

  Power Networks",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing share of renewable generation leads to new challenges in
reliable power system operation, such as the rising volatility of power
generation, which leads to time-varying dynamics and behavior of the system. To
counteract the changing dynamics, we propose to adapt the parameters of
existing controllers to the changing conditions. Doing so, however, is
challenging, as large power systems often involve multiple subsystem operators,
which, for safety and privacy reasons, do not want to exchange detailed
information about their subsystems. Furthermore, centralized tuning of
structured controllers for large-scale systems, such as power networks, is
often computationally very challenging. For this reason, we present a
hierarchical decentralized approach for controller tuning, which increases data
security and scalability. The proposed method is based on the exchange of
structured reduced models of subsystems, which conserves data privacy and
reduces computational complexity. For this purpose, suitable methods for model
reduction and model matching are introduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
increased renewable penetration leads to time-varying dynamics on the IEEE 68
bus power system, which underlines the importance of the problem. Then, we
apply the proposed approach on simulation studies to show its effectiveness. As
shown, a similar system performance as with a centralized method can be
obtained. Finally, we show the scalability of the approach on a large power
system with more than 2500 states and about 1500 controller parameters.

However, it is impractical to find this accurate model with transmission line

brought by instrument transformers and communication errors brought by PMUs.
Therefore, a methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate the actual
transmission lines parameters throughout the whole system and, at the same
time, calibrate the corresponding instrument transformers. A PMU positive
sequence measurement error model is proposed targeting at the aforementioned
errors, which is applicable to both transposed and un-transposed transmission
lines. A single line parameters estimation method is designed based on Least

Breadth-first Search algorithm. The IEEE 118-bus system and the Texas 2000-bus

has been one of the main open questions since the work of Guruswami and Sudan.
It is now known by the work of Rudra and Wootters, using techniques from high
dimensional probability, that over large enough alphabets most RS codes are
indeed list-decodable beyond this radius.
  In this paper we take a more combinatorial approach which allows us to
determine the precise relation (up to the exact constant) between the decoding
radius and the list size. We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given
list size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most RS codes over large
enough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list
sizes $2 \text{ and }3$, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a
rate of at least $1/9$ are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Lastly, we
give the first explicit construction of such RS codes. The main tools used in
the proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that
are contained in a small Hamming ball, and the notion of cycle space from Graph
Theory. Both of them have not been used before in the context of list-decoding.

concurrent objects like sets, key-value maps, and queues. While some
concurrent-object operations are designed to behave atomically, each witnessing
the atomic effects of predecessors in a linearization order, others forego such
strong consistency to avoid complex control and synchronization bottlenecks.
For example, contains (value) methods of key-value maps may iterate through
key-value entries without blocking concurrent updates, to avoid unwanted
performance bottlenecks, and consequently overlook the effects of some
linearization-order predecessors. While such weakly-consistent operations may
not be atomic, they still offer guarantees, e.g., only observing values that
have been present.
  In this work we develop a methodology for proving that concurrent object
implementations adhere to weak-consistency specifications. In particular, we
consider (forward) simulation-based proofs of implementations against
relaxed-visibility specifications, which allow designated operations to
overlook some of their linearization-order predecessors, i.e., behaving as if
they never occurred. Besides annotating implementation code to identify
linearization points, i.e., points at which operations' logical effects occur,
we also annotate code to identify visible operations, i.e., operations whose
effects are observed; in practice this annotation can be done automatically by
tracking the writers to each accessed memory location. We formalize our
methodology over a general notion of transition systems, agnostic to any
particular programming language or memory model, and demonstrate its
application, using automated theorem provers, by verifying models of Java

assimilation methods applied to nonlinear state-space models. However, these
covariances are largely unknown in most of the applications. A misspecification
of the model error covariance has a strong impact on the computation of the
posterior probability density function, leading to unreliable estimations and
even to a total failure of the assimilation procedure. In this work, we propose
the combination of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM) with an
efficient particle filter to estimate the model error covariance, using a batch
of observations. Based on the EM algorithm principles, the proposed method
encompasses two stages: the expectation stage, in which a particle filter is
used with the present estimate of the model error covariance as given to find
the probability density function that maximizes the likelihood, followed by a
maximization stage in which the expectation under the probability density
function found in the expectation step is maximized as a function of the
elements of the model error covariance. This novel algorithm here presented
combines the EM with a fixed point algorithm and does not require a particle
smoother to approximate the posterior densities. We demonstrate that the new
method accurately and efficiently solves the linear model problem. Furthermore,
for the chaotic nonlinear Lorenz-96 model the method is stable even for
observation error covariance 10 times larger than the estimated model error
covariance matrix, and also that it is successful in high-dimensional
situations where the dimension of the estimated matrix is 1600.

symmetry (TRS) broken Majorana chains. The tricriticality separates
topologically ordered, symmetry protected topological (SPT), and trivial phases
of the system. Here we demonstrate that the breaking of the TRS manifests
itself in an emergence of a new dimensionless scale, $g = \alpha(\xi) B
\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the system size, $B$ is a generic TRS breaking field,
and $\alpha(\xi)$, with $\alpha(0)\equiv 1$, is a model-dependent function of
the localization length, $\xi$, of boundary Majorana zero modes at the
tricriticality. This scale determines the scaling of the finite size
corrections around the tricriticality, which are shown to be {\it universal},
and independent of the nature of the breaking of the TRS. We show that the
single variable scaling function, $f(w)$, $w\propto m N$, where $m$ is the
excitation gap, that defines finite-size corrections to the ground state energy
of the system around topological phase transition at $B=0$, becomes
double-scaling, $f=f(w,g)$, at finite $B$. We realize TRS breaking through
three different methods with completely different lattice details and find the
same universal behavior of $f(w,g)$. In the critical regime, $m=0$, the
function $f(0,g)$ is nonmonotonic, and reproduces the Ising conformal field
theory scaling only in limits $g=0$ and $g\rightarrow \infty$. The obtained
result sets a scale of $N \gg 1/(\alpha B)^2$ for the system to reach the
thermodynamic limit in the presence of the TRS breaking. We derive the
effective low-energy theory describing the tricriticality and analytically find
the asymptotic behavior of the finite-size scaling function. Our results show
that the boundary entropy around the tricriticality is also a universal

white paper written by members of the Canadian community for the 2020 Long
Range Plan panel, which will be making recommendations on Canada's future
directions in astronomy. Since Canadians have been historically major users of
the VLA and have been valued partners with NRAO for ALMA, Canada's
participation in ngVLA is welcome. Canadians have been actually involved in
ngVLA discussions for the past five years, and have played leadership roles in
the ngVLA Science and Technical Advisory Councils. Canadian technologies are
also very attractive for the ngVLA, in particular our designs for radio
antennas, receivers, correlates, and data archives, and our industrial
capacities to realize them. Indeed, the Canadian designs for the ngVLA antennas
and correlator/beamformer are presently the baseline models for the project.
Given the size of Canada's radio community and earlier use of the VLA (and
ALMA), we recommend Canadian participation in the ngVLA at the 7% level. Such
participation would be significant enough to allow Canadian leadership in
gVLA's construction and usage. Canada's participation in ngVLA should not
preclude its participation in SKA; access to both facilities is necessary to
meet Canada's radio astronomy needs. Indeed, ngVLA will fill the gap between
those radio frequencies observable with the SKA and ALMA at high sensitivities
and resolutions. Canada's partnership in ngVLA will give it access to
cutting-edge facilities together covering approximately three orders of
magnitude in frequency.

Taken
literally, it refers to a type of dense accumulation of wood in rivers widely
recognized as bestowing numerous biological and physical benefits to the system
but also present serious hazards to infrastructure. Despite this, no in-situ
field measurements have assessed the degree of arrest in a naturally-formed
logjam. Using time-lapse photography, repeat total station surveys and water
level loggers, we provide an unprecedented perspective on the evolution of a
logjam in central Idaho. Despite the namesake, we find that the logjam is not
jammed. The ensemble of logs progressively deforms in response to shear and
buoyant lift of flowing water, modulated by the rising limb, peak and falling
limb of the snowmelt hydrograph. As water rises and log drag against the bed
and banks decreases, they collectively translate downstream, generating a
heterogeneous pattern of deformation. As streamflow recedes and the logs
reconnect with the bed and banks, the coherent deformation pattern degrades as
logs settle opportunistically amongst their neighbors. Field observations of
continuous movement at a low rate are qualitatively similar to creep and
clogging, behaviors that are common to a wide class of disordered materials.
These similarities open the possibility to inform future studies of
environmental clogging, wood-laden flows, logjams, hazard mitigation and the
design of engineered logjams by bridging these practices with frontier research
efforts in soft matter physics and granular rheology.

identified by closed contours of the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation
obtained from Lagrangian particles advected by the flow. A series of flow
regimes with different bottom friction strengths are considered---it is found
that coherent eddies become more prevalent and longer-lasting as the strength
of the bottom drag increases. These coherent eddies, with average core radius
close to the deformation radius, propagate zonally with speeds close to the
long baroclinic Rossby wave speed and meridionally with a preference for
cyclones to propagate poleward and anticyclones to propagate equatorward. The
meridional propagation preference of the coherent eddies gives rise to a
systematic upgradient potential vorticity (PV) transport, which is in the
opposite direction as the background PV transport and not captured by standard
Lagrangian diffusivity estimates. The upgradient PV transport by coherent eddy
cores is less than 10% of the total PV transport, but the PV transport by the
periphery flow induced by the PV inside coherent eddies is significant and
downgradient. This clarifies the distinct roles of the trapping and stirring

improvements in the performance of robotic systems like autonomous vehicles and
surgical robots. These perception systems, however, are hard to analyze and
errors in them can propagate to cause catastrophic failures. In this paper, we
consider the problem of synthesizing safe and robust controllers for robotic
systems which rely on complex perception modules for feedback. We propose a
counterexample-guided synthesis framework that iteratively builds simple
surrogate models of the complex perception module and enables us to find safe
control policies. The framework uses a falsifier to find counterexamples, or
traces of the systems that violate a safety property, to extract information
that enables efficient modeling of the perception modules and errors in it.
These models are then used to synthesize controllers that are robust to errors
in perception. If the resulting policy is not safe, we gather new
counterexamples. By repeating the process, we eventually find a controller
which can keep the system safe even when there is a perception failure. We
demonstrate our framework on two scenarios in simulation, namely lane keeping
and automatic braking, and show that it generates controllers that are safe, as
well as a simpler model of a deep neural network-based perception system that
can provide meaningful insight into operations of the perception system.

effects of disk self-gravity and radiative cooling on the formation of gaps and
spirals. (1) With disk self-gravity included, we find stronger, more
tightly-wound spirals and deeper gaps in more massive disks. The deeper gaps
are due to the larger Angular Momentum Flux (AMF) of the waves excited in more
massive disks, as expected from the linear theory. The position of the
secondary gap does not change, provided that the disk is not extremely massive
($Q \gtrsim 2$). (2) With radiative cooling included, the excited spirals
become monotonically more open (less tightly-wound) as the disk's cooling
timescale increases. On the other hand, the amplitude and strength of the
spirals decrease when the cooling time increases from a small value to $\sim
1/\Omega$, but then the amplitude starts to increase again when the cooling
time continues to increase. This indicates that radiative dissipation becomes
important for waves with $T_{cool}\sim$ 1. Consequently, the induced primary
gap is narrower and the secondary gap becomes significantly shallower when the
cooling time becomes $\sim 1/\Omega$. When the secondary gap is present, the
position of it moves to the inner disk from the fast cooling cases to the slow
cooling cases. The dependence of gap properties on the cooling timescale (e.g.
in AS 209) provides a new way to constrain the disk optical depth and thus disk
surface density.

approximated eigenfunctions are analyzed. Within this framework, two classes of
graphons with simple spectral representations are given. Applications to
graphon-based control analysis are next presented; in particular, the
controllability of systems distributed over very large networks is expressed in
terms of the properties of the corresponding graphon dynamical systems.
Moreover, spectral analysis based upon real-world network data is presented,
which demonstrates that low-dimensional spectral approximations of networks are
possible. Finally, an initial, exploratory investigation of the utility of the
spectral analysis methodology in graphon systems control to study the control
of epidemic spread is presented.

design and analysis of a wide variety of autonomous and cyber-physical systems

one has to maximize certain probabilistic objective functions overall choices
of initial states and parameters. In this paper, we identify the assumptions
that make it possible to view this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem.
Based on this fresh perspective, we propose an algorithm (HOO-MB) for solving
the problem that carefully instantiates an existing bandit algorithm --
Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization -- with appropriate parameters. As a
consequence, we obtain theoretical regret bounds on sample efficiency of our
solution that depends on key problem parameters like smoothness,
near-optimality dimension, and batch size. The batch size parameter enables us
to strike a balance between the sample efficiency and the memory usage of the
algorithm. Our experiments, using the tool HooVer, suggest that the approach
scales to realistic-sized problems and is often more sample-efficient compared
to PlasmaLab -- a leading tool for verification of stochastic systems.
Specifically, HooVer has distinct advantages in analyzing models in which the
objective function has sharp slopes. In addition, HooVer shows promising
behavior in parameter synthesis for a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) example.

artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we
need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables
comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the
past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and
measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize
and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making
apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly
guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still
gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited
by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We
argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring
intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to
""buy"" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's
own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of
intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence
as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope,
generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we
propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like.
Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors
designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC
can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that
it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.

of Gaia had revealed the Fimbulthul stellar stream in the halo of the Milky
Way. It had been proposed that the stream is associated with the $\omega$
Centauri, but this proposition relied exclusively upon the kinematics and
metallicities of the stars to make the association. In this work, we find our
two new members of the stream to be metal-poor stars that are enhanced in
sodium and aluminium, typical of second population globular cluster stars, but
not otherwise seen in field stars. Furthermore, the stars share the s-process
abundance pattern seen in $\omega$ Centauri, which is rare in field stars.
Apart from one star within 1.5 deg of $\omega$ Centauri, we find no other stars
observed by GALAH spatially near $\omega$ Centauri or the Fimbulthul stream

tagging stars in the Fimbulthul stream to $\omega$ Centauri confirms the

model of radio to X-ray afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). GeV
gamma-ray emission detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the
duration of which extends beyond the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, is also
compatible with broad features of afterglow emission. We revisit the
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model from a decelerating blastwave to
fit multiwavelength data from three bright GRBs, namely GRB~190114C,
GRB~130427A and GRB~090510. We constrain the afterglow model parameters using
the simultaneous fit of the spectral energy distributions at different times
and light curves at different frequencies for these bursts. We find that a
constant density interstellar medium is favored for the short GRB~090510, while
a wind-type environment is favored for the long GRB~130427A and GRB~190114C.
The sub-TeV component in GRB~190114C detected by MAGIC is the SSC emission in
our modelling. Furthermore we find that the SSC emission in the Thomson regime
is adequate to fit the spectra and light curves of GRB~190114C. For the other
two GRBs, lacking sub-TeV detection, the SSC emissions are also modeled in the
Thomson regime. For the model parameters we have used, the $\gamma\gamma$
attenuation in the blastwave is negligible in the sub-TeV range compared to the
redshift-dependent $\gamma\gamma$ attenuation in the extragalactic background
light.

peak-to average power ratio (PAPR) problem is still cumbersome. In this paper,
based on the iterative clipping and filtering (ICF) and optimization methods,
we investigate the PAPR reduction in the mixed-numerology systems. We first
illustrate that the direct extension of classical ICF brings about the
accumulation of inter-numerology interference (INI) due to the repeated
execution. By exploiting the clipping noise rather than the clipped signal, the
noise-shaped ICF (NS-ICF) method is then proposed without increasing the INI.
Next, we address the in-band distortion minimization problem subject to the
PAPR constraint. By reformulation, the resulting model is separable in both the
objective function and the constraints, and well suited for the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. The ADMM-based algorithms are
then developed to split the original problem into several subproblems which can
be easily solved with closed-form solutions. Furthermore, the applications of
the proposed PAPR reduction methods combined with filtering and windowing
techniques are also shown to be effective.

generalizes the Chern-Simons gravity by including the higher derivatives of the

The degree of circular polarization of PGWs is suppressed by the energy scale
of parity violation in gravity, which is hardly detected on the basis solely of
two-point statistics from future cosmic microwave background data.

Generalized mutual information (GMI) has been shown to be successful at
benchmarking the bit-error rate (BER) after FEC decoding (post-FEC BER) for
systems with soft-decision (SD) FEC without probabilistic shaping (PS).
However, GMI is not relevant to benchmark post-FEC BER for systems with SD-FEC
and PS. For such systems, normalized GMI (NGMI), asymmetric information (ASI),
and achievable FEC rate have been proposed instead. They are good at
benchmarking post-FEC BER or to give an FEC limit in bit-interleaved coded

far. In this paper, we define generalized L-values under mismatched decoding,
which are connected to the GMI and ASI. We then show that NGMI, ASI, and
achievable FEC rate are theoretically equal under matched decoding but not
under mismatched decoding. We also examine BER before FEC decoding (pre-FEC
BER) and ASI over Gaussian and nonlinear fiber-optic channels with
approximately matched decoding. ASI always shows better correlation with
post-FEC BER than pre-FEC BER for BICM with PS. On the other hand, post-FEC BER
can differ at a given ASI when we change the bit mapping, which describes how
each bit in a codeword is assigned to a bit tributary.

object gradually brightened within the long cycle before the next brightening

the increasing disk mass during the long cycle predicted by a model of

that are qualitatively different. These provide the first example of non-local
games that self-test non-Pauli operators resolving an open questions posed by
Coladangelo and Stark (QIP 2017). Our games also provide a self-test for states
other than the maximally entangled state, and hence resolves the open question
posed by Cleve and Mittal (ICALP 2012). Additionally, our games have 1 bit

complexity theoretic application. This work is the first step towards a general
theory of self-testing arbitrary groups. In order to obtain our results, we
exploit connections between sum of squares proofs, non-commutative ring theory,

part of our analysis is to introduce a sum of squares framework that
generalizes the \emph{solution group} of Cleve, Liu, and Slofstra (Journal of

  Machine Translation",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generally, Neural Machine Translation models generate target words in a
left-to-right (L2R) manner and fail to exploit any future (right) semantics
information, which usually produces an unbalanced translation. Recent works
attempt to utilize the right-to-left (R2L) decoder in bidirectional decoding to
alleviate this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic
\textbf{I}nteraction \textbf{M}odule (\textbf{DIM}) to dynamically exploit
target semantics from R2L translation for enhancing the L2R translation
quality. Different from other bidirectional decoding approaches, DIM firstly
extracts helpful target information through addressing and reading operations,
then updates target semantics for tracking the interactive history.
Additionally, we further introduce an \textbf{agreement regularization} term
into the training objective to narrow the gap between L2R and R2L translations.
Experimental results on NIST Chinese$\Rightarrow$English and WMT'16
English$\Rightarrow$Romanian translation tasks show that our system achieves
significant improvements over baseline systems, which also reaches comparable
results compared to the state-of-the-art Transformer model with much fewer

physics graduate students using tasks minimally adapted from the mathematics

Preliminary findings suggest physics experts approach covariational reasoning
problems significantly differently than mathematics experts. In particular, two
behaviors are identified in the reasoning of expert physicists that were not
seen in the mathematics study. We introduce these two behaviors, which we call
Using Compiled Relationships and Neighborhood Analysis, and articulate their
differences from the behaviors articulated by Hobson and Moore. Finally, we
share implications for instruction and questions for further research.

In addition to impersonation, ASV systems are vulnerable to replay, speech

to consider all three spoofing attack types within a single challenge. While
they originate from the same source database and same underlying protocol, they
are explored in two specific use case scenarios. Spoofing attacks within a
logical access (LA) scenario are generated with the latest speech synthesis and
voice conversion technologies, including state-of-the-art neural acoustic and

reflects the impact of spoofing and countermeasures on the reliability of a

Correspondingly, the radial profile of the mass inflow rate decreases with
decreasing radii as $ \dot{M}_\mathrm{in} \propto r $. Inflow-outflow structure
has been found in our solution. In the region $ \theta > 65^{\circ} $ there
exist inflow while above that flow moves outward and outflow could launch. The
driving forces of the outflow are analyzed and found that the radiation force
is dominant and push the gas particles outwards with poloidal velocity $ \sim
0.25 c $. The properties of outflow are also studied. The results show that the
mass flux weighted angular momentum of the inflow is lower than that of
outflow, thus the angular momentum of the flow can be transported by the
outflow. We also analyze the convective stability of the supercritical disk and
find that in the absence of the magnetic field, the flow is convectively
unstable. Our analytical results are fully consistent with the previous

Linear Unit (ReLU) Neural Network (NN) architecture that is sufficient to
implement the optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for an LTI system

Assured ReLU Architectures. AReN takes as input an LTI system with quadratic
cost specification, and outputs a ReLU NN architecture with the assurance that
there exist network weights that exactly implement the associated MPC
controller. AReN thus offers new insight into the design of ReLU NN
architectures for the control of LTI systems: instead of training a
heuristically chosen NN architecture on data -- or iterating over many
architectures until a suitable one is found -- AReN can suggest an adequate NN
architecture before training begins. While several previous works were inspired
by the fact that both ReLU NN controllers and optimal MPC controller are both
Continuous, Piecewise-Linear (CPWL) functions, exploiting this similarity to
design NN architectures with correctness guarantees has remained elusive. AReN
achieves this using two novel features. First, we reinterpret a recent result
about the implementation of CPWL functions via ReLU NNs to show that a CPWL
function may be implemented by a ReLU architecture that is determined by the
number of distinct affine regions in the function. Second, we show that we can
efficiently over-approximate the number of affine regions in the optimal MPC
controller without solving the MPC problem exactly. Together, these results
connect the MPC problem to a ReLU NN implementation without explicitly solving
the MPC and directly translates this feature to a ReLU NN architecture that
comes with the assurance that it can implement the MPC controller. We show
through numerical results the effectiveness of AReN in designing an NN

Monte-Carlo method, together with the deep neural network, is used to overcome
the curse of dimensionality, while classical methods fail. Often, a deep neural
network outperforms classical numerical methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose to use quasi-Monte Carlo sampling,
instead of Monte-Carlo method to approximate the loss function. To demonstrate
the idea, we conduct numerical experiments in the framework of deep Ritz method

observed that quasi-Monte Carlo sampling reduces the size of training data set

assumptions, we prove that quasi-Monte Carlo sampling together with the deep
neural network generates a convergent series with rate proportional to the
approximation accuracy of quasi-Monte Carlo method for numerical integration.
Numerically the fitted convergence rate is a bit smaller, but the proposed
approach always outperforms Monte Carlo method. It is worth mentioning that the
convergence analysis is generic whenever a loss function is approximated by the

  transform of spectral line profiles","11 figures and 1 table (along with electronic data tables); accepted
  for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/psz129",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that stellar differential rotation can be detected by analyzing
the Fourier transform of spectral line profiles, since the ratio of the 1st-
and 2nd-zero frequencies is a useful indicator. This approach essentially
relies on the conventional formulation that the observed flux profile is
expressible as a convolution of the rotational broadning function and the
intrinsic profile, which implicitly assumes that the local intensity profile
does not change over disk. Although this postulation is unrealistic in the
strict sense, how the result is affected by this approximation is still
unclear. In order to examine this problem, profiles of several lines (showing
different center-limb variations) were simulated using a model atmosphere
corresponding to a mid-F dwarf by integrating intensity profiles for various
combinations of vsini (rot. velocity), alpha (diff. degree), and i (inc.
angle), and their Fourier transforms were computed to check whether zeros are
detected at the predicted positions or not. For this comparison purpose, a
large grid of standard rotational broadening functions and their
transforms/zeros were also calculated. It turned out that the situation
criticaly depends on vsini: In case of vsini>~20km/s where rotational
broadening is predominant over other line broadening velocities (typically
several km/s), the 1st/2nd zeros of the transform are confirmed almost at the
expected positions. In contrast, deviations begin to appear as vsini is
lowered, and the zero features of the transform are totally different from the
expectation at vsini as low as ~10km/s, which means that the classical
formulation is no more valid. Accordingly, while the zero-frequency approach is
safely applicable to studying differential rotation in the former broader-line
case, it would be difficult to practice for the latter sharp-line case.

  Sentiment Analysis","This paper is accepted in AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Target-based sentiment analysis or aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)
refers to addressing various sentiment analysis tasks at a fine-grained level,
which includes but is not limited to aspect extraction, aspect sentiment
classification, and opinion extraction. There exist many solvers of the above
individual subtasks or a combination of two subtasks, and they can work
together to tell a complete story, i.e. the discussed aspect, the sentiment on
it, and the cause of the sentiment. However, no previous ABSA research tried to
provide a complete solution in one shot. In this paper, we introduce a new
subtask under ABSA, named aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE).
Particularly, a solver of this task needs to extract triplets (What, How, Why)
from the inputs, which show WHAT the targeted aspects are, HOW their sentiment
polarities are and WHY they have such polarities (i.e. opinion reasons). For
instance, one triplet from ""Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is simply
average"" could be ('Waiters', positive, 'friendly'). We propose a two-stage
framework to address this task. The first stage predicts what, how and why in a
unified model, and then the second stage pairs up the predicted what (how) and
why from the first stage to output triplets. In the experiments, our framework
has set a benchmark performance in this novel triplet extraction task.
Meanwhile, it outperforms a few strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art
related methods.

condition from the recent $\theta$-group collaboration [Phys. Fluids. 29 (2017)

are resolved by the finest grid for the entire duration of the simulation, and
that both integral and spectral quantities of interest are converged.
Comparisons are made with implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) results from
the $\theta$-group collaboration, generated using the same numerical algorithm.
The total amount of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is shown to be decreased in
the DNS compared to the ILES, particularly in the transverse directions, giving
rise to a greater level of anisotropy in the flow (70\% vs. 40\% more TKE in
the shock parallel direction at the latest time considered). This decrease in
transfer of TKE to the transverse components is shown to be due to the viscous
suppression of secondary instabilities. Overall the agreement in the large
scales between the DNS and ILES is very good and hence the mixing width and
growth rate exponent $\theta$ are very similar. There are substantial
differences in the small scale behaviour however, with a 38\% difference
observed in the minimum values obtained for the mixing fractions $\Theta$ and
$\Xi$. Differences in the late time decay of TKE are also observed, with decay
rates calculated to be $\tau^{-1.41}$ and $\tau^{-1.25}$ for the DNS and ILES
respectively.

interaction along with an instantaneous Heisenberg exchange. The resultant
damped spin precession yields exceptional points (EPs) in the coupled spin
dynamics, which should be experimentally accessible with the existing magnetic
heterostructures. In particular, we show that an EP is naturally approached in
an antiferromagnetic dimer by controlling local damping, while the same is
achieved by tuning the dissipative coupling between spins in the ferromagnetic
case. Extending our treatment to one-dimensional spin chains, we show how EPs
can emerge within the magnonic Brillouin zone by tuning the dissipative
properties. The critical point, at which an EP pair emerges out of the
Brillouin zone center, realizes a gapless Weyl point in the magnon spectrum.
Tuning damping beyond this critical point produces synchronization (level
attraction) of magnon modes over a finite range of momenta, both in ferro- and
antiferromagnetic cases. We thus establish that damped magnons can generically
yield singular points in their band structure, close to which their kinematic
properties, such as group velocity, become extremely sensitive to the control
parameters.

facilitate many important downstream NLP tasks. To instantiate the game, we
create a game environment and a competition platform. Comprehensive experiments

promising and interesting results. Based on the analysis on the game and

\textit{ranked} gene tree topologies under the multispecies coalescent are
considered. A ranked tree depicts not only the topological relationship among
gene lineages, as an unranked tree does, but also the sequence in which the
lineages coalesce. In this article, we study how the parameters of a species
tree simulated under a constant rate birth-death process can affect the
probability that the species tree lies in the anomaly zone. We find that with
more than five taxa, it is possible for species trees have both AGTs and ARGTs.
The probability of being in either type of anomaly zones increases with more
taxa. The probability of AGTs also increases with higher speciation rates. We
observe that the probabilities of unranked anomaly zones are higher and grow
much faster than those of ranked anomaly zones as the speciation rate
increases. Our simulation shows that the most probable ranked gene tree is
likely to have the same unranked topology as the species tree. We design the
software {\it PRANC} which computes probabilities of ranked gene tree

celebrated randomized near-linear-time min-cut algorithm [STOC'96]. We present
a new approach for this problem which can be easily implemented in many
settings, leading to the following randomized min-cut algorithms for weighted
graphs.
  * An $O(m\frac{\log^2 n}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$-time sequential algorithm:
This improves Karger's $O(m \log^3 n)$ and $O(m\frac{(\log^2 n)\log
(n^2/m)}{\log\log n} + n\log^6 n)$ bounds when the input graph is not extremely
sparse or dense. Improvements over Karger's bounds were previously known only
under a rather strong assumption that the input graph is simple [Henzinger et
al. SODA'17; Ghaffari et al. SODA'20]. For unweighted graphs with parallel
edges, our bound can be improved to $O(m\frac{\log^{1.5} n}{\log\log n} +
n\log^6 n)$.
  * An algorithm requiring $\tilde O(n)$ cut queries to compute the min-cut of
a weighted graph: This answers an open problem by Rubinstein et al. ITCS'18,
who obtained a similar bound for simple graphs.
  * A streaming algorithm that requires $\tilde O(n)$ space and $O(\log n)$
passes to compute the min-cut: The only previous non-trivial exact min-cut
algorithm in this setting is the 2-pass $\tilde O(n)$-space algorithm on simple
graphs [Rubinstein et al., ITCS'18] (observed by Assadi et al. STOC'19).
  In contrast to Karger's 2-respecting min-cut algorithm which deploys
sophisticated dynamic programming techniques, our approach exploits some cute
structural properties so that it only needs to compute the values of $\tilde
O(n)$ cuts corresponding to removing $\tilde O(n)$ pairs of tree edges, an
operation that can be done quickly in many settings.

a process of detecting data points in which their patterns deviate
significantly from others. It is common to have outliers in industry
applications, which could be generated by different causes such as human error,
fraudulent activities, or system failure. Recently, density-based methods have
shown promising results, particularly among which Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is
arguably dominating. However, one of the major drawbacks of LOF is that it is
computationally expensive. Motivated by the mentioned problem, this research
presents a novel pruning-based procedure in which the execution time of LOF is
reduced while the performance is maintained. A novel Prune-based Local Outlier
Factor (PLOF) approach is proposed, in which prior to employing LOF,
outlierness of each data instance is measured. Next, based on a threshold, data
instances that require further investigation are separated and LOF score is
only computed for these points. Extensive experiments have been conducted and
results are promising. Comparison experiments with the original LOF and two
state-of-the-art variants of LOF have shown that PLOF produces higher accuracy
and precision while reducing execution time.

multiple labels simultaneously. As a representative method, Ranking Support
Vector Machine (Rank-SVM) aims to minimize the Ranking Loss and can also
mitigate the negative influence of the class-imbalance issue. However, due to
its stacking-style way for thresholding, it may suffer error accumulation and
thus reduces the final classification performance. Binary Relevance (BR) is
another typical method, which aims to minimize the Hamming Loss and only needs
one-step learning. Nevertheless, it might have the class-imbalance issue and
does not take into account label correlations. To address the above issues, we
propose a novel multi-label classification model, which joints Ranking support
vector machine and Binary Relevance with robust Low-rank learning (RBRL). RBRL
inherits the ranking loss minimization advantages of Rank-SVM, and thus
overcomes the disadvantages of BR suffering the class-imbalance issue and
ignoring the label correlations. Meanwhile, it utilizes the hamming loss
minimization and one-step learning advantages of BR, and thus tackles the
disadvantages of Rank-SVM including another thresholding learning step.
Besides, a low-rank constraint is utilized to further exploit high-order label
correlations under the assumption of low dimensional label space. Furthermore,
to achieve nonlinear multi-label classifiers, we derive the kernelization RBRL.
Two accelerated proximal gradient methods (APG) are used to solve the
optimization problems efficiently. Extensive comparative experiments with
several state-of-the-art methods illustrate a highly competitive or superior

fusion of global context and local context according to different per-pixel

measured by the similarity between the global feature and its local feature,
whose reverse value can be used to measure the local context demand. We model
the two demand measurements by the proposed global context module and local
context module, respectively, to generate adaptive contextual features.
Furthermore, we import multiple such modules to build several adaptive context
blocks in different levels of network to obtain a coarse-to-fine result.
Finally, comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed ACNet, and new state-of-the-arts performances are achieved on

the modularity and the number of clusters are combined in a fitness function to
find the optimal structure enhancement scheme; the other is called robust
community detection via similarity ensemble (RobustECD-SE), integrating
multiple information of community structures captured by various vertex

Still, many

This need has pushed for generic solutions and specific concurrent data
structures.
  Wait-free universal constructs are attractive as they can turn a sequential
implementation of any object into an equivalent, yet concurrent and wait-free,
implementation. While highly relevant from a research perspective, these
techniques are of limited practical use when the underlying object or data
structure is sizable. The copy operation can consume much of the CPU's
resources and significantly degrade performance.
  To overcome this limitation, we have designed CX, a multi-instance-based
wait-free universal construct that substantially reduces the amount of copy
operations. The construct maintains a bounded number of instances of the object
that can potentially be brought up to date. We applied CX to several sequential
implementations of data structures, including STL implementations, and compared
them with existing wait-free constructs. Our evaluation shows that CX performs
significantly better in most experiments, and can even rival with hand-written
lock-free and wait-free data structures, simultaneously providing wait-free

Extraction that aims to identify terms and their corresponding definitions in
unstructured texts. This task can be formalized either as a sentence
classification task (i.e., containing term-definition pairs or not) or a
sequential labeling task (i.e., identifying the boundaries of the terms and
definitions). The previous works for DE have only focused on one of the two
approaches, failing to model the inter-dependencies between the two tasks. In
this work, we propose a novel model for DE that simultaneously performs the two
tasks in a single framework to benefit from their inter-dependencies. Our model
features deep learning architectures to exploit the global structures of the
input sentences as well as the semantic consistencies between the terms and the
definitions, thereby improving the quality of the representation vectors for
DE. Besides the joint inference between sentence classification and sequential
labeling, the proposed model is fundamentally different from the prior work for
DE in that the prior work has only employed the local structures of the input
sentences (i.e., word-to-word relations), and not yet considered the semantic
consistencies between terms and definitions. In order to implement these novel
ideas, our model presents a multi-task learning framework that employs graph
convolutional neural networks and predicts the dependency paths between the
terms and the definitions. We also seek to enforce the consistency between the
representations of the terms and definitions both globally (i.e., increasing
semantic consistency between the representations of the entire sentences and
the terms/definitions) and locally (i.e., promoting the similarity between the
representations of the terms and the definitions).

optimization objective (the loss) and the end target metric. Recent works in
computer vision have proposed soft surrogates to alleviate this discrepancy and
directly optimize the desired metric, either through relaxations (soft-Dice,
soft-Jaccard) or submodular optimization (Lov\'asz-softmax). The aim of this

we show that all surrogates are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor, and
that no optimal weighting of cross-entropy exists to approximate Dice or
Jaccard measures. We validate these findings empirically and show that, while
it is important to opt for one of the target metric surrogates rather than a
cross-entropy-based loss, the choice of the surrogate does not make a

model reviewers and their co-review pairs as a pairwise-MRF, and use loopy
belief propagation to evaluate the suspiciousness of reviewers. We further
design a high quality yet easy-to-compute node prior for ColluEagle, through
which the review spammer groups can also be subsequently identified.

disillusioned with this research program and after the rise of a convincing
alternative for the gauge idea by translating it to the phase of wave functions
and spinor fields in quantum mechanics, Weyl no longer considered the original
scale gauge as physically relevant.
  About the middle of the last century the question of conformal and/or local
scale gauge transformation were reconsidered by different authors in high
energy physics (Bopp, Wess, et al.) and, independently, in gravitation theory
(Jordan, Fierz, Brans, Dicke). In this context Weyl geometry attracted new
interest among different groups of physicists (Omote/Utiyama/Kugo,
Dirac/Canuto/Maeder, Ehlers/Pirani/Schild and others), often by hypothesizing a
new scalar field linked to gravity and/or high energy physics. Although not
crowned by immediate success, this ``retake'' of Weyl geometrical methods lives
on and has been extended a century after Weyl's first proposal of his basic
geometrical structure. It finds new interest in present day studies of
elementary particle physics, cosmology, and philosophy of physics.

with the group using as sensory input the velocity of its neighbors. This goal
is pursued by each learning individual by exerting a limited control on its own
direction of motion. By means of standard reinforcement learning algorithms we
show that: i) a learning agent exposed to a group of teachers, i.e. hard-wired
flocking agents, learns to follow them, and ii) that in the absence of
teachers, a group of independently learning agents evolves towards a state
where each agent knows how to flock. In both scenarios, i) and ii), the
emergent policy (or navigation strategy) corresponds to the polar velocity
alignment mechanism of the well-known Vicsek model. These results show that a)
such a velocity alignment may have naturally evolved as an adaptive behavior
that aims at minimizing the rate of neighbor loss, and b) prove that this
alignment does not only favor (local) polar order, but it corresponds to best
policy/strategy to keep group cohesion when the sensory input is limited to the

lattice graphs, i.e. those forming a regular tessellation of the Euclidean
plane (triangular, square, and honeycomb lattice graphs). We first consider the
free particle: on square and triangular lattice graphs we observe the
well-known ballistic behavior, whereas on the honeycomb lattice graph we obtain
a sub-ballistic one, although still faster than the classical diffusive one. We
impute this difference to the different amount of coherence generated by the
evolution and, in turn, to the fact that, in 2D, the square and the triangular
lattices are Bravais lattices, whereas the honeycomb one is non-Bravais. From
the physical point of view, this means that CTQWs are not universally
characterized by the ballistic spreading. We then address the dynamics in the
presence of a perpendicular uniform magnetic field and study the effects of the
field by two approaches: (i) introducing the Peierls phase-factors, according
to which the tunneling matrix element of the free particle becomes complex, or
(ii) spatially discretizing the Hamiltonian of a spinless charged particle in
the presence of a magnetic field. Either way, the dynamics of an initially
localized walker is characterized by a lower spread compared to the free
particle case, the larger is the field the more localized stays the walker.
Remarkably, upon analyzing the dynamics by spatial discretization of the
Hamiltonian (vector potential in the symmetric gauge), we obtain that the
variance of the space coordinate is characterized by pseudo-oscillations, a
reminiscence of the harmonic oscillator behind the Hamiltonian in the
continuum, whose energy levels are the well-known Landau levels.

fixed magnetic Reynolds number. In the optimal dynamo of Willis (2012, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 109, 251101), we find mean-field dynamo action for planar averages.
One component of the magnetic field grows exponentially while the other decays
in an oscillatory fashion near onset. This behavior is different from that of
an alpha^2 dynamo, where the two non-vanishing components of the planar
averages are coupled and have the same growth rate. For the Willis dynamo, we
find that the mean field is excited by a negative turbulent magnetic
diffusivity, which has a non-uniform spatial profile near onset. The temporal
oscillations in the decaying component are caused by the corresponding
component of the diffusivity tensor being complex when the mean field is
decaying and, in this way, time-dependent. The growing mean field can be
modeled by a negative magnetic diffusivity combined with a positive magnetic
hyperdiffusivity. In two other classes of optimal dynamos of Chen et al. (2015,
J. Fluid Mech. 783, 23), we find, to some extent, similar mean-field dynamo
actions. When the magnetic boundary conditions are mixed, the two components of
the planar averaged field grow at different rates when the dynamo is 15%
supercritical. When the mean magnetic field satisfies homogeneous boundary
conditions (where the magnetic field is tangential to the boundary), mean-field
dynamo action is found for one-dimensional averages, but not for planar
averages. Despite having different spatial profiles, both dynamos show negative
turbulent magnetic diffusivities. Our finding suggests negative turbulent
magnetic diffusivities may support a broader class of dynamos than previously
thought, including these three optimal dynamos.

the new generation of Gazebo, part of the Ignition Robotics suite, which
provides three main improvements for reinforcement learning applications

simulator as a C++ library, simplifying the interconnection with external
software; 2) multiple physics and rendering engines are supported as plugins,
simplifying their selection during the execution; 3) the new distributed
simulation capability allows simulating complex scenarios while sharing the
load on multiple workers and machines. The core of Gym-Ignition is a component
that contains the Ignition Gazebo simulator and exposes a simple interface for
its configuration and execution. We provide a Python package that allows
developers to create robotic environments simulated in Ignition Gazebo.
Environments expose the common OpenAI Gym interface, making them compatible
out-of-the-box with third-party frameworks containing reinforcement learning
algorithms. Simulations can be executed in both headless and GUI mode, the
physics engine can run in accelerated mode, and instances can be parallelized.
Furthermore, the Gym-Ignition software architecture provides abstraction of the
Robot and the Task, making environments agnostic on the specific runtime. This
abstraction allows their execution also in a real-time setting on actual
robotic platforms, even if driven by different middlewares.

The coupled dynamics for the bipartite collinear antiferromagnets is modeled by
a coupled system of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with an additional term

numerical simulations are performed by means of matrix-product-state based

rotates the local (bosonic) Hilbert spaces adaptively into an optimized basis

to study the thermodynamics of open systems based on the rigorous notion of a

results, which serve as the basis to define the corresponding thermodynamic
quantities. In contrast to this observer-dependent point of view, a `black
box', which evolves unitarily and can simulate a quantum causal model, is
constructed here. The quantum thermodynamics of this big isolated system can
then be studied using widely accepted arguments from statistical mechanics. It
is shown that the resulting definitions of internal energy, heat, work, and
entropy have a natural extension to the trajectory level. The canonical choice
of them coincides with the proclaimed definitions of operational quantum

(PES) to data obtained from our own (storage) stability study, to answer this
question. The 52-week stability study was conducted on a selection of
multi-component monoclonal antibody (mAb) formulations. Solid state dynamics of
the formulations were probed using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).

consider the transient dynamics following an outage or require a full Phasor

from a limited number of PMUs, we propose a real-time dynamic outage detection
scheme based on alternating current (AC) power flow model and statistical
change detection theory. The proposed method can capture system dynamics since
it retains the time-variant and nonlinear nature of the power system. The
method is computationally efficient and scales to large and realistic networks.

propose a parameterised student-t cost function that can interpolate between
two cost functions that are amongst the most widely in image registration

comets and injecting them into the observability region of the Solar System.
The aim of this paper is to discuss two cases in which the data obtained from
observations were used and stellar perturbations (of different intensity,
strong case of C/2002 A3 LINEAR and weaker case of C/2013 F3 PANSTARRS) on
cometary motion were detected. Using the best available data from the Gaia DR2
catalogue and some other sources we searched for close stellar passages near
the Sun. Our study took into account that some of the stars are parts of
multiple systems. Over 600 stars or systems that approached or will approach
the Sun closer than 4.0 pc were found. Having the list of perturbers completed
we studied their influence on a sample of 277 Oort spike comets that were
observed since 1901 and discovered that two comets might have their orbits
fundamentally changed due to a close stellar encounter. Our results show how
much different the dynamical evolution of comets would have looked when their
motion was considered only in the Galactic potential. Uncertainties both in
stellar and cometary data were carefully taken into account. Our analysis
indicates that the occurrence of stellar perturbations on cometary motions is
very rare and the uncertainties of these effects are hard to estimate.

propose a learning-based framework that allows simultaneous usage of both

bright for almost two years with little spectral evolution, is still unclear.
We here propose that iPTF14hls was not a sudden outburst like supernovae but
rather a long-term outflow similar to stellar winds. The properties of
iPTF14hls, which are at odds with a supernova scenario, become natural when
interpreted as a stellar wind with variable mass-loss rate. Based on the wind
hypothesis, we estimate the mass-loss rates of iPTF14hls in the bright phase.
We find that the instantaneous mass-loss rate of iPTF14hls during the 2-year
bright phase was more than a few Msun/yr (""hyper-wind"") and it reached as much
as 10 Msun/yr. The total mass lost over two years was about 10 Msun.
Interestingly, we find that the light curve of iPTF14hls has a very similar
shape to that of eta Carinae during the Great Eruption, which also experienced
a similar but less extreme brightening accompanied by extraordinary mass loss,
shedding more than 10 Msun in 10 years. The progenitor of iPTF14hls is less
than 150 Msun if it still exists, which is similar to eta Carinae. The two
phenomena may be related to a continuum-driven extreme wind from very massive

possible to have a deep and thorough examination of cues embedded in the

highly refined anisotropic angular adaptivity with a Haar wavelet angular
discretisation. We test this on three simple problems with pure streaming where

aspects to consider when studying both natural cognition and adaptive robotics
to human environments. Although several researches have focused on nonverbal

has obtained less attention. From the perspective of neurorobotics, we
investigate the relation between intentionality, motor compliance, cognitive

has deep implications on the unpredictability of open Hamiltonian systems. When
the energy of the system increases the particles escape faster. For this reason
the boundary of the exit basins becomes thinner and less fractal. Hence, we
could expect a monotonous decrease in the unpredictability as well as in the
fractal dimension. However, within the nonhyperbolic regime, fluctuations in
the basin entropy have been uncovered. The reason is that when increasing the
energy, both the size and geometry of the KAM islands undergo abrupt changes.
These fluctuations do not appear within the hyperbolic regime. Hence, the
fluctuations in the basin entropy allow us to ascertain the hyperbolic or
nonhyperbolic nature of a system. In this manuscript we have used continuous
and discrete open Hamiltonian systems in order to show the relevant role of the
KAM islands on the unpredictability, and the utility of the basin entropy to
analyze this kind of systems.

observed in close stellar binary systems based on an angular momentum exchange
between the spin of the active component and the orbital motion. This
spin-orbit coupling is not due to tides, but is produced by a non-axisymmetric
component of the gravitational quadrupole moment of the active star due to a
persistent non-axisymmetric internal magnetic field. The proposed mechanism
easily satisfies all the energy constraints having an energy budget about
100-1000 times smaller than those of previously proposed models and is
supported by the observations of persistent active longitudes in the active
components of close binary systems. We present preliminary applications to
three well-studied binary systems to illustrate the model. The case of stars
with hot Jupiters is also discussed showing that no significant orbital period
modulation is generally expected on the basis of the proposed model.

We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for
segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no

selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The
system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise
to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than
or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate
segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and
second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10
tasks. The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates
the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net.
Multi-planar training combines the parameter efficiency of a 2D fully

augmentation scheme, which allows the 2D model to learn a representation of the

screening length of the electrolyte filling the pore, and
$z_{\mathrm{if}}=\sqrt{z_{+}|z_{-}|}$ is a scaling factor that makes scaling
work for electrolytes containing multivalent ions ($z_{+}$ and $z_{-}$ are
cation and the anion valences). By scaling we mean that the rectification of
the pore (defined as the ratio of currents in the forward and reversed biased
states) depends on pore radius, concentration, $c$, and ion valences via the
parameter $\xi$ implicitly. This feature is based on the fact that
rectification depends on the voltage-sensitive appearance of depletion zones
that, in turn, depend on the relation of $R_{\mathrm{P}}$ to the rescaled
screening length $\lambda z_{\mathrm{if}}$. In this modeling study, we use the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory and a particle simulation method, the Local
Equilibrium Monte Carlo (LEMC). The latter can compute ion correlations that
are ignored in the mean-field treatment of PNP and that are very important for
multivalent ions (we show results for 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 2:2 electrolytes). In
addition to the $z_{\mathrm{if}}$ factor, we show that one must choose a
screening length appropriate to the system, in our case the Debye length for

proposes a novel approach - Multi-head Attention-based Multi-robot Exploration
in Continuous Space (MAMECS) - aimed at reducing the state space and
automatically learning the cooperation strategies required for decentralized
multi-robot exploration tasks in continuous space. Computational geometry
knowledge is applied to describe the environment in continuous space and to
design an improved reward function to ensure a superior exploration rate.
Moreover, the multi-head attention mechanism employed helps to solve the
historical trajectory issue in the decentralized multi-robot exploration task,
as well as to reduce the quadratic increase of action space.

Reference
nodes, either selected using a priory information about the network or

putative communities. Distance vectors between each network node and the
reference nodes are then used for defining a coordinate system representing the
community structure of the network at many different scales. For modular
networks, the distribution of nodes in this space often results in a
well-separated clustered structure, with each cluster corresponding to a
community. One interesting feature of the reported methodology for community
finding is that the coordinate system defined by the seeds allows an intuitive
and direct interpretation of the situation of each node with respect to the
considered communities. The potential of the method is illustrated with respect
to a community detection benchmark, a spatial network model and to city streets

a Mach number $Ma_i=1.30$ at a total temperature ratio
$T_{0,i}/T_{0,\infty}=0.75$. A deflection $\beta=8\deg$ generates a shock that
impinges upon the cooling film. A shock interaction case and a reference case

(LES) results of a comparable flow configuration are used. The streamwise and
wall-normal turbulent mass fluxes are in qualitative agreement with the LES

shock interaction, the turbulent Schmidt number is in the range $0.5 \leq Sc_t

the turbulent Schmidt number varies drastically in the vicinity of the shock

current generated by the magnetic spin Hall effect accomplishes
spin-orbit-torque switching for ferromagnetic magnetization and exchange bias
concurrently without any external magnetic field. The switching mechanism
crucially relies on the non-collinear spin texture in the antiferromagnet,

spatio-temporal stochastic models for epidemics is the selection of the
transmission kernel used to represent the relationship between infectious
challenge and spatial separation of infected and susceptible hosts. As the
design of control strategies is often based on an assessment of the distance
over which transmission can realistically occur and estimation of this distance
is very sensitive to the choice of kernel function, it is important that models
used to inform control strategies can be scrutinised in the light of
observation in order to elicit possible evidence against the selected kernel
function. While a range of approaches to model criticism are in existence, the
field remains one in which the need for further research is recognised. In this
paper, building on earlier contributions by the authors, we introduce a new
approach to assessing the validity of spatial kernels - the latent likelihood
ratio tests - and compare its capacity to detect model misspecification with
that of tests based on the use of infection-link residuals. We demonstrate that
the new approach, which combines Bayesian and frequentist ideas by treating the
statistical decision maker as a complex entity, can be used to formulate tests
with greater power than infection-link residuals to detect kernel
misspecification particularly when the degree of misspecification is modest.
This new approach avoids the use of a fully Bayesian approach which may
introduce undesirable complications related to computational complexity and
prior sensitivity.

cosmological and event horizons in a McVittie universe whose expansion is
driven by the Redlich-Kwong, (Modified) Berthelot, Dieterici, and Peng-Robinson
fluids, respectively. The equations of state of these fluids are rich enough to
account for both exotic and regular, as well as ideal and non-ideal matter
contents of the universe. We show that the cosmological horizon is expanding,
while the event horizon is shrinking along the cosmic time evolution. The
former achieves larger size for regular types of matter, contrary to the
latter. The strength of interactions within the cosmic fluid are shown to play
a more important role in affecting the evolution of the event horizon, rather
than of the cosmological horizon in the case of a singularity-free universe.
While the cosmological horizon always exists during the time evolution, the
event horizon can exist only when a certain relationship between the
Hawking-Hayward quasi-local mass and the Hubble function is fulfilled. In this

emerged as a promising tool to train statistical models over networks of
devices while keeping data localized. Federated learning methods run training
tasks directly on user devices and do not share the raw user data with third
parties. However, current methods still share model updates, which may contain
private information (e.g., one's weight and height), during the training
process. Existing efforts that aim to improve the privacy of federated learning
make compromises in one or more of the following key areas: performance
(particularly communication cost), accuracy, or privacy. To better optimize
these trade-offs, we propose that \textit{sketching algorithms} have a unique
advantage in that they can provide both privacy and performance benefits while
maintaining accuracy. We evaluate the feasibility of sketching-based federated
learning with a prototype on three representative learning models. Our initial
findings show that it is possible to provide strong privacy guarantees for
federated learning without sacrificing performance or accuracy. Our work
highlights that there exists a fundamental connection between privacy and
communication in distributed settings, and suggests important open problems
surrounding the theoretical understanding, methodology, and system design of
practical, private federated learning.

The first estimator is based on local linear quantile regressions, and the
second is based on local linear smoothed quantile regressions, both of which

sufficient conditions under which the two estimators are shown to be

is shown that $N<<T^{2/(d+4)}$ is needed to ignore the incidental parameter

opportunities to address this challenge, but generally cannot guarantee safety
in terms of state and input constraint satisfaction. A recently proposed safety
framework for centralized linear systems ensures safety by matching the
learning-based input online with the initial input of a model predictive
control law capable of driving the system to a terminal set known to be safe.
We extend this idea to derive a distributed model predictive safety
certification (DMPSC) scheme, which is able to ensure state and input
constraint satisfaction when applying any learning-based control algorithm to
an uncertain distributed linear system with dynamic couplings. The scheme is
based on a distributed tube-based model predictive control (MPC) concept, where
subsystems negotiate local tube sizes among neighbors in order to mitigate
restrictiveness of the safety approach. In addition, we present a technique for
generating a structured ellipsoidal robust positive invariant tube. In
numerical simulations, we show that the safety framework ensures constraint
satisfaction for an initially unsafe control policy and allows to improve
overall control performance compared to robust distributed MPC.

including both the resistive effects and, above all, the mean-field dynamo
action due to sub-scale, unresolved turbulence, are applied for the first time
to such systems in the fully nonlinear regime. Combined with the differential
rotation of the disk, the dynamo process is able to produce an exponential
growth of any initial seed magnetic field up to the values required to explain
the observations, when the instability tends to saturate even in the absence of
artificial quenching effects. Before reaching the final saturation stage we
observe a secondary regime of exponential growing, where the magnetic field
increases more slowly due to accretion, which is modifying the underlying
equilibrium. By varying the dynamo coefficient we obtain different growth
rates, though the field seems to saturate at approximately the same level, at
least for the limited range of parameters explored here, providing substantial
values for the MAD parameter for magnetized accretion. For reasonable values of

high rates. The GEM consists of a polyimide foil which is coated by two thin
copper layers. Charges collected into the holes or created during the
amplification process may adhere to the polyimide part inside the holes. This
is often accompanied by a change of the effective gain. The effect is commonly
known as the charging-up effect.
  This work presents a systematic investigation of the effect under
well-controlled and monitored conditions for a single standard GEM foil in
Ar/CO$_2$ (90/10) gas for varying rates of X-ray interactions in the detector
and for different gains of the foil. In order to cover a wide range of
different rates, we apply two different methods. The first one is based on a
current measurement while the second one relies on the analysis of $^{55}$Fe
spectra over time. Both methods give consistent results, showing an initial
increase of the effective gain with time and an asymptotic saturation, which
can be well described by a single-exponential function. We find that the
characteristic time constants extracted from our measurements scale inversely
proportional to the rate of incoming electrons for a given GEM voltage.
Introducing characteristic quantities, which describe either the number of
incoming electrons per hole or the total number of electrons in a hole per
characteristic time, we find consistent numbers for measurements taken at the
same GEM voltages. For measurements taken at different GEM voltages, however,
also the characteristic total number of electrons inside the hole, which is
supposed to take into account the different effective gains, is found to be
higher by a factor of about 3.5 for $U_{\rm GEM}=$ 350V ($n_{\rm tot}=8.8\times
10^8$) compared to 400V ($n_{\rm tot}=2.4\times 10^8$). This hints at a
residual dependence of the charging-up characteristics on the GEM voltage.

inference can benefit from an analysis that takes into account the
distributional changes across environments. In particular, it is useful to
distinguish between stable and unstable predictors, i.e., predictors which have
a fixed or a changing functional dependence on the response, respectively. We
introduce stabilized regression which explicitly enforces stability and thus
improves generalization performance to previously unseen environments. Our work
is motivated by an application in systems biology. Using multiomic data, we
demonstrate how hypothesis generation about gene function can benefit from
stabilized regression. We believe that a similar line of arguments for
exploiting heterogeneity in data can be powerful for many other applications as
well. We draw a theoretical connection between multi-environment regression and
causal models, which allows to graphically characterize stable versus unstable
functional dependence on the response. Formally, we introduce the notion of a
stable blanket which is a subset of the predictors that lies between the direct
causal predictors and the Markov blanket. We prove that this set is optimal in
the sense that a regression based on these predictors minimizes the mean
squared prediction error given that the resulting regression generalizes to
unseen new environments.

of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with ultra-fast
outflows (UFOs). Mrk~79 is a radio-quiet AGN with UFOs and warm absorbers, had
been monitored by three reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns, but its BLR
kinematics is not understood yet. In this paper, we report the results from a
new RM-campaign of Mrk~79, which was undertaken by Lijiang 2.4-m telescope.
Mrk~79 is seeming to come out the faint state, the mean flux approximates a
magnitude fainter than historical record. We successfully measured the lags of
the broad emission lines including H$\beta~\lambda4861$, H$\gamma~\lambda4340$,
He II $\lambda4686$ and He I $\lambda5876$ with respect to the varying AGN
continuum. Based on the broad H$\beta~\lambda4861$ line, we measured black hole
(BH) mass of $M_{\bullet}=5.13^{+1.57}_{-1.55}\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$, estimated
accretion rates of ${\dot{M}_{\bullet}}=(0.05\pm0.02)~L_{\rm Edd}~c^{-2}$,
indicating that Mrk~79 is a sub-Eddington accretor. We found that Mrk~79
deviates from the canonical Radius$-$Luminosity relationship. The marginal
blueshift of the broad He II $\lambda4686$ line detected from rms spectrum
indicates outflow of high-ionization gas. The velocity-resolved lag profiles of
the broad H$\gamma~\lambda4340$, H$\beta~\lambda4861$, and He I $\lambda5876$
lines show similar signatures that the largest lag occurs in the red wing of
the lines then the lag decreases to both sides. These signatures should suggest
that the BLR of Keplerian motion probably exists the outflow gas motion. All
findings including UFOs, warm absorbers, and the kinematics of high- and
low-ionization BLR, may provide an indirect evidence that the BLR of Mrk~79
probably originates from disk wind.

signatures (speed and trajectories) of the motile green alga, Dunaliella
primolecta, during the lag-exponential-stationary growth cycle at different
nutrient concentrations. We discovered significant changes in neutral lipid
content and swimming signatures of microalgae across growth phases. The timing
of the maximum swimming speed coincided with the maximum lipid content and both
maxima occurred under nutrient stress at the stationary growth phase.
Furthermore, the swimming trajectories of microalgae signal the growth phase
and corresponding intracellular lipid accumulation. Our results provide the
potential exploitation of microalgal swimming signatures as indicators for the
cultivation conditions and the timing of microalgal harvest to maximize the
lipid yield for biofuel production. The findings can also be implemented to
explore the production of food and antibiotics from other microalgal

is based on a grand canonical free energy functional of the fluid number

terms of the linear theory of elasticity, parametrized by two Lam\'e

potentials characterize the interparticle interactions in the system. The
long-ranged attraction between the fluid particles is described by a potential

integrating out the elastic degrees of freedom we obtain an effective theory
for the fluid number density alone. Its structure is similar to the one for
wetting of an inert substrate. However, the potential $w(r)$ is replaced by an
effective potential which, in addition to $w(r)$, contains a term bilinear in
$v(r)$. We discuss the corresponding wetting transitions in terms of an

training samples in each epoch without considering their learning situations,
which leads to a lot of unnecessary training and can not target the difficult

and enhance the overall control of the whole sentence. Moreover, the text-based
dynamic attention mechanism and the visual attention mechanism are linked
together to focus on the important words. They can benefit from each other
during training. Accordingly, the model is trained through two steps: ""starting

optimize the model, while the latter only trains for samples with poor control.

for example the case for multilingual collections where documents are not
available in all languages. Some studies tackled this problem by assuming the
existence of view generation functions to approximately complete the missing
views; for example Machine Translation to translate documents into the missing

their quality has a direct impact on the performance of the learned multiview
classifier over the completed training set. Our proposed approach addresses
this problem by jointly learning the missing views and the multiview classifier
using a tripartite game with two generators and a discriminator. Each of the
generators is associated to one of the views and tries to fool the
discriminator by generating the other missing view conditionally on the
corresponding observed view. The discriminator then tries to identify if for an
observation, one of its views is completed by one of the generators or if both
views are completed along with its class. Our results on a subset of Reuters
RCV1/RCV2 collections show that the discriminator achieves significant
classification performance; and that the generators learn the missing views

assumption is made, or because a model with interactions is used but lacks the
identification property. In official statistics, this is currently the main
challenge to the automated production and use of linked data. To address this
challenge, a new methodology is described for proper linkage problems, where
matched records may be identified with a probability that is bounded away from
zero, regardless of the population size. It models the number of neighbours of
a given record, i.e. the number of resembling records. To be specific, the
proposed model is a finite mixture where each component is the sum of a
Bernoulli variable with an independent Poisson variable. It has the
identification property and yields solutions for many longstanding problems,
including the evaluation of blocking criteria and the estimation of linkage
errors for probabilistic or non-probabilistic linkages, all without clerical
reviews or conditional independence assumptions. Thus it also enables
unsupervised machine learning solutions for record linkage problems.

(GRMCs), to generalize the parallel construction in [Xu and Chen, IEEE Trans.
Inf. Theory, 64 (2018), 6315--6319] and the classic multilevel construction. A
Singleton-like upper bound and a lower bound for GRMCs derived from Gabidulin
codes are given. Via GRMCs, two effective constructions for CDCs are presented
by combining the parallel construction and the multilevel construction. Many
CDCs with larger size than the previously best known codes are given. The ratio
between the new lower bound and the known upper bound for
$(4\delta,2\delta,2\delta)_q$-CDCs is calculated. It is greater than 0.99926
for any prime power $q$ and any $\delta\geq 3$.

frame alignment and system separation in impedance modeling of ac grids, and
thereby enables impedance-based whole-system modeling of generator-converter
composite power systems. The methodology is based on a frame-dynamics-embedding
transformation via an intermediary steady frame between local and global
frames, which yields a locally defined impedance model for each generator or
converter that does not rely on a global frame but retains all frame dynamics.
The individual impedance model can then be readily combined into a whole-system
model even for meshed networks via the proposed closed-loop formulation without
network separation. Compared to start-of-the-art impedance-based models, the
proposed method retains both frame dynamics and scalability, and is generally
applicable to various network topologies (meshed, radial, etc) and combinations
of machines (generators, motors, converters, etc). The methodology is used to
analyze the dynamic interaction between generators and converters in a
composite grid, which yields important findings and potential solutions for
unstable oscillation caused by PLL-swing coupling in low-inertia grids.

of linear oscillation modes to nonlinear systems and proposes a definition of
strict nonlinear normal modes, which matches most of the relevant properties of
the linear modes. The main contributions are a theorem providing necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of strict oscillation modes on systems
endowed with a Riemannian metric and a potential field as well as a

(LQG) social optimization and Nash game in the context of a large scale system.
Two types of interactive agents are involved: a major agent and a large number
of weakly-coupled minor agents. All minor agents are cooperative to minimize
the social cost as the sum of their individual costs, whereas such social cost
are conflictive to that of major agent. Thus, major agent and all minor agents
are further competitive to reach some non-zero Nash equilibrium. The control
processes enter both diffusion and drift terms of all major and minors' states.
This extends the standard setup in which control only enters the drift terms,
and such extension brings more modeling difference and technical difficulties,
in particular, when dealing with the feedback decentralized strategy via
Riccati equation and mean-field consistency condition (CC) representation.
Applying the mean-field approximations and person-by-person optimality, we
obtain auxiliary control problems for major agent and minor agents,
respectively. The decentralized social strategy is derived by a class of new CC
system, which is mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations.
The well-posedness of the CC system is obtained by the discounting method. The
related asymptotic social optimality for minor agents, and Nash equilibrium for
major-minor agents are also verified.

topologically protected flat zero-energy bands of surface states, which can be
described as Majorana modes. We here investigate their fate if residual
interactions beyond BCS theory are included. For a minimal square-lattice model
with a plaquette interaction, we find string-like integrals of motion that form
Clifford algebras and lead to exact degeneracies. These degeneracies strongly
depend on whether the numbers of sites in the $x$ and $y$ directions are even
or odd, and are robust against disorder in the interactions. We show that the
mapping of the Majorana model onto two decoupled spin compass models [Kamiya et
al., Phys. Rev. B 98, 161409 (2018)] and extra spectator degrees of freedom
only works for open boundary conditions. The mapping shows that the three-leg
and four-leg Majorana ladders are integrable, while systems of larger width are
not. In addition, the mapping maximally reduces the effort for exact
diagonalization, which is utilized to obtain the gap above the ground states.
We find that this gap remains open if one dimension is kept constant and even,
while the other is sent to infinity, at least if that dimension is odd.
Moreover, we compare the topological properties of the interacting Majorana
model to those of the toric-code model. The Majorana model has long-range
entangled ground states that differ by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes through the system
on a torus. The ground states exhibit string condensation similar to the toric
code but the topological order is not robust. While the spectrum is gapped -
due to spontaneous symmetry breaking inherited from the compass models - states
with different values of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes end up in the ground-state
sector in the thermodynamic limit. Hence, the gap does not protect these fluxes
against weak perturbations.

non-uniformly distributed,the agents realize it is less informative and start
to ignore it, and, surprisingly, they make a better use of the remaining

a notable dearth of short period, Neptune-like planets is found. Here we report
the {\it TESS} discovery of a new short-period planet in the Neptune desert,
orbiting the G-type dwarf TYC\,8003-1117-1 (TOI-132). {\it TESS} photometry
shows transit-like dips at the level of $\sim$1400 ppm occurring every
$\sim$2.11 days. High-precision radial velocity follow-up with HARPS confirmed
the planetary nature of the transit signal and provided a semi-amplitude radial
velocity variation of $\sim$11.5 m s$^{-1}$, which, when combined with the
stellar mass of $0.97\pm0.06$ $M_{\odot}$, provides a planetary mass of
22.83$^{+1.81}_{-1.80}$ $M_{\oplus}$. Modeling the {\it TESS} high-quality
light curve returns a planet radius of 3.43$^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$ $R_{\oplus}$, and
therefore the planet bulk density is found to be 3.11$^{+0.44}_{-0.450}$ g
cm$^{-3}$. Planet structure models suggest that the bulk of the planet mass is
in the form of a rocky core, with an atmospheric mass fraction of
4.3$^{+1.2}_{-2.3}$\%. TOI-132 b is a {\it TESS} Level 1 Science Requirement
candidate, and therefore priority follow-up will allow the search for
additional planets in the system, whilst helping to constrain low-mass planet
formation and evolution models, particularly valuable for better understanding
the Neptune desert.

biologically-plausible algorithm using a Hebbian-type synaptic update rule to
solve streaming principal component analysis (PCA). Computational
neuroscientists have known that this biological version of Oja's rule converges
to the top eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the input in the limit.
However, prior to this work, it was open to prove any convergence rate
guarantee.
  In this work, we give the first convergence rate analysis for the biological
version of Oja's rule in solving streaming PCA. Moreover, our convergence rate
matches the information theoretical lower bound up to logarithmic factors and
outperforms the state-of-the-art upper bound for streaming PCA. Furthermore, we
develop a novel framework inspired by ordinary differential equations (ODE) to
analyze general stochastic dynamics. The framework abandons the traditional
step-by-step analysis and instead analyzes a stochastic dynamic in one-shot by
giving a closed-form solution to the entire dynamic. The one-shot framework
allows us to apply stopping time and martingale techniques to have a flexible
and precise control on the dynamic. We believe that this general framework is
powerful and should lead to effective yet simple analysis for a large class of
problems with stochastic dynamics.

benefits for improved traffic safety, mobility, and accessibility. However,
AVs' benefits also introduce a serious potential challenge, in the form of
complex interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs). The emergence of AVs
introduces uncertainty in the behavior of human actors and in the impact of the
AV manufacturer on autonomous driving design. This paper thus aims to
investigate how AVs affect road safety and to design socially optimal liability
rules for AVs and human drivers. A unified game is developed, including a Nash
game between human drivers, a Stackelberg game between the AV manufacturer and
HVs, and a Stackelberg game between the law maker and other users. We also
establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game. The game
is then simulated with numerical examples to investigate the emergence of human
drivers' moral hazard, the AV manufacturer's role in traffic safety, and the
law maker's role in liability design. Our findings demonstrate that human
drivers could develop moral hazard if they perceive their road environment has
become safer and an optimal liability rule design is crucial to improve social
welfare with advanced transportation technologies. More generally, the
game-theoretic model developed in this paper provides an analytical tool to
assist policy-makers in AV policymaking and hopefully mitigate uncertainty in
the existing regulation landscape about AV technologies.

  Hyperparameter Optimization","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1905.06872",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: In order that the general public is not vulnerable to hackers,
security bug reports need to be handled by small groups of engineers before
being widely discussed. But learning how to distinguish the security bug
reports from other bug reports is challenging since they may occur rarely. Data
mining methods that can find such scarce targets require extensive optimization
effort.
  Goal: The goal of this research is to aid practitioners as they struggle to
optimize methods that try to distinguish between rare security bug reports and
other bug reports.
  Method: Our proposed method, called Swift, is a dual optimizer that optimizes
both learner and pre-processor options. Since this is a large space of options,
Swift uses a technique called epsilon-dominance that learns how to avoid
operations that do not significantly improve performance.
  Result: When compared to recent state-of-the-art results (from FARSEC which
is published in TSE'18), we find that the Swift's dual optimization of both
pre-processor and learner is more useful than optimizing each of them
individually. For example, in a study of security bug reports from the Chromium
dataset, the median recalls of FARSEC and Swift were 15.7% and 77.4%,
respectively. For another example, in experiments with data from the Ambari
project, the median recalls improved from 21.5% to 85.7% (FARSEC to SWIFT).
  Conclusion: Overall, our approach can quickly optimize models that achieve
better recalls than the prior state-of-the-art. These increases in recall are
associated with moderate increases in false positive rates (from 8% to 24%,
median). For future work, these results suggest that dual optimization is both
practical and useful.

intermediate low $p_T$. The shape of the observed nuclear suppression factor
obtained within our calculations is in qualitative agreement with the
experimental results of the same quantity for $D-$mesons in proton-nucleus
collisions. We compute the nuclear suppression factor in nucleus-nucleus

that quantum probability does not allow an epistemic (ignorance)
interpretation. By inquiring possible connections between contextuality and
non-classical probabilities we show that a class T of theories can be selected
in which probabilities are introduced as classical averages of Kolmogorovian
probabilities over sets of (microscopic) contexts, which endows them with an
epistemic interpretation. The conditions characterizing T are compatible with
classical mechanics (CM), statistical mechanics (SM) and QM, hence we assume
that these theories belong to T. In the case of CM and QM this assumption is
irrelevant, as all notions introduced in them as members of T reduce to
standard notions. In the case of QM it leads to interpret quantum probability
as a derived notion in a Kolmogorovian framework, explains why it is
non-Kolmogorovian and provides it with an epistemic interpretation. These
results were anticipated in a previous paper but are obtained here in a general
framework without referring to individual objects, which shows that they hold
even if only a minimal (statistical) interpretation of QM is adopted to avoid
the problems following from the standard quantum theory of measurement.

photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) for recording vibrational resonances.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that spectroscopic contrast in PiFM is
mediated by opto-mechanical damping of the cantilever oscillation as the
optical wavelength is scanned through optical resonance. To our knowledge, this
is the first time opto-mechanical damping has been observed in the AFM. We
hypothesize that this damping force is a consequence of the dissipative
interaction between the sample and the vibrating tip; the modulated light
source in PiFM modulates the effective damping constant of the 2nd eigenmode of
the cantilever which in turn generate side-band signals producing the PiFM
signal at the 1st eigenmode. A series of experiments have eliminated other
mechanisms of contrast. By tracking the frequency shift of the PiFM signal at
the 1st cantilever eigenmode as the excitation wavenumber is tuned through a
mid-infrared absorption band, we showed that the near-field optical interaction
is attractive. By using a vibrating piezoelectric crystal to mimic sample
thermal expansion in a PiFM operating in mixing mode, we determined that the
minimum thermal expansion our system can detect is 30 pm limited by system
noise. We have confirmed that van der Waal mediated thermal-expansion forces
have negligible effect on PiFM signals by detecting the resonant response of a
4-methylbenzenethiol mono molecular layer deposited on template-stripped gold,
where thermal expansion was expected to be < 3 pm, i.e., 10 times lower than
our system noise level. Finally, the basic theory for dissipative tip-sample
interactions was introduced to model the photoinduced opto-mechanical damping.
Theoretical simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment.

However, relations in social networks are often hard to profile, due to noisy

profile user relations as edge semantics in social networks by integrating

is also flexible towards limited or missing supervision. Specifically, we
assume a latent distribution of multiple relations underlying each user link,

These include (but are not limited to) damping of fast magneto-sonic waves,
interruption of linearly polarized Alfv\'en waves by the firehose instability
and the inhibition of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability by Braginskii viscosity.
An explicit update of Braginskii viscosity is associated with a severe time
step constraint that scales with $(\Delta x)^2$ where $\Delta x$ is the grid
size. In our implementation, this restrictive time step constraint is
alleviated by employing 2nd order accurate Runge-Kutta-Legendre
super-time-stepping. We envision including Braginskii viscosity in future
large-scale simulations of Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable cold fronts in cluster

Yang-Mills gauge field theory, the Maxwell equations, as the earliest gauge
field theory, are non-symmetric because of the undefined term of magnetic
current density. This article reports on the theoretical quantization of this
term based on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spatial geometry of a gauge
group (G-group) of quantum charged (QC) particles. A locally supersymmetric
background-independent spatial geometry of the G-group is developed based on
the commutative string field interaction (SFI) between infinite number of QC
particles and the grand monopole and the noncommutative SFI of each pair of
adjacent QC particles in the G-group. Two adjoint and disjoint currents are
associated with the commutative and noncommutative SFIs, respectively, based on
the spin of a QC particle. The adjoint and disjoint currents are associated
with a zero resistivity between a QC particle and the grand monopole and an
infinite resistivity between each pair of adjacent QC particles correlated to
their microscopic commutative and noncommutative SFIs in the G-group,
respectively. This article demonstrates that the two corresponding
resistivities are finite (greater than zero and less than infinity) for the
macroscopic commutative and noncommutative SFIs of the G-group. Therefore, the
adjoint and disjoint currents are related to the classical macroscopic currents
known as electric and magnetic currents, respectively. Because the microscopic
adjoint current associated with the commutative SFI has already been related to
the macroscopic electric current density in the Maxwell equations, it is
proposed that the microscopic disjoint current associated with the
noncommutative SFI is related to the undefined magnetic current density in
these equations.

usually presented to an undergraduate audience. Our aim is to present
configuration spaces in a manner accessible to the advanced undergraduate. We
begin with a slight introduction to the topic before giving necessary
background on algebraic topology. We then discuss configuration spaces of the
Euclidean plane and the braid groups they give rise to. Lastly, we discuss
configuration spaces of graphs and the various techniques which have been
developed to pursue their study.

  Integrated Memory",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine-learning tasks performed by neural networks demonstrated useful
capabilities for producing reliable, and repeatable intelligent decisions.
Integrated photonics, leveraging both component miniaturization and the
wave-nature of the signals, can potentially outperform electronics
architectures when performing inference tasks. However, the missing
photon-photon force challenges non-volatile photonic device-functionality
required for efficient neural networks. Here we present a novel concept and
optimization of multi-level discrete-state non-volatile photonic memory based
on an ultra-compact (<4um) hybrid phase change material GSST-silicon Mach
Zehnder modulator, with low insertion losses (3dB), to serve as node in a
photonic neural network. An optimized electro-thermal switching mechanism,
induced by Joule heating through tungsten contacts, is engineered. This
operation allows to change the phase of the GSST film thus providing weight
updating functionality to the network. We show that a 5 V pulse-train (<1 us,
20 pulses) applied to a serpentine contact produces crystallization and a
single pulse of longer duration (2 us) amorphization, used to set the analog
synaptic weights of a neuron. Emulating an opportunely trained 100x100 fully
connected multilayered perceptron neural network with this weighting
functionality embedded as photonic memory, shows up to 93% inference accuracy
and robustness towards noise when performing predictions of unseen data

as the distribution of said random numbers for use as a cryptographic key.
However, emphasis is often placed on one of the two to the exclusion of the
other, but both are often simultaneously important. Here we present a simple
hybrid free-space link scheme for both the generation and secure distribution
of (pseudo-)random numbers between two remote parties, drawing the randomness
from the stochastic nature of atmospheric turbulence. The atmosphere is
simulated using digital micro-mirror devices for efficient, all-digital
control. After outlining one potential algorithm for extracting random numbers
based on finding the centre-of-mass (COM) of turbulent beam intensity profiles,
the statistics of our experimental COM measurements is studied and found to
agree well with the literature. After implementing the scheme in the
laboratory, Alice and Bob are able to establish a string of correlated random
bits with an 84% fidelity. Finally, we make a simple modification to the
original setup in an attempt to thwart the hacking attempts of an eavesdropper,
Eve, who has access to the free-space portion of the link. We find that the
fidelity between Eve's key and that of Alice/Bob is 54%, only slightly above
the theoretical minimum. Atmospheric turbulence could hence be leveraged as an
added security measure, rather than being seen as a drawback.

graphene resonator and three graphene nanoribbon waveguides of W-geometry
placed on a dilectric substrate. Surface plasmon-polariton waves propagate in
the waveguides. The nanoribbon excites in the resonator dipole resonance.
Nonreciprocity of the device is defined by nonsymmetry of the conductivity
tensor of the magnetized graphene. The circulator with the central frequency
7.5 THz has the bandwidth 4.25\% for isolation -15 dB, insertion loss -2.5 dB.
Applied DC magnetic field is 0.56T and Fermi energy of graphene
$\epsilon_F=0.15$eV. The Fermi energy allows one to control dynamically the
circulator responses.
