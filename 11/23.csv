complexity of the model, as well as the potential implications on human
interests, rights, and lives . While Explainable AI is an emerging field of
research, there is no consensus on the definition, quantification, and
formalization of explainability. In fact, the quantification of explainability
is an open challenge. In our previous work, we incorporated domain knowledge
for better explainability, however, we were unable to quantify the extent of
explainability. In this work, we (1) briefly analyze the definitions of
explainability from the perspective of different disciplines (e.g., psychology,
social science), properties of explanation, explanation methods, and
human-friendly explanations; and (2) propose and formulate an approach to
quantify the extent of explainability. Our experimental result suggests a
reasonable and model-agnostic way to quantify explainability

However, the spectral decomposition across different brain graphs causes
inconsistencies between the eigenvectors of individual spectral domains,
causing the graph learning algorithm to fail. Current spectral graph

a novel approach for learning the transformation matrix required for aligning

systems feasible. In this work, we focus on learning to coordinate.
Specifically, we consider the multi-agent multi-armed bandit framework, in
which fully cooperative loosely-coupled agents must learn to coordinate their
decisions to optimize a common objective. We propose multi-agent Thompson
sampling (MATS), a new Bayesian exploration-exploitation algorithm that
leverages loose couplings. We provide a regret bound that is sublinear in time

loosely-coupled multi-agent system is a wind farm. Coordination within the wind
farm is necessary to maximize power production. As upstream wind turbines only
affect nearby downstream turbines, we can use MATS to efficiently learn the
optimal control mechanism for the farm. To demonstrate the benefits of our
method toward applications we apply MATS to a realistic wind farm control task.
In this task, wind turbines must coordinate their alignments with respect to

seamless data sharing between fleet members, which could greatly improve the
sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning techniques. However in practice,
these machines, while almost identical in design, have small discrepancies due
to production errors or degradation, preventing control algorithms to simply
aggregate and employ all fleet data. We propose a novel reinforcement learning
method that learns to transfer knowledge between similar fleet members and
creates member-specific dynamics models for control. Our algorithm uses
Gaussian processes to establish cross-member covariances. This is significantly
different from standard transfer learning methods, as the focus is not on

  networks with PyTorch",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it has been shown that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be
trained efficiently, in a supervised manner, using backpropagation through
time. Indeed, the most commonly used spiking neuron model, the leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron, obeys a differential equation which can be
approximated using discrete time steps, leading to a recurrent relation for the
potential. The firing threshold causes optimization issues, but they can be
overcome using a surrogate gradient. Here, we extend previous approaches in two
ways. Firstly, we show that the approach can be used to train convolutional
layers. Convolutions can be done in space, time (which simulates conduction
delays), or both. Secondly, we include fast horizontal connections \`a la
Den\`eve: when a neuron N fires, we subtract to the potentials of all the
neurons with the same receptive the dot product between their weight vectors
and the one of neuron N. As Den\`eve et al. showed, this is useful to represent
a dynamic multidimensional analog signal in a population of spiking neurons.
Here we demonstrate that, in addition, such connections also allow implementing
a multidimensional send-on-delta coding scheme. We validate our approach on one
speech classification benchmarks: the Google speech command dataset. We managed
to reach nearly state-of-the-art accuracy (94%) while maintaining low firing
rates (about 5Hz). Our code is based on PyTorch and is available in open source

important only at gate dielectric thicknesses of a few nm, much smaller than a
typical separation between electrons. Our theoretical analysis agrees well with
the scattering rates extracted from measurements of electron viscosity in

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain surface analysis is essential to neuroscience, however, the complex
geometry of the brain cortex hinders computational methods for this task. The
difficulty arises from a discrepancy between 3D imaging data, which is

highly-convoluted brain surface. Recent advances in machine learning have
enabled the use of neural networks for non-Euclidean spaces. These facilitate
the learning of surface data, yet pooling strategies often remain constrained
to a single fixed-graph. This paper proposes a new learnable graph pooling
method for processing multiple surface-valued data to output subject-based

of graph nodes based on graph spectral embedding. We illustrate the advantages
of our approach with in-depth experiments on two large-scale benchmark

different prediction tasks, namely, subject-sex classification, regression of
cortical region sizes, classification of Alzheimer's disease stages, and brain

the non-private case, where the sample complexity is independent of the domain

learning the sample complexity must depend on the domain size $X$ (even for
approximate differential privacy). Alon et al. (STOC 2019) showed a lower bound
of $\Omega(\log^*|X|)$ on the sample complexity and Bun et al. (FOCS 2015)

ILU) techniques. However, the previous multilevel ILU techniques still lacked
robustness and efficiency for some large-scale saddle-point problems, which
often arise from systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We introduce
HILUCSI, or Hierarchical Incomplete LU-Crout with Scalability-oriented and
Inverse-based dropping. As a multilevel preconditioner, HILUCSI statically and
dynamically permutes individual rows and columns to the next level for deferred
factorization. Unlike ILUPACK, HILUCSI applies symmetric preprocessing
techniques at the top levels but always uses unsymmetric preprocessing and
unsymmetric factorization at the coarser levels. The deferring combined with
mixed preprocessing enabled a unified treatment for nearly or partially
symmetric systems, and simplified the implementation by avoiding mixed $1\times
1$ and $2\times 2$ pivots for symmetric indefinite systems. We show that this
combination improves robustness for indefinite systems without compromising
efficiency. Furthermore, to enable superior efficiency for large-scale systems

dropping in conjunction with a variant of inverse-based dropping. We

them to be signals. As the marginal estimator can be viewed as a ridge
estimator with regularization parameter $\lambda \to \infty$, we further
investigate a class of ridge-type estimators in a unifying framework, including
the popular best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) in genetics. We find that
the influence of $\lambda$ on out-of-sample prediction accuracy heavily depends
on $\omega$. Though selecting an optimal $\lambda$ can be important when $p$

estimators becomes near-optimal for any $\lambda \in (0,\infty)$ as $\omega$
increases. For example, when features are independent, the out-of-sample $R^2$
is always bounded by $1/\omega$ from above and is largely invariant to
$\lambda$ given large $\omega$ (say, $\omega>5$). We also find that in-sample
$R^2$ has completely different patterns and depends much more on $\lambda$ than
out-of-sample $R^2$. In practice, our analysis delivers useful messages for
genome-wide polygenic risk prediction and computation-accuracy trade-off in
dense high-dimensions. We numerically illustrate our results in simulation
studies and a real data example.

the negative feature reconstruction (i.e., perceptual distance) loss. We
validate the proposed method on face attribute prediction, showing that our

of the chain sector, formed by center-vortex worldlines attached to pointlike

supports the formation of a stable domain wall between quarks, thus
accommodating not only a linear potential but also the L\""uscher term.
Moreover, after a detailed analysis of the associated field equations, the
asymptotic string tension turns out to scale with the quadratic Casimir of the

system (CNS) tumors with poor prognosis in adults. The purpose of this study is
to develop a machine-learning based classification method using radio-mic
features of multi-parametric MRI to classify high-grade gliomas (HGG) and
low-grade gliomas (LGG). Methods: Multi-parametric MRI of 80 patients, 40 HGG
and 40 LGG, with gliomas from the MICCAI BRATs 2015 training database were used
in this study. Each patient's T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and Fluid
Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRIs as well as the tumor contours were
provided in the database. Using the given contours, radiomic features from all
four multi-parametric MRIs were extracted. Of these features, a feature
selection process using two-sample T-test and least absolute shrinkage,
selection operator (LASSO), and a feature correlation threshold was applied to
various combinations of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and FLAIR MRIs
separately. These selected features were then used to train, test, and
cross-validate a random forest to differentiate HGG and LGG. Finally, the
classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate
the classification method. Results: Optimized parameters showed that on
average, the overall accuracy of our classification method was 0.913 or 73 out
of 80 correct classifications, 36/40 for HGG and 37/40 for LGG, with an AUC of
0.956 based on the combination with FLAIR, T1, T1c and T2 MRIs. Conclusion:
This study shows that radio-mic features derived from multi-parametric MRI
could be used to accurately classify high and lower grade gliomas. The
radio-mic features from multi-parametric MRI in combination with even more
advanced machine learning methods may further elucidate the underlying tumor
biology and response to therapy.

that has become a very active field of research over the last decade in
theoretical computer science and machine learning. In this paradigm one assumes
there is a trusted curator who holds the data of individuals in a database and
the goal of privacy is to simultaneously protect individual data while allowing
the release of global characteristics of the database. In this setting we
introduce a general framework for parametric inference with differential
privacy guarantees. We first obtain differentially private estimators based on
bounded influence M-estimators by leveraging their gross-error sensitivity in
the calibration of a noise term added to them in order to ensure privacy. We
then show how a similar construction can also be applied to construct
differentially private test statistics analogous to the Wald, score and
likelihood ratio tests. We provide statistical guarantees for all our proposals
via an asymptotic analysis. An interesting consequence of our results is to
further clarify the connection between differential privacy and robust
statistics. In particular, we demonstrate that differential privacy is a weaker
stability requirement than infinitesimal robustness, and show that robust
M-estimators can be easily randomized in order to guarantee both differential
privacy and robustness towards the presence of contaminated data. We illustrate
our results both on simulated and real data.

sequential and interdependent markets represents a classic Stackelberg game and
relies on the exchange of sensitive information between the system agents,
including the supply and demand bids in each market or the characteristics of
the systems. The paper is motivated by the observation that traditional
differential privacy mechanisms are unsuitable for the problem of interest: The
perturbation introduced by these mechanisms fundamentally changes the
underlying optimization problem and even leads to unsatisfiable instances. To
remedy such limitation, the paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Stackelberg
Mechanism (PPSM), a framework that enforces the notions of consistency and
fidelity of the privacy-preserving information to the original problem
objective. The PPSM has strong properties: It complies with the notion of
differential privacy and ensures that the outcomes of the privacy-preserving
coordination mechanisms are close-to-optimality for each agent. The fidelity
property is analyzed by providing theoretical guarantees on the cost of privacy
of PPSM and experimental results on several gas and electricity market
benchmarks based on a real case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach.

governed by the harmonic resolvent, which is a linear operator similar to the
harmonic transfer function introduced by Wereley (1991). This approach makes it
possible to explicitly capture the triadic interactions that are responsible
for the energy transfer between different time scales in the flow. For
instance, perturbations at frequency $\alpha$ are coupled with perturbations at
frequency $\omega$ through the base flow at frequency $\omega-\alpha$. We draw
a connection with resolvent analsyis, which is a special case of the harmonic

control-affine systems which is subject to uncertainty. With the accessibility
to finite sample measurements of the uncertain variables, we aim to find
controls which are feasible and provide superior performance guarantees with
high probability. This results into the formulation of a stochastic
optimization problem (P), which is intractable due to the unknown distribution
of the uncertainty variables. By developing a distributionally robust
optimization framework, we present an equivalent and yet tractable
reformulation of (P). Further, we propose an efficient algorithm that provides
online suboptimal data-driven solutions and guarantees performance with high
probability. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we
consider a highway speed-limit control problem. We then develop a set of
data-driven speed controls that allow us to prevent traffic congestion with
high probability. Finally, we employ the resulting control method on a traffic
simulator to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach numerically.

typically through a dedicated app installed on a mobile device. Traditional
access control mechanisms consider one unique trusted user that controls the
access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings
pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For
instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and
dynamically changing demands on multiple devices, which cannot be handled by
traditional access control techniques. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce Kratos, a novel multiuser and multi-device-aware access
control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access
control demands. Kratos has three main components: user interaction module,
backend server, and policy manager. Users can specify their desired access
control settings using the interaction module which are translated into access
control policies in the backend server. The policy manager analyzes these
policies and initiates negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands
and generates final policies. We implemented Kratos and evaluated its
performance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with
a rich set of configurations (309 different policies including 213 demand
conflicts and 24 restriction policies). These configurations included five
different threats associated with access control mechanisms. Our extensive
evaluations show that Kratos is very effective in resolving conflicting access
control demands with minimal overhead and robust against different attacks.

the state-of-the-art of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains suffers from a
quadratic dependence on $k$: these protocols, exemplified by Ouroboros (Crypto
2017), Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017),
can only establish that depth $\Theta(k^2)$ is sufficient. Whether this
quadratic gap is an intrinsic limitation of PoS---due to issues such as the
nothing-at-stake problem---has been an urgent open question, as deployed PoS
blockchains further rely on consistency for protocol correctness.
  We give an axiomatic theory of blockchain dynamics that permits rigorous
reasoning about the longest-chain rule and achieve, in broad generality,

In particular, for the first time, we show that PoS protocols can match
proof-of-work protocols for linear consistency. We analyze the associated

this process, and derive tail bounds in both i.i.d. and martingale settings via

record. The most likely cause is massive volcanic activity associated with the
formation of the Permo-Triassic Siberian flood basalts. A proposed mechanism
for extinction due to this volcanic activity is depletion of stratospheric
ozone, leading to increased penetration of biologically damaging Solar
ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation to Earth's surface. Previous work has modeled the
atmospheric chemistry effects of volcanic emission at the end-Permian. Here we
use those results as input for detailed radiative transfer simulations to
investigate changes in surface-level Solar irradiance in the ultraviolet-B,
ultraviolet-A and photosynthetically available (visible light) wave bands. We
then evaluate the potential biological effects using biological weighting
functions. In addition to changes in ozone column density we also include
gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfate aerosols. Ours is the first such study
to include these factors and we find they have a significant impact on
transmission of Solar radiation through the atmosphere. Inclusion of SO2 and
aerosols greatly reduces the transmission of radiation across the ultraviolet

UVB. We conclude that claims of a UVB mechanism for this extinction are likely
overstated.

significant for the submillisecond and millisecond integrations obtainable by
AGILE. The sources are constrained to emit a MeV-fluence in the millisecond

Chen proved that for $n\geq 3k$, Kneser graphs are Hamiltonian. Similarly as
for graphs with Hajnal's and Szemer\'edi's result about a minimum degree

its solution for large graphs due to Koml\'os, S\'ark\""ozy, and Szemer\'edi,
the next step is to ask for clique factors and powers of Hamiltonian cycles in

regression modeling. Best subset selection (BS) is known to be NP-hard and has
a computational cost that grows exponentially with the number of predictors.
Recently, Bertsimas (2016) formulated BS as a mixed integer optimization (MIO)
problem and largely reduced the computation overhead by using a well-developed
optimization solver, but the current methodology is not scalable to very large
datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel LS-based method, the best
orthogonalized subset selection (BOSS) method, which performs BS upon an
orthogonalized basis of ordered predictors and scales easily to large problem
sizes. Another challenge in applying LS-based methods in practice is the
selection rule to choose the optimal subset size k. Cross-validation (CV)
requires fitting a procedure multiple times, and results in a selected k that
is random across repeated application to the same dataset. Compared to CV,
information criteria only require fitting a procedure once, but they require
knowledge of the effective degrees of freedom for the fitting procedure, which
is generally not available analytically for complex methods. Since BOSS uses
orthogonalized predictors, we first explore a connection for orthogonal
non-random predictors between BS and its Lagrangian formulation (i.e.,
minimization of the residual sum of squares plus the product of a
regularization parameter and k), and based on this connection propose a
heuristic degrees of freedom (hdf) for BOSS that can be estimated via an
analytically-based expression. We show in both simulations and real data
analysis that BOSS using a proposed Kullback-Leibler based information
criterion AICc-hdf has the strongest performance of all of the LS-based methods
considered and is competitive with regularization methods, with the
computational effort of a single ordinary LS fit.

having a robust single session/subject functional connectome is just the
starting point to subsequently assess network properties for characterizing
properties of integration, segregation and communicability, among others.
Naturally, one wonders if uncovering identifiability at the connectome level
also uncovers identifiability on the derived network properties. This also
raises the question of where to apply the If framework: on the connectivity
data or directly on each network measurement? Our work answers these questions
by exploring the differential identifiability profiles of network measures when
If is applied on 1) the functional connectomes, and 2) directly on derived
network measurements. Results show that improving across-session reliability of
FCs also improves reliability of derived network measures. We also find that,
for specific network properties, application of If directly on network
properties is more effective. Finally, we discover that applying the framework,
either way, increases task sensitivity of network properties. At a time when
the neuroscientific community is focused on subject-level inferences, this
framework is able to uncover FC fingerprints, which propagates to derived
network properties.

units to be realized from the defined constants through any applicable equation
of physics. In this new and more abstract SI, units can take on new guises ---
for example, the kilogram is at present best implemented as a derived
electrical unit. Relevant to astronomy, however, is that several formerly
non-SI units, such as electron-volts, light-seconds, and what we may call
""gravity seconds"" $GM/c^3$, can now be interpreted not as themselves units, but
as shorthand for volts and seconds being used with particular equations of
physics. Moreover, the classical astronomical units have exact and rather
convenient equivalents in the new SI: zero AB magnitude amounts to
$\simeq5\times10^{10}$ photons $\rm m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ per logarithmic frequency

eigensolver. The feasibility and performance of this algorithm depend
critically on the form of the wavefunction ansatz. Recently in Nat. Commun. 10,
3007 (2019), an algorithm termed ADAPT-VQE was introduced to build
system-adapted ans\""atze with substantially fewer variational parameters
compared to other approaches. This algorithm relies heavily on a predefined
operator pool with which it builds the ansatz. However, Nat. Commun. 10, 3007
(2019) did not provide a prescription for how to select the pool, how many
operators it must contain, or whether the resulting ansatz will succeed in
converging to the ground state. In addition, the pool used in that work leads
to state preparation circuits that are too deep for a practical application on
near-term devices. Here, we address all these key outstanding issues of the
algorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that
drastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to
contain the operators necessary to construct exact ans\""atze. Moreover, we show
that the minimal pool size that achieves this scales linearly with the number

we show that our algorithm (""qubit-ADAPT"") reduces the circuit depth by an

between the surface densities of star-formation rate (SFR) and gas, and
successfully explains plausible scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution.
However, star formation being a multi-scale process, requires
spatially-resolved analysis for a better understanding of the physics of star
formation. It has been shown that the removal of a diffuse background from SFR
tracers, such as H$\alpha$, far-ultraviolet (FUV), infrared, leads to an
increase in the slope of the sub-galactic Schmidt relation. We reinvestigate
the local Schmidt relations in nine nearby spiral galaxies taking into account
the effect of inclusion and removal of diffuse background in SFR tracers as
well as in the atomic gas.We used multiwavelength data obtained as part of the
surveys such as SINGS, KINGFISH, THINGS, and HERACLES. Making use of a novel
split of the overall light distribution as a function of spatial scale, we
subtracted the diffuse background in the SFR tracers as well as the atomic gas.
Using aperture photometry, we study the Schmidt relations on background
subtracted and unsubtracted data at physical scales varying between 0.5--2 kpc.
The fraction of diffuse background varies from galaxy to galaxy and accounts to
$\sim$34 % in H$\alpha$, $\sim$43 % in FUV, $\sim$37 % in 24 $\mu$m, and
$\sim$75\% in H I on average. We find that the inclusion of diffuse background
in SFR tracers leads to a linear molecular gas Schmidt relation and a bimodal
total gas Schmidt relation. However, the removal of diffuse background in SFR
tracers leads to a super-linear molecular gas Schmidt relation. A further
removal of the diffuse background from atomic gas results in a slope $\sim$1.4
$\pm$ 0.1, which agrees with dynamical models of star formation accounting for
flaring effects in the outer regions of galaxies.

surveys now allow to address. In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of
the ionised gas in 2778 galaxies at z $\sim$ 0.05 observed by SDSS-IV MaNGA.
Specifically, we measure the kinematics of the [OIII] {\lambda}5007{\AA}
emission line in each spatial element and fit multiple Gaussian components to
account for possible non-gravitational motions of gas. Comparing the kinematics
of the ionised gas between 308 MaNGA-selected AGN that have been previously
identified through emission line diagnostics and sources not classified as AGN,
we find that while 25% of MaNGA-selected AGN show [OIII] components with
emission line widths of $>$ 500 km/s in more than 10% of their spaxels, only 7%
of MaNGA non-AGN show a similar signature. Even the AGN that do not show
nuclear AGN photoionisation signatures and that were only identified as AGN
based on their larger scale photoionisation signatures show similar kinematic
characteristics. In addition to obscuration, another possibility is that
outflow and mechanical feedback signatures are longer lived than the AGN
itself. Our measurements demonstrate that high velocity gas is more prevalent
in AGN compared to non-AGN and that outflow and feedback signatures in
low-luminosity, low-redshift AGN may so far have been underestimated. We show
that higher luminosity MaNGA-selected AGN are able to drive larger scale
outflows than lower luminosity AGN. But estimates of the kinetic coupling
efficiencies are $<$ 1% and suggest that the feedback signatures probed in this
paper are unlikely to have a significant impact on the AGN host galaxies.
However, continuous energy injection may still heat a fraction of the cool gas
and delay or suppress star formation in individual galaxies even when the AGN
is weak.

convergence of nonparametric plug-in estimates of Cram\'er-von Mises and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics applied to value functions. For practical

establish local size control of tests which use the resampling procedure. Monte

two-dimensional supersymmetric Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory, i.e. the theory of a

The theory depends on a single dimensionless coupling $\bar{g}$, and is
expected to have a critical point at a tuned value $\bar{g}_*$ where it flows
in the IR to the Tricritical Ising Model (TIM); the theory spontaneously breaks
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on one side of this phase transition, and breaks
SUSY on the other side. We calculate the spectrum of energies as a function of
$\bar{g}$ and see the gap close as the critical point is approached, and
numerically read off the critical exponent $\nu$ in TIM. Beyond the critical
point, the gap remains nearly zero, in agreement with the expectation of a
massless Goldstino. We also study spectral functions of local operators on both
sides of the phase transition and compare to analytic predictions where
possible. In particular, we use the Zamolodchikov $C$-function to map the
entire phase diagram of the theory. Crucial to this analysis is the fact that
our truncation is able to preserve supersymmetry sufficiently to avoid any

and its upgrades. This would explain the mass of the $b-$quark, and the
tachyonic SM Higgs boson mass$^2$. The flavor texture problem is no longer
associated with the HY couplings, but rather is determined by the inverted
multi-Higgs boson mass spectrum, e.g., the lightest fermions are associated
with heaviest Higgs bosons and vice versa. The theory is no less technically
natural than the standard model. The discovery of $H_b$ at the LHC would
confirm the general compositeness idea of Higgs bosons and anticipate
additional states potentially accessible to the $100$ TeV $pp$ machine.

preserves their phase information, while using only the system's classical
dynamics as an input. Over the time an identification has been developed
between stationary phase approximation and semiclassical mechanics. Although it
is true that in most of the cases in semiclassical mechanics the significant
contributions come from the neighborhood of the stationary points, there are
some important exceptions to it. In this paper we address one of these
exceptions, occurring in the evaluation of the time evolution of the
expectation value of an operator. We explain why it is necessary to include
contributions which are not in the neighborhood of stationary points and
provide new semiclassical expressions for the evolution of the expectation
values. For our analysis we employ and discuss two major semiclassical tools.
The first one is the association of the quantum evolution of a wavefunction to
the classical evolution of a Lagrangian manifold, as done by Maslov. The second
one is the derivation of an expression for the semiclassical Wigner function
whose properties under canonical transformation are made explicit. Using the
canonical invariance of the formalism, we derive an expression for the
expectation value of observables for the one-dimensional case and then
generalize it to higher dimensions. We find that the expression can be written
as the sum of a classical contribution which corresponds to what is referred to
as the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) in the cold-atoms physics context,
or the Linearized Semiclassical Initial Value Representation(LSC-IVR) in
chemical or molecular physics, and additional terms associated with
interferences. Along the way, we get a deeper understanding of the origin of

heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium via charge exchange
collisions that convert ions into atoms and vice versa. So far, most studies of
interstellar atoms assumed that daughter hydrogen atoms directly inherit the
kinetic properties of parent protons. This assumption neglects angular
scattering of the interacting particles. However, for low relative velocities,
as expected for charge exchanges in the outer heliosheath, this scattering is
significant. In this study, we present how the parameters of daughter
populations depend on the relative velocity and temperatures of parent
populations. For this purpose, we numerically compute collision terms with and
without this scattering. We find that the secondary population of interstellar
hydrogen atoms, for the parent populations with the relative bulk velocity of
20 km s$^{-1}$ and equal temperatures of 7500 K, has ~2 km s$^{-1}$ higher bulk
velocity if the scattering is taken into account. Additionally, temperatures
are higher by ~2400 K and ~1200 K in parallel and perpendicular direction to
the relative motion of parent populations, respectively. Moreover, a
significant departure of secondary atoms from the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution is expected for high relative velocities of parent populations.
This process affects the distribution and density of interstellar atoms in the
heliosphere and production of pickup ions. Thus, we show that angular
scattering in charge exchange collisions is important to include in analyses of
interstellar neutral atoms and pickup ions observed at 1 au and in the outer
heliosphere.

the Cauchy Integral Formula has proven to be a corner stone of Clifford

In recent years, several new branches of Clifford analysis have emerged.
Similarly as hermitian Clifford analysis in euclidean space R^{2n} of even
dimension emerged as a refinement of euclidean Clifford analysis by introducing
a complex structure on R^{2n}, quaternionic Clifford analysis arose as a
further refinement by introducing a so--called hypercomplex structure Q, i.e.\
three complex structures (I, J, K) which submit to the quaternionic
multiplication rules, on R^{4p}, the dimension now being a fourfold. Two,
respectively four, differential operators lead to first order systems invariant
under the action of the respective symmetry groups U(n) and Sp(p). Their
simultaneous null solutions are called hermitian monogenic and quaternionic
monogenic functions respectively. In this contribution we further elaborate on
the Caychy Integral Formula for hermitian and quaternionic monogenic functions.
Moreover we establish Caychy integral formulae for osp(4|2)--monogenic

in quiescent gases, where an isolated hot spot is formed on a timescale shorter
than the chemical and acoustic timescales of the gas. In this work, we extend
the laminar temperature-gradient mechanism into a statistical model for
predicting the detonability of an autoignitive gas experiencing compressible
isotropic turbulence fluctuations. Compressible turbulence forms non-monotonic
temperature fields with tightly-spaced local minima and maxima that evolve over
a range of timescales, including those much larger than chemical and acoustic
timescales. We examine the utility of the adapted statistical model through
direct numerical simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence in premixed
hydrogen-air reactants for a range of conditions. We find strong, but not
conclusive, evidence that the model can predict the degree of detonability in
an autoignitive gas due to turbulence-induced thermodynamic gradients.

then enriched with the synthesised automaton so that the generation of a

DeepSynth's performance in a set of experiments that includes the Atari game

is Gaussian, doubly robust, and efficient in the limit, under the only

the proportion of embolic strokes of undetermined source arising from occult

resembles that observed in extreme debris disks, and is likely related to
short-lived dust of secondary origin, though variable shadowing from the inner

methods to compute the spectral norm of convolution layers either rely on
heuristics that are efficient in computation but lack guarantees or are
theoretically-sound but computationally expensive. In this work, we obtain the
best of both worlds by deriving {\it four} provable upper bounds on the
spectral norm of a standard 2D multi-channel convolution layer. These bounds
are differentiable and can be computed efficiently during training with
negligible overhead. One of these bounds is in fact the popular heuristic
method of Miyato et al. (multiplied by a constant factor depending on filter
sizes). Each of these four bounds can achieve the tightest gap depending on
convolution filters. Thus, we propose to use the minimum of these four bounds
as a tight, differentiable and efficient upper bound on the spectral norm of
convolution layers. We show that our spectral bound is an effective regularizer
and can be used to bound either the lipschitz constant or curvature values
(eigenvalues of the Hessian) of neural networks. Through experiments on MNIST

Higgs boson in the $\mu\tau$ and e$\tau$ decay modes is presented. The search
is based on proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} =$ 13
TeV collected with the CMS detector in 2016, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The $\tau$ leptons are reconstructed in the
leptonic and hadronic decay modes. No signal is observed in the mass range
200-900 GeV. At 95% confidence level, the observed (expected) upper limits on
the production cross section multiplied by the branching fraction vary from

  Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values","Accepted by AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is widely used in various domains,
such as meteorology and traffic. Due to limitations on data collection,
transmission, and storage, real-world MTS data usually contains missing values,
making it infeasible to apply existing MTS forecasting models such as linear
regression and recurrent neural networks. Though many efforts have been devoted
to this problem, most of them solely rely on local dependencies for imputing
missing values, which ignores global temporal dynamics. Local
dependencies/patterns would become less useful when the missing ratio is high,
or the data have consecutive missing values; while exploring global patterns
can alleviate such problems. Thus, jointly modeling local and global temporal
dynamics is very promising for MTS forecasting with missing values. However,
work in this direction is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem
of MTS forecasting with missing values by jointly exploring local and global
temporal dynamics. We propose a new framework LGnet, which leverages memory
network to explore global patterns given estimations from local perspectives.
We further introduce adversarial training to enhance the modeling of global
temporal distribution. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the
effectiveness of LGnet for MTS forecasting with missing values and its
robustness under various missing ratios.

areas of engineering, including structural, geotechnical, and petroleum

the numerical difficulties stem from the strong nonlinearities present in the
fluid equations as well as those associated with crack propagation, from the
quasi-static nature of the problem, and from the a priori unknown and
potentially intricate crack geometries that may arise. An additional challenge
is the need for large scale simulation owing to the mesh resolution
requirements and the expected 3D character of the problem in practical
applications. To address these challenges we model crack propagation with a
high-order hybrid discontinuous Galerkin / cohesive zone model framework, which
has proven massive scalability properties, and we model the lubrication flow
inside the propagating cracks using continuous finite elements, furnishing a
fully-coupled discretization of the solid and fluid equations. The parallel
approach for solving the linearized coupled problem consists of standard
iterative solvers based on domain decomposition. The resulting computational
approach provides the ability to conduct highly-resolved and quasi-static
simulations of fluid-driven fracture propagation with unspecified crack path.
We conduct a series of numerical tests to verify the computational framework
against known analytical solutions in the toughness and viscosity dominated
regimes and we demonstrate its performance in terms of robustness and parallel
scalability, enabling simulations of several million degrees of freedom on

the in situ, final stage assembly of multi-planet systems via the collisional
accretion of protoplanets. Our initial conditions are constructed using a
subset of the Kepler 5-planet systems as templates. Two different prescriptions
for treating planetary collisions are adopted. The simulations address numerous
questions: do the results depend on the accretion prescription?; do the
resulting systems resemble the Kepler systems, and do they reproduce the
observed distribution of planetary multiplicities when synthetically observed?;
do collisions lead to significant modification of protoplanet compositions, or
to stripping of gaseous envelopes?; do the eccentricity distributions agree
with those inferred for the Kepler planets? We find the accretion prescription
is unimportant in determining the outcomes. The final planetary systems look
broadly similar to the Kepler templates adopted, but the observed distributions
of planetary multiplicities or eccentricities are not reproduced, because
scattering does not excite the systems sufficiently. In addition, we find that
$\sim 1$% of our final systems contain a co-orbital planet pair in horseshoe or
tadpole orbits. Post-processing the collision outcomes suggests they would not
significantly change the ice fractions of initially ice-rich protoplanets, but
significant stripping of gaseous envelopes appears likely. Hence, it may be
difficult to reconcile the observation that many low mass Kepler planets have
H/He envelopes with an in situ formation scenario that involves giant impacts
after dispersal of the gas disc.

assembly histories are characterised by episodic mergers and interactions with
other haloes. An accurate description of this process will provide insights
into the dynamical evolution of haloes and the galaxies that reside in them.
Using large cosmological N-body simulations, we characterise halo orbits to
study the interactions between substructure haloes and their hosts, and how
different evolutionary histories map to different classes of orbits. We use two
new software tools - WhereWolf, which uses halo group catalogues and merger
trees to ensure that haloes are tracked accurately in dense environments, and
OrbWeaver, which quantifies each halo's orbital parameters. We demonstrate how
WhereWolf improves the accuracy of halo merger trees, and we use OrbWeaver to
quantify orbits of haloes. We assess how well analytical prescriptions for the
merger timescale from the literature compare to measured merger timescales from
our simulations and find that existing prescriptions perform well, provided the
ratio of substructure-to-host mass is not too small. In the limit of small
substructure-to-host mass ratio, we find that the prescriptions can
overestimate the merger timescales substantially, such that haloes are
predicted to survive well beyond the end of the simulation. This work
highlights the need for a revised analytical prescription for the merger
timescale that more accurately accounts for processes such as catastrophic
tidal disruption.

have been widely used in data mining and knowledge discovery with noticeable
advantages. However, clustering algorithms based on density peak have limited
clustering effect on data with varying density distribution (VDD), equilibrium
distribution (ED), and multiple domain-density maximums (MDDM), leading to the
problems of sparse cluster loss and cluster fragmentation. To address these
problems, we propose a Domain-Adaptive Density Clustering (DADC) algorithm,
which consists of three steps: domain-adaptive density measurement, cluster
center self-identification, and cluster self-ensemble. For data with VDD
features, clusters in sparse regions are often neglected by using uniform
density peak thresholds, which results in the loss of sparse clusters. We
define a domain-adaptive density measurement method based on K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) to adaptively detect the density peaks of different density
regions. We treat each data point and its KNN neighborhood as a subgroup to
better reflect its density distribution in a domain view. In addition, for data
with ED or MDDM features, a large number of density peaks with similar values
can be identified, which results in cluster fragmentation. We propose a cluster
center self-identification and cluster self-ensemble method to automatically
extract the initial cluster centers and merge the fragmented clusters.
Experimental results demonstrate that compared with other comparative
algorithms, the proposed DADC algorithm can obtain more reasonable clustering
results on data with VDD, ED and MDDM features. Benefitting from a few
parameter requirements and non-iterative nature, DADC achieves low
computational complexity and is suitable for large-scale data clustering.

their ability to increase the secret key rate for certain CV-QKD protocols.
However, most previous studies on such protocols are carried out in a

multi-mode components in frequency space. In this work we investigate the use
of non-Gaussian operations in a multi-mode CV-QKD system. Our main finding is
that, contrary to single-mode CV-QKD systems, in generic multi-mode CV-QKD
systems it is possible to use non-Gaussian operations to increase the optimized
secret key rate. More specifically, we find that at losses of order 30dB, which
represents a distance of order 160km and the effective maximum distance for
CV-QKD, the key rate for multi-mode non-Gaussian operations can be orders of
magnitude higher than single-mode operations. Our results are important for
real-world CV-QKD systems especially those dependent on quantum error

partially inspired by the theory of graph Laplacian, to study recent popular

inherits the virtues of spectral methods, graph algorithms designed using
weighted Laplacian will necessarily possess more robust theoretical guarantees
for algorithmic performances, comparing with those existing algorithms that are
heuristically proposed. In order to illustrate its powerful utility both in
theory and in practice, we also present two effective applications of our
weighted Laplacian method to multilevel graph partitioning and balanced minimum
cut problem, respectively. By means of variational methods and theory of
partial differential equations (PDEs), we have established the equivalence
relations among the weighted cut problem, balanced minimum cut problem and the
initial clustering problem that arises in the middle stage of graph
partitioning algorithms under a multilevel structure. These equivalence
relations can indeed provide solid theoretical support for algorithms based on
our proposed weighted Laplacian strategy. Moreover, from the perspective of the
application to the balanced minimum cut problem, weighted Laplacian can make it
possible for research of numerical solutions of PDEs to be a powerful tool for
the algorithmic study of graph problems. Experimental results also indicate
that the algorithm embedded with our strategy indeed outperforms other existing

However, it is cost- and time-consuming to experimentally screen synergistic

computational methods have become an important way to predict and prioritize

  Results: We proposed a Deep Tensor Factorization (DTF) model, which
integrated a tensor factorization method and a deep neural network (DNN), to
predict drug synergy. The former extracts latent features from drug synergy
information while the latter constructs a binary classifier to predict the drug
synergy status. Compared to the tensor-based method, the DTF model performed
better in predicting drug synergy. The area under the precision-recall curve
(PR AUC) was 0.57 for DTF and 0.24 for the tensor method. We also compared the
DTF model with DeepSynergy and logistic regression models and found that the
DTF outperformed the logistic regression model and achieved almost the same
performance as DeepSynergy using several typical metrics for the classification
task. Applying the DTF model to predict missing entries in our drug-cell line
tensor, we identified novel synergistic drug combinations for 10 cell lines
from the 5 cancer types. A literature survey showed that some of these
predicted drug synergies have been identified in vivo or in vitro. Thus, the
DTF model could be valuable in silico tool for prioritizing novel synergistic
drug combinations.

substantially increased near-field radiative heat transfer between asymmetric

integrating the drug-drug combination, drug-protein interaction, and
protein-protein interaction networks. We found that the GCN model was able to
correctly predict cell line-specific synergistic drug combinations from a large
heterogonous network. The majority (30) of the 39 cell line-specific models
show an area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) larger

referred to as the edge currents, are independent on the conductivity of the
sample which is why they can be conveniently described within the thermodynamic
approach. They can be related to the Landau thermodynamic potential for an
infinite system. We demonstrate that the observable manifestation of this,

magnetic field measured in the center of the disk as a function of the external
field. The oscillations depend on the temperature difference at the edges of
the disk. Dirac fermions and 2D electrons with a parabolic spectrum are

clinic use. Many studies have explored an interactive strategy to improve the
image segmentation performance by iteratively incorporating user hints.
However, the dynamic process for successive interactions is largely ignored. We
here propose to model the dynamic process of iterative interactive image
segmentation as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement
learning (RL). Unfortunately, it is intractable to use single-agent RL for
voxel-wise prediction due to the large exploration space. To reduce the
exploration space to a tractable size, we treat each voxel as an agent with a
shared voxel-level behavior strategy so that it can be solved with multi-agent
reinforcement learning. An additional advantage of this multi-agent model is to
capture the dependency among voxels for segmentation task. Meanwhile, to enrich
the information of previous segmentations, we reserve the prediction
uncertainty in the state space of MDP and derive an adjustment action space
leading to a more precise and finer segmentation. In addition, to improve the
efficiency of exploration, we design a relative cross-entropy gain-based reward
to update the policy in a constrained direction. Experimental results on
various medical datasets have shown that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, with the advantage of fewer interactions and

  Supremacy",,,,,"quant-ph cs.CC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent Google's claim on breakthrough in quantum computing is a gong
signal for further analysis of foundational roots of (possible) superiority of
some quantum algorithms over the corresponding classical algorithms. This note
is a step in this direction. We start with critical analysis of rather common
reference to entanglement and quantum nonlocality as the basic sources of
quantum superiority. We elevate the role of the Bohr's {\it principle of
complementarity}\footnote{} (PCOM) by interpreting the Bell-experiments as
statistical tests of this principle. (Our analysis also includes comparison of
classical vs genuine quantum entanglements.) After a brief presentation of PCOM
and endowing it with the information interpretation, we analyze its
computational counterpart. The main implication of PCOM is that by using the
quantum representation of probability, one need not compute the joint
probability distribution (jpd) for observables involved in the process of
computation. Jpd's calculation is exponentially time consuming. Consequently,
classical probabilistic algorithms involving calculation of jpd for $n$ random
variables can be over-performed by quantum algorithms (for big values of $n).$
Quantum algorithms are based on quantum probability calculus. It is crucial
that the latter modifies the classical formula of total probability (FTP).
Probability inference based on the quantum version of FTP leads to constructive
interference of probabilities increasing probabilities of some events. We also
stress the role the basic feature of the genuine quantum superposition
comparing with the classical wave superposition: generation of discrete events
in measurements on superposition states. Finally, the problem of superiority of
quantum computations is coupled with the quantum measurement problem and
linearity of dynamics of the quantum state update.

rather than forecast future, environmental and socioeconomic indicators of
drought, and hence are not always sufficiently timely to be effective in
practice. Here we present a novel method for forecasting satellite-based
indicators of vegetation condition. Specifically, we focused on the 3-month
Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) over pastoral livelihood zones in Kenya,
which is the indicator used by the Kenyan National Drought Management
Authority(NDMA). Using data from MODIS and Landsat, we apply linear
autoregression and Gaussian process modeling methods and demonstrate high
forecasting skill several weeks ahead. As a benchmark we predicted the drought
alert marker used by NDMA (VCI3M<35). Both of our models were able to predict
this alert marker four weeks ahead with a hit rate of around 89% and a false
alarm rate of around 4%, or 81% and 6% respectively six weeks ahead. The
methods developed here can thus identify a deteriorating vegetation condition
well and sufficiently in advance to help disaster risk managers act early to
support vulnerable communities and limit the impact of a drought hazard.

one direction to each edge of $G$. Converting two-way traffic networks to
one-way traffic networks and bidirectional communication networks to
unidirectional communication networks are practical instances of graph
orientations. In these contexts minimising the diameter of the resulting
oriented graph is of prime interest.
  The $n$-star network topology was proposed as an alternative to the hypercube
network topology for multiprocessor systems by Akers and Krishnamurthy [IEEE
Trans. on Computers (1989)]. The $n$-star graph $S_n$ consists of $n!$
vertices, each labelled with a distinct permutation of $[n]$. Two vertices are
adjacent if their labels differ exactly in the first and one other position.
$S_n$ is an $(n-1)$-regular, vertex-transitive graph with diameter $\lfloor
3(n-1)/2 \rfloor$. Orientations of $S_n$, called unidirectional star graphs and
distributed routing protocols over them were studied by Day and Tripathi
[Information Processing Letters (1993)] and Fujita [The First International
Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR 2013)]. Fujita showed that the
(directed) diameter of this unidirectional star graph $\overrightarrow{S_n}$ is
at most $\lceil{5n/2}\rceil + 2$.
  In this paper, we propose a new distributed routing algorithm for the same
$\overrightarrow{S_n}$ analysed by Fujita, which routes a packet from any node
$s$ to any node $t$ at an undirected distance $d$ from $s$ using at most
$\min\{4d+4, 2n+4\}$ hops. This shows that the (directed) diameter of
$\overrightarrow{S_n}$ is at most $2n+4$. We also show that the diameter of
$\overrightarrow{S_n}$ is at least $2n$ when $n \geq 7$, thereby showing that
our upper bound is tight up to an additive factor.

important limitations. For example, it failed to restrict the gauge group and
the matter sector in a powerful way. After discussing its effectiveness, we
upgrade it to make room for quantum gravity. The unitarity assumption is better
understood, since it allows for the presence of physical particles as well as
fake particles (fakeons). The locality assumption is applied to an interim
classical action, since the true classical action is nonlocal and emerges from
the quantization and a later process of classicization. The renormalizability
assumption is refined to single out the special role of the gauge couplings. We
show that the upgraded principle leads to an essentially unique theory of
quantum gravity. In particular, in four dimensions, a fakeon of spin 2,
together with a scalar field, is able to make the theory renormalizable while
preserving unitarity. We offer an overview of quantum field theories of

four filters (Y, J, H, Ks), available for 297 of these candidates, allow a
reliable comparison with the laboratory data of howardite, eucrite, and
diogenite meteorites.
  We found that the majority of the basaltic candidates ($\approx$ 95$\%$) are
located in the inner main belt, while only 29 ($\approx$ 4$\%$) and 8
($\approx$ 1$\%$) are located in the middle and outer main belt, respectively.
A fraction of $\approx$ 33$\%$ from the V-type candidates is associated with
the Vesta family (with respect to AstDyS). We also identified four middle main
belt V-type candidates belonging to (15) Eunomia family, and another four low
inclination ones corresponding to (135) Hertha.
  We report differences between the color indices and albedo distributions of

that tolerate costly DRAM accesses. Though hardware prefetching is one of the
fundamental mechanisms prevalent on most of the commercial machines, there is
no prefetching technique that works well across all the access patterns and
different types of workloads. Through this paper, we propose Arsenal, a
prefetching framework which allows the advantages provided by different data
prefetchers to be combined, by dynamically selecting the best-suited prefetcher
for the current workload. Thus effectively improving the versatility of the
prefetching system. It bases on the classic Sandbox prefetcher that dynamically
adapts and utilizes multiple offsets for sequential prefetchers. We take it to
the next step by switching between prefetchers like Multi look Ahead Offset
Prefetching and Timing SKID Prefetcher on the run. Arsenal utilizes a
space-efficient pooling filter, Bloom filters, that keeps track of useful
prefetches of each of these component prefetchers and thus helps to maintain a
score for each of the component prefetchers. This approach is shown to provide
better speedup than anyone prefetcher alone. Arsenal provides a performance
improvement of 44.29% on the single-core mixes and 19.5% for some of the
selected 25 representative multi-core mixes.

represented or transmitted from multiple views. Most of the existing algorithms
are graph-based ones to learn the complex structures within multiview data but
overlooked the information within data representations. Furthermore, many
existing works treat multiple views discriminatively by introducing some
hyperparameters, which is undesirable in practice. To this end, abundant
multiview based methods have been proposed for dimension reduction. However,
there are still no research to leverage the existing work into a unified
framework. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a general framework
for multiview data dimension reduction, named Kernelized Multiview Subspace
Analysis (KMSA). It directly handles the multi-view feature representation in
the kernel space, which provides a feasible channel for direct manipulations on
multiview data with different dimensions. Meanwhile, compared with those
graph-based methods, KMSA can fully exploit information from multiview data
with nothing to lose. Furthermore, since different views have different
influences on KMSA, we propose a self-weighted strategy to treat different
views discriminatively according to their contributions. A co-regularized term
is proposed to promote the mutual learning from multi-views. KMSA combines
self-weighted learning with the co-regularized term to learn appropriate
weights for all views. We also discuss the influence of the parameters in KMSA
regarding the weights of multi-views. We evaluate our proposed framework on 6
multiview datasets for classification and image retrieval. The experimental
results validate the advantages of our proposed method.

identical agents interacting on a directed graph topology. The agents are
considered to have general continuous linear time-invariant dynamics with
homogeneous communication and/or control delays. An LMI approach based on a
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed, together with the synchronizing
region concept, which decouples the single-agent dynamics from the detailed
graph topology. Moreover, the conventional notion of synchronizing region is
here extended by an LMI relaxation utilizing quasi-convex characteristic of the
problem. This leads to less conservative results for the region of graph matrix
eigenvalues in the complex domain, where the synchronization is guaranteed. The
proposed method to calculate the allowable delay bound for synchronization is
also less conservative as compared to the results from the literature.
Furthermore, two designs for distributed state-feedback control are suggested.
The precise delay value and the detailed graph topology need not be known for
their application; it suffices only to know the upper bound on the delay and
the approximate region where the Laplacian eigenvalues lie. Specific
improvements over the results existing in the literature are demonstrated by a
numerical example, which validates the proposed approaches.

showed that maximum Cu uptake was obtained by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
metal uptake was dependent on the type of biosorbent with different
accumulation affinities toward the tested chemical form of the copper. Cells
harvested at exponential growth phase showed slightly higher Cu uptake than at
stationary phase, which reflect that the Cu uptake is metabolism
dependent-process. The increasing order of affinity of the cupric chloride and
cupric sulphate towards the three genera were almost constant. However, where
cupric nitrate was used, the copper uptake behavior in Pseudomonas aeroginosa
was not changed from those results with the other two chemical forms, whereas
with E. aerogenes & B. thuringiensis, different Cu uptake behaviors were
observed. In B. thuengenesis, the copper uptake rate as a function of initial
Cu concentration were shown to increase with increasing the initial
concentration of Cu, constantly above 320 ppm as compared with others. In
Enterobacter with cupric nitrate, different bahavior was also shown in which
the copper uptake decline sharply beyond the 320 ppm. These results reflect

segmentation, there have been a few attempts to develop the segmentation model
in the few-shot learning paradigm. However, most existing methods only focus on
the traditional 1-way segmentation setting (i.e., one image only contains a
single object). This is far away from practical semantic segmentation tasks
where the K-way setting (K>1) is usually required by performing the accurate
multi-object segmentation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the few-shot
semantic segmentation task as a learning-based pixel classification problem and
propose a novel framework called MetaSegNet based on meta-learning. In
MetaSegNet, an architecture of embedding module consisting of the global and
local feature branches is developed to extract the appropriate meta-knowledge
for the few-shot segmentation. Moreover, we incorporate a linear model into
MetaSegNet as a base learner to directly predict the label of each pixel for
the multi-object segmentation. Furthermore, our MetaSegNet can be trained by
the episodic training mechanism in an end-to-end manner from scratch.
Experiments on two popular semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., PASCAL VOC and
COCO, reveal the effectiveness of the proposed MetaSegNet in the K-way few-shot
semantic segmentation task.

over-complete molecular basis set is pruned by a pivoted Cholesky decomposition
of the overlap matrix, yielding an optimal low-rank approximation that is
numerically stable; the pivot indices determining a reduced basis set that is
complete enough to describe all the basis functions in the original

modification to the usual canonical orthogonalization procedure, which hides
the excess functions and yields fewer efficiency benefits, or by generating
custom basis sets for all the atoms in the system, yielding significant cost
reductions in electronic structure calculations. The pruned basis sets from the
latter choice allow accurate calculations to be performed at a lower cost even
at the self-consistent field level, as illustrated on a solvated (H2O)24-

mean and variance shifts caused by full-spatial FN limit the image inpainting
network training and we propose a spatial region-wise normalization named
Region Normalization (RN) to overcome the limitation. RN divides spatial pixels
into different regions according to the input mask, and computes the mean and
variance in each region for normalization. We develop two kinds of RN for our
image inpainting network: (1) Basic RN (RN-B), which normalizes pixels from the
corrupted and uncorrupted regions separately based on the original inpainting
mask to solve the mean and variance shift problem; (2) Learnable RN (RN-L),
which automatically detects potentially corrupted and uncorrupted regions for
separate normalization, and performs global affine transformation to enhance
their fusion. We apply RN-B in the early layers and RN-L in the latter layers
of the network respectively. Experiments show that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We further
generalize RN to other inpainting networks and achieve consistent performance

done in the GeV-TeV range, energy-dependent delays (spectral lags) are searched
for, usually neglecting any source-intrinsic time delay. With the aim being to
distinguish lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects from lags generated at
the sources themselves, a detailed investigation into intrinsic spectral lags
in flaring AGNs above 100 GeV is presented in the frame of
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) scenarios for their very-high-energy (VHE)
emission. A simple model of VHE flares in blazars is proposed, allowing to
explore the influence of the main physical parameters describing the emitting
zones on intrinsic delays. For typical conditions expected in TeV blazars,
significant intrinsic lags are obtained, which can dominate over LIV effects,
especially at low redshifts, and should therefore be carefully disentangled
from any extrinsic lags. Moreover, two main regimes are identified with
characteristic spectral lags, corresponding to long-lasting and fast particle
acceleration. Such intrinsic spectral lags should be detected with
new-generation instruments at VHE such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array which
begins operation in a few years. This will provide original constraints on AGN
flare models and open a new era for LIV searches in the photon sector.

materials have attracted considerable research interest because of their
potential in fabricating materials with specifically-designed properties.
Chemical vapor deposition has proved to be an efficient and scalable
fabrication method. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding has hampered
efforts to control the fabrication process beyond empirical trial-and-error
approaches. In this paper, we develop a general multiscale Burton-Cabrera-Frank
(BCF) type model of the vertical growth of 2D materials to predict the
necessary growth conditions for vertical versus in-plane (monolayer) growth of
arbitrarily-shaped layers. This extends previous work where we developed such a
model assuming the layers were fully-faceted (Ye et al., ACS Nano, 11,
12780-12788, 2017). To solve the model numerically, we reformulate the system
using the phase-field/diffuse domain method that enables the equations to be
solved in a fixed regular domain. We use a second-order accurate, adaptive
finite-difference/nonlinear multigrid algorithm to discretize and solve the
discrete system. We investigate the effect of parameters, including the van der
Waals interaction energies between the layers, the kinetic attachment rates,
the edge-energies and the deposition flux, on layer growth and morphologies.
While the conditions that favor vertical growth generally follow an analytic
thermodynamic criterion we derived for circular layers, the layer boundaries
may develop significant curvature during growth, consistent with experimental
observations. Our approach provides a mechanistic framework for controlling and
optimizing the growth multilayered 2D materials.

facial video hallucination. It is implemented by making full usage of preceding
super-resolved frames and a temporal window of adjacent low-resolution frames.
Specifically, the algorithm first obtains the initial high-resolution inference
of each frame by taking into consideration a sequence of consecutive
low-resolution inputs through temporal consistency modelling. It further
recurrently exploits the reconstructed results and intermediate features of a
sequence of preceding frames to improve the initial super-resolution of the
current frame by modelling the coherence of structural facial features across
frames. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our

beneficial for many applications. Moreover, jointly solving both angular and
spatial super-resolution problem also introduces new possibilities in light
field imaging. The conventional method relies on physical-based rendering and a
secondary network to solve the angular super-resolution problem. In addition,
pixel-based loss limits the network capability to infer scene geometry
globally. In this paper, we show that both super-resolution problems can be
solved jointly from a single image by proposing a single end-to-end deep neural
network that does not require a physical-based approach. Two novel loss
functions based on known light field domain knowledge are proposed to enable
the network to preserve the spatio-angular consistency between sub-aperture
images. Experimental results show that the proposed model successfully
synthesizes dense high resolution light field and it outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both quantitative and qualitative criteria. The
method can be generalized to arbitrary scenes, rather than focusing on a
particular subject. The synthesized light field can be used for various
applications, such as depth estimation and refocusing.

Observed higher strength of the crusts is mostly due to surface tension between
the solid particles which are connected by liquid bridges (connate water).
Qualitative (FTIR) and quantitative (TGA) measurements confirm the presence of
trapped water within the crust. Amount of the trapped water was ~1.5% (this is
about 10 times higher than in the samples with caking) which was confirmed
using SEM images. Further, in the fixed particle sizes case, the crust
thickness varied slightly (10-20 particle diameters only for cases with
external heating) while with the natural sand whole porous column was crusted;
surprisingly, crust was also found with the hydrophobic glass beads.
Fluorescein dye visualization technique was used to determine the crust
thickness. We give a power law relation between the crust thickness and the
incident heat flux for various particle sizes. The strength of the crust
decreases drastically with increasing hydrophilic spheres diameter while it
increases with higher surface temperature.

popular approach for detecting differences between healthy and clinical

must undergo several preprocessing steps to control for artifacts and to
improve data quality. However, preprocessing may affect the results in an
undesirable way. Spatial smoothing, for example, is known to alter functional
network structure. Yet, its effects on group-level network differences remain
unknown.
  Here, we investigate the effects of spatial smoothing on the difference
between patients and controls for two clinical conditions: autism spectrum
disorder and bipolar disorder, considering fMRI data smoothed with Gaussian
kernels (0-32 mm).
  We find that smoothing affects network differences between groups. For
weighted networks, incrementing the smoothing kernel makes networks more
different. For thresholded networks, larger smoothing kernels lead to more
similar networks, although this depends on the network density. Smoothing also
alters the effect sizes of the individual link differences. This is independent
of the ROI size, but vary with link length.
  The effects of spatial smoothing are diverse, non-trivial, and difficult to
predict. This has important consequences: the choice of smoothing kernel
affects the observed network differences.

prevalent. Standard methods for directly measuring power availability are
complex, often inaccurate, and are prone to attack. This paper explores an
alternative approach to identifying power outages through intelligent
monitoring of IP address availability. In finding these outages, we explore the
trade-off between the accuracy of detection and false alarms.
  We begin by experimentally demonstrating that static, residential Internet
connections serve as good indicators of power, as they are mostly active unless
power fails and rarely have battery backups. We construct metrics that
dynamically score the reliability of each residential IP, where a higher score
indicates a higher correlation between that IP's availability and its regional
power. We monitor specifically selected subsets of residential IPs and evaluate
the accuracy with which they can indicate current county power status.
  Using data gathered during the power outages caused by Hurricane Florence, we
demonstrate that we can track power outages at different granularities, state
and county, in both sparse and dense regions. By comparing our detection with
the reports gathered from power utility companies, we achieve an average
detection accuracy of $90\%$, where we also show some of our false alarms and
missed outage events could be due to imperfect ground truth data. Therefore,
our method can be used as a complementary technique of power outage detection.

exists redundant information between different interaction patterns between
nodes. Recent research reveals the analogy between the community structure and
the hyperbolic coordinate. To learn each node's effective embedding
representation while reducing the redundancy of multiplex network, we then
propose a unified framework combing multiplex network hyperbolic embedding and
multiplex community detection. The intuitive rationale is that high order node
embedding approach is expected to alleviate the observed network's sparse and
noisy structure which will benefit the community detection task. On the
contrary, the improved community structure will also guide the node embedding
task. To incorporate the common features between channels while preserving
unique features, a random walk approach which traversing in latent multiplex
hyperbolic space is proposed to detect the community across channels and bridge
the connection between node embedding and community detection. The proposed

Confinement Fusion (ICF) reactor chamber due to energy deposition of the prompt
X-rays and ion debris in the first wall. These dense plasmas are encountered in
many other applications as well. The design and optimization of such
lithium-based applications requires information about the thermodynamic
properties of Li fluid over a wide range of parameters including the
high-energy-density regime. A model that takes into account all essential
features of strongly-coupled plasmas of metal vapors is developed and used to
predict the equation-of-state (EOS), critical constants, thermodynamic
functions, and principal shock Hugoniot of hot dense lithium fluid. Predictions
and computational results from the present model are analyzed and presented and
are available in electronic form suitable for use to interested researchers and
scientists.
