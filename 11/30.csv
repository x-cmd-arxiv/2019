  Letters A",,"10.1142/S0217732320300025",,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We review some recent work by Carone, Erlich and Vaman on composite gravitons
in metric-independent quantum field theories, with the aim of clarifying a
number of basic issues. Focusing on a theory of scalar fields presented
previously in the literature, we clarify the meaning of the tunings required to
obtain a massless graviton. We argue that this formulation can be interpreted
as the massless limit of a theory of massive composite gravitons in which the
graviton mass term is not of Pauli-Fierz form. We then suggest closely related
theories that can be defined without such a limiting procedure (and hence
without worry about possible ghosts). Finally, we comment on the importance of
finding a compelling ultraviolet completion for models of this type, and
discuss some possibilities.

baths, whose action on the dynamics conserves the volume and the momentum,
while energy is exchanged with the heat baths in such way that, in equilibrium,
the system is at a given temperature $T$. We study the space empirical profiles

the size of the system growth to be infinite, with the boundary tension
changing slowly in the macroscopic time scale. We prove that the probability
distributions of these profiles concentrate on $L^2$-valued weak solutions of
the isothermal Euler equations (i.e. the non-linear wave equation, also called

inequality between the work done by the boundary force and the change of the
total free energy in the system. This result includes the shock regime of the

an optical biopsy, providing real-time microscopic images, via a probe. pCLE
probes consist of multiple optical fibres arranged in a bundle, which taken
together generate signals in an irregularly sampled pattern. Current pCLE
reconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled
Cartesian grid, using a naive linear interpolation. It was shown that
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could improve pCLE image quality. Although
classical CNNs were applied to pCLE, input data were limited to reconstructed
images in contrast to irregular data produced by pCLE. Methods: We compare pCLE
reconstruction and super-resolution (SR) methods taking irregularly sampled or
reconstructed pCLE images as input. We also propose to embed a Nadaraya-Watson
(NW) kernel regression into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer.
Using the NW layer and exemplar-based super-resolution, we design an NWNetSR
architecture that allows for reconstructing high-quality pCLE images directly
from the irregularly sampled input data. We created synthetic sparse pCLE
images to evaluate our methodology. Results: The results were validated through
an image quality assessment based on a combination of the following metrics:
Peak signal-to-noise ratio, the Structural Similarity Index. Conclusion: Both
dense and sparse CNNs outperform the reconstruction method currently used in
the clinic. The main contributions of our study are a comparison of sparse and

NW kernel regression, and adaptation of synthetic data for training pCLE SR.

non-regular tessellations promise unprecedented structure-property
relationships for a wide spectrum of applications in fields ranging from
optoelectronics to surface technology. Yet, despite numerous computational
studies predicting the emergence of exotic structures from simple interparticle
interactions, the experimental realization of non-hexagonal patterns remains
challenging. Not only kinetic limitations often hinder structural relaxation,
but also programming the inteparticle interactions during assembly, and hence
the target structure, remains an elusive task. Here, we demonstrate how a
single type of soft polymeric microparticle (microgels) can be assembled into a
wide array of complex structures as a result of simple pairwise interactions.
We first let microgels self-assemble at a water-oil interface into a
hexagonally packed monolayer, which we then compress to varying degrees and
deposit onto a solid substrate. By repeating this process twice, we find that
the resultant structure is not the mere stacking of two hexagonal patterns. The
first monolayer retains its hexagonal structure and acts as a template into
which the particles of the second monolayer rearrange to occupy interstitial
positions. The frustration between the two lattices generates new symmetries.
By simply varying the packing fraction of the two monolayers, we obtain not
only low-coordination structures such as rectangular and honeycomb lattices,
but also rhomboidal, hexagonal, and herringbone superlattices which display
non-regular tessellations. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these
structures are thermodynamically stable and develop from short-ranged repulsive
interactions, making them easy to predict, and thus opening new avenues to the
rational design of complex patterns.

  Statistics or Normalization","under review at ECAI2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep convolutional neural networks are known to be unstable during training
at high learning rate unless normalization techniques are employed. Normalizing
weights or activations allows the use of higher learning rates, resulting in
faster convergence and higher test accuracy. Batch normalization requires
minibatch statistics that approximate the dataset statistics but this incurs
additional compute and memory costs and causes a communication bottleneck for
distributed training. Weight normalization and initialization-only schemes do
not achieve comparable test accuracy.
  We introduce a new understanding of the cause of training instability and
provide a technique that is independent of normalization and minibatch
statistics. Our approach treats training instability as a spatial common mode
signal which is suppressed by placing the model on a channel-wise zero-mean
isocline that is maintained throughout training. Firstly, we apply channel-wise
zero-mean initialization of filter kernels with overall unity kernel magnitude.
At each training step we modify the gradients of spatial kernels so that their
weighted channel-wise mean is subtracted in order to maintain the common mode
rejection condition. This prevents the onset of mean shift. This new technique
allows direct training of the test graph so that training and test models are
identical. We also demonstrate that injecting random noise throughout the
network during training improves generalization. This is based on the idea
that, as a side effect, batch normalization performs deep data augmentation by
injecting minibatch noise due to the weakness of the dataset approximation.
  Our technique achieves higher accuracy compared to batch normalization and
for the first time shows that minibatches and normalization are unnecessary for
state-of-the-art training.

that the standard equal-area principle fails to select these solutions in
general, and therefore we introduce a generalized equal-area principle which
always selects the weak solution corresponding to the correct convex envelope.
The resulting numerical scheme presented here relies on the area-preserving
parametric interpolation framework introduced in [14] and locates shock
position to fifth order in space, conserves area exactly and admits weak
solutions which satisfy the Oleinik entropy condition numerically regardless of
the initial states.

are small. Both are outperforming a naive seasonal random walk model. Although
the performance degrades with increasing prediction horizon, the model shows a
performance gain of over 150% at a prediction horizon of 60 minutes compared
with the naive model. Furthermore, it is shown that predicting the in- and
outflux is a far more difficult task (i.e. performance gains of 30%) which
needs more training data, not based exclusively on occupancy rate. However, the
performance of predicting in- and outflux is less sensitive to the prediction

quality in terms of linguistics and literalness. Based on a multi-task learning
scheme, QA-MLM is able to determine whether polishing is needed based on the
poem draft. Furthermore, QAMLM is able to localize improper characters of the
poem draft and substitute with newly predicted ones accordingly. Benefited from
the masked language model structure, QAMLM incorporates global context
information into the polishing process, which can obtain more appropriate
polishing results than the unidirectional sequential decoding. Moreover, the
iterative polishing process will be terminated automatically when QA-MLM
regards the processed poem as a qualified one. Both human and automatic

$n^2$-coloured generalisation of Primc's identity by constructing a $n^2 \times
n^2$ matrix of difference conditions, Primc's original identities corresponding
to $n=2$ and $n=3$. While most coloured partition identities in the literature
connect partitions with difference conditions to partitions with congruence
conditions, in our case, the natural way to generalise these identities is to
relate partitions with difference conditions to coloured Frobenius partitions.
This gives a very simple expression for the generating function. With a
particular specialisation of the colour variables, our generalisation also
yields a partition identity with congruence conditions. Then, using a bijection
from our new generalisation of Primc's identity, we deduce a multi-parameter
family of identities on $(n^2-1)$-coloured partitions which generalise
Capparelli's identity, also in terms of coloured Frobenius partitions. The

sequential learning, called the signature method and rooted in rough path
theory, is considered. Its basic principle is to represent multidimensional
paths by a graded feature set of their iterated integrals, called the
signature. This approach relies critically on an embedding principle, which
consists in representing discretely sampled data as paths, i.e., functions from
$[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. After a survey of machine learning methodologies for
signatures, the influence of embeddings on prediction accuracy is investigated
with an in-depth study of three recent and challenging datasets. It is shown
that a specific embedding, called lead-lag, is systematically the strongest
performer across all datasets and algorithms considered. Moreover, an empirical
study reveals that computing signatures over the whole path domain does not
lead to a loss of local information. It is concluded that, with a good
embedding, combining signatures with other simple algorithms achieves results
competitive with state-of-the-art, domain-specific approaches.

the higher-rank gauge and matter fields, etc. In particular, the higher-spin
algebra is given here by $hs[\lambda]$ and parameterized by a real parameter
$\lambda$. The singleton is defined to be a Verma module of the AdS$_2$
isometry subalgebra $so(2,1) \subset hs[\lambda]$ with conformal weight $\Delta

determined by the Flato-Fronsdal theorem for the tensor product of two such
singletons. It is given by an infinite tower of massive scalar fields in
AdS$_2$ with ascending masses expressed in terms of $\lambda$. On the other
hand, the higher-spin fields arising through the gauging of $hs[\lambda]$
algebra do not propagate local degrees of freedom. Our analysis of the spectrum

attention due to a variety of possible exotic superconducting order parameters
as well as non-trivial bulk and surface states. While the impact of coexisting
magnetic order on superconductivity has been studied for many years, such as
ferromagnetic superconductors, the implication of coexisting multipolar order
has not been explored much despite the possibility of multipolar hidden order
in a number of $f$-electron materials. In this work, we investigate topological
properties of multipolar superconductors that may arise when quadrupolar local
moments are coupled to conduction electrons in the multiband Luttinger
semimetal. We show that the multipolar ordering of local moments leads to
various multipolar superconductors with distinct topological properties. We
apply these results to the quadrupolar Kondo semimetal system, PrBi, by
deriving the microscopic multipolar Kondo model and examining the possible
superconducting order parameters. We also discuss how to experimentally probe
the topological nature of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in distinct multipolar
superconductors via doping and external pressure, especially in the context of
PrBi.

directly computed on the rendered 2D observations, and the gradients can be
propagated backwards to optimize the 3D geometry. We show that our rendering

d-dimensional micropolar equations ($d=2$ or $d=3$) with general fractional
dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}u$ and $(-\Delta)^{\beta}w$. The micropolar
equations with standard Laplacian dissipation model fluids with microstructure.
The generalization to include fractional dissipation allows simultaneous study
of a family of equations and is relevant in some physical circumstances. We
establish that, when $\alpha\ge \frac12$ and $\beta\ge \frac12$, any initial
data $(u_0, w_0)$ in the critical Besov space $u_0\in
B^{1+\frac{d}{2}-2\alpha}_{2,1}(\mathbb R^d)$ and $w_0\in
B^{1+\frac{d}{2}-2\beta}_{2,1}(\mathbb R^d)$ yields a unique weak solution. For
$\alpha\ge 1$ and $\beta=0$, any initial data $u_0\in

B^{\frac{d}{2}}_{2,1}(\mathbb R^d)$ also leads to a unique weak solution as
well. The regularity indices in these Besov spaces appear to be optimal and can
not be lowered in order to achieve the uniqueness. Especially, the 2D
micropolar equations with the standard Laplacian dissipation, namely
$\alpha=\beta=1$ have a unique weak solution for $(u_0, w_0)\in B^0_{2,1}$. The

We establish the theoretical fixed-point convergence of SIMBA under
nonexpansive denoisers for convex data-fidelity terms. We validate SIMBA on

inputs either at test time or at training time. This has received much recent
interest on the empirical front due to applications where reliability and
security are critical. However, theoretical understanding of algorithms that
are robust to adversarial perturbations is limited.
  In this work we focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a ubiquitous
algorithmic primitive in machine learning. We formulate a natural robust
variant of PCA where the goal is to find a low dimensional subspace to
represent the given data with minimum projection error, that is in addition
robust to small perturbations measured in $\ell_q$ norm (say $q=\infty$).
Unlike PCA which is solvable in polynomial time, our formulation is
computationally intractable to optimize as it captures a variant of the
well-studied sparse PCA objective as a special case. We show the following
results:
  -Polynomial time algorithm that is constant factor competitive in the
worst-case with respect to the best subspace, in terms of the projection error
and the robustness criterion.
  -We show that our algorithmic techniques can also be made robust to
adversarial training-time perturbations, in addition to yielding
representations that are robust to adversarial perturbations at test time.
Specifically, we design algorithms for a strong notion of training-time
perturbations, where every point is adversarially perturbed up to a specified
amount.
  -We illustrate the broad applicability of our algorithmic techniques in
addressing robustness to adversarial perturbations, both at training time and
test time. In particular, our adversarially robust PCA primitive leads to
computationally efficient and robust algorithms for both unsupervised and
supervised learning problems such as clustering and learning adversarially
robust classifiers.

have challenged the long-held dichotomy between simple $s$- and $d$-wave
spin-singlet pairing states. Here, we advance several time-reversal-invariant
irreducible pairings that go beyond the standard singlet functions through a
matrix structure in the band/orbital space, and elucidate their naturalness in
multiband systems. We consider the $s\tau_{3}$ multiorbital superconducting
state for Fe-chalcogenide superconductors. This state, corresponding to a $d+d$
intra- and inter-band pairing, is shown to contrast with the more familiar $d
+\text{i}d$ state in a way analogous to how the B- triplet pairing phase of
\enhe superfluid differs from its A- phase counterpart. In addition, we
construct an analogue of the $s\tau_{3}$ pairing for the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, using degrees-of-freedom that incorporate
spin-orbit coupling. Our results lead to the proposition that $d$-wave
superconductors in correlated multiband systems will generically have a

underdamped motion with inertial effects, the intricate competition between
self-propulsion and inertial forces, in conjunction with the rototactic torque

dark matter consists of multiple sectors. We call these objects $N$-MACHOs. In
such theories neither the existence of dark matter species nor their extremely
weak coupling to the observable sector represent additional hypotheses but
instead are imposed by the solution to the Hierarchy Problem and unitarity. The
crucial point is that particles from the same sector have non-trivial
interactions but interact only gravitationally otherwise. As a consequence, the
pressure that counteracts the gravitational collapse is reduced while the
gravitational force remains the same. This results in collapsed structures much
lighter and smaller as compared to the ordinary single-sector case. We apply
this phenomenon to a dark matter theory that consists of $N$ dilute copies of
the Standard Model. The solutions do not rely on an exotic stabilization
mechanism, but rather use the same well-understood properties as known stellar
structures. This framework also gives rise to new microscopic superheavy
structures, for example with mass $10^8\,$g and size $10^{-13}\,$cm. By
confronting the resulting objects with observational constraints, we find that,
due to a huge suppression factor entering the mass spectrum, these objects
evade the strongest constrained region of the parameter space. Finally, we
discuss possible formation scenarios of $N$-MACHOs. We argue that, due to the
efficient dissipation of energy on small scales, high-density regions such as
ultra-compact mini-halos could serve as formation sites of $N$-MACHOs.

complexity for a family of graph problems: binary labeling problems in trees.
These are locally checkable problems that can be encoded with an alphabet of
size two in the edge labeling formalism. Examples of binary labeling problems
include sinkless orientation, sinkless and sourceless orientation, 2-vertex
coloring, perfect matching, and the task of coloring edges red and blue such
that all nodes are incident to at least one red and at least one blue edge.
More generally, we can encode e.g. any cardinality constraints on indegrees and
outdegrees.
  We study the deterministic time complexity of solving a given binary labeling
problem in trees, in the usual LOCAL model of distributed computing. We show
that the complexity of any such problem is in one of the following classes:
$O(1)$, $\Theta(\log n)$, $\Theta(n)$, or unsolvable. In particular, a problem
that can be represented in the binary labeling formalism cannot have time
complexity $\Theta(\log^* n)$, and hence we know that e.g. any encoding of
maximal matchings has to use at least three labels (which is tight).
  Furthermore, given the description of any binary labeling problem, we can
easily determine in which of the four classes it is and what is an
asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving it. Hence the distributed time
complexity of binary labeling problems is decidable, not only in principle, but
also in practice: there is a simple and efficient algorithm that takes the
description of a binary labeling problem and outputs its distributed time
complexity.

projects as a low cost camera sensor. However, when the stock lens is removed

background and colour response which hampers the use of this excellent and
popular image sensor. This effect is found to be due to the sensor's optical
design as well as due to built-in corrections in the GPU firmware, which is
optimised for a short focal length lens. In this work we characterise and
correct the vignetting and colour crosstalk found in the Raspberry Pi camera
module v2, presenting two measures that greatly improve the quality of images
using custom optics. First, we use a custom ""lens shading table"" to correct for
vignetting of the image, which can be done in real time in the camera's
existing processing pipeline (i.e. the camera's low-latency preview is
corrected). The second correction is a colour unmixing matrix, which enables us
to reverse the loss in saturation at the edge of the image, though this
requires post-processing of the image. With both of these corrections in place,
it is possible to obtain uniformly colour-corrected images, at the expense of
slightly increased noise at the edges of the image.

magnetic cycle and instrument systematics. Furthermore, the TESS pipeline
reports a significant signal at 2.17 days corresponding to a planet of radius
$\approx 1.2 R_\oplus$. A compatible signal is seen in the radial velocities,

recently started to merge. Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring
when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and sub-femtosecond
time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced
electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even
tens of attoseconds (1 attosecond=1 as=10$^{-18}$ s), which is of the order of
the optical field cycle. For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a
$1s$ orbital of a hydrogen atom is $\sim152$ as. On the other hand, the second
topic involves the manipulation and engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as
solids, metals, and dielectrics, with nanometric precision. Although
nano-engineering is a vast and well-established research field on its own, the
combination with intense laser physics is relatively recent. We present a
comprehensive theoretical overview of the tools to tackle and understand the
physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses interact with
nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In particular, we
elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser-induced fields at a nanometer
scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this has an
important impact on pivotal processes such as above-threshold ionization and
high-order harmonic generation. The deep understanding of the coupled dynamics
between these spatially inhomogeneous fields and matter configures a promising
way to new avenues of research and applications. Thanks to the maturity that
attosecond physics has reached, together with the tremendous advance in
material engineering and manipulation techniques, the age of atto-nano physics
has begun, but it is still in an incipient stage.

often considered to be Gaussian in the large data regime by assuming that the
\emph{classical} central limit theorem (CLT) kicks in. This assumption is often
made for mathematical convenience, since it enables SGD to be analyzed as a
stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a Brownian motion. We argue
that the Gaussianity assumption might fail to hold in deep learning settings
and hence render the Brownian motion-based analyses inappropriate. Inspired by
non-Gaussian natural phenomena, we consider the GN in a more general context
and invoke the \emph{generalized} CLT, which suggests that the GN converges to
a \emph{heavy-tailed} $\alpha$-stable random vector, where \emph{tail-index}
$\alpha$ determines the heavy-tailedness of the distribution. Accordingly, we
propose to analyze SGD as a discretization of an SDE driven by a L\'{e}vy
motion. Such SDEs can incur `jumps', which force the SDE and its discretization
\emph{transition} from narrow minima to wider minima, as proven by existing
metastability theory and the extensions that we proved recently. In this study,
under the $\alpha$-stable GN assumption, we further establish an explicit
connection between the convergence rate of SGD to a local minimum and the
tail-index $\alpha$. To validate the $\alpha$-stable assumption, we conduct
experiments on common deep learning scenarios and show that in all settings,
the GN is highly non-Gaussian and admits heavy-tails. We investigate the tail
behavior in varying network architectures and sizes, loss functions, and
datasets. Our results open up a different perspective and shed more light on
the belief that SGD prefers wide minima.

cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to minimize its flying
distance from given initial to final locations, while ensuring a target link
quality in terms of the expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
at the UAV receiver with each of its associated ground base stations (GBSs)
during the flight. To exploit the location-dependent and spatially varying
channel as well as interference over the 3D space, we propose a new radio map
based path planning framework for the UAV. Specifically, we consider the
channel gain map of each GBS that provides its large-scale channel gains with
uniformly sampled locations on a 3D grid, which are due to static and
large-size obstacles (e.g., buildings) and thus assumed to be time-invariant.
Based on the channel gain maps of GBSs as well as their loading factors, we
then construct an SINR map that depicts the expected SINR levels over the
sampled 3D locations. By leveraging the obtained SINR map, we proceed to derive
the optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in
graph theory. We further propose a grid quantization approach where the grid
points in the SINR map are more coarsely sampled by exploiting the spatial
channel/interference correlation over neighboring grids. Then, we solve an
approximate SPP over the reduced-size SINR map (graph) with reduced complexity.
Numerical results show that the proposed solution can effectively minimize the
flying distance/time of the UAV subject to its communication quality
constraint, and a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity can be
achieved by adjusting the grid quantization ratio in the SINR map. Moreover,
the proposed solution significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes
without fully exploiting the channel/interference spatial distribution in the
network.

more complex landscape of solutions of this system. Upon identifying branches
of solutions, we construct the relevant bifurcation diagrams and perform
spectral stability analysis to identify parametric regimes of stability and
instability and to understand the mechanisms by which these branches emerge.
The method reveals a remarkable wealth of solutions: these do not only include

(ASA) of electrons arising from the basic dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence and found that the ASA acts to efficiently harden the injected
electron energy spectrum. The dominance of the ASA at low energies and the
dominance of synchrotron cooling at high energies result in a broken power-law
shape of both electron energy spectrum and photon synchrotron spectrum.
Furthermore, we have applied the ASA to studying the synchrotron spectra of the
prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). The
good agreement between our theories and observations confirms that the
stochastic particle acceleration is indispensable in explaining their
synchrotron emission.

N-body integrations to study the structure and stability of circumplanetary

many extended, inclined circumplanetary disks remain stable over the duration

generated by propagating sea waves of small amplitude close to the bottom, is
simulated numerically by integrating Navier-Stokes and continuity equations.
The bottom is made up of spherical particles, free to move, which mimic
sediment grains. The approach allows to fully-resolve the flow around the
particles and to evaluate the forces and torques that the fluid exerts on their
surface. Then, the dynamics of sediments is explicitly computed by means of
Newton-Euler equations. For the smallest value of the flow Reynolds number
presently simulated, the flow regime turns out to fall in the intermittently
turbulent regime such that turbulence appears when the free stream velocity is
close to its largest values but the flow recovers a laminar like behaviour
during the remaining phases of the cycle. For the largest value of the Reynolds
number turbulence is significant almost during the whole flow cycle. The
evaluation of the sediment transport rate allows to estimate the reliability of
the empirical predictors commonly used to estimate the amount of sediments
transported by the sea waves. For large values of the Shields parameter, the
sediment flow rate during the accelerating phases does not differ from that
observed during the decelerating phases. However, for relatively small values
of the Shields parameter, the amount of moving particles depends not only on
the bottom shear stress but also on flow acceleration. Moreover, the numerical
results provide information on the role that turbulent eddies have on sediment
dynamics.

the nature of strain in the films using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique

diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS)
measurements. Raman measurements revealed a disappearance of characteristic A1g

locations as they move in an area of interest, and it is often obtained from
the user in applications such as recommendation and advertising. However, a
location histogram that leaves a user's computer or device may threaten privacy
when it contains visits to locations that the user does not want to disclose
(sensitive locations), or when it can be used to profile the user in a way that
leads to price discrimination and unsolicited advertising. Our work introduces
two privacy notions to protect a location histogram from these threats:
sensitive location hiding, which aims at concealing all visits to sensitive
locations, and target avoidance/resemblance, which aims at concealing the
similarity/dissimilarity of the user's histogram to a target histogram that
corresponds to an undesired/desired profile. We formulate an optimization
problem around each notion: Sensitive Location Hiding (SLH), which seeks to
construct a histogram that is as similar as possible to the user's histogram
but associates all visits with nonsensitive locations, and Target
Avoidance/Resemblance (TA/TR), which seeks to construct a histogram that is as
dissimilar/similar as possible to a given target histogram but remains useful
for getting a good response from the application that analyzes the histogram.
We develop an optimal algorithm for each notion and also develop a greedy
heuristic for the TA/TR problem. Our experiments demonstrate that all
algorithms are effective at preserving the distribution of locations in a
histogram and the quality of location recommendation. They also demonstrate
that the heuristic produces near-optimal solutions while being orders of
magnitude faster than the optimal algorithm for TA/TR.

cosmic time, with lGRBs at higher redshifts being on average more narrowly
beamed than those at lower redshifts. We examine the nature of this
anti-correlation in the context of collimation by the progenitor stellar
envelope. First, we show that the data indicate a strong correlation between
gamma-ray luminosity and jet opening angle, and suggest this is a natural
selection effect - only the most luminous GRBs are able to successfully launch
jets with large opening angles. Then, by considering progenitor properties
expected to evolve through cosmic time, we show that denser stars lead to more
collimated jets; we argue that the apparent anti-correlation between opening
angle and redshift can be accounted for if lGRB massive star progenitors at
high redshifts have higher average density compared to those at lower
redshifts. This may be viable for an evolving IMF - under the assumption that
average density scales directly with mass, this relationship is consistent with
the form of the IMF mass evolution suggested in the literature. The jet
angle-redshift anti-correlation may also be explained if the lGRB progenitor
population is dominated by massive stars at high redshift, while lower redshift
lGRBs allow for a greater diversity of progenitor systems (that may fail to
collimate the jet as acutely). Overall, however, we find both the jet
angle-redshift anti-correlation and jet angle-luminosity correlation are
consistent with the conditions of jet launch through, and collimation by, the
envelope of a massive star progenitor.

spherical Bessel functions (sBFs) with different configuration-space arguments
against the power spectrum or its square, weighted by powers of wavenumber.
Naively computing them scales as $N_{\rm g}^{p+1}$ with $p$ the number of
configuration space arguments and $N_{\rm g}$ the grid size, and they cannot be
done with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). Here we show that by rewriting the
sBFs as sums of products of sine and cosine and then using the product to sum
identities, these integrals can then be performed using 1-D FFTs with $N_{\rm
g} \log N_{\rm g}$ scaling. This ""rotation"" method has the potential to
accelerate significantly a number of calculations in cosmology, such as
perturbation theory predictions of loop integrals, higher order correlation
functions, and analytic templates for correlation function covariance matrices.
We implement this approach numerically both in a free-standing,
publicly-available \textsc{Python} code and within the larger,
publicly-available package \texttt{mcfit}. The rotation method evaluated with
direct integrations already offers a factor of 6-10$\times$ speed-up over the
naive approach in our test cases. Using FFTs, which the rotation method
enables, then further improves this to a speed-up of $\sim$$1000-3000\times$
over the naive approach. The rotation method should be useful in light of
upcoming large datasets such as DESI or LSST. In analysing these datasets
recomputation of these integrals a substantial number of times, for instance to
update perturbation theory predictions or covariance matrices as the input
linear power spectrum is changed, will be one piece in a Monte Carlo Markov

link between physically separated qubits in most quantum information platforms.
However, the impossibility of performing a deterministic Bell measurement with

that the ability to perform feedback during the measurement process enables
unit success probability in a single shot. Our primary feedback protocol, based
on photon counting retains the same robustness as the standard Barrett-Kok

superconducting circuits, for which homodyne detectors are more readily

deterministically entangle remote qubits given existing parameters. In
constructing the latter protocol, we derive a general expression for locally

$\sim1\times10^{-16}$ and $\sim8\times10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the

1.5-2) and significant ($\ge$4$\sigma$) over-density in the full region studied
$0.3R_{200}<R<1.5R_{200}$. We identified optical and infrared counterparts for

star-forming galaxies both associated to the cluster, while in the more
external region it is likely mostly due to background AGN. The fraction of
cluster galaxies hosting an X-ray detected AGN is 1.0$\pm$0.4$\%$, nearly
constant with the radius, a fraction similar to that reported in other clusters

(L$_{2-10keV}$$>$10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) in the region $0.3R_{200}<R<R_{200}$
is $0.5^{+0.6}_{-0.2}$$\%$, higher than that in other clusters at similar

spatial distributions of AGN and star-forming galaxies, selected also thanks to

the emergence of effective degrees of freedom in nuclei. For the illustrative

shell model or rotational degrees of freedom are not assumed in the ab initio

LS-scheme rotational degrees of freedom, consistent with an Elliott-Wilsdon

The wide wavelength range of the VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopic data in the

to explore different techniques to obtain the stellar population properties,
namely through age/metallicity sensitive spectral indices, full spectral
fitting and broad-band photometric fitting. Moreover, together with the widely
used optical Lick indices we consider further indices in the UV rest-frame, and
demonstrate that UV indices significantly help the accuracy of the resulting
population parameters.
  We find galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is
found at the lowest redshift, with an excellent agreement between ages
determined via indices, full spectral fitting or broad-band colours. These ages
are in perfect agreement with ages of local galaxies at the same velocity
dispersion when we assume pure passive evolution. Total metallicities derived
from indices show some scatter (between less than half-solar to very high
values, ([Z/H]~0.6]). We speculate on possible mechanisms explaining these
values, but given the sample size and low S/N of the spectra no conclusion can
be made.
  Indices in the UV-rest frame generally lead to similar conclusions as optical
indices. For the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr) we show that its UV-indices can only be
explained by stellar population models including a UV contribution from old
stellar populations, suggesting that old, UV bright populations start to
inhabit mature galaxies of a few Gyr of age. This is the highest redshift

  Perception",,,,,"eess.SP eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Several industry leaders and governmental agencies are currently
investigating the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones as commonly
known, for an ever-growing number of applications from blue light services to
parcel delivery. For the specific case of the delivery sector, drones can
alleviate road space usage and also lead to reductions in CO2 and air pollution
emissions, compared to traditional diesel-powered vehicles. However, due to
their unconventional acoustic characteristics and operational manoeuvres, it is
uncertain how communities will respond to drone operations. Noise has been
suggested as a major barrier to public acceptance of drone operations in urban
areas. In this paper, a series of audio-visual scenarios were created to
investigate the effects of drone noise on the reported loudness, annoyance and
pleasantness of seven different types of urban soundscapes. In soundscapes
highly impacted by road traffic noise, the presence of drone noise lead to
small changes in the perceived loudness, annoyance and pleasantness. In
soundscapes with reduced road traffic noise, the participants reported a
significantly higher perceived loudness and annoyance and a lower pleasantness
with the presence of the same drone noise. For instance, the reported annoyance
increased from 2.3 (without drone noise) to 6.8 (with drone noise), in an
11-point scale (0-not at all, 10-extremely). Based on these results, the
concentration of drone operations along flight paths through busy roads might
aid in the mitigation of the overall community noise impact caused by drones.

noninvasive functional neurosurgery technique. Previous reports have shown that
bone marrow damage in the skull can occur at high acoustic energies. While this
damage is asymptomatic, it would be desirable to avoid it. Here we examined
whether acoustic and thermal simulations can predict where the thermal lesions
in the skull might occur. Post-treatment imaging was obtained at 3-15 months
after 40 clinical TcMRgFUS procedures, and skull lesions were observed after
16/40 treatments. The presence for lesions was predicted by the acoustic energy
with a threshold of 18.1-21.1 kJ (maximum acoustic energy) and 97-112 kJ (total
acoustic energy). The size and degree of the lesions was not always predicted
by the acoustic en-ergy used during treatment alone. In contrast, the heating
estimated by the acoustic and thermal simulations was pre-dictive of the lesion
extent. The lesions appeared in areas that were predicted to have high
temperatures, and when thin slice T2-weighted imaging was obtained at 3-15
months, an excellent agreement was observed between the predictions and lesion
locations. While more work is needed to validate the absolute temperatures
measurements in and around the skull, being able to predict the locations and
onset for skull lesions could allow for better distribution of the acoustic
energy over the skull. Understanding skull ab-sorption characteristics of
TcMRgFUS could also be useful in optimizing transcranial focusing.

  Encyclopedia of Psychology. Oxford UK: Oxford University Press",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Creativity is perhaps what most differentiates humans from other species. It
involves the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of
thought in response to task demands. Divergent thought has been characterized
as the kind of thinking needed to generate multiple solutions, while convergent
thought has been characterized as the kind of thinking needed for tasks in with
one solution. Divergent thought has been conceived of as reflecting on the task
from unconventional perspectives, while convergent thought has been conceived
of as reflecting on it from conventional perspectives. Personality traits
correlated with creativity include openness to experience, tolerance of
ambiguity, and self-confidence. Evidence that creativity is linked with
affective disorders is mixed. Neuroscientific research using
electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
suggests that creativity is associated with a loosening of cognitive control
and decreased arousal. The distributed, content-addressable structure of
associative memory is conducive to bringing task-relevant items to mind without
the need for explicit search. Human creativity dates back to the earliest stone
tools over three million years ago, with the Paleolithic marking the onset of
art, science, and religion. Areas of controversy concern the relative
contributions of expertise, chance, and intuition, the importance of process
versus product, whether creativity is domain-specific versus domain-general,
the extent to which creativity is correlated with affective disorders, and
whether divergent thought entails the generation of multiple ideas or the
honing of a single initially ambiguous mental representation that may manifest
as different external outputs. Areas for further research include computational
modeling, the biological basis of creativity, and studies that track ideation

The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic
imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are however suppressed
by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as
the Reynolds number $Re$ based on the through-flow exceeds 25. For a
sufficiently high Rayleigh number, this base flow is linearly unstable to three
different modes, depending on $Re$. For $Re\leq75$, the rolls destabilise
through a supercritical bifurcation into a travelling wave. For $100\leq Re
\leq 110$, a subcritical bifurcation leads to a standing oscillatory mode,
whereas for $Re\geq150$, the unstable mode is non-oscillatory and grows out of
a supercritical bifurcation. The direct numerical simulations confirm that in

terms of the enthalpy $h(x,t)$, the evolution equation reads $\partial_t
h+(-\Delta)^s\Phi(h) =0$, while the temperature is defined as
$u:=\Phi(h):=\max\{h-L,0\}$ for some constant $L>0$ called the latent heat, and
$(-\Delta)^s$ stands for the fractional Laplacian with exponent $s\in(0,1)$.
  We prove the existence of a continuous and bounded selfsimilar solution of
the form $h(x,t)=H(x\,t^{-1/(2s)})$ which exhibits a free boundary at the
change-of-phase level $h(x,t)=L$. This level is located at the line (called the
free boundary) $x(t)=\xi_0 t^{1/(2s)}$ for some $\xi_0>0$. The construction is
done in 1D, and its extension to $N$-dimensional space is shown.
  We also provide well-posedness and basic properties of very weak solutions
for general bounded data $h_0$ in several dimensions. The temperatures $u$ of
these solutions are continuous functions that have finite speed of propagation,
with possible free boundaries. We obtain estimates on the growth in time of the
support of $u$ for solutions with compactly supported initial temperatures.
Besides, we show the property of conservation of positivity for $u$ so that the
support never recedes. On the contrary, the enthalpy $h$ has infinite speed of
propagation and we obtain precise estimates on the tail.
  The limits $L\to0^+$, $L\to +\infty$, $s\to0^+$ and $s\to 1^-$ are also
explored, and we find interesting connections with well-studied diffusion
problems. Finally, we propose convergent monotone finite-difference schemes and
include numerical experiments aimed at illustrating some of the obtained

construction of polar codes with successive cancellation (SC) decoding over an

codes with low-complexity SC decoder can approach the channel capacity of an
arbitrary symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channel, provided that the

over an AWGN channel with low computational effort has been an open problem.
Compared to density evolution, the GA is known as a low complexity yet powerful
technique that traces the evolution of the mean log likelihood ratio (LLR)
value by iterating a nonlinear function. Therefore, its high-precision
numerical evaluation is critical as the code length increases. In this work, by
analyzing the asymptotic behavior of this nonlinear function, we propose an
improved GA approach that makes an accurate trace of mean LLR evolution
feasible. With this improved GA, through numerical analysis and simulations
with code lengths up to $N=2^{18}$, we explicitly demonstrate that various

different dimensions. We illustrate the usefulness of this criterion by
applying it to tripartite states where one of the systems is a qubit. Moreover,
we scrutinize all SLOCC classes of these systems and derive a complete

exactly the low-order moment equations. Because of competition between the
spatial period of the external force $\lambda=2 \pi/K$, and the soliton width
$l_s$, which is a function of the nonlinearity $\kappa$ as well as the initial
frequency $\omega_0$ of the solitary wave, there is a transition (at fixed
$\omega_0$) from trapped to unbound behavior of the soliton, which depends on
the parameters $r$ and $K$ of the external force and the nonlinearity parameter
$\kappa$. We previously studied this phenomena when $\kappa=1$ (2019 J. Phys.

domain formation in MFIM and MFIS stacks and their voltage-dependent DW motion.
Our analysis signifies that, when FE is in multi-domain (MD) state with
soft-DW, the stored energy in the DW leads to non-hysteretic NC effect in FE,
which provides an enhanced charge response in the MFIM stack, compared to
Metal-Insulator-Metal. According to our analysis, the DW-induced NC effect
yields local negative permittivity in FE in the domain and DW regions, which
leads to an average negative effective permittivity in FE. Furthermore, we show
that the NC trajectory of FE is dependent on its thickness, the gradient energy
coefficient and the in-plane permittivity of the underline DE material but not
on the DE thickness. Similar to MFIM, MFIS also exhibits an enhancement in the
overall charge response and the capacitance compared to MOS capacitor. At the
same time, the MD state of FE induces non-homogenous potential profile across
the underlying DE and semiconductor layer. In the low voltage regime, such
non-homogenous surface potential leads to the co-existence of electron and hole
in an undoped semiconductor, while at higher voltages, the carrier
concentration in the semiconductor becomes electron dominated. In addition, we
show that with FE being in the 180 MD state, the minimum potential at FE-DE
interface and hence, the minimum surface potential in the semiconductor, does
not exceed the applied voltage (in-spite of the local differential

mid-IR wavelengths, are known to possess massive stars within their shell
boundaries. In our previous study, Hanaoka et al. (2019) expanded the research
area to the whole Galactic plane ($0^{\circ} \leq l \leq 360^{\circ}$, $|b|
\leq 5^{\circ}$) and studied systematic differences in the shell morphology and
the IR luminosity of the IR bubbles between inner and outer Galactic regions.
In this study, utilizing high spatial-resolution data of AKARI and WISE in the
mid-IR and Herschel in the far-IR, we investigate the spatial distributions of
dust components around each IR bubble to discuss the relation between the
star-formation activity and the dust properties of the IR bubbles. For the 247
IR bubbles studied in Hanaoka et al. (2019), 165 IR bubbles are investigated in
this study, which have the Herschel data ($|b| \leq 1^{\circ}$) and known
distances. We created their spectral energy distributions on a pixel-by-pixel
basis around each IR bubble, and decomposed them with a dust model consisting
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hot dust, warm dust and cold dust.
As a result, we find that the offsets of dust heating sources from the shell
centers in inner Galactic regions are systematically larger than those in outer
Galactic regions. Many of the broken bubbles in inner Galactic regions show
large angles between the offset and the broken shell directions from the
center. Moreover, the spatial variations of the PAH intensity and cold dust
emissivity around the IR bubbles in inner Galactic regions are larger than
those in outer Galactic regions. We discuss these results in light of the
interstellar environments and the formation mechanism of the massive stars
associated with the IR bubbles.

was first detected coming from the direction of the Galactic center in the

measured flux of the annihilation corresponds to an intense steady source of
positron production, with an annihilation rate on the order of
$\sim10^{43}$~e$^{+}$/s. The 511 keV emission is the strongest persistent
Galactic $\gamma$-ray line signal and it shows a concentration towards the
Galactic center region. An additional low-surface brightness component is
aligned with the Galactic disk; however, the morphology of the latter is not
well constrained. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne

towards better understanding of public safety in large urban environments.
Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a natural way to study spatial variation in
urban crime dynamics at the neighborhood level, since it facilitates principled
``sharing of information'' between spatially adjacent neighborhoods. Typically,
however, cities contain many physical and social boundaries that may manifest
as spatial discontinuities in crime patterns. In this situation, standard prior
choices often yield overly-smooth parameter estimates, which can ultimately
produce mis-calibrated forecasts. To prevent potential over-smoothing, we
introduce a prior that partitions the set of neighborhoods into several
clusters and encourages spatial smoothness within each cluster. In terms of
model implementation, conventional stochastic search techniques are
computationally prohibitive, as they must traverse a combinatorially vast space
of partitions. We introduce an ensemble optimization procedure that
simultaneously identifies several high probability partitions by solving one
optimization problem using a new local search strategy. We then use the
identified partitions to estimate crime trends in Philadelphia between 2006 and
2017. On simulated and real data, our proposed method demonstrates good
estimation and partition selection performance.

evaluate the instantaneous pressure fields from velocity fields measured using
particle image velocimetry (PIV) or particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). First,
the pressure gradient fields are calculated from velocity fields, while the
local and instantaneous pressure gradient uncertainty is estimated from the
velocity uncertainty using a linear-transformation based algorithm. The
pressure field is then reconstructed by solving an overdetermined linear system
which involves the pressure gradients and boundary conditions. This linear
system is solved with generalized least-squares (GLS) which incorporates the
previously estimated variances and covariances of the pressure gradient errors
as inverse weights to optimize the reconstructed pressure field. The method was
validated with synthetic velocity fields of a 2D pulsatile flow and the results
show significantly improved pressure accuracy with an error reduction of as
much as 250% compared to the existing baseline method of solving the pressure
Poisson equation (PPE). The GLS was more robust to the velocity errors and
provides greater improvement with spatially correlated velocity errors. For
experimental validation, the volumetric pressure fields were evaluated from a
laminar pipe flow velocity field measured using 3D PTV. The GLS reduced the
median absolute pressure errors by as much as 96%.

refined matching in sub-pixel accuracy based on local phase coherence. We
performed experiments on our very low-resolution thermal images (acquired using

extract two times more features than state-of-the-art methods such as ORB or

random fault locations using fault injection techniques. In this work we study
whether random fault injection is accurate to simulate the behavior of

  Our study extends the Gem5 simulator to support fault injection on the caches

corrupting random bits of the SRAMs. During our study we corrupt the L1-Dcache

Hercules a particularly metal--poor galaxy, placing it slightly below the

However, several recent works have shown that in practical scenarios, where the
test data mismatch the training data (e.g. when the downsampling kernel is not
the bicubic kernel or is not available at training), the leading DNN methods
suffer from a huge performance drop. Inspired by the literature on generalized
sampling, in this work we propose a method for improving the performance of
DNNs that have been trained with a fixed kernel on observations acquired by
other kernels. For a known kernel, we design a closed-form correction filter
that modifies the low-resolution image to match one which is obtained by
another kernel (e.g. bicubic), and thus improves the results of existing
pre-trained DNNs. For an unknown kernel, we extend this idea and propose an
algorithm for blind estimation of the required correction filter. We show that
our approach outperforms other super-resolution methods, which are designed for
general downsampling kernels.

spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) was proposed in lasers with small modal

for achieving STML in those cavities because the small dispersion can be easily
balanced. Here, we demonstrate that STML can also be achieved in multimode
lasers with much larger modal dispersion, where we find that the intracavity
saturable absorber plays an important role for counteracting the large modal
dispersion. Furthermore, we observe a new STML phenomenon of passive nonlinear
auto-selection of single-mode mode-locking, resulting from the interaction
between spatiotemporal saturable absorption and spatial gain competition. Our
work significantly broadens the design possibilities for useful STML lasers
thus making them much more accessible for applications, and extends the

the duration of training time. To accelerate training, practitioners often turn
to distributed reinforcement learning architectures to parallelize and

reinforcement learning (RL) often tradeoff between the throughput of samples
that an RL agent can learn from (sample throughput) and the quality of learning
from each sample (sample efficiency). In these scalable RL architectures, as
one increases sample throughput (i.e. increasing parallelization in IMPALA),
sample efficiency drops significantly. To address this, we propose a new
distributed reinforcement learning algorithm, IMPACT. IMPACT extends IMPALA
with three changes: a target network for stabilizing the surrogate objective, a
circular buffer, and truncated importance sampling. In discrete action-space
environments, we show that IMPACT attains higher reward and, simultaneously,
achieves up to 30% decrease in training wall-time than that of IMPALA. For
continuous control environments, IMPACT trains faster than existing scalable
agents while preserving the sample efficiency of synchronous PPO.

largest energy is achieved by protons during centrifugal acceleration in the
magnetosphere of the central machine. When the proton accelerated in the
magnetosphere of a black hole approaches light cylinder surface, acceleration
occurs mainly in the azimuthal direction, i.e. the acceleration is centrifugal.
In this paper the acceleration of a proton having smaller synchrotron losses
compared to the electron is considered. As a proton experiences the highest
energy increase while accelerating near the light surface, a partial solution
for the maximum Lorentz factor can be obtained there. In the analysis the
obtained dependence of the maximum energy on the parameter of particle
magnetization $ \kappa $ and parameter $ \alpha $ which reflects the relation
of toroidal $ B_\phi $ and poloidal $ B_T $ magnetic fields , has led to the
conclusion that the achievement of theoretical maximum limit of Lorentz factor
value $ \gamma_m=\kappa^{-1}$ is not possible for an accelerated particle in
the magnetosphere of a black hole due to restrictions of the topology of
toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields imposed. The analysis of special cases of
the relation of toroidal and poloidal magnetic field has shown that in the
presence of magnetic field that is significantly more toroidal the maximum
Lorentz factor value reaches $\gamma_m = \kappa^ {-2/3} $, in case when
toroidal field becomes smaller in comparison to poloidal field the maximum
Lorentz factor value does not exceed $\gamma_m = \kappa^ {-1/2} $. For a number
of objects, such as M87 and Sgr. A *, maximum Lorentz factor values for
accelerated protons for scenarios of existence or lack of toroidal magnetic
field have been derived. The obtained results for magnetosphere of Sgr. A * has
confirmed by the experimental data obtained on the massive HESS of Cherenkov

other is a Goldstone mode with zero frequency at a magnetic field along the

the magnetic field with respect to this direction. The upper gap was found to
be reduced in the doped compound Ni(Cl(1-x)Br(x))2-4SC(NH2)2 with $x=0.21$.
This reduction is unexpected because of the previously reported rise of the

design a code matrix so that the minimum Hamming distance between any two rows

two columns (i.e., two partitions of class labels) are simultaneously
maximized. Maximizing row distances can increase the system fault tolerance
while maximizing column distances helps increase the diversity between binary

allows further improvement of the diversity between binary classifiers. The
end-to-end training renders our proposed ECNN different from the traditional
error-correcting output code (ECOC) based methods that train binary classifiers
independently. ECNN is complementary to other existing defense approaches such
as adversarial training and can be applied in conjunction with them. We
empirically demonstrate that our proposed ECNN is effective against the

allocates the transmit power and computational resources in a centralized radio
access network architecture. The network comprises a set of computing nodes to
which the requested tasks of different users are offloaded. The optimization
problem minimizes the energy consumption of task offloading while takes the
end-to-end latency, i.e., the transmission, execution, and propagation
latencies of each task, into account. We aim to allocate the transmit power and
computational resources such that the maximum acceptable latency of each task
is satisfied. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, we divide it into
two sub-problems, one for transmit power allocation and another for task
placement and computational resource allocation. Transmit power is allocated
via the convex-concave procedure. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is
proposed to jointly manage computational resources and task placement. We also
propose a feasibility analysis that finds a feasible subset of tasks.
Furthermore, a disjoint method that separately allocates the transmit power and
the computational resources is proposed as the baseline of comparison. A lower
bound on the optimal solution of the optimization problem is also derived based
on exhaustive search over task placement decisions and utilizing
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results show that the joint method
outperforms the disjoint method in terms of acceptance ratio. Simulations also
show that the optimality gap of the joint method is less than 5%.

$\sim 2\sigma$. Following this path, we vary physical and phenomenological

that the CMB constraint on the Hubble constant is sensitive to the Hydrogen

of a solar flare in solar atmosphere. The mechanism agree with two observed
characteristics of explosive flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that have
proved to be very difficult to explain with previous mechanisms: the huge
enrichments of $^{3}He$ and the high energy gamma ray radiation. The twisted
magnetic flux rope is a typical structure during the solar flares, which is
closely related to the solar active region that magnetic fields have almost
complete control over the plasma. Consequently, the plasma inside the flux rope
is heated to more than 1.0$\times10^{7}$ K by adiabatic compression process,
and then the thermonuclear fusion can take place in the flux rope accompanied
with high energy gamma rays. We utilize the time-dependent ideal
2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to demonstrate the
physical mechanism for producing flares, which reveals three stages of flare
development with process of magnetic energy conversion and intense release
during the solar flares and CMEs in solar atmosphere. Furthermore, we discuss

charge stripes decays approximately as $T^{-2}$ towards our detection limit.
The in-plane integrated intensity, however, remains roughly temperature
independent. Therefore, although the incommensurability shows a remarkably
large increase at high temperature, our results are interpreted via a single

intercept/resend attacks, we evaluate a probability that the legitimate users,
Alice and Bob, do not notice interference caused by the eavesdropper Eve and a
probability that Eve obtains a secret bit sent by Alice. For the collective
attacks, we estimate not only the above two probabilities but also Eve's
Shannon information. In the assessment of the security against the collective
attacks, imposing looser constraints upon Eve's strategies than
Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, we reach substantially the same result as their
study. In other words, although we let Eve's strategies satisfy lower symmetry
than Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, both their work and ours attain the same
conclusion, i.e. the identical, unique, and optimum strategy. This implies that
we obtain Eve's best tactic by applying simpler conditions to it than
Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, so that this result is novel. Finally, we
consider a relation between the six-state protocol and the E91 scheme. We show
that the intercept/resend attacks can always be described by hidden variable
models. In contrast, we demonstrate that we cannot regard the collective
attacks as the hidden variable theories if the disturbance is smaller than
$1/3$.

precession frequency of nuclear spins, have attracted a lot of attentions.
Under a feedback-generated drive, the precession frequency is supposed to be
dependent only on the angular momentum and an applied magnetic field. However,
nuclei with spins larger than 1/2, experience electric quadrupole interaction
with electric field gradients at the cell walls. This quadrupole interaction
shifts the precession frequencies of the nuclear spins, which brings inaccuracy
to the rotation measurement as the quadrupole interaction constant $C_q$ is
difficult to precisely measure. In this work, the effects of quadrupole
interaction on nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes is theoretically studied.
We find that, when the constant $C_q$ is small compared to the characteristic
decay rate of the system, as the strength of the feedback-driving field
increases, the quadrupole shift monotonically decreases, regardless of the sign
of $C_q$. In large $C_q$ regime, more than one precession frequency exists, and
the nuclear spins may precess with a single frequency or multi-frequencies
depending on initial conditions. In this regime, with large driving amplitudes,
the nuclear spin can restore the single-frequency-precession. These results are
obtained by solving an effective master equation of the nuclear spins in a
rotating frame, from which both the steady-state solutions and dynamics of the
system are shown.

performance metric in terms of energy efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, it does
not depend directly on the EE of each link and its maximization leads to
unfairness between the links. On the other hand, the maximization of the
minimum EE (MEE), i.e., the minimum of the EEs of all links, guarantees the
fairest power allocation, but it does not contain any explicit information
about the total system performance. The main trend in current research is to
maximize TEE and MEE separately. Unlike previous contributions, this letter
presents a general multi-objective approach for EE optimization that takes into

b) the market equilibrium is shown to approach social efficiency as if the ISO
solves a stochastic optimization taking into account all the uncertainties. In
showing this result, a key innovation is a new approach of efficiently
computing the Nash equilibrium (NE) among the strategic RPPs in
congestion-constrained power networks. In particular, the proposed approach
decouples finding an NE into searching over congestion patterns and computing
an NE candidate assuming a congestion pattern. As such, the computational
complexity of finding an NE grows only cubically with the number of RPPs in the
market. We demonstrate our results in the IEEE 14-bus system and show that the

Visual Question Answering (VQA). Until recently, their accuracy has been the
main focus of research. Now there is a trend toward assessing the robustness of
these models against adversarial attacks by evaluating the accuracy of these
models under increasing levels of noisiness in the inputs of VQA models. In
VQA, the attack can target the image and/or the proposed query question, dubbed
main question, and yet there is a lack of proper analysis of this aspect of
VQA. In this work, we propose a new method that uses semantically related
questions, dubbed basic questions, acting as noise to evaluate the robustness
of VQA models. We hypothesize that as the similarity of a basic question to the
main question decreases, the level of noise increases. To generate a reasonable
noise level for a given main question, we rank a pool of basic questions based
on their similarity with this main question. We cast this ranking problem as a
LASSO optimization problem. We also propose a novel robustness measure Rscore
and two large-scale basic question datasets in order to standardize robustness
analysis of VQA models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation method is able to effectively analyze the robustness of VQA models.
To foster the VQA research, we will publish our proposed datasets.

First, we consider PDEs where the function is constrained to be positive and
integrate to unity, as is the case with Fokker-Planck equations. Our approach
involves reparameterizing the solution as the exponential of a neural network
appropriately normalized to ensure both requirements are satisfied. This then
gives rise to nonlinear a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) where
the integral appearing in the equation is handled by a novel application of
importance sampling. Secondly, we tackle a number of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equations that appear in stochastic optimal control problems. The key
contribution is that these equations are approached in their unsimplified
primal form which includes an optimization problem as part of the equation. We
extend the DGM algorithm to solve for the value function and the optimal
control \simultaneously by characterizing both as deep neural networks.
Training the networks is performed by taking alternating stochastic gradient
descent steps for the two functions, a technique inspired by the policy

equals AUC, and for pairwise distinct outcomes CPA relates linearly to
Spearman's coefficient, in the same way that the C index relates linearly to
Kendall's coefficient. ROC movies, UROC curves, and CPA nest and generalize the

to systemic risk come from the companies that have the highest betweenness
centrality or the highest degree in the MST obtained?

  Information","Accepted at IEEE Internet of Things Journal",,,,"cs.NI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been extensively researched
in past years particularly with regard to range-based or visual-based sensors.
Instead of deploying dedicated devices that use visual features, it is more
pragmatic to exploit the radio features to achieve this task, due to their
ubiquitous nature and the widespread deployment of Wi-Fi wireless network. This
paper presents a novel approach for collaborative simultaneous localization and
radio fingerprint mapping (C-SLAM-RF) in large unknown indoor environments. The
proposed system uses received signal strengths (RSS) from Wi-Fi access points
(AP) in the existing infrastructure and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) from a
smart phone, without a prior knowledge about map or distribution of AP in the
environment. We claim a loop closure based on the similarity of the two radio
fingerprints. To further improve the performance, we incorporate the turning
motion and assign a small uncertainty value to a loop closure if a matched
turning is identified. The experiment was done in an area of 130 meters by 70
meters and the results show that our proposed system is capable of estimating
the tracks of four users with an accuracy of 0.6 meters with Tango-based PDR
and 4.76 meters with a step counter-based PDR.
