whereas the cache timing side-channel may inadvertently leak information
through the physically measurable timing variance. Speculative execution, an
essential processor optimization, and a source of such variances, can cause
severe detriment on deliberate branch mispredictions. Despite static analysis
could qualitatively verify the timing-leakage-free property under speculative
execution, it is incapable of producing endorsements including inputs and
speculated flows to diagnose leaks in depth. This work proposes a new symbolic
execution based method, SpecuSym, for precisely detecting cache timing leaks
introduced by speculative execution. Given a program (leakage-free in
non-speculative execution), SpecuSymsystematically explores the program state
space, models speculative behavior at conditional branches, and accumulates the
cache side effects along with subsequent path explorations. During the dynamic
execution, SpecuSymconstructs leak predicates for memory visits according to
the specified cache model and conducts a constraint-solving based cache
behavior analysis to inspect the new cache behaviors. We have
implementedSpecuSymatop KLEE and evaluated it against 15 open-source
benchmarks. Experimental results show thatSpecuSymsuccessfully detected from 2
to 61 leaks in 6 programs under 3 different cache settings and identified false
positives in 2 programs reported by recent work.

mean-field theory, suitable for narrow-band systems with correlation-induced
hybridisation at finite temperatures. Presently this approach, based on the
notion of a fluctuating on-site density matrix (OSDM), is developed for the
case of extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM). In an EFKM, an excitonic
insulator phase can be stabilised at zero temperature. With increasing
temperature, the excitonic order parameter (interaction-induced hybridisation
on-site, characterised by the absolute value and phase) eventually becomes
disordered, which involves fluctuations of both its phase and (at higher T) its
absolute value. In order to build an adequate finite-temperature description,
it is important to clarify the nature of degrees of freedom associated with the
phase and absolute value of the induced hybridisation, and correctly account
for the corresponding phase-space volume. We show that the OSDM-based treatment
of the local fluctuations indeed provides an intuitive and concise description
(including the phase-space integration measure). This allows to describe both
the lower-temperature regime where phase fluctuations destroy the long-range
order, and the higher temperature crossover corresponding to a decrease of the
absolute value of hybridisation. In spite of the rapid progress in the studies
of excitonic insulators, a unified picture of this kind has not been available
to date. We briefly discuss recent experiments on ${\rm Ta_2 Ni Se_5 }$ and
also address the amplitude mode of collective excitations in relation to the
measurements reported for 1T--${\rm TiSe_2}$. Both the overall scenario and the
theoretical framework are also expected to be relevant in other contexts,

nodes in a network as a function of their position and the underlying topology.
One class of such measures builds on eigenvector centrality, where the
importance of a node is derived from the importance of its neighboring nodes.
For directed and weighted complex networks, where the nodes can carry some
intrinsic property value, there have been centrality measures proposed that are
variants of eigenvector centrality. However, these expressions all suffer from
shortcomings. Here, an extension of such centrality measures is presented that
remedies all previously encountered issues. While similar improved centrality
measures have been proposed as algorithmic recipes, the novel quantity that is
presented here is a purely analytical expression, only utilizing the adjacency
matrix and the vector of node values. The derivation of the new centrality
measure is motivated in detail. Specifically, the centrality itself is ideal
for the analysis of directed and weighted networks (with node properties)
displaying a bow-tie topology. The novel bow-tie centrality is then computed
for a unique and extensive real-world data set, coming from economics. It is
shown how the bow-tie centrality assesses the relevance of nodes similarly to
other eigenvector centrality measures, while not being plagued by their
drawbacks in the presence of cycles in the network.

(EMS) in the power grid. The goal of CA is to operate the power system in a
secure manner by analyzing the system subject to a contingency (e.g., the
outage of a transmission line or a power generator) to determine the setpoints
that will allow system operation without violation of constraints. The analysis
in CA is conducted based on the output from State Estimation (SE), another core
EMS module. However, it is also shown that an adversary can alter certain power
measurements to corrupt the system states estimated by SE without being
detected. Such a corrupted estimation can severely skew the results of the
contingency analysis as it will provide a fake model to deal with. In this
research, we formally model necessary interdependency relationships and
systematically analyze these novel attacks on the contingency analysis. In
particular, this research focuses on Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow
(SCOPF) that finds out the optimal economic dispatches considering a single
line failure (based on the $n - 1$ contingency analysis) and transmission line
capacities. The proposed model is implemented and solved to find out potential
threat vectors (i.e., a set of measurements to be altered) that can evade CA so
that the system will face overloading situation on one or more transmission
lines when some specific contingencies happen. We demonstrate our formal model
on an IEEE 14 bus system-based case study and verify the results with a
standard PowerWorld model. We further evaluate the model with respect to
various attacks and grid characteristics.

and thermostatted RPMD (T-RPMD) - is that for a given MD timestep, the overlap

for hybrid Metropolis Monte-Carlo/MD sampling schemes. We show that these
problems can be avoided through the introduction of ""dimension-free"" numerical
integration schemes for which the sampled ring-polymer position distribution
has non-zero overlap with the exact distribution in the infinite-bead limit for
the case of a harmonic potential. We show that dimension freedom can be
achieved via mollification of the forces from the physical potential and with
the BCOCB integration scheme. The dimension-free numerical integration schemes
yield finite error bounds for a given MD timestep as the number of beads is
taken to infinity; these conclusions are proven for harmonic potential and
borne out numerically for anharmonic systems, including water. The numerical
results for BCOCB are particularly striking, allowing for three-fold increases
in the stable timestep for liquid water with respect to the Bussi-Parrinello

waves that repeatedly reflect off an inclined slope, a new trapping mechanism
emerges that displays the tendency to align this angle with the upslope

we show first that this configuration leads to trapezium-shaped attractors,
very similar to what has been extensively studied in two-dimensions. However,
we also establish a direct link between the trapping and the existence of
two-dimensional attractors. In a second stage, considering a geometry that is
not translationally invariant, closer to realistic configurations, we prove
that although there are no two-dimensional attractors, one can find a structure
in three-dimensional space with properties similar to internal wave attractors:
a one-dimensional attracting manifold. Moreover, as this structure is unique,
it should be easy to visualize in laboratory experiments since energy injected
in the domain would eventually be confined to a very thin region in
three-dimensional space, for which reason it is called a super-attractor.

quantization in inhomogeneous dielectric media required definite and proper

numerical canonical quantization is straightforward using linear algebra. We

example of indistinguishable two-photon interference in quantum beam splitters,

in the case where the control precision is not very high, so the input factor
values vary significantly even under the same setting of the corresponding
manipulating factors. The case is observed in our main application to carbon
nanotube growth experiments, where one experimental input among many is
manipulated by another manipulating factors, and the relation between the input
and the manipulating factors significantly varies in the dates and times of
operations. Due to this variation, the standard GP surrogate that directly
relates the manipulating factors to the experimental outcome does not provide a
great predictive power on the outcome. At the same time, the GP model relating
the main factors to the outcome directly is not appropriate for the prediction
purpose because the main factors cannot be accurately set as planned for a
future experiment. Motivated by the carbon nanotube example, we propose a
two-tiered GP model, where the bottom tier relates the manipulating factors to
the corresponding main factors with potential biases and variation independent
of the manipulating factors, and the top tier relates the main factors to the

the control uncertainty to the experimental outcome through the two GP modeling
tiers. We present the inference and hyper-parameter estimation of the proposed

the injected energy is determined from the linear inviscid theory. The
dissipation rate in the bulk of the domain is directly computed from the

estimated using the theoretical expression of the velocity field in the
boundary layers, derived recently by Beckebanze et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 841, 614

steady-state and also in the transient regime, by taking into account the bulk
dissipation and, more important, the dissipation in the boundary layers without
any adjustable parameters. The dependence of the different sources on the
thickness of the experimental set-up is also discussed. In the nonlinear
regime, the analysis is extended by estimating the dissipation due to the
secondary waves generated by triadic resonant instabilities showing the
importance of the energy transfer from large scales to small scales. The method
tested here on internal wave attractors can be generalized straightforwardly to
any quasi two-dimensional stratified flow.

need posted in a natural language query. It requires a good understanding of
the query and all the documents in a corpus, which is difficult because the
meaning of natural language texts depends on the context, syntax,and semantics.
Recently deep neural networks have been used to rank search results in response
to a query. In this paper, we devise a multi-resolution neural network(MRNN) to
leverage the whole hierarchy of representations for document retrieval. The
proposed MRNN model is capable of deriving a representation that integrates
representations of different levels of abstraction from all the layers of the
learned hierarchical representation.Moreover, a duplex attention component is
designed to refinethe multi-resolution representation so that an optimal
contextfor matching the query and document can be determined. More
specifically, the first attention mechanism determines optimal context from the
learned multi-resolution representation for the query and document. The latter
attention mechanism aims to fine-tune the representation so that the query and
the relevant document are closer in proximity. The empirical study shows that
MRNN with the duplex attention is significantly superior to existing models
used for ad-hoc retrieval on benchmark datasets including SQuAD, WikiQA,
QUASAR, and TrecQA.

between Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR), in which spacetime
is foliated by flat Euclidean spaces. While GR is based on the idea that
""matter curves spacetime"", FFR is based on the idea that ""matter curves
spacetime, but not space"". This idea, inspired by the observed spatial flatness
of our local universe, is realized by considering the same action as used in
GR, but restricting it only to metrics which are foliated by flat spatial
slices. FFR can be thought of as describing gravity without gravitational
waves.
  In FFR, a positive cosmological constant implies several interesting
properties which do not follow in GR: the metric equations are elliptic on each
euclidean slice, there exists a unique vacuum solution among those spherically
symmetric at infinity, and there exists a geometric way to define the arrow of
time. Furthermore, as gravitational waves do not exist in FFR, there are simple
analogs to the positive mass theorem and Penrose-type inequalities.
  Importantly, given that gravitational waves have a negligible effect on the
curvature of spacetime, and that the universe appears to be locally flat, FFR
may be a good approximation of GR. Moreover, FFR still admits many notable
features of GR including the big bang, an accelerating expansion of the
universe, and the Schwarzschild spacetime. Lastly, FFR is already known to have
an existence theory for some simplified cases, which provokes an interesting
discussion regarding the possibility of a more general existence theory, which
may be relevant to understanding existence of solutions to GR.

due to the high-dimensionality of the state and action space as well as
uncertainty from noisy sensors and inaccurate motor control. To combat these
factors and achieve more robust manipulation, humans actively exploit contact
constraints in the environment. By adopting a similar strategy, robots can also
achieve more robust manipulation. In this paper, we enable a robot to
autonomously modify its environment and thereby discover how to ease
manipulation skill learning. Specifically, we provide the robot with fixtures
that it can freely place within the environment. These fixtures provide hard
constraints that limit the outcome of robot actions. Thereby, they funnel
uncertainty from perception and motor control and scaffold manipulation skill
learning. We propose a learning system that consists of two learning loops. In
the outer loop, the robot positions the fixture in the workspace. In the inner
loop, the robot learns a manipulation skill and after a fixed number of
episodes, returns the reward to the outer loop. Thereby, the robot is
incentivised to place the fixture such that the inner loop quickly achieves a
high reward. We demonstrate our framework both in simulation and in the real
world on three tasks: peg insertion, wrench manipulation and shallow-depth
insertion. We show that manipulation skill learning is dramatically sped up
through this way of scaffolding.

interacting molecules commonly used to model chemical kinetics and noisy gene
regulatory networks. Exact time-dependent solutions of the CME -- which
typically consists of infinitely many coupled differential equations -- are
rare, and are valuable for numerical benchmarking and getting intuition for the
behavior of more complicated systems. Jahnke and Huisinga's landmark
calculation of the exact time-dependent solution of the CME for monomolecular
reaction systems is one of the most general analytic results known; however, it
is hard to generalize, because it relies crucially on properties of
monomolecular reactions. In this paper, we rederive Jahnke and Huisinga's
result on the time-dependent probability distribution and moments of
monomolecular reaction systems using the Doi-Peliti path integral approach,
which reduces solving the CME to evaluating many integrals. While the
Doi-Peliti approach is less intuitive, it is also more mechanical, and hence
easier to generalize. To illustrate how the Doi-Peliti approach can go beyond
the method of Jahnke and Huisinga, we also find an explicit and exact
time-dependent solution to a problem involving an autocatalytic reaction that
Jahnke and Huisinga identified as not solvable using their method. We also find
a formal exact time-dependent solution for any CME whose list of reactions
involves only zero and first order reactions, which may be the most general
result currently known.

possibility of optically controlling material properties. Motivated by the
recent discovery of intrinsic long-range magnetic order in two-dimensional
materials, which allows for the creation of novel magnetic devices of
unprecedented small size, we predict that light can couple with magnetism and
efficiently tune magnetic orders of monolayer ruthenium trichloride (RuCl3).
First-principles calculations show that both free carriers and optically
excited electron-hole pairs can switch monolayer RuCl3 from the proximate
spin-liquid phase to a stable ferromagnetic phase. Specifically, a moderate
electron-hole pair density (on the order of 10^13 cm-2) can significantly
stabilize the ferromagnetic phase by 10 meV/f.u. in comparison to the zigzag
phase, so that the predicted ferromagnetism can be driven by optical pumping
experiments. Analysis shows that this magnetic phase transition is driven by a
combined effect of doping-induced lattice strain and itinerant ferromagnetism.
According to the Ising-model calculation, we find that the Curie temperature of
the ferromagnetic phase can be increased significantly by raising carrier or
electron-hole pair density. This enhanced opto-magnetic effect opens new
opportunities to manipulate two-dimensional magnetism through non-contact,
optical approaches.

that commonly surround chondrules, we simulate the growth of FGRs through
direct accretion of monomers of various sizes onto the chondrule surfaces. Dust
becomes charged to varying degrees in the radiative plasma environment of the
solar nebula (SN), and the resulting electrostatic force alters the
trajectories of colliding dust grains, influencing the structure of the dust
rim as well as the time scale of rim formation. We compare the growth of FGRs
in protoplanetary disks (PPD) with different turbulence strengths and plasma
conditions to previous models which assumed neutral dust grains. We use a
combination of a Monte Carlo method and an N-body code to simulate the
collision of dust monomers with chondrules: a Monte Carlo algorithm is used to
randomly select dust particles that will collide with the chondrule as well as
determine the elapsed time interval between collisions; at close approach, the
detailed collision process is modeled using an N-body algorithm, Aggregate
Builder (AB), to determine the collision outcome, as well as any restructuring
of the chondrule rim. The collisions are driven by Brownian motion and coupling
to turbulent gas motion in the protoplanetary disk. The charge distribution of
the dust rim is modeled, used to calculate the trajectories of dust grains, and
then analyze the resulting morphology of the dust rim. In a weakly turbulent
region, the decreased relative velocity between charged particles causes small
grains to be repelled from the chondrule, causing dust rims to grow more slowly
and be composed of larger monomers, which results in a more porous structure.
In a highly turbulent region, the presence of charge mainly affects the
porosity of the rim by causing dust particles to deviate from the extremities
of the rim and reducing the amount of restructuring.

if they can be qualified as a coprime factor perturbation of the plant. We show
that for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, a linearization error can be

depends on the size of the linearization error. In particular, improving the
linearization makes the perturbation smaller so that, eventually, standard

transforms NBED patterns into real-space patterns with sharp peaks
corresponding to inter-atomic spacings. We describe a simple analytical model
for interpretation of these patterns that cleanly decouples lattice information
from the intensity variations in NBED patterns caused by tilt and thickness. By
tracking the inter-atomic spacing peaks in EWPC patterns, strain mapping is
demonstrated for two practical applications: mapping of ferroelectric domains
in epitaxially strained PbTiO3 films and mapping of strain profiles in
arbitrarily oriented core-shell Pt-Co nanoparticle fuel-cell catalysts. The
EWPC transform enables lattice structure measurement at sub-pm precision and
sub-nm resolution that is robust to small sample mistilts and random

fundamentals of IRS and elaborate on how an IRS can be integrated to benefit
communication covertness. We also demonstrate a case study of the joint

equations on moving domains with second-order accuracy. The space
discretization is based on the ghost-point method, which falls under the
category of unfitted boundary methods, since the mesh does not adapt to the
moving boundary. The equations are advanced in time by using Crank-Nicholson.
The momentum and continuity equations are solved simultaneously for the
velocity and the pressure by adopting a proper multigrid approach. To avoid the
checkerboard instability for the pressure, a staggered grid is adopted, where
velocities are defined at the sides of the cell and the pressure is defined at
the centre. The lack of uniqueness for the pressure is circumvented by the
inclusion of an additional scalar unknown, representing the average divergence
of the velocity, and an additional equation to set the average pressure to
zero. Several tests are performed to simulate the motion of an incompressible
fluid around a moving object, as well as the lid-driven cavity tests around
steady objects. The object is implicitly defined by a level-set approach, that
allows a natural computation of geometrical properties such as distance from
the boundary, normal directions and curvature. Different shapes are tested:
circle, ellipse and flower. Numerical results show the second order accuracy
for the velocity and the divergence (that decays to zero with second order) and
the efficiency of the multigrid, that is comparable with the tests available in
literature for rectangular domains without objects, showing that the presence
of a complex-shaped object does not degrade the performance.

goals, we introduce a probabilistic framework that efficiently learns latent
variables to jointly model the multi-step future motions of agents in a scene.
Our framework is data-driven and learns semantically meaningful latent
variables to represent the multimodal future, without requiring explicit
labels. Using a dynamic attention-based state encoder, we learn to encode the
past as well as the future interactions among agents, efficiently scaling to
any number of agents. Finally, our model can be used for planning via computing
a conditional probability density over the trajectories of other agents given a
hypothetical rollout of the 'self' agent. We demonstrate our algorithms by
predicting vehicle trajectories of both simulated and real data, demonstrating
the state-of-the-art results on several vehicle trajectory datasets.

multi-contrast quantitative imaging. Methods: The recently proposed Echo Planar
Time-resolved Imaging (EPTI) technique can achieve fast distortion- and
blurring-free multi-contrast quantitative imaging. In this work, a subspace
reconstruction framework is developed to improve the reconstruction accuracy of
EPTI at high encoding accelerations. The number of unknowns in the
reconstruction is significantly reduced by modeling the temporal signal
evolutions using low-rank subspace. As part of the proposed reconstruction
approach, a B0-update algorithm and a shot-to-shot B0 variation correction
method are developed to enable the reconstruction of high-resolution tissue
phase images and to mitigate artifacts from shot-to-shot phase variations.
Moreover, the EPTI concept is extended to 3D k-space for 3D GE-EPTI, where a
new temporal-variant of CAIPI encoding is proposed to further improve
performance. Results: The effectiveness of the proposed subspace reconstruction
was demonstrated first in 2D GESE EPTI, where the reconstruction achieved
higher accuracy when compared to conventional B0-informed GRAPPA. For 3D
GE-EPTI, a retrospective undersampling experiment demonstrates that the new
temporal-variant CAIPI encoding can achieve up to 72x acceleration with close
to 2x reduction in reconstruction error when compared to conventional
spatiotemporal-CAIPI encoding. In a prospective undersampling experiment,
high-quality whole-brain T2* and QSM maps at 1 mm isotropic resolution was
acquired in 52 seconds at 3T using 3D GE-EPTI with temporal-variant CAIPI
encoding. Conclusion: The proposed subspace reconstruction and optimized
temporal-variant CAIPI encoding can further improve the performance of EPTI for
fast quantitative mapping.

imaging and tracking (mCIT, $\mu$CIT) for laboratory plasma experiments. Three
types of microparticle clouds are described: from exploding wires, in dusty
plasmas and in atmospheric plasmas. The experimental data sets are obtained
with one or more imaging cameras at a rate up to 100k frames per second (fps).
A physics-constrained motion tracker, a Kohonen neural network (KNN) or
self-organizing map (SOM), the feature tracking kit (FTK), and U-Net are
described and compared with each other for particle tracking using the

two important factors that affect the tracking accuracy. Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) is used to reveal how U-Net, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
developed for non-plasma applications, achieves the improvements for noisy
scenes. The fitting parameters for a simple polynomial track model are found to
group into clusters that reveal the geometry information about the camera

to optimize the hardware performance, a new class of stream cipher has been
proposed. The basic idea is to employ a single Galois NLFSR with maximum period
to construct the cipher. As a representative design of this kind of stream
ciphers, Espresso is based on a 256-bit Galois NLFSR initialized by a 128-bit
key. The $2^{256}-1$ maximum period is assured because the Galois NLFSR is
transformed from a maximum length LFSR. However, we propose a
Galois-to-Fibonacci transformation algorithm and successfully transform the
Galois NLFSR into a Fibonacci LFSR with a nonlinear output function. The
transformed cipher is broken by the standard algebraic attack and the R\o
njom-Helleseth attack with complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^{68.44})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(2^{66.86})$ respectively. The transformation algorithm is derived
from a new Fibonacci-to-Galois transformation algorithm we propose in this

that the Galois NLFSR used in any Espresso-like stream ciphers can be easily

uncoordinated Gaussian multiple access problem. The proposed scheme leverages
notions from single-user coding, random spreading, minimum-mean squared error
(MMSE) estimation, and successive interference cancellation. Specifically,
every message is split into two parts: the first fragment serves as the
argument to an injective function that determines which spreading sequence
should be employed, whereas the second component of the message is encoded
using a polar code. The latter coded bits are then spread using the sequence
determined during the first step. The ensuing signal is transmitted through a
Gaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC). On the receiver side, active sequences
are detected using a correlation-based energy detector, thereby simultaneously
recovering individual signature sequences and their generating information bits
in the form of preimages of the sequence selection function. Using the set of
detected active spreading sequences, an MMSE estimator is employed to produce
log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the second part of the messages corresponding
to these detected users. The LLRs associated with each detected user are then
passed to a list decoder of the polar code, which performs single-user decoding
to decode the second portion of the message. This decoding operation proceeds
iteratively by subtracting the interference due to the successfully decoded
messages from the received signal, and repeating the above steps on the
residual signal. At this stage, the proposed algorithm outperforms alternate
existing low-complexity schemes when the number of active uses is below 225.

  The visual part of the system performs a photometric bundle adjustment on a
sparse set of points. This direct approach does not extract feature points and
is able to track not only corners, but any pixels with sufficient gradient
magnitude. Neglecting rolling-shutter effects in the visual part severely
degrades accuracy and robustness of the system. In this paper, we incorporate a
rolling-shutter model into the photometric bundle adjustment that estimates a
set of recent keyframe poses and the inverse depth of a sparse set of points.
  IMU information is accumulated between several frames using measurement
preintegration, and is inserted into the optimization as an additional
constraint between selected keyframes. For every keyframe we estimate not only
the pose but also velocity and biases to correct the IMU measurements. Unlike
systems with global-shutter cameras, we use both IMU measurements and
rolling-shutter effects of the camera to estimate velocity and biases for every
state.
  Last, we evaluate our system on a novel dataset that contains global-shutter
and rolling-shutter images, IMU data and ground-truth poses for ten different
sequences, which we make publicly available. Evaluation shows that the proposed
method outperforms a system where rolling shutter is not modelled and achieves
similar accuracy to the global-shutter method on global-shutter data.

model for the CLASS observing site in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
Then, using two years of observations at 32.3 GHz to 43.7 GHz from the CLASS
Q-band telescope, we present a detection of this signal and compare the
observed signal to that predicted by the model. We recover an angle between
magnetic north and true north of $(-5.5 \pm 0.6)^\circ$, which is consistent
with the expectation of $-5.9^\circ$ for the CLASS observing site. When
comparing dipole sky patterns fit to both simulated and data-derived sky maps,
the dipole directions match to within a degree, and the measured amplitudes
match to within ${\sim}20\%$.

overlapping label sets. Changing the label set does not involve removing

training examples. We demonstrate that this simple strategy is robust to
changes in the label space. Furthermore, our results show that learning a
non-Euclidean metric can improve performance in the low data regime, suggesting
that further work on metric spaces may benefit low-resource research.

progress in the design and organization of resource-efficient architectures in

compute-efficient networks. Model quantization is a widely used technique to
compress and accelerate neural network inference and prior works have quantized
MobileNets to 4-6 bits albeit with a modest to significant drop in accuracy.
While quantization to sub-byte values (i.e. precision less than or equal to 8
bits) has been valuable, even further quantization of MobileNets to binary or
ternary values is necessary to realize significant energy savings and possibly
runtime speedups on specialized hardware, such as ASICs and FPGAs. Under the
key observation that convolutional filters at each layer of a deep neural
network may respond differently to ternary quantization, we propose a novel
quantization method that generates per-layer hybrid filter banks consisting of
full-precision and ternary weight filters for MobileNets. The layer-wise hybrid
filter banks essentially combine the strengths of full-precision and ternary

MobileNets. Using this proposed quantization method, we quantized a substantial

addition, they cannot handle the dynamic environment and may produce
sub-optimal results. To address these issues, we utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN),
an RL-based method combined with a neural network to estimate the expected
long-term return of recommending a task. DQN inherently considers the immediate
and future reward simultaneously and can be updated in real-time to deal with
evolving data and dynamic changes. Furthermore, we design two DQNs that capture
the benefit of both workers and requesters and maximize the profit of the
platform. To learn value functions in DQN effectively, we also propose novel
state representations, carefully design the computation of Q values, and
predict transition probabilities and future states. Experiments on synthetic

poloidal magnetic field in the sun or planet. However, the alpha effect is
quenched as the magnetic field grows due to the conservation of magnetic
helicity. With these conventional understanding, what indeed generates and
sustains the observed poloidal magnetic field remains a mystery. To solve this
contradiction between theory and real nature, we derived a semi-analytic
representation of alpha and beta using large scale magnetic helicity and
energy. Applying the simulation data to alpha and beta, we found that the
negative beta effect is a promising substitution of the quenched alpha effect.
However, since the negative beta effect contradicts the conventional dynamo
theory, we derived the new beta expression referring to the field structure
model. This analytic result with the field relation between velocity U and
magnetic field B shows that the beta effect in the helical system is not a
fixed one. Rather, it plays a variable and dynamic role in dynamo depending on
the interaction between the poloidal velocity field and relative strength of
the large scale magnetic field.

adaptive data collection induces memory and correlation in the samples, and

regression, where the samples are collected adaptively, and the sample size $n$
can be smaller than $p$, the number of covariates. In this setting, there are
two distinct sources of bias: the first due to regularization imposed for
consistent estimation, e.g. using the LASSO, and the second due to adaptivity
in collecting the samples. We propose ""online debiasing"", a general procedure
for estimators such as the LASSO, which addresses both sources of bias. In two
concrete contexts $(i)$ time series analysis and $(ii)$ batched data
collection, we demonstrate that online debiasing optimally debiases the LASSO
estimate when the underlying parameter $\theta_0$ has sparsity of order
$o(\sqrt{n}/\log p)$. In this regime, the debiased estimator can be used to
compute $p$-values and confidence intervals of optimal size.

decomposed into a set of microtasks (e.g., pairwise comparisons). These
microtasks are passed to a large number of workers and their answers are
aggregated to infer the ranking. The number of microtasks depends on the budget

of a model, the signals interacting with the parameter estimates should not
decay too quickly for the optimal values to be discovered correctly. This
requirement is referred to as persistency of excitation, and it arises in
various contexts, such as optimization with stochastic gradient methods,
exploration for multi-armed bandits, and adaptive control of dynamical systems.
While training a neural network, the iterative optimization algorithm involved
also creates an online learning problem, and consequently, correct estimation
of the optimal parameters requires persistent excitation of the network
weights. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of the gradient descent
algorithm while training a two-layer neural network with two different loss
functions, the squared-error loss and the cross-entropy loss; and we obtain
conditions to guarantee persistent excitation of the network weights. We then
show that these conditions are difficult to satisfy when a multi-layer network
is trained for a classification task, for the signals in the intermediate
layers of the network become low-dimensional during training and fail to remain
persistently exciting. To provide a remedy, we delve into the classical
regularization terms used for linear models, reinterpret them as a means to
ensure persistent excitation of the model parameters, and propose an algorithm
for neural networks by building an analogy. The results in this work shed some
light on why adversarial examples have become a challenging problem for neural
networks, why merely augmenting training data sets will not be an effective
approach to address them, and why there may not exist a data-independent
regularization term for neural networks, which involve only the model

excellent performances, they lack the mechanism to encode the rich, structured

the property of these nonlocal-based blocks, we provide a unified approach to
interpreting them, where we view them as a graph filter generated on a
fully-connected graph. When the graph filter is approximated by Chebyshev
polynomials, a generalized formulation can be derived for explaining the
existing nonlocal-based blocks ($\mathit{e.g.,}$ nonlocal block, nonlocal

spectral nonlocal block, which can be flexibly inserted into deep neural

developed a novel method, referred to as Gemini Network, for effective modeling
of temporal structures and achieving high-performance temporal action
localization. The significant improvements afforded by the proposed method are
attributable to three major factors. First, the developed network utilizes two
subnets for effective modeling of temporal structures. Second, three parallel
feature extraction pipelines are used to prevent interference between the
extractions of different stage features. Third, the proposed method utilizes
auxiliary supervision, with the auxiliary classifier losses affording
additional constraints for improving the modeling capability of the network. As
a demonstration of its effectiveness, the Gemini Network was used to achieve
state-of-the-art temporal action localization performance on two challenging
datasets, namely, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet.

effectively improve the quantitative analysis of cervical cancer. However,
accurate nuclei segmentation is still challenging. The classic U-net has not
achieved satisfactory results on this task, because it mixes the information of
different scales that affect each other, which limits the segmentation accuracy
of the model. To solve this problem, we propose a progressive growing U-net
(PGU-net+) model, which uses two paradigms to extract image features at
different scales in a more independent way. First, we add residual modules
between different scales of U-net, which enforces the model to learn the
approximate shape of the annotation in the coarser scale, and to learn the
residual between the annotation and the approximate shape in the finer scale.
Second, we start to train the model with the coarsest part and then
progressively add finer part to the training until the full model is included.
When we train a finer part, we will reduce the learning rate of the previous
coarser part, which further ensures that the model independently extracts
information from different scales. We conduct several comparative experiments
on the Herlev dataset. The experimental results show that the PGU-net+ has
superior accuracy than the previous state-of-the-art methods on cervical nuclei
segmentation.

While firms respect the advantages of dynamic pricing and price
experimentation, they must limit the number of price changes (i.e., switches)
to be within some budget due to various practical reasons. We study both the
classical price-based network revenue management problem in the
distributionally-unknown setup, and the bandits with knapsacks problem. In
these problems, a decision-maker (without prior knowledge of the environment)
has finite initial inventory of multiple resources to allocate over a finite
time horizon. Beyond the classical resource constraints, we introduce an
additional switching constraint to these problems, which restricts the total
number of times that the decision-maker makes switches between actions to be
within a fixed switching budget. For such problems, we show matching upper and
lower bounds on the optimal regret, and propose computationally-efficient
limited-switch algorithms that achieve the optimal regret. Our work reveals a
surprising result: the optimal regret rate is completely characterized by a
piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, which further depends on
the number of resource constraints -- to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time the number of resources constraints is shown to play a fundamental
role in determining the statistical complexity of online learning problems. We
conduct computational experiments to examine the performance of our algorithms
on a numerical setup that is widely used in the literature. Compared with
benchmark algorithms from the literature, our proposed algorithms achieve
promising performance with clear advantages on the number of incurred switches.
Practically, firms can benefit from our study and improve their learning and
decision-making performance when they simultaneously face resource and
switching constraints.

The Van Hove singularities manifest themselves as some sharp dips or peaks in

numerical analysis demonstrates that the number of Van Hove singularities is
independent of the modulus of the applied stress, but their position shifts as
the strength of the tension increases. Besides, the number and location of
singularities strongly depend on the stress direction relative to the zigzag
axis in the graphene lattice. Moreover, we show that the location of

source of the $\gamma$-ray emission. Very close to periastron there is a
pronounced dip in the hard X-ray emission, concomitant with the repeated
disappearance of the thermal X-ray emission, which we interpret as being due to
the suppression of significant electron acceleration in the system. Within our
model, the residual emission seen by NuSTAR at this phase can be accounted for
with secondary electrons produced in interactions of accelerated protons, in
agreement with the variation in pion-decay $\gamma$-ray emission. Future
observations with H.E.S.S., CTA and NuSTAR should confirm or refute this
scenario.

superconducting properties through electron scattering, modulation of coherence
length, and correlation with quantized magnetic flux. For iron-based
superconductors (IBSCs) that are expected to be employed in high-field magnetic
applications, a fundamental question is whether such defects develop an upper
critical field (Hc2) similar to that of conventional BCS-type superconductors.
Herein, we report the first demonstration of a significantly improved Hc2 in a
122-phase IBSC by introducing defects through high-energy milling. Co-doped
Ba122 polycrystalline bulk samples (Ba(Fe,Co)2As2) were prepared by sintering
powder which was partially mechanically alloyed through high-energy milling. A
remarkable increase in full-width at half maximum of X-ray powder diffraction
peaks, anomalous shrinkage in the a-axis, and elongation in the c-axis were
observed. When lattice defects are introduced into the grains, semiconductor
behavior of the electric resistivity at low temperature (T < 100 K), slight
decrease in transition temperature (Tc), upturn of Hc2(T) near Tc, and a large
increase in Hc2(T) slope were observed. The slope of Hc2(T) increased
approximately by 50%, i.e., from 4 to 6 T/K, and exceeded that of single
crystals and thin films. Defect engineering through high-energy milling is
expected to facilitate new methods for the designing and tuning of Hc2 in
122-phase IBSCs.

according to the criterion of minimum information loss (MIL). The MIL criterion
amounts to minimizing the (weighted) sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences (KLDs)
with the fused density appearing as righthand argument of the KLDs. In order to
ensure the fused density to be consistent with the local ones when LRFS
densities are marginal $\delta$-generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli
(M$\delta$-GLMB) or labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) densities, the MIL rule is
further elaborated by imposing the constraint that the fused density be in the
same family of local ones. In order to deal with different fields-of-view
(FoVs) of the local densities, the global label space is divided into disjoint
subspaces which represent the exclusive FoVs and the common FoV of the agents,
and each local density is decomposed into the sub-densities defined in the
corresponding subspaces. Then fusion is performed subspace-by-subspace to
combine local subdensities into global ones, and the global density is obtained
by multiplying the global sub-densities. Further, in order to tackle the label
mismatching issue arising in practical applications, a rank assignment
optimization (RAO) of a suitably defined cost is carried out so as to match
labels from different agents. Moreover, issues concerning implementation of the
MIL rule and its application to distributed multitarget tracking (DMT) are
discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed fusion approach is assessed
via simulation experiments considering DMT with either the same or different
FoVs of the agents.

initial axisymmetric system. We explore where populations with different
actions end up once a bar forms and a B/P bulge develops. We find that the
density bimodality due to the B/P bulge (the X-shape) is better traced by
populations with low radial, JR,0, or vertical, Jz,0, actions, or high
azimuthal action, J{\phi},0. Generally populations separated by JR,0 have a
greater variation in bar strength and vertical heating than those separated by
Jz,0. While the bar substantially weakens the initial vertical gradient of
Jz,0, it also drives a strikingly monotonic vertical profile of JR,0. We then
use these results to guide us in assigning metallicity to star particles in a
pure N-body model. Because stellar metallicity in unbarred galaxies depends on
age as well as radial and vertical positions, the initial actions are
particularly well suited for assigning metallicities. We argue that assigning
metallicities based on single actions, or on positions, results in metallicity
distributions inconsistent with those observed in real galaxies. We therefore
use all three actions to assign metallicity to an N-body model by comparing
with the actions of a star-forming, unbarred simulation. The resulting
metallicity distribution is pinched on the vertical axis, has a realistic
vertical gradient and has a stronger X-shape in metal-rich populations, as
found in real galaxies.

to provide a means to probe non-Gaussian diffusion through manipulation of the
flip angle. A framework is presented to define an effective b-value in DW-SSFP.
Theory: The DW-SSFP signal is a summation of coherence pathways with different
b-values. The relative contribution of each pathway is dictated by the flip
angle. This leads to an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimate that
depends on the flip angle in non-Gaussian diffusion regimes. By acquiring
DW-SSFP data at multiple flip angles and modelling the variation in ADC for a
given form of non-Gaussianity, the ADC can be estimated at a well-defined
effective b-value. Methods: A gamma distribution is used to model non-Gaussian
diffusion, embedded in the Buxton signal model for DW-SSFP. Monte-Carlo
simulations of non-Gaussian diffusion in DW-SSFP and diffusion-weighted
spin-echo (DW-SE) sequences are used to verify the proposed framework.
Dependence of ADC on flip angle in DW-SSFP is verified with experimental
measurements in a whole, human post-mortem brain. Results: Monte-Carlo
simulations reveal excellent agreement between ADCs estimated with DW-SE and
the proposed framework. Experimental ADC estimates vary as a function of flip
angle over the corpus callosum of the postmortem brain, estimating the mean and
standard deviation of the gamma distribution as $1.50\cdot 10^{-4} mm^2/s$ and
$2.10\cdot 10^{-4} mm^2/s$. Conclusion: DW-SSFP can be used to investigate
non-Gaussian diffusion by varying the flip angle. By fitting a model of
non-Gaussian diffusion, the ADC in DW-SSFP can be estimated at an effective
b-value, comparable to more conventional diffusion sequences.

and understand in a different way. Thus, grounded language learning argues that
models need to learn and understand language by the experience and perceptions
obtained by interacting with enviroments, like how humans do. With the help of
deep reinforcement learning techniques, there are already lots of works
focusing on facilitating the emergence of communication protocols that have
compositionalities like natural languages among computational agents
population. Unlike these works, we, on the other hand, focus on the numeric
concepts which correspond to abstractions in cognition and function words in
natural language. Based on a specifically designed language game, we verify
that computational agents are capable of transmitting numeric concepts during
autonomous communication, and the emergent communication protocols can reflect
the underlying structure of meaning space. Although their encodeing method is
not compositional like natural languages from a perspective of human beings,
the emergent languages can be generalised to unseen inputs and, more
importantly, are easier for models to learn. Besides, iterated learning can
help further improving the compositionality of the emergent languages, under
the measurement of topological similarity. Furthermore, we experiment another
representation method, i.e. directly encode numerals into concatenations of
one-hot vectors, and find that the emergent languages would become
compositional like human natural languages. Thus, we argue that there are 2
important factors for the emergence of compositional languages.

active regions in the farside through local helioseismology techniques. The
knowledge of the magnetism in the whole Sun, including the non-visible
hemisphere, is fundamental for several space weather forecasting applications.
Seismic identification of farside active regions is challenged by the reduced
signal-to-noise, and only large and strong active regions can be reliable
detected. Here we develop a new methodology to improve the identification of
active region signatures in farside seismic maps. We have constructed a deep
neural network that associates the farside seismic maps obtained from
helioseismic holography with the probability of presence of active regions in
the farside. The network has been trained with pairs of helioseismic phase
shift maps and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms acquired half a
solar rotation later, which were used as a proxy for the presence of active
regions in the farside. The method has been validated using a set of artificial
data, and it has also been applied to actual solar observations during the
period of minimum activity of the solar cycle 24. Our approach shows a higher
sensitivity to the presence of farside active regions than standard methods
applied up to date. The neural network can significantly increase the number of
detected farside active regions, and will potentially improve the application
of farside seismology to space weather forecasting.

Remarkably, spectroscopic and microscopic characterization reveals that WS2
grows only on top of the graphene crystals so that the vertical heterostack is
selectively obtained in a bottom-up fashion. Spectroscopic characterization
indicates that, after WS2 synthesis, graphene undergoes compressive strain and
hole doping. Tailored experiments show that such hole doping is caused by the
modification of the SiO2 stoichiometry at the graphene/SiO2 interface during
the WS2 growth. Electrical transport measurements reveal that the
heterostructure behaves like an electron-blocking layer at large positive gate
voltage, which makes it a suitable candidate for the development of unipolar

Endowing robots with this ability of imitating humans from third person is a
very immediate and natural way of teaching new tasks. Only recently, through
meta-learning, there have been successful attempts to one-shot imitation
learning from humans; however, these approaches require a lot of human
resources to collect the data in the real world to train the robot. But is
there a way to remove the need for real world human demonstrations during

control polices by embedding human demonstrations that can condition a control

domain randomisation in an application that has not been seen before:
sim-to-real transfer on humans. Upon evaluating our approach on pushing and

currently explored at low-z by means of UV spectroscopy of quasars. We propose
an alternative approach based on UV colours of quasars as observed from GALEX
surveys. We built a NUV-selected sample of 9033 quasars with (FUV-NUV) colours.
The imprint of HI absorption in the observed colours is suggested qualitatively
by their distribution as a function of quasar redshift. Because broad band
fluxes lack spectral resolution and are sensitive to a large range of N_HI a
Monte Carlo simulation of IGM opacity is required for quantitative analysis. It
was performed with absorbers randomly distributed along redshift and column
density distributions, assumed to be a broken power law with index beta1 (10^15
< N_HI <10^17.2 cm^-2) and beta2 (10^17.2 < N_HI <10^19 cm^-2). The redshift
distribution is proportional to the redshift evolution law of the number
density of Lyman limit systems (LLS) per unit redshift as determined by
spectroscopic surveys.The simulation is run with different assumptions on the
spectral index alpha_nu of the quasar ionising flux. The fits between the
simulated and observed distribution of colours require an LLS redshift density
larger than that derived from spectroscopic counting. This result is robust in
spite of difficulties in determining the colour dispersion other than that due
to HI absorption. We provide arguments to retain alpha_nu = - 2, a value
already extreme with respect to those measured with HST/COS. Further fitting of
power law index beta1 and beta2 leads to a higher density by a factor of 1.7
(beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.5), possibly 1.5 (beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.7). Beyond
the result in terms of density the analysis of UV colours of quasars reveals a
tension between the current description of IGM opacity at low z and the
published average ionising spectrum of quasars.

singular points are still unsatisfactory, especially for low-quality

methods, methods based on deep learning only need the original fingerprint
image but not the fingerprint orientation field. In this paper, different from
other detection methods based on deep learning, we treat singular points
detection as a semantic segmentation problem and just use few data for
training. Furthermore, we propose a new convolutional neural network called
SinNet to extract the singular regions of interest and then use a blob
detection method called SimpleBlobDetector to locate the singular points. The
experiments are carried out on the test dataset from SPD2010, and the proposed
method has much better performance than the other advanced methods in most

and the result applied to a static rivulet between two parallel contact lines.
The substrate is supposed to be incompressible (Stokes like description of
elasticity), and having a non-zero surface tension, that eventually differs
depending on whether its surface is dry or wet. For a single straight line
separating two domains with the same substrate surface tension, the ridge
profile is shown to be be very close to that of Shanahan and de Gennes, but
shift from the contact line of a distance equal to the elastocapillary length
built upon substrate surface tension and shear modulus. As a result, the
divergence near contact line disappears and is replaced by a balance of surface
tensions at the contact line (Neumann equilibrium), though the profile remains
nearly logarithmic. In the rivulet case, using the previous solution as a Green
function allows one to calculate analytically the geometry of the distorted
substrate, and in particular its slope on each side (wet and dry) of the
contact lines. These two slopes are shown to be nearly proportional to the
inverse of substrate surface tensions, though the respective weight of each
side (wet and dry) in the final expressions is difficult to establish because
of the linear nature of standard elasticity. A simple argument combining
Neumann and Young equations is however provided to overcome this limitation.
The result may have surprising implications for the modelling of hysteresis on
systems having both plastic and elastic properties, as initiated long ago by
Extrand and Kumagai.

  Circuits with Memory","7 pages, 4 figures, submitted for possible conference publication",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the rate-power region of a simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) system where a transmitter (TX)
broadcasts a common signal to an information receiver (IR) and an energy
harvester (EH). Since practical EH circuits include a reactive element as part
of their signal rectifier and the voltage on this element cannot drop or rise
instantaneously, the EH circuit has memory. We model the memory effect of the
EH by a Markov reward chain. Furthermore, since an analytical model that
includes all non-linear and memory effects of the EH circuit is not available,
we employ a deep neural network (DNN) to model the Markov chain evolution. We
formulate an optimization problem to determine the rate-power region of the
considered SWIPT system and propose an iterative algorithm based on sequential
quadratic programming (SQP) to solve it. Our numerical results show that the
optimal input distribution and the rate-power region depend on both the input
power level at the EH and the symbol duration.

in several fields, including machine learning. In the last decade, deep
learning, and in particular Convolutional neural networks (CNN), have become
essential for applications in signal processing and image recognition. Quantum
deep learning, however remains a challenging problem, as it is difficult to
implement non linearities with quantum unitaries. In this paper we propose a
quantum algorithm for applying and training deep convolutional neural networks
with a potential speedup. The quantum CNN (QCNN) is a shallow circuit,
reproducing completely the classical CNN, by allowing non linearities and
pooling operations. The QCNN is particularly interesting for deep networks and
could allow new frontiers in image recognition, by using more or larger
convolution kernels, larger or deeper inputs. We introduce a new quantum
tomography algorithm with $\ell_{\infty}$ norm guarantees, and new applications
of probabilistic sampling in the context of information processing. We also
present numerical simulations for the classification of the MNIST dataset to
provide practical evidence for the efficiency of the QCNN.

\emph{rainbow connected} if any two distinct vertices of the graph are
connected by a rainbow path. The minimum $k$ for which there exists such an
edge-colouring is the rainbow connection number $rc(G)$ of $G.$ Recently, Bau

that the edge-colouring must be proper. %An proper edge-coloured graph is said
to be \emph{properly rainbow connected} if any two distinct vertices of the

radiation tolerance is below the requirements for LHC experiments by factors of
100 to 1000. We developed fully depleted (D)MAPS pixel sensors employing a 150

control the near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between closely spaced
bodies. In this context, the use of an external magnetic field has emerged as a
very attractive possibility and a plethora of physical phenomena have been put
forward in the last few years. Here, we predict some additional
magnetic-field-induced phenomena that can take place in the context of NFRHT
between planar layered structures containing magneto-optical (MO) materials
(mainly doped semiconductors like InSb). In particular, we predict the
possibility of increasing the NFRHT upon applying an external magnetic field in
an asymmetric structure consisting of two infinite plates made of InSb and Au.
We also study the impact of a magnetic field in the NFRHT between structures
containing MO thin films and show that the effect is more drastic than in their
bulk counterparts. Finally, we systematically investigate the anisotropic
thermal magnetoresistance, i.e., the dependence of the radiative heat
conductance on the orientation of an external magnetic field, in the case of
two infinite plates made of InSb and show that one can strongly modulate the
NFRHT by simply changing the orientation of the magnetic field. All the
phenomena predicted in this work can be experimentally tested with existent
technology and provide a new insight into the topic of active control of NFRHT.

studying either ion or electron recoils in large arrays of parallel carbon
nanotubes. For instance, a MeV mass DM particle could scatter off a lattice
electron, resulting in the transfer of sufficient energy to eject the electron
from the nanotube surface. The electron can eventually be detected whenever an
external electric field is added to drive it from the open ends of the array.
This detection scheme would offer an anisotropic response and could be used to
select an orientation of the target with respect to the DM wind. A compact
sensor, in which the cathode element is substituted with a dense array of
parallel carbon nanotubes, could serve as the basic detection unit which - if
adequately replicated - would allow to explore a significant region of light DM
mass and cross-section. A similar detection scheme could be used to detect DM
particles with mass in the GeV range scattering off the surface of a CNT and
ejecting a carbon ion. We report about the Monte Carlo simulations of such a

we propose a novel approach for trajectory design using a coverage map that can
be obtained with a combination of 3D map of the environment and radio

After deriving the effective Hamiltonian from the connection dynamics

interesting features unique to the Jordan frame of STT. In particular, the
linear term of the cosine function appearing in the equations could lead to

in Brans-Dicke theory the effective evolution equations can be classified into
four different cases. Exact solutions of the Friedmann equation in terms of the
internal time are obtained in these cases. Moreover, the solutions in terms of
the proper time describing the late time evolution of the Universe are also
obtained under certain approximation; in two cases the solutions coincide with

Hausdorff part can already be bigger than the Kim-Pillay space. Using it, we
obtain simple proofs of a number of results previously obtained using
topological dynamics, but working one power set level lower. The Lascar

voltage in the presence of co-planar electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic
($\mathbf{B}$) fields, occurs in regular Weyl semimetals (WSMs) as one of the
fundamental manifestations of chiral anomaly. A major issue, therefore, is
whether there are alternate route to PHE, without invoking chiral anomaly. We
demonstrate that PHE exists in an inhomogeneous Weyl semimetal (IWSM) even in
the absence of the aforesaid anomaly. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport
theory, we show that PHE appears in an IWSM due to the strain-induced chiral
gauge potential, which couples to the Weyl fermions of opposite chirality with
opposite sign. Our study shows a resultant phase shift in the current
associated with opposite chirality Weyl nodes, which, remarkably, leads to a
finite chirality-dependent planar Hall effect (CPHE) in the IWSMs.
Interestingly, we show that a small tilt in the Weyl node can generate a pure
CPHE even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. The CPHE has important
implications in `chiralitytronics'. We also discuss the experimental
feasibility of these novel effects of strain in type-I IWSMs.

To surmount this difficulty, we use state-of-the-art models to generate (noisy)

noisy supervision. We present a method to disentangle the overall pedestrian
motion into easier to learn subparts by utilizing a pose completion and a
decomposition module. The completion module fills in the missing key-point
annotations and the decomposition module breaks the cleaned locomotion down to
global (trajectory) and local (pose keypoint movements). Further, with Quasi

creation of additional surface roughness which produce ripples; and finally an

entanglement witnesses that detect the presence of entanglement in subsystems
of experimental multi-qubit stabilizer states. The witnesses we propose can be
decomposed into sums of Pauli operators and can be efficiently evaluated by
either two measurement settings only or at most a number of measurements that
only depends on the size of the subsystem of interest. We provide two
constructive methods to design the local witness operators, the first one based
on the local unitary equivalence between graph and stabilizer states, and the
second one based on sufficient and necessary conditions that the respective set
of constituent Pauli operators needs to fulfill. We theoretically establish the
noise tolerance of the proposed witnesses and benchmark their practical
performance by analyzing the local entanglement structure of an experimental
seven-qubit quantum error correction code.

microscopic diffusion anisotropy, yielding valuable information on tissue
microstructure. A recent study proposed that the acquisition of rotationally
invariant DDE metrics, typically obtained using a spherical ""5-design"", could
be greatly simplified by assuming Gaussian diffusion, facilitating reduced
acquisition times that are more compatible with clinical settings. Here, we aim
to validate the new minimal acquisition scheme against the standard DDE
5-design, and to quantify the proposed method's noise robustness to facilitate
future clinical use. Methods: DDE MRI experiments were performed on both ex
vivo and in vivo rat brains at 9.4 T using the 5-design and the proposed
minimal design and taking into account the difference in the number of
acquisitions. The ensuing microscopic fractional anisotropy ({\mu}FA) maps were
compared over a range of b-values up to 5000 s/mm2. Noise robustness was
studied using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. Results: The
minimal protocol quantified {\mu}FA at an accuracy comparable to the estimates
obtained via the more theoretically robust DDE 5-design. {\mu}FA's sensitivity
to noise was found to strongly depend on compartment anisotropy and tensor
magnitude in a non-linear fashion. When {\mu}FA < 0.75 or when mean diffusivity
is particularly low, very high signal to noise ratio (SNR) is required for
precise quantification of {\mu}FA. Conclusion: Our work supports using DDE for
quantifying microscopic diffusion anisotropy in clinical settings but raises
hitherto overlooked precision issues when measuring {\mu}FA with DDE and
typical clinical SNR.

we propose a soft positive/negative anchor assignment procedure based on a new
overlapping function called ""Per-Object Normalized Overlap"" (PONO). This soft

metric. The obtained profiles from the SMBHBs are then compared with those in
the case of the single supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We considered two
models of the SMBHBs: a model when the secondary SMBH is embedded in the
accretion disk around the primary, causing an empty gap in the disk, and a
model with clearly separated components, where the accretion disks around both
primary and secondary give a significant contribution to the composite Fe
K$\alpha$ line emission of a such SMBHB. The obtained results showed that both
models of SMBHBs can leave imprints in the form of ripples in the cores of the
emitted Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles, which may look like an absorption component
in the line profile. However, in the case of the composite line profiles
emitted from two accretion disks, these ripples could have much higher
amplitudes and strongly depend on orbital phase of the system, while for those
emitted from a disk with an empty gap, the corresponding ripples mostly have
lower amplitudes and do not vary significantly with orbital phase. The present
day X-ray telescopes are not able to detect such signatures in the observed
X-ray spectra of SMBHBs. However this will be possible with the next generation
of X-ray observatories, which will also enable application of such effects as a
tool for studying the properties of these objects.

crafting universal perturbations based on orientation of perturbation vectors.
At each iteration, instead of choosing minimal perturbation vector with respect
to each image, we aggregate the current instance of universal perturbation with
the perturbation which has similar orientation to the former so that the
magnitude of the aggregation will rise up as large as possible at every
iteration. The experiment results show that we get universal perturbations in a
shorter time and with a smaller number of training images. Furthermore, we
observe in experiments that universal perturbations generated by our proposed

concretely, given a specific target speaker, how likely is it to find another
person who gets falsely accepted as that target? This question may be addressed
empirically by studying naturally confusable pairs of speakers within a large
enough corpus. To this end, one might expect to find at least some speaker
pairs that are indistinguishable from each other in terms of ASV. To a certain
extent, such aim is mirrored in the standardized ASV evaluation benchmarks.
However, the number of speakers in such evaluation benchmarks represents only a
small fraction of all possible human voices, making it challenging to
extrapolate performance beyond a given corpus. Furthermore, the impostors used
in performance evaluation are usually selected randomly. A potentially more
meaningful definition of an impostor - at least in the context of
security-driven ASV applications - would be closest (most confusable) other
speaker to a given target.
  We put forward a novel performance assessment framework to address both the
inadequacy of the random-impostor evaluation model and the size limitation of
evaluation corpora by addressing ASV security against closest impostors on
arbitrarily large datasets. The framework allows one to make a prediction of
the safety of given ASV technology, in its current state, for arbitrarily large

planetary thermal evolution. Uncertainty in a giant planet's thermal state
contributes to the uncertainty in the inferred abundance of heavy elements it
contains. Within an analytic atmosphere model, we here investigate the
influence that different cloud opacities and cloud depths can have on the
metallicity of irradiated extrasolar gas giants, which is inferred from
interior models. In this work, the link between inferred metallicity and
assumed cloud properties is the thermal profile of atmosphere and interior.
Therefore, we perform coupled atmosphere, interior, and evolution calculations.
The atmosphere model includes clouds in a much simplified manner; it includes
long-wave absorption but neglects shortwave scattering. Within that model, we
show that optically thick, high clouds have negligible influence, whereas
deep-seated, optically very thick clouds can lead to warmer deep tropospheres
and therefore higher bulk heavy element mass estimates. For the young hot
Jupiter WASP-10b, we find a possible enhancement in inferred metallicity of up
to 10% due to possible silicate clouds at $\sim$0.3 bar. For WASP-39b, whose
observationally derived metallicity is higher than predicted by cloudless
models, we find an enhancement by at most 50%. However, further work on cloud
properties and their self-consistent coupling to the atmospheric structure is
needed in order to reduce uncertainties in the choice of model parameter
values, in particular of cloud opacities.

supervised segmentation loss term and an unsupervised term that encourages
segmentation consistency between the predictions of the two branches. We

reaches significantly higher segmentation accuracy compared to supervised
learning. This is due to learning transformation consistency on both labeled

multiple images. The implementation consists of three stages: model
initialization, model update, and background output. We consider the pixels

then segmented into superpixels with simple linear iterative clustering. When
the number of pixels labelled as background in a superpixel is bigger than a
predefined threshold, we label the superpixel as background to initialize the
background candidate masks. Background candidate images are obtained from input
raw images with the masks. Combining all candidate images, a background image
is produced. The background candidate masks, candidate images, and the
background image are then updated alternately until convergence. Finally,
ghosting artifacts is removed with the k-nearest neighbour method. An
experiment on an outdoor dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can

challenging 3-D terrain like rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as
large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from
branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of
snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to
understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable
kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface
friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by
partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body
sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces
for propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical
plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these
three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the
step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to
increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of
reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the
step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an
intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off
became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed
the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before
reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for
diverse, complex 3-D terrain.

employ a non-perturbative field-theoretical analysis based on the functional
renormalization group. For the particular case of $N_1=3$, $N_2=1$, we perform
a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo analysis of the strong-coupling region, where
both orders meet. Our findings support the robust emergence of enhanced

interesting findings. For a given current, there exists a critical disorder
strength below which its transverse motion could either be boosted below a
critical damping or be hindered above the critical damping, resulting in
current and disorder dependences of skyrmion Hall angle. The boosting comes
mainly from the random force that is opposite to the driving force (current).
The critical damping depends on the current density and disorder strength.
However, the longitudinal motion of a skyrmion is always hindered by the
disorder. Above the critical disorder strength, skyrmions are pinned. The
disorder-induced random force on a skyrmion can be classified as static and
kinetic ones, similar to the friction force in the Newtonian mechanics. In the
pinning phase, the static (pinning) random force is transverse to the current
density. The kinetic random force is opposite to the skyrmion velocity when
skyrmions are in motion. Furthermore, we provide strong evidences that the
Thiele equation can perfectly describe skyrmion dynamics in granular films.
These findings provide insight to skyrmion motion and should be important for
skyrmiontronics.

Automatic Speech Recognition has fostered interest in RNN inference

computations, prior work has designed customized architectures specifically
tailored to the computation pattern of RNN, getting high computation efficiency
for certain chosen model sizes. However, given that the dimensionality of RNNs
varies a lot for different tasks, it is crucial to generalize this efficiency
to diverse configurations. In this work, we identify adaptiveness as a key
feature that is missing from today's RNN accelerators. In particular, we first
show the problem of low resource-utilization and low adaptiveness for the
state-of-the-art RNN implementations on GPU, FPGA and ASIC architectures. To
solve these issues, we propose an intelligent tiled-based dispatching mechanism
for increasing the adaptiveness of RNN computation, in order to efficiently
handle the data dependencies. To do so, we propose Sharp as a hardware
accelerator, which pipelines RNN computation using an effective scheduling
scheme to hide most of the dependent serialization. Furthermore, Sharp employs
dynamic reconfigurable architecture to adapt to the model's characteristics.
Sharp achieves 2x, 2.8x, and 82x speedups on average, considering different RNN
models and resource budgets, compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC, FPGA, and

energy-reduction with respect to the previous solutions, due to the low power

exhibit non-homogeneous steady flows and that are subjected to an additional

viscosity bifurcation in the flow response to an external shear stress, we find
that additional sources of noise can lead to a fluidisation effect. As we
increase the noise intensity we evidence a transition from a non-monotonic to a
monotonic rheology, associated with giant fluctuations of the macroscopic shear
rate and long-time correlated dynamics. Although distinct noise models can lead
to different rheological behaviours in the low stress regime, we show that the
noise-induced transition from shear-localised to homogeneous flow at higher
stresses appears very generic. The observed features in the dynamics can be
interpreted as a result of an out-of-equilibrium phase transition, for which we
estimate the critical exponents that appear to be independent of the specific
choice of the noise implementation for the microscopic dynamics.

However, the pattern has been observed at the global (i.e., aggregated) level

study aims to address the following questions: Is the power-law uniform across

initiation and release of CMEs from solar active regions (ARs), without
reaching consensus on which is the predominant scenario, and thus rendering
impossible to accurately predict when a CME is going to erupt from a given AR.
To investigate AR magnetic properties that favor CMEs production, we employ
multi-spacecraft data to analyze a long duration AR (NOAA 11089, 11100, 11106,
11112 and 11121) throughout its complete lifetime, spanning five Carrington
rotations from July to November 2010. We use data from the Solar Dynamics
Observatory to study the evolution of the AR magnetic properties during the
five near-side passages, and a proxy to follow the magnetic flux changes when
no magnetograms are available, i.e. during far-side transits. We characterized
the angular widths, speeds and masses of 108 CMEs that we associated to the AR,
when examining a 124-day period. Such an ejectivity tracking was possible
thanks to the multiviewpoint images provided by the STEREO and SOHO in a
quasiquadrature configuration. We also inspected the X-ray flares registered by
the GOES satellite and found 162 to be associated to the AR under study. Given
the substantial number of ejections studied, we use a statistical approach
instead of a single-event analysis. We found three well defined periods of very
high CMEs activity and two periods with no mass ejections that are preceded or
accompanied by characteristic changes in the AR magnetic flux, free magnetic
energy and/or presence of electric currents. Our large sample of CMEs and long

activity to CME and Flare production.

two stages. In the first stage, we solve a sequence of optimization problems to
roughly identify those regions of parameter space which trigger the rare-event.
In the second stage, we use the stage one results to construct a mixture of
Gaussians that can be then used in an importance sampling algorithm to estimate
rare event probability. We propose using a local surrogate that minimizes
costly forward solves. The effectiveness of A-BIMC is demonstrated via several
synthetic examples. Yet again, the modified algorithm is prone to failure. We
systematically identify conditions under which it fails to lead to an effective

systems in which many-body localization coexists with topological properties in
a driven system. This allows one to implement and dynamically control a
topologically-protected qubit even at high energies. Floquet engineering - the
idea that a periodically driven non-equilibrium system can effectively emulate
the physics of a different Hamiltonian - is used to simulate an ffective
three-body interaction among spins in one dimension, using time-dependent
two-body interactions only. In the effective system emulated topology and
disorder coexist which provides an intriguing inroad into the interplay of
many-body localization, defying our standard understanding of thermodynamics,
and topological phases of matter, which are of fundamental and technological
importance. We demonstrate explicitly how combining Floquet engineering,
topology and many-body localization allows one to harvest the advantages
(time-dependent control, topological protection and reduction of heating,
respectively) of each of these sub-fields while protecting from their
disadvantages (heating, static control parameters and strong disorder).

through cosmic time by correlating $\sim50,000$ MgII absorbers, tracers of cool
gas ($\sim10^{4}$~K), detected in the SDSS quasar spectra with galaxies
detected in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. By doing so, we extract the
properties of galaxies associated with absorbers from redshift 0.4 to 1.3 with
effectively $\sim 15,000$ pairs and explore the covering fraction of MgII
absorbers as a function of galaxy type, stellar mass, impact parameter, and
redshift. We find that the gas covering fraction increases with stellar mass of
galaxies by $\sim M_{*}^{0.4}$. However, after we normalize the impact
parameter by the virial radius of dark matter halos, the gas profiles around
galaxies with masses ranging from $10^{9}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$ become
weakly dependent on stellar mass. In addition, the gas distribution depends on
galaxy type: the covering fraction within $0.3 \, r_{vir}$ around star-forming
galaxies is 2-4 times higher than that around passive galaxies at all
redshifts. We find that the covering fraction of strong absorbers
($W_{\lambda2796}>1$ Angstrom) around both types of galaxies evolves
significantly with redshift, similarly to the evolution of star-formation rate
of galaxies, while such an evolution is not detected for weak absorbers
($W_{\lambda2796}<1$ Angstrom). We quantify the HI mass traced by strong
absorbers and find that the gas mass around galaxies evolves consistently with
the star-formation rate of galaxies. This result suggests that the properties
of galaxies and their CGM co-evolve through cosmic time. Finally, we discuss
the origins of strong absorbers around passive galaxies and argue that its
redshift evolution may trace the star-formation activity of satellite galaxies.

infrastructure network. Failure mitigation can be carried out in an active or
passive manner. In active manner, live backups provide the required
reliability. Due to the high cost of active backups, failures can be mitigated
in a reactive manner where mitigation starts when a function fails. In this
paper, network functions are divided into two classes of essential (i.e., core)
functions and additive (i.e., service) functions. Core functions need active
backups and cannot tolerate any failure. However, additive functions do not
require backups and their absence is tolerable in short periods. Maximum
tolerable (function) absence time (TAT) is a measure used for their reliability
level. In our model and within the mitigation process, first, the backup host
to migrate the failed function is selected. Then, the state of the function is
migrated. The process should be carried out in less than TAT. An optimization
problem is formulated investigating cost-effective failure mitigation of
additive functions. The problem is of mixed integer non convex form. To tackle
the computational complexity, it is bisected into two back-to-back
leader-follower parts. The leader selects the migration destinations and the
follower divides network resources among functions for migration. These
problems are both NP-hard. For the leader problem, a central heuristic based on
the Viterbi algorithm suggested. The follower problem is converted into two
convex sub-problems. The validity of the proposed algorithms is proved via
extensive numerical results.

needlet thresholding procedures as a component separation tool. In this work,
we develop algorithms based on different needlet-thresholding schemes and use
them as extensions of existing, well-known component separation techniques,
namely ILC and template-fitting. We test soft- and hard-thresholding schemes,
using different procedures to set the optimal threshold level. We find that
thresholding can be useful as a denoising tool for internal templates in
experiments with few frequency channels, in conditions of low signal-to-noise.
We also compare our method with other denoising techniques, showing that
thresholding achieves the best performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy
and data compression while preserving the map resolution. The best results in
our tests are in particular obtained when considering template-fitting in an

the sum of losses over a large set of inputs $a_1,\ldots, a_n$, it is often
desirable to approximate $F$ by subsampling the input points. Strong
theoretical guarantees require taking into account the importance of each
point, measured by how much its individual loss contributes to $F(x)$.
Maximizing this importance over all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ yields the
\emph{sensitivity score} of $a_i$. Sampling with probabilities proportional to
these scores gives strong guarantees, allowing one to approximately minimize of
$F$ using just the subsampled points.
  Unfortunately, sensitivity sampling is difficult to apply since (1) it is
unclear how to efficiently compute the sensitivity scores and (2) the sample
size required is often impractically large. To overcome both obstacles we
introduce \emph{local sensitivity}, which measures data point importance in a
ball around some center $x_0$. We show that the local sensitivity can be
efficiently estimated using the \emph{leverage scores} of a quadratic
approximation to $F$ and that the sample size required to approximate $F$
around $x_0$ can be bounded. We propose employing local sensitivity sampling in
an iterative optimization method and analyze its convergence when $F$ is smooth
and convex.

  fields","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1901.09508",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to develop the theory of groups definable in the
$p$-adic field ${\mathbb Q}_p$, with ``definable $f$-generics"" in the sense of
an ambient saturated elementary extension of ${\mathbb Q}_p$. We call such
groups definable $f$-generic groups.
  So, by a ``definable f-generic'' or dfg group we mean a definable group in a
saturated model with a global f-generic type which is definable over a small
model. In the present context the group is definable over ${\mathbb Q}_p$, and
the small model will be ${\mathbb Q}_p$ itself. The notion of a dfg group is
dual, or rather opposite to that of an fsg group (group with ``finitely
satisfiable generics"") and is a useful tool to describe the analogue of torsion
free o-minimal groups in the $p$-adic context.
  In the current paper our group will be definable over ${\mathbb Q}_p$ in an
ambient saturated elementary extension $\mathbb K$ of ${\mathbb Q}_p$, so as to
make sense of the notions of $f$-generic etc. In this paper we will show that
every definable $f$-generic group definable in ${\mathbb Q}_p$ is virtually
isomorphic to a finite index subgroup of a trigonalizable algebraic group over
${\mathbb Q}_p$. This is analogous to the $o$-minimal context, where every
connected torsion free group definable in $\mathbb R$ is isomorphic to a
trigonalizable algebraic group (Lemma 3.4, \cite{COS}). We will also show that
every open definable $f$-generic subgroup of a definable $f$-generic group has
finite index, and every $f$-generic type of a definable $f$-generic group is
almost periodic, which gives a positive answer to the problem raised in
\cite{P-Y} of whether $f$-generic types coincide with almost periodic types in
the $p$-adic case.

as an example, i.e., statistical properties of the shipping lines of WMTN have
been investigated in various aspects: Firstly, we study the feature of loops in
the shipping lines by defining the line saturability. It is found that the line
saturability decays exponentially with the increase of line length. Secondly,
to detect the geographical community structure of shipping lines, the Label
Propagation Algorithm with compression of Flow (LPAF) and Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (MDS) method are employed, which show rather consistent communities.
Lastly, to analyse the redundancy property of shipping lines of different
marine companies, the multilayer networks were constructed by aggregating the
shipping lines of different marine companies. It is observed that the
topological quantities, such as average degree, average clustering coefficient,
etc., increase smoothly when marine companies are randomly merged (randomly
choose two marine companies, then merge the shipping lines of them together),
while the relative entropy decreases when the merging sequence is determined by
the Jensen-Shannon distance (choose two marine companies when the J-S distance
between them is the lowest). This indicates the low redundancy of shipping
lines among different marine companies.

authentication or identification mechanism. The popularity of SR brings in
serious security concerns, as demonstrated by recent adversarial attacks.
However, the impacts of such threats in the practical black-box setting are
still open, since current attacks consider the white-box setting only. In this
paper, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic study of the
adversarial attacks on SR systems (SRSs) to understand their security weakness
in the practical blackbox setting. For this purpose, we propose an adversarial
attack, named FAKEBOB, to craft adversarial samples. Specifically, we formulate
the adversarial sample generation as an optimization problem, incorporated with
the confidence of adversarial samples and maximal distortion to balance between
the strength and imperceptibility of adversarial voices. One key contribution
is to propose a novel algorithm to estimate the score threshold, a feature in
SRSs, and use it in the optimization problem to solve the optimization problem.
We demonstrate that FAKEBOB achieves 99% targeted attack success rate on both
open-source and commercial systems. We further demonstrate that FAKEBOB is also
effective on both open-source and commercial systems when playing over the air
in the physical world. Moreover, we have conducted a human study which reveals
that it is hard for human to differentiate the speakers of the original and
adversarial voices. Last but not least, we show that four promising defense
methods for adversarial attack from the speech recognition domain become
ineffective on SRSs against FAKEBOB, which calls for more effective defense
methods. We highlight that our study peeks into the security implications of
adversarial attacks on SRSs, and realistically fosters to improve the security
robustness of SRSs.

spectral properties of the non-selfadjoint Bloch-Torrey operator which
incorporates the microstructure of a sample through boundary conditions. Since
the spectrum of this operator is known to be discrete for isolated pores, the
signal can be decomposed onto the eigenmodes of the operator that yields the
stretched-exponential decay at high gradients and long times. Moreover, the
eigenmodes are localized near specific boundary points that makes the signal
more sensitive to the boundaries and thus opens new ways of probing the
microstructure. We argue that this behavior is much more general than earlier
believed, and should also be valid for unbounded and multi-compartmental
domains. In particular, the signal from the extracellular space is not Gaussian

interacting with flow fields, they show interesting dynamical features such as
trapping, clustering, and preferential orientation. One important step towards
the understanding of such features is to clarify the interplay of hydrodynamic
flows with microswimmer motility and shape. Here, we study the dynamics of
ellipsoidal microswimmers in a two-dimensional axisymmetric vortex flow.
Despite this simple setting, we find surprisingly rich dynamics, which can be
comprehensively characterized in the framework of dynamical systems theory. By
classifying the fixed-point structure of the underlying phase space as a
function of motility and microswimmer shape, we uncover the topology of the
phase space and determine the conditions under which microswimmers are trapped
in the vortex. For spherical microswimmers, we identify Hamiltonian dynamics,
which are broken for microswimmers of a different shape. We find that prolate
ellipsoidal microswimmers tend to align parallel to the velocity field, while
oblate microswimmers tend to remain perpendicular to it. Additionally, we find
that rotational noise allows microswimmers to escape the vortex with an
enhanced escape rate close to the system's saddle point. Our results clarify
the role of shape and motility on the occurrence of preferential concentration
and clustering and provide a starting point to understand the dynamics in more
complex flows.

is rarely sufficient - usually allowing only to predict conditional probability
distributions. This article discusses hierarchical correlation reconstruction
(HCR) methodology for such prediction on example of usually unavailable bid-ask
spreads, predicted from more accessible data like closing price, volume,
high/low price, returns. In HCR methodology we first normalize marginal
distributions to nearly uniform like in copula theory. Then we model (joint)
densities as linear combinations of orthonormal polynomials, getting its
decomposition into (mixed) moments. Then here we model each moment (separately)
of predicted variable as a linear combination of mixed moments of known
variables using least squares linear regression - getting accurate description
with interpretable coefficients describing linear relations between moments.
Combining such predicted moments we get predicted density as a polynomial, for
which we can e.g. calculate expected value, but also variance to evaluate
uncertainty of such prediction, or we can use the entire distribution e.g. for
more accurate further calculations or generating random values. There were
performed 10-fold cross-validation log-likelihood tests for 22 DAX companies,
leading to very accurate predictions, especially when using individual models
for each company as there were found large differences between their behaviors.
Additional advantage of the discussed methodology is being computationally
inexpensive, finding and evaluation a model with hundreds of parameters and
thousands of data points takes a second on a laptop.

Bayesian inference. It has also been argued that analogy is the core of
cognition. Here I will propose that these perspectives are fully compatible, in
that analogical reasoning can be described in terms of Bayesian inference and
vice versa, and that both of these positions require a thorough cybernetic
grounding in order to fulfill their promise as unifying frameworks for
understanding minds. From the Bayesian perspective of the Free Energy Principle
and Active Inference framework, thought is constituted by dynamics of cascading
belief propagation through the nodes of probabilistic generative models
specified by a cortical heterarchy ""rooted"" in action-perception cycles that
ground the mind as an embodied control system for an autonomous agent. From the
analogical structure mapping perspective, thought is constituted by the
alignment and comparison of heterogeneous structural representations. Here I
will propose that this core cognitive process for analogical reasoning is
naturally implemented by predictive coding mechanisms. However, both Bayesian
cognitive science and models of cognitive development via analogical reasoning
require rich base domains and priors (or reliably learnable posteriors) from
which they can commence the process of bootstrapping minds. Here in the spirit
of the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, I propose that embodiment
provides many of the inductive biases that are usually described in terms of

equations, it is possible to reorganize the linear system that results from the
implicit time-integration of the GL-DGSEM as a Schur complement problem, which
can be efficiently solved using static condensation. The use of static
condensation reduces the linear system size and improves the condition number
of the system matrix, which translates into shorter computational times when
using direct and iterative solvers.
  The statically condensed GL-DGSEM presented here can be applied to linear and
nonlinear advection-diffusion partial differential equations in conservation
form. To test it we solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with direct
and Krylov subspace solvers, and we show for a selected problem that using the
statically condensed GL-DGSEM leads to speed-ups of up to $200$ when compared
to the time-explicit GL-DGSEM, and speed-ups of up to three when compared with
the time-implicit GL-DGSEM that solves the global system.
  The GL-DGSEM has gained increasing popularity in recent years because it
satisfies the summation-by-parts property, which enables the construction of
provably entropy stable schemes, and because it is computationally very
efficient. In this paper, we show that the GL-DGSEM has an additional
advantage: It can be statically condensed.

areas. Emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great potential to replace
traditional human patrols for regularly monitoring critical situations
involving the safety of the grid. The critical lines can be monitored by a
fleet of UAVs to ensure a resilient surveillance system. The proposed approach
considers the \textit{n}-1 contingency analysis to find the criticality of a

set of UAVs (i.e., a UAV swarm) can perform continuous surveillance of the grid
satisfying various requirements, particularly the monitoring and resiliency
specifications. The verification process ultimately provides a trajectory plan

inspecting a point on a line is expressed in terms of a $k-$property specifying
that if $k$ UAVs fail or compromised still there is a UAV to collect the data
at the point within on time. We evaluate the proposed framework on synthetic

Laplacian matrix can well approximate the original Laplacian eigenvalues and

extensively studied for accelerating various numerical and graph-related
applications. Prior nearly-linear-time spectral sparsification methods first
extract low-stretch spanning tree from the original graph to form the backbone
of the sparsifier, and then recover small portions of spectrally-critical
off-tree edges to the spanning tree to significantly improve the approximation
quality. However, it is not clear how many off-tree edges should be recovered
for achieving a desired spectral similarity level within the sparsifier.
Motivated by recent graph signal processing techniques, this paper proposes a
similarity-aware spectral graph sparsification framework that leverages
efficient spectral off-tree edge embedding and filtering schemes to construct
spectral sparsifiers with guaranteed spectral similarity (relative condition
number) level. An iterative graph densification scheme is also introduced to
facilitate efficient and effective filtering of off-tree edges for highly
ill-conditioned problems. The proposed method has been validated using various
kinds of graphs obtained from public domain sparse matrix collections relevant
to VLSI CAD, finite element analysis, as well as social and data networks

socio-economic drivers, but focused, event-level predictions have had limited
success. Standard machine learning approaches are promising, but lack
interpretability, are generally interpolative, and ineffective for precise
future interventions with costly and wasteful false positives. Here, we are
introducing Granger Network inference as a new forecasting approach for
individual infractions with demonstrated performance far surpassing past
results, yet transparent enough to validate and extend social theory.
Considering the problem of predicting crime in the City of Chicago, we achieve
an average AUC of ~90\% for events predicted a week in advance within spatial
tiles approximately $1000$ ft across. Instead of pre-supposing that crimes
unfold across contiguous spaces akin to diffusive systems, we learn the local
transport rules from data. As our key insights, we uncover indications of
suburban bias -- how law-enforcement response is modulated by socio-economic
contexts with disproportionately negative impacts in the inner city -- and how
the dynamics of violent and property crimes co-evolve and constrain each other
-- lending quantitative support to controversial pro-active policing policies.
To demonstrate broad applicability to spatio-temporal phenomena, we analyze
terror attacks in the middle-east in the recent past, and achieve an AUC of
~80% for predictions made a week in advance, and within spatial tiles measuring
approximately 120 miles across. We conclude that while crime operates near an
equilibrium quickly dissipating perturbations, terrorism does not. Indeed

time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation within the single-active electron
approximation have been developed for studying ionization of atomic targets
exposed to an intense laser field. In addition, various numerical techniques
for extracting the photoelectron spectra from the time-dependent wave function
have emerged. In this paper we compare photoelectron spectra obtained by either
projecting the time-dependent wave function at the end of the laser pulse onto
the continuum state having proper incoming boundary condition or by using the
window-operator method. Our results for three different atomic targets show
that the boundary condition imposed onto the continuum states plays a crucial
role for obtaining correct spectra accurate enough to resolve fine details of
the interference structures of the photoelectron angular distribution.

they have also started to report on their environmental impact and their social
responsibility. The latest trend is now to deliver one single integrated report
where all stakeholders of the company can easily connect all facets of the
business with their impact considered in a broad sense. The main purpose of
this integrated approach is to avoid delivering data related to disconnected
silos, which consequently makes it very difficult to globally assess the
overall performance of an entity or a business line. In this paper, we focus on
how companies report on risks and ethical issues related to the increasing use
of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We explain some of these risks and potential
issues. Next, we identify some recent initiatives by various stakeholders to
define a global ethical framework for AI. Finally, we illustrate with four
cases that companies are very shy to report on these facets of AI.

and social systems. The dynamic range of an excitable network quantifies the
range of stimulus intensities that can be robustly distinguished by the network
response, and is maximized at the critical state. In this study, we examine the
impacts of backtracking activation on system criticality in excitable networks
consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, for dynamics
with refractory states that prohibit backtracking activation, the critical
state occurs when the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking (WNB)
matrix for excitatory units, $\lambda^E_{NB}$, is close to one, regardless of
the strength of inhibition. In contrast, for dynamics without refractory state
in which backtracking activation is allowed, the strength of inhibition affects
the critical condition through suppression of backtracking activation. As
inhibitory strength increases, backtracking activation is gradually suppressed.
Accordingly, the system shifts continuously along a continuum between two
extreme regimes -- from one where the criticality is determined by the largest
eigenvalue of the weighted adjacency matrix for excitatory units,
$\lambda^E_W$, to the other where the critical state is reached when
$\lambda_{NB}^E$ is close to one. For systems in between, we find that
$\lambda^E_{NB}<1$ and $\lambda^E_W>1$ at the critical state. These findings,
confirmed by numerical simulations using both random and synthetic neural
networks, indicate that backtracking activation impacts the criticality of
excitable networks.

were coupled to track the elastic strain field (or stress field) and the total
strain field near a general grain boundary in a bent bicrystal. A 316L
stainless steel bicrystal was deformed in situ into the elasto-plastic regime
with a four-point bending setup. The test was then simulated using finite
elements with a crystal plasticity model comprising internal variables
(dislocation densities on discrete slip systems). The predictions of the model
have been compared with both the total strain field and the elastic strain
field obtained experimentally. While activated slip systems and total strains
are reasonably well predicted, elastic strains appear overestimated next to the
grain boundary. This suggests that conventional crystal plasticity models need
improvement to correctly model stresses at grain boundaries.

challenge in the development of deep learning models for scholarly applications
in cloud based environment is the underutilization of resources because of the

parallel search engine at its core. A CAM takes as an input a value and outputs
the address where this value is stored in case of a match. CAMs are used in a
wide range of applications including networking, cashing, neuromorphic
associative memories, multimedia, and data analytics. Here, we introduce a
novel opto-electronic CAM (OE-CAM) utilizing the integrated silicon photonic
platform. In our approach, we explore the performance of an experimental OE-CAM
and verify the efficiency of the device at 25Gbit/s while maintaining the bit
integrity under noise conditions. We show that OE-CAM enables a) two orders of
magnitude faster search functionality resulting in b) a five orders of
magnitude lower power-delay-product compared to CAMs implementations based on
other emerging technologies. This remarkable performance potential is achieved
by utilizing i) a high parallelism of wavelength-division-multiplexing in the
optical domain, combined with ii) 10s of GHz-fast opto-electronic components,
packaged in iii) integrated photonics for 10-100s ps-short communication
delays. We further verify the upper optical input power limit of this OE-CAM to
be given by parasitic nonlinearities inside the silicon waveguides, and the
minimal detectable optical power at the back-end photoreceivers responsivity
given channel noise. Such energy-efficient and short-delay OE-CAMs could become
a key component of functional photonic-augmented ASICS, co-processors, or smart
sensors.
