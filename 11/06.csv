platform for the realization of axion electrodynamics. In this paper, we report
a systematic study of the axion topological insulator candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$.
A linear energy dispersion across the Fermi level confirms the existence of the
proposed hole-type Fermi pocket. Spin-flop transitions occur with magnetic
fields applied within the $ab$-plane while are absent for fields parallel to
the $c$-axis. Anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams are observed and the
orientation of the ground magnetic moment is found to be within the $ab$-plane.
The magnetoresistivity for EuIn$_2$As$_2$ behaves non-monotonic as a function
of field strength. It exhibits angular dependent evolving due to field-driven
and temperature-driven magnetic states. These results indicate that the
magnetic states of EuIn$_2$As$_2$ strongly affect the transport properties as
well as the topological nature.

For interpretability, we decompose the expected health outcome into a linear
main effect, pairwise interactions, and a non-linear deviation. Our interest is
in model selection for these different components, accounting for uncertainty
and addressing non-identifability between the linear and nonparametric
components of the semiparametric model. We propose a Bayesian approach to
inference, placing variable selection priors on the different components, and
developing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. A key component of our
approach is the incorporation of a heredity constraint to only include
interactions in the presence of main effects, effectively reducing
dimensionality of the model search. We adapt a projection approach developed in
the spatial statistics literature to enforce identifiability in modeling the
nonparametric component using a Gaussian process. We also employ a dimension
reduction strategy to sample the non-linear random effects that aids the mixing
of the MCMC algorithm. The proposed MixSelect framework is evaluated using a

training sets are obtained. Instead of relying on a single expert annotator,
crowdsourcing shares the labelling effort among a large number of
collaborators. For instance, this is being applied to the data acquired by the
laureate Laser Interferometer Gravitational Waves Observatory (LIGO), in order
to detect glitches which might hinder the identification of true
gravitational-waves. The crowdsourcing scenario poses new challenging
difficulties, as it deals with different opinions from a heterogeneous group of
annotators with unknown degrees of expertise. Probabilistic methods, such as
Gaussian Processes (GP), have proven successful in modeling this setting.
However, GPs do not scale well to large data sets, which hampers their broad
adoption in real practice (in particular at LIGO). This has led to the recent
introduction of deep learning based crowdsourcing methods, which have become
the state-of-the-art. However, the accurate uncertainty quantification of GPs
has been partially sacrificed. This is an important aspect for astrophysicists
in LIGO, since a glitch detection system should provide very accurate
probability distributions of its predictions. In this work, we leverage the
most popular sparse GP approximation to develop a novel GP based crowdsourcing
method that factorizes into mini-batches. This makes it able to cope with
previously-prohibitive data sets. The approach, which we refer to as Scalable
Variational Gaussian Processes for Crowdsourcing (SVGPCR), brings back GP-based
methods to the state-of-the-art, and excels at uncertainty quantification.
SVGPCR is shown to outperform deep learning based methods and previous
probabilistic approaches when applied to the LIGO data. Moreover, its behavior

not guaranteed to compose, we provide theory for a set of conditions under
which fairness of individual models does compose. We then present an analytical
framework for both understanding whether a real system's signals can achieve
compositional fairness, and improving which component would have the greatest
impact on the fairness of the overall system. In addition to the theoretical
results, we find on multiple datasets -- including a large-scale real-world

However, even with such unprecedented success, DL methods are often regarded as

severely limits further improvement and extension. In this paper, we present a
preliminary theoretical analysis on DL based channel estimation for
multiple-antenna systems to understand and interpret its internal mechanism.
Deep neural network (DNN) with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function
is mathematically equivalent to a piecewise linear function. Hence, the
corresponding DL estimator can achieve universal approximation to a large
family of functions by making efficient use of piecewise linearity. We
demonstrate that DL based channel estimation does not restrict to any specific
signal model and approaches to the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation
in various scenarios without requiring any prior knowledge of channel
statistics. Therefore, DL based channel estimation outperforms or is at least
comparable with traditional channel estimation, depending on the types of
channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed
interpretation and demonstrate the effectiveness of DL based channel estimation
under both linear and nonlinear signal models.

  In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end framework to detect such attacks

we analyze the activation patterns of the dense layers during classification

examples.
  Our prototype implementation successfully detects adversarial examples in

addition, to effectively defend against state-of-the-art attacks, our approach
generalizes between different sets of adversarial examples. Thus, our method

security community, namely persistent security. As NVM-based memories are
expected to restore their data after recovery, the security metadata must be
recovered as well. However, persisting all affected security metadata on each
memory write would significantly degrade performance and exacerbate the write
endurance problem. Moreover, recovery time can increase significantly (up to
hours for practical memory sizes) when security metadata are not updated
strictly. Counter trees are used in state-of-the-art commercial secure
processors, e.g., Intel's Safe Guard Extension (SGX). Counter trees have a
unique challenge due to the inability to recover the whole tree from leaves.
Thus, to ensure recoverability, all updates to the tree must be persisted,
which can be tens of additional writes on each write. The state-of-art scheme,
Anubis, enables recoverability but incurs an additional write per cache
eviction, i.e., reduces lifetime to approximately half. Additionally, Anubis
degrades performance significantly in many cases. In this paper, we propose
Phoenix, a practical novel scheme which relies on elegantly reproducing the
cache content before a crash, however with minimal overheads. Our evaluation
results show that Phoenix reduces persisting security metadata overhead writes
from 87\% extra writes (for Anubis) to less than write-back compared to an
encrypted system without recovery, thus improving the NVM lifetime by 2x.
Overall Phoenix performance is better than the baseline, unlike Anubis which
adds 7.9\% (max of 35\%) performance overhead.

effect is forbidden in bulk zinc-blende crystals by symmetry arguments,
therefore, its observation indicates either the symmetry reduction of bulk

the form of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates, harbouring a
supermassive black hole. We use the ``velocity dispersion tracing'' relation
according to which the velocity dispersion in the core $v_c^2\sim GM_c/R_c$ is
of the same order as the velocity dispersion in the halo $v_h^2\sim GM_h/r_h$
(this relation can be justified from thermodynamical arguments) and the
approximate analytical mass-radius relation of the quantum core in the presence
of a central black hole obtained in our previous paper [P.H. Chavanis, Eur.
Phys. J. Plus 134, 352 (2019)]. For a given minimum halo mass $(M_h)_{\rm
min}\sim 10^8\, M_{\odot}$ determined by the observations, the only free
parameter of our model is the scattering length $a_s$ of the bosons (their mass
$m$ is then determined by the characteristics of the minimum halo). For
noninteracting bosons and for bosons with a repulsive self-interaction, we find
that the core mass $M_c$ increases with the halo mass $M_h$ and achieves a
maximum value $(M_c)_{\rm max}$ at some halo mass $(M_h)_{*}$ before
decreasing. The whole series of equilibria is stable. For bosons with an
attractive self-interaction, we find that the core mass achieves a maximum
value $(M_c)_{\rm max}$ at some halo mass $(M_h)_{*}$ before decreasing. The
series of equilibria becomes unstable above a maximum halo mass $(M_h)_{\rm
max}\ge (M_h)_{*}$. In the absence of black hole $(M_h)_{\rm max}=(M_h)_{*}$.
At that point, the quantum core (similar to a dilute axion star) collapses. We
perform a similar study for fermionic dark matter halos. We find that they
behave similarly to bosonic dark matter halos with a repulsive
self-interaction, the Pauli principle for fermions playing the role of the
repulsive self-interaction for bosons.

decline of each burst, and attempt to fit an analytical model based on the
standard GRB afterglow equations to each data set. We show that most of the
events in our \textit{Swift} GRB sample are incompatible with the radio light
curve behavior predicted by conventional afterglow theory. Many exhibit a
late-time radio decline incompatible with the post-break X-ray or optical
afterglow. Only one radio afterglow in this sample, at any time, shows the
eventually expected decline of $\sim t^{-2}$, although two others show it in
their mm light curve. Several others remain consistent with the standard model
if such a decline began after the observations. The radio behavior alone does
not, however, indicate whether a GRB can be fit by our modeling code. Indeed,
several of the well-fit GRBs may only appear so due to a lack of
multi-wavelength data. While a second source of emission can account for some
of the anomalous radio behavior, our tests indicate this is often not the case
unless the main jet component is simultaneously suppressed.

satisfying the requirements of a resource measure, it has the closest possible

possible for {\it a priori} vanishing scalar field mass. In particular, we
demonstrate that the scalarization of an aAdS black hole requires the curvature
invariant $-\left(\alpha{\cal R} + \gamma {\cal G}\right)$ to drop below the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound close to the black hole horizon, while it
asymptotes to a value well above the bound. The dimension of the dual operator
on the AdS boundary depends on the parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ and we
demonstrate that -- for fixed operator dimension -- the expectation value of
this dual operator increases with decreasing temperature of the black hole,
i.e. of the dual field theory. When taking backreaction of the space-time into
account, we find that the scalarization of the black hole is the dual
description of a phase transition in a strongly coupled quantum system, i.e.
corresponds to a holographic phase transition. A possible application are
liquid-gas quantum phase transitions, e.g. in $^4$He. Finally, we demonstrate

sequential algorithms with (nearly) optimal running time have been known for
several decades, near-optimal parallel algorithms have turned out to be a much
tougher challenge. For $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation, all prior algorithms
with $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ depth perform at least $\Omega(mn^{c})$ work for
some constant $c>0$. Improving this long-standing upper bound obtained by Cohen
(STOC'94) has been open for $25$ years.
  We develop several new tools of independent interest. One of them is a new
notion beyond hopsets --- low hop emulator --- a $\mathrm{poly}(\log
n)$-approximate emulator graph in which every shortest path has at most
$O(\log\log n)$ hops (edges). Direct applications of the low hop emulators are
parallel algorithms for $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$-approximate single source
shortest path (SSSP), Bourgain's embedding, metric tree embedding, and low
diameter decomposition, all with $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ depth and
$m\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ work.
  To boost the approximation ratio to $(1+\varepsilon)$, we introduce
compressible preconditioners and apply it inside Sherman's framework (SODA'17)
to solve the more general problem of uncapacitated minimum cost flow (a.k.a.,
transshipment problem). Our algorithm computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate
uncapacitated minimum cost flow in $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ depth using
$m\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ work. As a consequence, it also improves the
state-of-the-art sequential running time from $m\cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$ to
$m\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$.

high probability whether a graph was drawn from this model or the uniform
distribution on regular graphs, is conjectured to undergo a computational phase
transition at a point called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold.
  In this work, we consider two models of random graphs namely the well-studied
(irregular) stochastic block model and a distribution over random regular
graphs we'll call the Degree Regular Block Model. For both these models, we
show that sufficiently high constant levels of our hierarchy can perform
detection arbitrarily close to the KS threshold and that our algorithm is
robust to up to a linear number of adversarial edge perturbations. Furthermore,
in the case of Degree Regular Block Model (DRBM), we show that below the
Kesten-Stigum threshold no constant level can do so.
  In the case of the (irregular) Stochastic Block Model, it is known that
efficient algorithms exist all the way down to this threshold, although none
are robust to a linear number of adversarial perturbations of the graph when
the average degree is small. More importantly, there is little
complexity-theoretic evidence that detection is hard below the threshold. In
the DRBM with more than two groups, it has not to our knowledge been proven
that any algorithm succeeds down to the KS threshold, let alone that one can do
so robustly, and there is a similar dearth of evidence for hardness below this
point.

efficient optimization over the active set of selected features (AMNR). This
algorithm can be used to minimize continuously differentiable objective

then use both algorithms for estimating different electroencephalography (EEG)

estimate new models in the EEG inverse problem context, such as nonnegative

manifold is governed by the Euler equations. Recently, Tao launched a programme
to address the global existence problem for the Euler and Navier Stokes
equations based on the concept of universality. Inspired by this proposal, in
this article we prove that the stationary Euler equations exhibit several
universality features. More precisely, we show that any non-autonomous flow on
a compact manifold can be extended to a smooth stationary solution of the Euler
equations on some Riemannian manifold of possibly higher dimension. The
solutions we construct are of Beltrami type, and being stationary they exist
for all time. Using this result, we establish the Turing completeness of the
steady Euler flows,i.e., there exist solutions that encode a universal Turing
machine and, in particular, these solutions have undecidable trajectories. Our
proofs deepen the correspondence between contact topology and hydrodynamics,
which is key to establish the universality of the Reeb flows and their Beltrami
counterparts. An essential ingredient in the proofs, of interest in itself, is
a novel flexibility theorem for embeddings in Reeb dynamics in terms of an
h-principle in contact geometry, which unveils the flexible behavior of the
steady Euler flows. These results can be viewed as lending support to the
intuition that solutions to the Euler equations can be extremely complicated in
nature.

Way-mass magneto-hydrodynamical simulations in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
context. In order to compare with observations, we generate synthetic SDSS-like
broad-band images from the numerical data at z = 0 with different inclinations
(from face-on to edge-on). Ellipse fits are used to determine the bar lengths,
and 2D bulge/disc/bar decompositions with galfit are also performed, modelling
the bar component with the modified Ferrer profile. We find a wide range of bar
sizes and luminosities in the sample, and their structural parameters are in
good agreement with the observations. All bulges present low S\'ersic indexes,
and are classified as pseudobulges. In regard to the discs, the same breaks in
the surface brightness profiles observed in real galaxies are found, and the
radii at which these take place are in agreement with the observations. Also,
from edge-on unsharp-masked images at z = 0, boxy or peanut-shaped (B/P)
structures are clearly identified in the inner part of 4 bars, and also 2 more
bars are found in buckling phase. The sizes of the B/P match fairly well with
those obtained from observations. We thus conclude that the observed
photometric and structural properties of galaxies with bars, which are the main
drivers of secular evolution, can be developed in present state-of-the-art
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations.

terms of hardware, devices have become so small that we are struggling to
eliminate the effects of thermodynamic fluctuations, which are unavoidable at
the nanometer scale. In terms of software, our ability to imagine and program
effective computational abstractions and implementations are clearly challenged

this problem in $O(n\log n)$ time in constant dimensions (i.e., when $d=O(1)$).
This paper asks and answers the question of the problem's quantum time
complexity. Specifically, we give an $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ algorithm in constant
dimensions, which is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor by the lower bound
on the quantum query complexity of element distinctness. The key to our

quantum interference.
  In $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ dimensions, no known quantum algorithms perform
better than brute force search, with a quadratic speedup provided by Grover's
algorithm. To give evidence that the quadratic speedup is nearly optimal, we
initiate the study of quantum fine-grained complexity and introduce the Quantum
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (QSETH), which is based on the assumption
that Grover's algorithm is optimal for CNF-SAT when the clause width is large.
We show that the na\""{i}ve Grover approach to closest pair in higher dimensions

channels is presented. Our derivation makes use of a flagged extension of the
map where the receiver obtains a copy of a state $\sigma_0$ whenever the
messages are transmitted without errors, and a copy of a state $\sigma_1$ when
instead the original state gets fully depolarized. By varying the overlap
between the flags states, the resulting transformation nicely interpolates
between the depolarizing map (when $\sigma_0=\sigma_1$), and the
$d$-dimensional erasure channel (when $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_1$ have orthogonal
support). In our analysis we compute the product-state classical capacity, the
entanglement assisted capacity and, under degradability conditions, the quantum
capacity of the flagged channel. From this last result we get the upper bound
for the depolarizing channel, which by a direct comparison appears to be
tighter than previous available results for $d>2$, and for $d=2$ it is tighter
in an intermediate regime of noise. In particular, in the limit of large $d$
values, our findings presents a previously unnoticed $\mathcal O(1)$
correction.

show that any choice of a faithful normal tracial state on $\mathscr{R}$
engenders the same measure topology on $\mathscr{R}$ in the sense of Nelson (J.
Func. Anal., 15 (1974), 103--116). Consequently it is justified to speak of
`the' measure topology of $\mathscr{R}$. Having made this observation, we
extend the notion of measure topology to general finite von Neumann algebras
and denominate it the $\mathfrak{m}$-topology. We note that the procedure of
$\mathfrak{m}$-completion yields Murray-von Neumann algebras in a functorial
manner and provides them with an intrinsic description as unital ordered
complex topological $*$-algebras. This enables the study of abstract Murray-von
Neumann algebras avoiding reference to a Hilbert space. Furthermore, it makes
apparent the appropriate notion of Murray-von Neumann subalgebras, and the
intrinsic nature of the spectrum and point spectrum of elements, independent of
their ambient Murray-von Neumann algebra. In this context, we show the
well-definedness of the Borel function calculus for normal elements and use it
along with approximation techniques in the $\mathfrak{m}$-topology to transfer
many standard operator inequalities involving bounded self-adjoint operators to
the setting of (unbounded) self-adjoint operators in Murray-von Neumann
algebras. On the algebraic side, Murray-von Neumann algebras have been
described as the Ore localization of finite von Neumann algebras with respect
to their corresponding multiplicative subset of non-zero-divisors. Our
discussion reveals that, in addition, there are fundamental topological,
order-theoretic and analytical facets to their description.

in sciences. Their analysis is usually based on the classical Repeated Measures
ANOVA. Roughly speaking, the latter can be shown to be asymptotically valid for
large sample sizes $n_i$ assuming a fixed number of groups $a$ and time points
$d$. However, for high-dimensional settings with $d>n_i$ this argument breaks
down and statistical tests are often based on (standardized) quadratic forms.
Furthermore analysis of their limit behaviour is usually based on certain
assumptions on how $d$ converges to $\infty$ with respect to $n_i$. As this may
be hard to argue in practice, we do not want to make such restrictions.
Moreover, sometimes also the number of groups $a$ may be large compared to $d$
or $n_i$. To also have an impression about the behaviour of (standardized)
quadratic forms as test statistic, we analyze their asymptotics under diverse
settings on $a$, $d$ and $n_i$. In fact, we combine all kind of combinations,
where they diverge or are bounded in a unified framework. Studying the limit
distributions in detail, we follow Sattler and Pauly (2018) and propose an
approximation to obtain critical values. The resulting test together with their
approximation approach are investigated in an extensive simulation study with a

current operator in the vicinity of equilibrium states in terms of powers of
local and quasi-local conserved quantities. We show that only the second-order
terms in this expansion carry a finite contribution to diffusive spreading. Our
formalism implies that whenever there are at least two coupled modes with
degenerate group velocities, the system behaves super-diffusively, in
accordance with the non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory. Finally, we
show that our expression saturates the exact diffusion constants in quantum and
classical interacting integrable systems, providing a general framework to
derive these expressions.

trade-off between model accuracy and the effort of manual labeling. However,
for segmenting the hierarchical brain tumor structures, manually labeling
scribbles for each substructure could still be demanding. In this paper, we use
only two kinds of weak labels, i.e., scribbles on whole tumor and healthy brain

deep learning model to segment all the sub-regions. Specifically, we train two

whole tumor (WT) segmentation network, which roughly recovers the WT mask of
training data; then we cluster the WT region with the guide of global labels.
The rough substructure segmentation from clustering is used as weak labels to
train the second network. The dense CRF loss is used to refine the weakly
supervised segmentation. We evaluate our approach on the BraTS2017 dataset and
achieve competitive WT dice score as well as comparable scores on substructure

emission line predictions is a relatively new and rapidly evolving field.
However, nebular emission lines have been particularly challenging to model
because they are extremely sensitive to the local photoionization balance,
which can be driven by a spatially dispersed distribution of stars amidst an
inhomogeneous absorbing medium of dust and gas. As such, several unmodeled
mysteries in observed emission line patterns exist in the literature. For
example, there is some question as to why He II $\lambda 4686$/H$\beta$ ratios
in observations of lower-metallicity dwarf galaxies tend to be higher than
model predictions. Since hydrodynamic cosmological simulations are best suited
to this mass and metallicity regime, this question presents a good test case
for the development of a robust emission line modeling pipeline. The pipeline
described in this work can model a process that produces high He II $\lambda
4686$/H$\beta$ ratios and eliminate some of the modeling discrepancy for ratios
below 3% without including AGNs, X-ray binaries, high mass binaries, or a
top-heavy stellar initial mass function. These ratios are found to be more

conclude that the combination of large fractions of interlopers and the longer

formation process to explain the observed abundance of CGs for $z<0.2$.

$k$-invariance, which we refine and study in detail. Particular emphasis is

the selection criteria which allows for valid post-selection inference.

sources. However, the detailed physics of these particle acceleration processes
is still not well understood. One of the main open questions is the role of
fossil relativistic electrons that have been deposited in the intra-cluster
medium by radio galaxies. These synchrotron-emitting electrons are very
difficult to study, as their radiative life time is only tens of Myrs at GHz
frequencies, and are therefore a relatively unexplored population. Despite the
typical steep radio spectrum due to synchrotron losses, these fossil electrons
are barely visible even at radio frequencies well below a GHz. However, when a
pocket of fossil radio plasma is compressed, it boosts the visibility at
sub-GHz frequencies, creating so-called radio phoenices. This compression can
be the result of bulk motion and shocks in the ICM due to merger activity. In
this paper, we demonstrate the discovery potential of low frequency radio sky
surveys to find and study revived fossil plasma sources in galaxy clusters. We
used the 150~MHz TGSS and 1.4 GHz NVSS sky surveys to identify candidate radio
phoenices. A subset of three candidates were studied in detail using deep
multi-band radio observations (LOFAR and GMRT), X-ray (\textit{Chandra} or

untrusted batches. Here, we assume $m$ users, all of whom have samples from
some underlying distribution $p$ over $1, \ldots, n$. Each user sends a batch
of $k$ i.i.d. samples from this distribution; however an $\epsilon$-fraction of
users are untrustworthy and can send adversarially chosen responses. The goal
is then to learn $p$ in total variation distance. When $k = 1$ this is the
standard robust univariate density estimation setting and it is well-understood
that $\Omega (\epsilon)$ error is unavoidable. Suprisingly, Qiao and Valiant
gave an estimator which improves upon this rate when $k$ is large.
Unfortunately, their algorithms run in time exponential in either $n$ or $k$.
  We first give a sequence of polynomial time algorithms whose estimation error
approaches the information-theoretically optimal bound for this problem. Our
approach is based on recent algorithms derived from the sum-of-squares
hierarchy, in the context of high-dimensional robust estimation. We show that
algorithms for learning from untrusted batches can also be cast in this
framework, but by working with a more complicated set of test functions.
  It turns out this abstraction is quite powerful and can be generalized to
incorporate additional problem specific constraints. Our second and main result
is to show that this technology can be leveraged to build in prior knowledge
about the shape of the distribution. Crucially, this allows us to reduce the
sample complexity of learning from untrusted batches to polylogarithmic in $n$
for most natural classes of distributions, which is important in many
applications. To do so, we demonstrate that these sum-of-squares algorithms for
robust mean estimation can be made to handle complex combinatorial constraints
(e.g. those arising from VC theory), which may be of independent technical
interest.

conventional model of virtual memory with a one-to-one mapping between
instructions and virtual memory addresses, PNS creates N mappings for the same
instruction, and randomly switches between them at runtime. PNS achieves fast
randomization, at the granularity of basic blocks, which mitigates a class of
attacks known as (just-in-time) code-reuse.
  If an attacker uses a memory safety-related vulnerability to cause any of the
instruction addresses to be different from the one chosen during a fetch, the
exploited program will crash. We quantitatively evaluate how PNS mitigates
real-world code-reuse attacks by reducing the success probability of typical
exploits to approximately $10^{-12}$. We implement PNS and validate it by
running SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite. We further verify its practicality by
adding it to a RISC-V core on an FPGA. Lastly, PNS is mainly designed for

$R_{\rm half}$ agree with observations at high redshift, but by $z=0$ are too
large, owing to numerical heating. We compare Simba $z=0$ sSFR radial profiles
for star forming and green valley galaxies to observations. Simba shows strong
central depressions in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, and gas fraction in
green valley galaxies and massive star-forming systems, qualitatively as
observed, owing to black hole X-ray feedback, which pushes central gas
outwards. Turning off X-ray feedback leads to centrally peaked sSFR profiles as
in other simulations. In conflict with observations, Simba yields green valley
galaxies with strongly dropping sSFR profiles beyond $\gtrsim R_{\rm half}$,
regardless of AGN feedback. The central depression owes to lowering molecular
gas content; the drop in the outskirts owes to reduced star formation
efficiency. Simba's satellites have higher central sSFR and lower outskirts
sSFR than centrals, in qualitative agreement with observations. At $z=2$ Simba
does not show central depressions in massive star-forming galaxies, suggesting
Simba's X-ray feedback should be more active at high-$z$. High resolution tests
indicate central sSFR suppression is not sensitive to numerical resolution.
Reproducing the central sSFR depression in $z=0$ green valley galaxies
represents a unique success of Simba. The remaining discrepancies highlight the
importance of SFR and gas profiles in constraining quenching mechanisms.

distribution of colliding objects into a large number N of bins in mass space,
usually logarithmically spaced. A standard approach for redistributing the
debris produced in collisions into the corresponding mass bins results in
O(N^3) calculation, which leads to significant computational overhead when N is
large. Here we formulate a more efficient explicit O(N^2) fragmentation
algorithm, which works when the size spectrum of fragments produced in an
individual collision has a self-similar shape with only a single characteristic
mass scale (which can have arbitrary dependence on the energy and masses of
colliding objects). Fragment size spectra used in existing fragmentation codes
typically possess this property. We also show that our O(N^2) approach can be
easily extended to work with non-self-similar fragment size distributions, for
which we provide a worked example. This algorithm offers a substantial speedup
of fragmentation calculations for large N> 100, even over the implicit methods,
making it an attractive tool for studying collisionally evolving systems.

of analytical strong-coupling arguments and a comprehensive Hartree-Fock
numerical calculation which includes the effect of remote bands. The ground

the Kramers intervalley-coherent (K-IVC) insulator. In its simplest form, the
K-IVC exhibits a pattern of alternating circulating currents which triples the
graphene unit cell leading to an ""orbital magnetization density wave"". Although
translation and time reversal symmetry are broken, a combined `Kramers' time
reversal symmetry is preserved. Our analytic arguments are built on first
identifying an approximate ${\rm U}(4) \times {\rm U}(4)$ symmetry, resulting
from the remarkable properties of the tBG band structure, which helps select a
low energy manifold of states, which are further split to favor the K-IVC. This
low energy manifold is also found in the Hartree-Fock numerical calculation. We
show that symmetry lowering perturbations can stabilize other insulators and

several years, researchers from multiple communities -- such as security,

These studies mainly focused on improving the utility of the LDP protocols.
However, the security of LDP protocols is largely unexplored. In this work, we
aim to bridge this gap. We focus on LDP protocols for frequency estimation and
heavy hitter identification, which are two basic data analytics tasks.
Specifically, we show that an attacker can inject fake users into an LDP
protocol and the fake users send carefully crafted data to the data collector
such that the LDP protocol estimates high frequencies for arbitrary
attacker-chosen items or identifies them as heavy hitters. We call our attacks
data poisoning attacks. We theoretically and/or empirically show the
effectiveness of our attacks. We also explore three countermeasures against our

important factor that the advertisers respond to changes. Our goal is to build
a theoretical framework for predicting the actions of an agent (the advertiser)

problem using a variant of the multi-armed bandit setting where playing an arm
is costly. The cost of each arm changes over time and is publicly observable.
The value of playing an arm is drawn stochastically from a static distribution
and is observed by the agent and not by us. We, however, observe the actions of
the agent. Our main result is that assuming the agent is playing a strategy
with a regret of at most $f(T)$ within the first $T$ rounds, we can learn to
play the multi-armed bandits game (without observing the rewards) in such a way
that the regret of our selected actions is at most $O(k^4(f(T)+1)\log(T))$,

drastically different radiation patterns when operated in transmission or in

resonant antenna element that provides very efficient frequency conversion
between only two frequencies: one associated to waves propagating in free-space
and the other related to guided signals. Controlling the tunable nonreciprocal
phase response of these elements with the phase of low-frequency modulation
signals permits to independently tailor the transmission and reception
radiation patterns of the entire array. Measured results at microwaves confirm
isolation levels over 40 dB at desired directions in space with an overall loss
below 4 dB. We believe that this concept can be extended across the

important implications in communication, sensing, and radar systems, as well as

  Harsh Jungle Terrains",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our overall aim is focused on exploring whether we could use Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) technology to track poacher vehicles in remote and rural areas
such as Sabah, in Malaysia, especially deep inside the jungle terrain with
little or no communication technologies exists. Tracking technologies are
currently limited to relying on satellites or cellular towers, for environments
that do not permit access to these signals, very few viable alternatives exist.
This paper explores the use of BLE as a method to track vehicles. It works by
mounting Bluetooth beacons beside a road and placing a receiver concealed
somewhere inside the vehicle. As the vehicle drives past the beacon, the
receiver and beacon are momentarily in range, the receiver then stores a unique
ID from the beacon and when the vehicle is then in an area with GSM signal, an
SMS is sent containing the unique IDs of the beacons that have been detected.
This project is prototyped and tested in collaboration with the Danau Girang
Field Centre in Sabah, Malaysia. The results offer insights for how effective
BLE beacons are in a tracking situation for where the beacon and receiver are
in range for a short period of time as well as how different obstructions will
affect the range and strength of the signal. It is important to note that our
objective is not to catch the poacher, instead to understand how they move
around within jungle terrain, as we can use such information to develop a
comprehensive plan against poaching activities.

to sample from an arbitrary probability distribution without explicitly

also a discriminator that is trained to discriminate such fake samples from
true samples of the distribution; at the same time, the generator is trained to
generate fakes that the discriminator cannot tell apart from the true samples.
Instead of learning a global generator, a recent approach involves training
multiple generators each responsible from one part of the distribution. In this

learns a tree structure implementing a hierarchical clustering with soft splits

  boundary value problems",,,,,"math.OA math.AP math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We answer the question of when an invariant pseudodifferential operator is
Fredholm on a fixed, given isotypical component. More precisely, let $\Gamma$
be a compact group acting on a smooth, compact, manifold $M$ without boundary
and let $P \in \psi^m(M; E_0, E_1)$ be a $\Gamma$-invariant, classical,
pseudodifferential operator acting between sections of two $\Gamma$-equivariant
vector bundles $E_0$ and $E_1$. Let $\alpha$ be an irreducible representation
of the group $\Gamma$. Then $P$ induces by restriction a map $\pi_\alpha(P) :
H^s(M; E_0)_\alpha \to H^{s-m}(M; E_1)_\alpha$ between the $\alpha$-isotypical
components of the corresponding Sobolev spaces of sections. We study in this
paper conditions on the map $\pi_\alpha(P)$ to be Fredholm. It turns out that
the discrete and non-discrete cases are quite different. Additionally, the
discrete abelian case, which provides some of the most interesting
applications, presents some special features and is much easier than the
general case. We thus concentrate in this paper on the case when $\Gamma$ is
finite abelian. We prove then that the restriction $\pi_\alpha(P)$ is Fredholm
if, and only if, $P$ is ""$\alpha$-elliptic"", a condition defined in terms of
the principal symbol of $P$. If $P$ is elliptic, then $P$ is also
$\alpha$-elliptic, but the converse is not true in general. However, if
$\Gamma$ acts freely on a dense open subset of $M$, then $P$ is
$\alpha$-elliptic for the given fixed $\alpha$ if, and only if, it is elliptic.
The proofs are based on the study of the structure of the algebra $\psi^{m}(M;
E)^\Gamma$ of classical, $\Gamma$-invariant pseudodifferential operators acting
on sections of the vector bundle $E \to M$ and of the structure of its
restrictions to the isotypical components of $\Gamma$. These structures are
described in terms of the isotropy groups of the action of the group $\Gamma$
on $E \to M$.

mitigate this knowledge gap, we have developed OtoMechanic, a web application
to detect and diagnose vehicle component issues from their corresponding

annotated sounds caused by failing automobile components. OtoMechanic returns
the most similar sounds, and provides weblinks for more information on the
diagnosis associated with each sound, along with an estimate of the similarity
of each retrieved sound. In user studies, we find that OtoMechanic

This binding leads to the modulation of the local concentrations of the ions of
the background electrolyte (KCl), and, thus, to the modulation of the ionic
current flowing through the pore. The nanopore's wall carries a bipolar charge
pattern with a larger positive buffer region determining the anions as the main
charge carriers and the smaller negative binding region containing binding
sites. This charge pattern proved to be an appropriate one as shown by a
previous comparative study of varying charge patterns (M\'adai et al.\
\textit{J. Mol. Liq.}, 2019, \textbf{283}, 391--398.). Binding of the positive
analyte ions attracts more anions in the pore thus increasing the current. The
asymmetric nature of the pore results in an additional device function,
rectification. Our model, therefore, is a dual response device. Using a reduced
model of the nanopore studied by a hybrid computer simulation method (Local
Equilibrium Monte Carlo coupled to the Nernst-Planck equation) we show that we
can create a sensor whose underlying mechanisms are based on the changes of the
local electric field as a response to changing thermodynamic conditions. The
change of the electric field results in changes in the local ionic
concentrations (depletion zones), and, thus, changes in ionic currents.

explanation for this effect, with the Planck CMB spectra now preferring a
positive curvature at more than $99 \%$ C.L. Here we further investigate the
evidence for a closed universe from Planck, showing that positive curvature
naturally explains the anomalous lensing amplitude and demonstrating that it
also removes a well-known tension within the Planck data set concerning the

that since the Planck power spectra prefer a closed universe, discordances
higher than generally estimated arise for most of the local cosmological
observables, including BAO. The assumption of a flat universe could, therefore,
mask a cosmological crisis where disparate observed properties of the Universe

tasks. To utilize the Huber loss, a parameter that controls the transitions
from a quadratic function to an absolute value function needs to be selected.
We believe the standard probabilistic interpretation that relates the Huber
loss to the Huber density fails to provide adequate intuition for identifying
the transition point. As a result, a hyper-parameter search is often necessary
to determine an appropriate value. In this work, we propose an alternative
probabilistic interpretation of the Huber loss, which relates minimizing the
loss to minimizing an upper-bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
Laplace distributions, where one distribution represents the noise in the
ground-truth and the other represents the noise in the prediction. In addition,
we show that the parameters of the Laplace distributions are directly related
to the transition point of the Huber loss. We demonstrate, through a toy
problem, that the optimal transition point of the Huber loss is closely related
to the distribution of the noise in the ground-truth data. As a result, our
interpretation provides an intuitive way to identify well-suited
hyper-parameters by approximating the amount of noise in the data, which we
demonstrate through a case study and experimentation on the Faster R-CNN and
RetinaNet object detectors.

Carlo. In trans-dimensional algorithms, Green (2003) recommended to sample the
parameter proposals during model switches from normal distributions with
informative means and covariance matrices. These proposal distributions can be
viewed as asymptotic approximations to the parameter distributions, where the
limit is with regard to the sample size. Models are typically proposed using
uninformed uniform distributions. In this paper, we build on the approach of
Zanella (2020) for discrete spaces to incorporate information about
neighbouring models. We rely on approximations to posterior model probabilities

combining this approach with that of Green (2003) behave like ideal ones that

the proposed samplers is straightforward in some cases. The methodology is

estimated, which is typically done by k-means. This results in two mismatches:
The first mismatch stems from using classical k-means with Euclidean norm,

using spherical k-means instead, we can show that we can already improve the
performance of DANet. Furthermore, we show that we can fully incorporate

m$ complex matrices which may be general, symmetric, or skew-symmetric ($m$
even), or $m \times p$ matrices, in the corresponding space $M$ of such
matrices. A ""matrix singularity"", $\mathcal{V}_0$ of ""type $\mathcal{V}$"", for
any of the $\mathcal{V} \subset M$ is defined as $\mathcal{V}_0 =
f_0^{-1}(\mathcal{V})$ by a germ $f_0 : \mathbb C^n, 0 \to M, 0$ (appropriately
transverse to $\mathcal{V}$). In part I of this paper we introduced the notion
of characteristic cohomology for a singularity $\mathcal{V}_0$ of type
$\mathcal{V}$ for the Milnor fiber (for $\mathcal{V}$ a hypersurface) and for
the complement and link (in the general case). We determine here the
characteristic cohomology for matrix singularities in all of these cases. For
these singularities we had shown in another paper that the Milnor fibers and
complements have ""compact model submanifolds"", which are classical symmetric
spaces in the sense of Cartan. We show that characteristic subalgebra is the
image of an exterior algebra (or in one case a module on two generators over an
exterior algebra) on an explicit set of generators. We give ""detection
criteria""using the vanishing compact models for identifying a exterior
subalgebras in the characteristic sublgebra, when $f_0$ contains a special type
of ""unfurled kite map"". This will be valid for the Milnor fiber, complement,

significantly better while discriminating stiffness values of virtual objects

datapoints based on similar properties for classification tasks. These

static nature of a cluster, and do not take into consideration its dynamic

clusters and their elements that can be used to derive new insights about what
happened to the clusters during their lifetimes. A fundamental step towards
this goal is to provide a formal definition of spatial-temporal cluster
relations. This report introduces, describes, and formalizes 14 novel
spatial-temporal cluster relations that may occur during the existence of a

(HNN) dynamics in order to solve this problem while incorporating a novel
Newton-like weighting factor. This addition lends itself to fast avoidance of
saddle points, which the gradient-like HNN is susceptible to. Turning to a
multi-agent setting, we reformulate the problem and develop a distributed

the distributed reformulation is obtained, it is also a local solution to the
centralized problem. A main contribution of this work is to show that the
probability of converging to a saddle point of an appropriately defined energy
function in both the centralized and distributed settings is zero under light
assumptions. Finally, we enlarge our algorithm with an annealing technique
which gradually learns a feasible binary solution. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with centralized greedy

advantage of our approach is a significant improvement in runtime over the SDP
relaxation method and the distributed quality of implementation.

50$^{\circ}$/day, and typical apparent $V$ magnitudes from 21 to 23.
Potentially-hazardous asteroids have observational characteristics similar to
TCOs, but the two populations can be distinguished based on their orbits with
LSST data alone. We predict that a TCO can be discovered once every year with

graphs of many loosely-coupled, single-concerned microservices. Microservices
have several advantages, including speeding up development and deployment,
allowing specialization of the software infrastructure, and helping with
debugging and error isolation. At the same time they introduce several hardware
and software challenges. Given that most of the performance and efficiency
implications of microservices happen at scales larger than what is available
outside production deployments, studying such effects requires designing the
right simulation infrastructures.
  We present uqSim, a scalable and validated queueing network simulator
designed specifically for interactive microservices. uqSim provides detailed
intra- and inter-microservice models that allow it to faithfully reproduce the
behavior of complex, many-tier applications. uqSim is also modular, allowing
reuse of individual models across microservices and end-to-end applications. We
have validated uqSim both against simple and more complex microservices graphs,
and have shown that it accurately captures performance in terms of throughput
and tail latency. Finally, we use uqSim to model the tail at scale effects of
request fanout, and the performance impact of power management in
latency-sensitive microservices.

energy resources and battery energy storage systems are proposed. Renewable
energy has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, while higher
penetration of renewable energy is hindered by the inherent variability and
intermittency of renewable resources. This motivates the development of
microgrids supplied by renewable energy resources. With proper control of
storage units and communications with the energy market, the non-dispatchable
energy can be regulated to reduce the difficulty of power scheduling in the
grid operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are widely used to make
renewable energy more controllable and usable on demand. With suitable
prediction techniques and control algorithms, BESS can store part of the
generated renewable energy and supply some stored energy at different periods,
so that the actual power dispatched can meet the required operating criteria.
The control algorithms introduced in this report are developed to maximize the
profit and minimize the energy cost in microgrids, which require predicted data
on renewable power, temperature, electricity price, and load demand.

the horizon, and requiring boundedness of the wave function, we get a rather
generic solution of the WDW equation, whose steepest-descent solution, i.e.,
the ridge of the wave function, coincides nicely with the classical trajectory.
However, there is an ambiguity in defining the arrow of time which leads to two

infer that the steepest-descent of the wave function follows the classical

outwards from the singularity in the other region, and there exists an
annihilation process of these two parts of the wave function inside the
horizon. Adopting the second interpretation could shed light on the information
loss paradox: as time goes on, probabilities for histories that include black

surface and homogenous material, the superheating transition is driven by a
non-local critical mode in which an array of vortices simultaneously penetrate
the surface. In contrast, we show that even a small amount of disorder
localizes the critical mode and can have a significant reduction in the

we propose fully parameterized quantile function that parameterizes both the
quantile fraction axis (i.e., the x-axis) and the value axis (i.e., y-axis) for
distributional RL. Our algorithm contains a fraction proposal network that
generates a discrete set of quantile fractions and a quantile value network
that gives corresponding quantile values. The two networks are jointly trained
to find the best approximation of the true distribution. Experiments on 55
Atari Games show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
distributional RL algorithms and creates a new record for the Atari Learning
Environment for non-distributed agents.

attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where,
unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g.,
software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of
problem-space attacks remain underexplored. This paper makes two major
contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML
evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a
comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved
semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the
relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the
concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping
problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate
the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several
attacks from related literature across different domains. Second, building on
our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware
that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android
apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a
state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our
results demonstrate that ""adversarial-malware as a service"" is a realistic
threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous
adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes
to generate an adversarial app. Our formalization of problem-space attacks
paves the way to more principled research in this domain.

the model, namely either the largest in-degree (for Bayesian Networks) or the
size of the largest hyper-edge (for Markov Random Fields).

``approximate distributions'' for bidder valuations, we can learn a mechanism
whose revenue is nearly optimal simultaneously for all ``true distributions''

a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item
values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our
framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg. When
item values are sampled from more general graphical models, we combine our
robustness theorem with novel sample complexity results for learning Markov

many applications. Most of the existing methods treat this task as a problem of
single-label multi-class text classification. To predict multiple emotions for
one instance, most of the existing works regard it as a general Multi-label
Classification (MLC) problem, where they usually either apply a manually
determined threshold on the last output layer of their neural network models or
train multiple binary classifiers and make predictions in the fashion of
one-vs-all. However, compared to labels in the general MLC datasets, the number
of emotion categories are much fewer (less than 10). Additionally, emotions
tend to have more correlations with each other. For example, the human usually
does not express ""joy"" and ""anger"" at the same time, but it is very likely to
have ""joy"" and ""love"" expressed together. Given this intuition, in this paper,
we propose a Latent Variable Chain (LVC) transformation and a tailored model --
Seq2Emo model that not only naturally predicts multiple emotion labels but also
takes into consideration their correlations. We perform the experiments on the
existing multi-label emotion datasets as well as on our newly collected
datasets. The results show that our model compares favorably with existing
state-of-the-art methods.

coupled with Silicon Drift Detectors with broad energy band coverage (keV-MeV
range) and excellent temporal resolution ( below or equal 100 nanoseconds) each
with effective area around 100 cm2. This simple and robust design allows for
mass-production of the satellites of the fleet. This revolutionary approach
implies a huge reduction of costs, flexibility in the segmented launching

theory, that if the hypersonic similarity parameter $K$ is fixed, the shock
solution structures (after scaling) are consistent, when the Mach number of the
flow is sufficiently large. One of the difficulty is that after scaling, the
solutions are usually of large data since the perturbation of the hypersonic
flow is usually not small related to the sonic speed. In order to make it, we
first employ the modified Glimm scheme to construct the approximate solutions

distributions, with emphasis on convergence rates of the P{\'o}lya-Gamma Gibbs
sampler for sparse logistic regression. Our analysis shows that the proposed
regularization leads to geometric ergodicity under a broad range of
global-local shrinkage priors. Essentially, the only requirement is for the
prior $\pi_{\rm local}$ on the local scale $\lambda$ to satisfy $\pi_{\rm
local}(0) < \infty$. If $\pi_{\rm local}(\cdot)$ further satisfies
$\lim_{\lambda \to 0} \pi_{\rm local}(\lambda) / \lambda^a < \infty$ for $a >
0$, as in the case of Bayesian bridge priors, we show the sampler to be
uniformly ergodic.

lead to the degradation of performance, restricting the capacity of
generalizing to real applications where the prior of orientation is often

operation to perceive local shape structure. Besides, we introduce an efficient
key point descriptor to assign each point with different response and help

describe the mechanisms in the system, and predict the system's equilibrium

identify the mechanisms. This manuscript leverages the benefits of both
approaches. We define the structural causal models in terms of the parameters
and the equilibrium dynamics of the Markov process models, and counterfactual
inference flows from these settings. The proposed approach alleviates the
identifiability drawback of the structural causal models, in that the
counterfactual inference is consistent with the counterfactual trajectories
simulated from the Markov process model. We showcase the benefits of this
framework in case studies of complex biomolecular systems with nonlinear

related to the frequency-dependent sound velocity (dispersion) via
Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. These relations are fundamentally
important for better understanding of the nature of attenuation and dispersion
and as a tool in physical acoustics measurements, where they can be used for
control purposes. However, physical acoustic measurements are frequently
carried out not in unbounded media, but in acoustic waveguides, e.g. inside
liquid-filled pipes. Surface acoustic waves are also often used for physical
acoustics measurements. In the present work, the applicability of
Kramers-Kronig relations to guided and surface waves is investigated using the
approach based on the theory of functions of complex variables. It is
demonstrated that Kramers-Kronig relations have limited applicability to guided
and surface waves. In particular, they are not applicable to waves propagating
in waveguides characterised by the possibility of wave energy leakage from the
waveguides into the surrounding medium. For waveguides without leakages, e.g.
those formed by rigid walls, Kramers-Kronig relations remain valid for both
ideal and viscous liquids. In the former case, Kramers-Kronig relations express
the exponential decay of non-propagating (evanescent) higher-order acoustic
modes below the cut-off frequencies via the dispersion of the same modes above
the cut-off frequencies. Examples of numerical calculations of wave dispersion
and attenuation using Kramers-Kronig relations, where applicable, are presented

programmers to run serverless functions in response to external events.
Serverless functions are priced at sub-second granularity, support transparent
elasticity, and relieve programmers from managing the operating system. Thus
serverless functions allow programmers to focus on writing application code,
and the cloud provider to manage computing resources globally. Unfortunately,
today's serverless platforms exhibit high latency, because it is difficult to
maximize resource utilization while minimizing operating costs.
  This paper presents serverless function acceleration, which is an approach
that transparently lowers the latency and resource utilization of a large class
of serverless functions. We accomplish this using language-based sandboxing,
whereas existing serverless platforms employ more expensive operating system
sandboxing technologies, such as containers and virtual machines. OS-based
sandboxing is compatible with more programs than language-based techniques.
However, instead of ruling out any programs, we use language-based sandboxing
when possible, and OS-based sandboxing if necessary. Moreover, we seamlessly
transition between language-based and OS-based sandboxing by leveraging the
fact that serverless functions must tolerate re-execution for fault tolerance.
Therefore, when a serverless function attempts to perform an unsupported
operation in the language-based sandbox, we can safely re-execute it in a
container. We use a new approach to trace compilation to build source-level,
interprocedural, execution trace trees for serverless functions written in
JavaScript. We compile trace trees to a safe subset of Rust, validate the
compiler output, and link it to a runtime system. We evaluate these techniques
in our implementation, which we call Containerless.

coupling is described by an interacting Lagrangian $f(X, Z)$, where $f$ depends
on $X=-\partial^{\mu} \phi \partial_{\mu} \phi/2$ and $Z=u_{c}^{\mu}

perturbations for the wavelength deep inside the Hubble radius and show that
the effective CDM sound speed is close to 0 as in the standard uncoupled case,
while the scalar-field propagation speed is affected by the interacting term
$f$. Under a quasi-static approximation, we also obtain a general expression of
the effective gravitational coupling felt by the CDM perturbation. We study the
late-time cosmological dynamics for the coupling $f \propto X^{(2-m)/2}Z^m$ and
show that the gravitational coupling weaker than the Newton constant can be
naturally realized for $m>0$ on scales relevant to the growth of large-scale

a continuous-time process that tends to come-back to already visited vertices.
It is closely linked to the edge-reinforced random walk (ERRW) introduced by
Coppersmith and Diaconis in 1986 which is more likely to cross edges it has
already crossed. On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 3$, both models where shown to be

coupling of the VRJP for different weights that the VRJP (and the ERRW)

weights of the VRJP and the ERRW makes them more transient which means that the

environmental monitoring, it may not be possible to obtain isolated signals for
training. Here, we propose objective functions and network architectures that
enable training a source separation system with weak labels. In this scenario,
weak labels are defined in contrast with strong time-frequency (TF) labels such
as those obtained from isolated sources, and refer either to frame-level weak
labels where one only has access to the time periods when different sources are
active in an audio mixture, or to clip-level weak labels that only indicate the
presence or absence of sounds in an entire audio clip. We train a separator
that estimates a TF mask for each type of sound event, using a sound event
classifier as an assessor of the separator's performance to bridge the gap
between the TF-level separation and the ground truth weak labels only available
at the frame or clip level. Our objective function requires the classifier
applied to a separated source to assign high probability to the class
corresponding to that source and low probability to all other classes. The
objective function also enforces that the separated sources sum up to the
mixture. We benchmark the performance of our algorithm using synthetic mixtures
of overlapping events created from a database of sounds recorded in urban
environments. Compared to training a network using isolated sources, our model
achieves somewhat lower but still significant SI-SDR improvement, even in

critical phenomena upon the number $M$ of the harmonic perturbations, where
$M+1=d$ corresponds to the spatial dimension of the ordinary disordered

SCT, by largely increasing $M$. The numerically obtained index of critical
subdiffusion $t^\alpha$~($t$:time) agrees well with the prediction of
one-parameter scaling theory $\alpha=2/(M+1)$, but the numerically obtained
critical exponent of localization length significantly deviates from the SCT
prediction. Deviation from the SCT prediction is drastic for the critical
perturbation strength of the transition: if $M$ is fixed the SCT presents
plausible prediction for the parameter dependence of the critical value, but
its value is $1/(M-1)$times smaller than the SCT prediction, which implies
existence of a strong cooperativity of the harmonic perturbations with the main

increase the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents, and propose
three new methods for selecting experiences to accelerate the learning process.
Firstly, we introduce Focused ES, which prioritizes unexplored regions of the

ES, which combines both previous approaches. The methods are empirically
validated in a control problem. While sharing randomly selected experiences
between two Deep Q-Network agents shows no improvement over a single agent

concentric airy patterns. These explicit formulas empower us to study the
global bifurcation and asymptotic behaviors of these solutions, within which
the cell population density has $\delta$-type spiky structures when the
chemotaxis rate is large. The explicit formulas are also used to study the
uniqueness and quantitative properties of nontrivial stationary radial patterns
ruled by several threshold phenomena determined by the chemotaxis rate. We find
that all nonconstant radial stationary solutions must have the cellular density
compactly supported unless for a discrete sequence of bifurcation values at
which there exist strictly positive small-amplitude solutions. The hierarchy of
free energy shows that in the radial class the inner ring solution has the
least energy while the constant solution has the largest energy, and all these

returns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,
we analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices
by defining a forward-looking measure which we call ""implied excess
predictability"". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's
predictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing
function of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These
empirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices
by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price
significantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the
underlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing
formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return
predictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock
return predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,
spot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of
the stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find
that the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk
premium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.

of a few kilometers per second ($\lesssim$10 km/s) at this stage. The expansion
of the loops leads to interactions between themselves and the ambient field,
which can drive magnetic reconnection evidenced by multiple intense

numerous EPR-like gedankenexperiments to its almost ubiquitous presence in
quantum technologies, entanglement is at the heart of modern quantum physics.
First introduced by Erwin Schr\""{o}dinger nearly a century ago, entanglement
has remained one of the most fascinating ideas that came out of quantum
mechanics. Here, we attempt to explain what makes entanglement fundamentally
different from any classical phenomenon. To this end, we start with a
historical overview of entanglement and discuss several hidden variables models
that were conceived to provide a classical explanation and demystify quantum
entanglement. We discuss some inequalities and bounds that are violated by
quantum states thereby falsifying the existence of some of the classical hidden
variables theories. We also discuss some exciting manifestations of
entanglement, such as N00N states and the non-separable single particle states.
We conclude by discussing some contemporary results regarding quantum
correlations and present a future outlook for the research of quantum
entanglement.

dynamics, i.e. the time evolution following a sudden change in the Hamiltonian,
via tomography of quantum gases in optical lattices. In contrast to the well
established theory for static band insulators or periodically driven systems,
at present it is not clear whether, and how, topological invariants can be
defined for a general quench of band insulators. Previous work solved a special
case of this problem beautifully using Hopf mapping of two-band Hamiltonians in
two dimensions. But it only works for topologically trivial initial state and
is hard to generalize to multiband systems or other dimensions. Here we
introduce the concept of loop unitary constructed from the unitary
time-evolution operator, and show its homotopy invariant fully characterizes
the dynamical topology. For two-band systems in two dimensions, we prove that
the invariant is precisely equal to the change in the Chern number across the
quench regardless of the initial state. We further show that the nontrivial
dynamical topology manifests as hedgehog defects in the loop unitary, and also
as winding and linking of its eigenvectors along a curve where dynamical
quantum phase transition occurs. This opens up a systematic route to classify

customers is specified by a bipartite graph. Once a pair of customer and server
are matched, they depart from the system instantaneously. The objective is to
maximize long-run average profits of the system while minimizing average
waiting time. We first propose a static pricing and max-weight matching policy,
which achieves $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ optimality rate when all of the arrival rates
are scaled by $\eta$. We further show that a dynamic pricing and modified

policy has an optimality rate that is lower bounded by $\Omega(\eta^{1/3})$.
Thus, the dynamic pricing policy and modified max-weight matching policy
achieves the optimal rate. In addition, we propose a constraint generation
algorithm that solves an approximation of the MDP and demonstrate strong
numerical performance of this algorithm.

proposed a method named BMM-UCP (Behavior-based Modeling Method for User Churn

carry out a comprehensive investigation on tail-biting (TB) spatially coupled

Specifically, we first develop a two-step design method to formulate a novel
type of constellation mappers, referred to as labeling-bit-partial-match (LBPM)
constellation mappers, for SC-P-based BICM-ID systems. The LBPM constellation
mappers can be seamlessly combined with high-order modulations, such as M-ary

Furthermore, we conceive a new bit-level interleaving scheme, referred to as
variable node matched mapping (VNMM) scheme, which can substantially exploit
the structure feature of SC-P codes and the unequal protection-degree property
of labeling bits to trigger the wave-like convergence for TB-SC-P codes. In
addition, we propose a hierarchical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)
algorithm to predict the convergence performance (i.e., decoding thresholds) of
the proposed SC-P-based BICM-ID systems. Theoretical analyses and simulation
results illustrate that the LBPM-mapped SC-P-based BICM-ID systems are
remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art mapped counterparts. Moreover, the
proposed SC-P-based BICM-ID systems can achieve even better error performance

from peripheral to central collisions, the longitudinal widths exhibit mixed
behaviors: BF of $\pi\pi$ and cross-species pairs narrow in more central
collisions whereas those of $KK$ and $pp$ are found invariant with collision

by estimating the packet error rate of short update packets based on Gallager's
random coding bound. For time-critical systems, we further define a new AoI
metric, termed bounded AoI, which corresponds to an AoI threshold for the
instantaneous AoI. Specifically, the instantaneous AoI is below the bounded AoI
a large percentage of the time. We give a theoretical upper bound for bounded
AoI. Our simulation results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.
Although TDMA outperforms FDMA in terms of average AoI, FDMA is more robust
against varying channel conditions since it gives a more stable bounded AoI
across different received powers. Overall, our findings give insight to the
design of practical multiple access systems with AoI requirements.

attention-based systems that significantly improve its performance: restricting
the attention to be monotonic, and applying a novel decoding algorithm that
breaks long utterances into shorter overlapping segments. Combining these two

let the model generate novel sentences and hence produce abstractive summaries.
Recent progress in summarization has seen the development of supervised models
which rely on large quantities of document-summary pairs. Since such training
data is expensive to acquire, we instead consider the unsupervised setting, in
other words, we do not use any summaries in training. We define a generative
model for a review collection which capitalizes on the intuition that when
generating a new review given a set of other reviews of a product, we should be
able to control the ""amount of novelty"" going into the new review or,
equivalently, vary the extent to which it deviates from the input. At test
time, when generating summaries, we force the novelty to be minimal, and
produce a text reflecting consensus opinions. We capture this intuition by
defining a hierarchical variational autoencoder model. Both individual reviews
and the products they correspond to are associated with stochastic latent
codes, and the review generator (""decoder"") has direct access to the text of
input reviews through the pointer-generator mechanism. Experiments on Amazon

Previous works have proved the capability of reinforcement learning in this

reinforcement learning in online systems, including low sample efficiency,
uncontrollable risks, and excessive variances. To address these issues, we
propose a novel reinforcement learning method, namely model-based
counterfactual advantage learning (MBCAL). The proposed method takes advantage
of the characteristics of recommender systems and draws ideas from the
model-based reinforcement learning method for higher sample efficiency. It has
two components: an environment model that predicts the instant user behavior
one-by-one in an auto-regressive form, and a future advantage model that
predicts the future utility. To alleviate the impact of excessive variance when
learning the future advantage model, we employ counterfactual comparisons
derived from the environment model. In consequence, the proposed method
possesses high sample efficiency and significantly lower variance; Also, it is
able to use existing user logs to avoid the risks of starting from scratch. In
contrast to its capability, its implementation cost is relatively low, which
fits well with practical systems. Theoretical analysis and elaborate
experiments are presented. Results show that the proposed method transcends the
other supervised learning and RL-based methods in both sample efficiency and

reformed at the same neutral line later, and then underwent partial and total
eruptions, drove the second and third jets, respectively. In the course of the
jets, cool plasma was injected into the large filament. Furthermore, persistent
magnetic flux cancelation occurred at the neutral line under the minifilament
before its eruption and continued until the end of the observation. We infer
that magnetic flux cancellation may account for building and then triggering
the minifilament to erupt to produce the two-sided loop jets. This observation

have been observed, mainly because the cosmic ray electrons migrate before they
lose their energy via synchrotron emission or escape. The major cosmic ray
electron transport mechanisms within the plane of galactic disks are diffusion
and streaming. A predicted radio continuum map can be obtained by convolving
the map of comic ray electron sources, represented by that of the star
formation, with adaptive Gaussian and exponential kernels. The ratio between
the smoothing lengthscales at 6cm and 20cm can be used to distinguish between
diffusion and streaming as the dominant transport mechanism. Star formation
maps of eight rather face-on local and Virgo cluster spiral galaxies were
constructed from Spitzer and Herschel infrared and GALEX UV observations.These
maps were convolved with adaptive Gaussian and exponential smoothing kernels to
obtain model radio continuum emission maps. It is found that in asymmetric
ridges of polarized radio continuum emission the total power emission is
enhanced with respect to the star formation rate. The typical lengthscale for
the transport of cosmic ray electrons is l=0.9kpc at 6cm and l=1.8kpc at 20cm.
Perturbed spiral galaxies tend to have smaller lengthscales. This is a natural
consequence of the enhancement of the magnetic field caused by the interaction.
The discrimination between the two cosmic ray electron transport mechanisms,
diffusion and streaming, is based on (i) the convolution kernel (Gaussian or
exponential),(ii) the dependence of the smoothing kernel on the local magnetic
field and hence on the local star formation rate, (iii) the ratio between the
two smoothing lengthscales via the frequency-dependence of the smoothing
kernel, and (iv) the dependence of the smoothing kernel on the ratio between
the ordered and the turbulent magnetic field.

Unfortunately, due to multiple factors of variation, directly comparing these

in performance. In this work, we present a unified probabilistic perspective on
IL algorithms based on divergence minimization. We present $f$-MAX, an
$f$-divergence generalization of AIRL [Fu et al., 2018], a state-of-the-art IRL
method. $f$-MAX enables us to relate prior IRL methods such as GAIL [Ho &

properties. Through the lens of divergence minimization we tease apart the
differences between BC and successful IRL approaches, and empirically evaluate
these nuances on simulated high-dimensional continuous control domains. Our
findings conclusively identify that IRL's state-marginal matching objective
contributes most to its superior performance. Lastly, we apply our new

demonstrate that in simulated arm pushing environments we can teach agents a

a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP), for odd $k$, and to the case $k=2$,
a.k.a. the Cactus Augmentation Problem (CacAP), for even $k$. Several better
than $2$ approximation algorithms are known for TAP, culminating with a recent
$1.458$ approximation [Grandoni et al.'18]. However, for CacAP the best known
approximation is $2$.
  In this paper we breach the $2$ approximation barrier for CacAP, hence for
CAP, by presenting a polynomial-time $2\ln(4)-\frac{967}{1120}+\epsilon<1.91$
approximation. Previous approaches exploit properties of TAP that do not seem
to generalize to CacAP. We instead use a reduction to the Steiner tree problem
which was previously used in parameterized algorithms [Basavaraju et al.'14].
This reduction is not approximation preserving, and using the current best
approximation factor for Steiner tree [Byrka et al.'13] as a black-box would
not be good enough to improve on $2$. To achieve the latter goal, we ``open the
box'' and exploit the specific properties of the instances of Steiner tree
arising from CacAP.

learning, is leading to a paradigm shift in the way we conceive the design of
new compounds. Today computational science does not only provide a sound
understanding of experiments, but also can directly design the best compound
for specific applications. This approach, known as reverse engineering,
requires the construction of models able to efficiently predict continuous
structure-property maps. Here we show that reverse engineering can be used to
tune the magnetic properties of a single-ion molecular magnet in an automated
intelligent fashion. We design a machine learning model to predict both the
energy and magnetic properties as function of the chemical structure. Then, a
particle-swarm optimization algorithm is used to explore the conformational
landscapes in the search for new molecular structures leading to an enhanced
magnetic anisotropy. We find that a 5% change in one of the coordination angles
leads to a 50% increase in the anisotropy. Our approach paves the way for a
machine-learning-driven exploration of the chemical space of general classes of
magnetic materials. Most importantly, it can be applied to any
structure-property relation and offers an effective way to automatically
generate new materials with target properties starting from the knowledge of

Bayesian monitoring at interim analyses to detect and stop recruitment into
unsuccessful strategies, defined as a >0.95 posterior probability of the true
cure rate being <90%. Here, we tested the operating characteristics of the
stopping guideline, planned the timing of the interim analyses and explored
power at the final analysis. Results A beta(4.5, 0.5) prior for the true cure
rate produces <0.05 probability of incorrectly stopping a group with true cure
rate >90%. Groups with very low cure rates (<60%) are very likely (>0.9
probability) to stop after ~25% patients are recruited. Groups with moderately
low cure rates (80%) are likely to stop (0.7 probability) before the end of
recruitment. Interim analyses 7, 10, 13 and 18 months after recruitment

developed the microservice architecture, which lets developers divide up their
application into smaller units that can be hosted on multiple machines, thus
enabling horizontal scale up. We propose a triphasic incremental process to
transform a traditional application into a microservice application that

Istio is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster to establish pod level

minimize inter-service calls by compiling all needed calls into a list and

can be understood as distortions of the local $120^\circ$ N\'eel parent order
of the Heisenberg-only Hamiltonian. Here, we explore possibilities of
stabilizing further types of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex phases in Kitaev-Heisenberg
models including those which rely on more complicated types of non-collinear
parent orders such as tetrahedral states. We perform extensive scans through
large classes of Kitaev-Heisenberg models on different lattices employing a
two-step methodology which first involves a mean-field analysis followed by a
stochastic iterative minimization approach. When allowing for longer-range
Kitaev couplings we identify several new $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex phases such as a
state based on the $120^\circ$ N\'eel order on the triangular lattice which
shows a coexistence of different $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex types. Furthermore,
perturbing the tetrahedral order on the triangular lattice with a suitable
combination of first and second neighbor Kitaev interactions we find that a
kagome-like superstructure of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices may be stabilized where
vortices feature a counter-rotating winding of spins on different sublattices.
This last phase may also be extended to honeycomb lattices where it is related
to cubic types of parent orders. In total, this analysis shows that
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex phases appear in much wider contexts than the $120^\circ$
N\'eel ordered systems previously studied.

and VERA Array (KaVA) large program, which has densely monitored the jet at 22
and 43 GHz since 2016. We find that the apparent jet speeds generally increase
from $\approx0.3c$ at $\approx0.5$ mas from the jet base to $\approx2.7c$ at
$\approx20$ mas, indicating that the jet is accelerated from subluminal to
superluminal speeds on these scales. We perform a complementary jet kinematic
analysis by using archival Very Long Baseline Array monitoring data observed in
$2005-2009$ at 1.7 GHz and find that the jet is moving at relativistic speeds
up to $\approx5.8c$ at distances of $200-410$ mas. We combine the two kinematic
results and find that the jet is gradually accelerated over a broad distance
range that coincides with the jet collimation zone, implying that conversion of
Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux takes place. If the jet emission consists
of a single streamline, the observed trend of jet acceleration ($\Gamma\propto
z^{0.16\pm0.01}$) is relatively slow compared to models of a highly magnetized
jet. This indicates that Poynting flux conversion through the differential
collimation of poloidal magnetic fields may be less efficient than expected.
However, we find a non-negligible dispersion in the observed speeds for a given
jet distance, making it difficult to describe the jet velocity field with a
single power-law acceleration function. We discuss the possibility that the jet
emission consists of multiple streamlines following different acceleration
profiles, resulting in jet velocity stratification.

lift its degeneracy and select the Palmer-Chalker ordering of $p$-orbital

the Fe K{\alpha} line and the hard X-ray continuum (7.8-12 keV) using the

obtain the true time delay, it is crucial to subtract the underlying continuum
of the Fe K{\alpha} line. The measured size of the Fe K{\alpha}-emitting region
over the whole observation period is 40 {\pm} 20 light-seconds. It is 5 times
larger than the accretion radius estimated from a quasi-isotropic stellar wind,

center pixel-spectrum and the neighborhood spectra. The final edge intensity is
derived upon order statistics of the similarity matrix or spatial convolution
of the similarity matrix with the spatial kernels. The LSS algorithm
facilitates simultaneous use of spectral-spatial information for the edge
detection by considering the spatial pattern of similar spectra within a
spatial window. The proposed edge-detection method is tested on benchmark HSIs
as well as the image obtained from
Airborne-Visible-and-Infra-RedImaging-Spectrometer-Next-Generation (AVIRIS-NG).
Robustness of the LSS method against multivariate Gaussian noise and low
spatial resolution scenarios were also verified with the benchmark HSIs.
Figure-of-merit, false-alarm-count and miss-count were applied to evaluate the
performance of edge detection methods. Results showed that Fractional distance
measure and Euclidean distance measure were able to detect the edges in HSIs
more precisely as compared to other spectral similarity measures. The proposed
method can be applied to radiance and reflectance data (whole spectrum) and it
has shown good performance on principal component images as well. In addition,
the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional multichannel edge detectors
in terms of both fastness, accuracy and the robustness. The experimental
results also confirm that LSS can be applied as a pre-processing approach to
reduce the errors in clustering as well as classification outputs.

dynamical simulations, however, show that planets are unable to collect so
muchheavy elements throughin situplanetesimal accretion. Aims.We investigate
whether a giant planet migrating inward can capture planetesimals efficiently
to significantly increase its metal-licity. Methods.We performed orbital
integrations of a migrating giant planet and planetesimals in a protoplanetary
gas disc to infer theplanetesimal mass that is accreted by the planet.
Results.We find that the two shepherding processes of mean motion resonances
trapping and aerodynamic gas drag inhibit plan-etesimal capture of a migrating
planet. However, the amplified libration allows the highly-excited
planetesimals in the resonances toescape from the resonance trap and be
accreted by the planet. Consequently, we show that a migrating giant planet
captures planetes-imals with total mass of several tens of Earth masses, if the
planet forms at a few tens of AU in a relatively massive disc. We alsofind that
planetesimal capture occurs efficiently in a limited range of semi-major axis,
and that the total captured planetesimal massincreases with increasing
migration distances. Our results have important implications for understanding
the relation between giantplanet metallicity and mass, as we suggest that it
reflects the formation location of the planet, or more precisely, the location
whererunaway gas accretion occurred. We also suggest the observed metal-rich

Using the Keldysh-Floquet formalism we compute electronic transport properties
of these nanowires, where we propose to couple the leads in such a way, as to
primarily address electronic states with a large weight at one edge of the
system. By tuning the Fermi energy of the leads to the center of the
topological gap we are able to directly address the topological edge states,
granting experimental access to the topological phase diagram. Surprisingly,
when tuning the lead Fermi energy to special values in the bulk which coincide
with extremal points of the dispersion relation, we find additional peaks of
similar magnitude to those caused by the topological edge states. These peaks
reveal the presence of continua of states centered around aforementioned
extremal points whose wavefunctions are linear combinations of delocalized bulk
states and exponentially localized edge states, where the ratio of edge- to
bulk-state amplitude is maximal at the extremal point of the dispersion. We
discuss the transport properties of these \emph{non-topological edge states},
explain their emergence in terms of an intuitive yet quantitative physical
picture and discuss their relationship with Van Hove singularities in the bulk

  combinatorics",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One powerful method for upper-bounding the largest independent set in a graph
is the Hoffman bound, which gives an upper bound on the largest independent set
of a graph in terms of its eigenvalues. It is easily seen that the Hoffman
bound is sharp on the tensor power of a graph whenever it is sharp for the
original graph.
  In this paper, we introduce the related problem of upper-bounding independent
sets in tensor powers of hypergraphs. We show that many of the prominent open
problems in extremal combinatorics, such as the Tur\'an problem for
(hyper-)graphs, can be encoded as special cases of this problem. We also give a
new generalization of the Hoffman bound for hypergraphs which is sharp for the
tensor power of a hypergraph whenever it is sharp for the original hypergraph.
  As an application of our Hoffman bound, we make progress on the problem of
Frankl on families of sets without extended triangles from 1990. We show that
if $\frac{1}{2}n\le2k\le\frac{2}{3}n,$ then the extremal family is the star,
i.e. the family of all sets that contains a given element. This covers the
entire range in which the star is extremal. As another application, we provide
spectral proofs for Mantel's theorem on triangle-free graphs and for
Frankl-Tokushige theorem on $k$-wise intersecting families.

diverse dynamical states of neural networks for self-organization and
robustness still has not been fully studied. Here, we present a model of neural
network built with hybrid synapses to investigate the emergence of global and
collective dynamics states. This neural networks consists of excitatory and
inhibitory population interacting together. The excitatory population is
connected by excitatory synapses in small world topology and its adjacent
neurons are also connected by gap junctions. The inhibitory population is only
connected by chemical inhibitory synapses with all-to-all interaction. Our
numerical simulations show that in the balanced networks with absence of
electrical coupling, the synchrony states generated by this architecture are
mainly controlled by heterogeneity among neurons and the balance of its
excitatory and inhibitory inputs. In balanced networks with strong electrical
coupling, several dynamical states arise from different combinations of
excitatory and inhibitory weights. More importantly, we find that these states,
such as synchronous firing, cluster synchrony, and various ripples events,
emerge by slight modification of chemical coupling weights. For large enough
electrical synapse coupling, the whole neural networks become synchronized. Our
results pave a way in the study of the dynamical mechanisms and computational
significance of the contribution of mixed synapse in the neural functions.

shortages from online job advertisements (ads) data. We first propose a method
to generate sets of highly similar skills based on a set of seed skills from
job ads. This provides researchers with a novel method to adaptively select
occupations based on granular skills data. Next, we apply this adaptive skills
similarity technique to a dataset of over 6.7 million Australian job ads in
order to identify occupations with the highest proportions of DSA skills. This
uncovers 306,577 DSA job ads across 23 occupational classes from 2012-2019.
Finally, we propose five variables for detecting skill shortages from online
job ads: (1) posting frequency; (2) salary levels; (3) education requirements;
(4) experience demands; and (5) job ad posting predictability. This contributes
further evidence to the goal of detecting skills shortages in real-time. In
conducting this analysis, we also find strong evidence of skills shortages in
Australia for highly technical DSA skills and occupations. These results
provide insights to Data Science researchers, educators, and policy-makers from

mechanisms still retain a weak (integrable) singularity, while other approaches
look for completely regular solutions with finite curvature and pressure at the

partial differential equations which are constituted of two parts: a system of
conservation laws and non-conservative first order terms. Whereas the theory of
first-order systems of conservation laws is well established and the conditions
for the existence of supplementary conservation laws, and more specifically of
an entropy supplementary conservation law for smooth solutions, well known,
there exists so far no general extension to obtain such supplementary
conservation laws when non-conservative terms are present. We propose a
framework in order to extend the existing theory and show that the presence of
non-conservative terms somewhat complexifies the problem since numerous
combinations of the conservative and non-conservative terms can lead to a
supplementary conservation law. We then identify a restricted framework in
order to design and analyze physical models of complex fluid flows by means of
computer algebra and thus obtain the entire ensemble of possible combination of
conservative and non-conservative terms with the objective of obtaining
specifically an entropy supplementary conservation law. The theory as well as
developed computer algebra tool are then applied to a Baer-Nunziato two-phase
flow model and to a multicomponent plasma fluid model. The first one is a
first-order fluid model, with non-conservative terms impacting on the linearly
degenerate field and requires a closure since there is no way to derive
interfacial quantities from averaging principles and we need guidance in order
to close the pressure and velocity of the interface and the thermodynamics of
the mixture. The second one involves first order terms for the heavy species
coupled to second order terms for the electrons, the non-conservative terms
impact the genuinely nonlinear fields and the model can be rigorously derived
from kinetic theory. We show how the theory allows to recover the whole
spectrum of closures obtained so far in the literature for the two-phase flow
system as well as conditions when one aims at extending the thermodynamics and
also applies to the plasma case, where we recover the usual entropy
supplementary equation, thus assessing the effectiveness and scope of the
proposed theory.

studied. During collapse, any pair of polymer units appearing in a sufficiently
close vicinity in space has the possibility with a certain probability to form
an irreversible crosslink, thereby preventing the interpenetration of chain
material between the forming clusters. Globular structures having different
spatial chain packing at various scales are obtained by computer simulations.
It is shown that the dependence of probability of contact between two monomers
in space , where s is a distance between monomers along chain, reproduces a
number of characteristic features observed previously in experiments on the
analysis of three-dimensional chromatin packing. The cluster analysis of
intramolecular contact maps makes it possible to express the hypothesis that
there are characteristic discrete hierarchical levels in polymer packing
associated with the number-theoretic origin of rare-event statistics and
inherent to individual maps of intra- and interchromosomal contacts.

the classical asymptotic convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ is pessimistic and
can be replaced by $O((\log(N)/N)^{\beta})$ with $\frac{1}{2}\leq \beta \leq 1$

depends on how informative these demonstrations are. Being informative is
unfortunately very challenging, because during teaching, people typically get
no transparency into what the robot already knows or has learned so far. In
contrast, human students naturally provide a wealth of nonverbal feedback that
reveals their level of understanding and engagement. In this work, we study how
a robot can similarly provide feedback that is minimally disruptive, yet gives
human teachers a better mental model of the robot learner, and thus enables
them to teach more effectively. Our idea is that at any point, the robot can
indicate what it thinks the correct next action is, shedding light on its
current estimate of the human's preferences. We analyze how useful this
feedback is, both in theory and with two user studies---one with a virtual
character that tests the feedback itself, and one with a PR2 robot that uses
gaze as the feedback mechanism. We find that feedback can be useful for
improving both the quality of teaching and teachers' understanding of the

images. As this is a difficult and time-consuming task, machine learning
methods using dermoscopic images have been proposed to assist human experts.
Other approaches have studied electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a
basis for clinical decision support systems. Both methods represent different
ways of measuring skin lesion properties as dermoscopy relies on visible light
and EIS uses electric currents. Thus, the two methods might carry complementary
features for lesion classification. Therefore, we propose joint deep learning
models considering both EIS and dermoscopy for melanoma detection. For this
purpose, we first study machine learning methods for EIS that incorporate
domain knowledge and previously used heuristics into the design process. As a
result, we propose a recurrent model with state-max-pooling which automatically
learns the relevance of different EIS measurements. Second, we combine this new
model with different convolutional neural networks that process dermoscopic
images. We study ensembling approaches and also propose a cross-attention
module guiding information exchange between the EIS and dermoscopy model. In
general, combinations of EIS and dermoscopy clearly outperform models that only
use either EIS or dermoscopy. We show that our attention-based, combined model
outperforms other models with specificities of 34.4% (CI 31.3-38.4), 34.7% (CI
31.0-38.8) and 53.7% (CI 50.1-57.6) for dermoscopy, EIS and the combined model,

scenario, one cannot make both parameter measurement results reach the
Heisenberg limit (HL) simultaneously when the input resources are maximally
entangled. Only one of the parameters' uncertainty can approach the HL while
the other is only scaled by the standard quantum limit (SQL). We also discussed
the constraint conditions that make the quantum Cramer-Rao bound saturable.
These constraint conditions would prompt one to choose proper evolution time
and optimal input state. Under the constraint conditions, we find that the HL
result obtained in the two parameter scenario would catch up with or even be
more precise than that acquired by the single parameter measurement process in
some special cases. Such general features about the Sagnac system revealed in

each operating very close to its theoretical limit. The total bandwidth can
reach 10THz limited by the optical amplifiers. Maximizing spectral efficiency,
the throughput per bandwidth is thus crucial. Replacing independent lasers with
an optical frequency comb can enable very dense packing by overcoming relative
drifts. However, to date, interference from non-ideal spectral shaping prevents
exploiting the full potential of frequency combs. Here, we demonstrate
comb-enabled multi-channel digital signal processing, which overcomes these
limitations. Each channel is detected using an independent coherent receiver
and processed at two samples-per-symbol. By accounting for the unique comb
stability and exploiting aliasing in the design of the dynamic equalizer, we
show that the optimal spectral shape changes, resulting in a higher signal to
noise ratio that pushes the optimal symbol rate towards and even \emph{above}
the channel spacing, resulting in the first example of frequency-domain
super-Nyquist transmission with multi-channel detection for optical systems.
The scheme is verified both in back-to-back configuration and in single span
transmission of a 21 channel superchannel originating from a 25GHz-spaced
frequency comb. By jointly processing 3 wavelength channels at a time, we
achieve spectral efficiency beyond what is possible with independent channels.
At the same time, one significantly relaxes the hardware requirements on
digital-to-analog resolution and bandwidth, and well as filter tap numbers. Our
results show that comb-enabled multi-channel processing can overcome the
limitations of classical dense wavelength division multiplexing systems by
enabling tighter spacing to reach the ultimate spectral efficiency in optical
communications.

been employed for linear inductors in superconducting high-impedance qubits and
kinetic inductance detectors. Due to its large critical current density
compared to typical Josephson junctions, its resilience to external magnetic
fields, and its low dissipation, grAl may also provide a robust source of
non-linearity for strongly driven quantum circuits, topological
superconductivity, and hybrid systems. Having said that, can the grAl
non-linearity be sufficient to build a qubit? Here we show that a small grAl
volume ($10 \times 200 \times 500 \,\mathrm{nm^3}$) shunted by a thin film
aluminum capacitor results in a microwave oscillator with anharmonicity
$\alpha$ two orders of magnitude larger than its spectral linewidth
$\Gamma_{01}$, effectively forming a transmon qubit. With increasing drive
power, we observe several multi-photon transitions starting from the ground
state, from which we extract $\alpha = 2 \pi \times 4.48\,\mathrm{MHz}$.
Resonance fluorescence measurements of the $|0> \rightarrow |1>$ transition
yield an intrinsic qubit linewidth $\gamma = 2 \pi \times 10\,\mathrm{kHz}$,
corresponding to a lifetime of $16\,\mathrm{\mu s}$. This linewidth remains
below $2 \pi \times 150\,\mathrm{kHz}$ for in-plane magnetic fields up to
$\sim70\,\mathrm{mT}$.

within an appropriate range. This coordination is achieved through the function
of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular ""fuel gauge"" that is
expressed in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes
containing catalytic $\alpha$ subunits and regulatory $\beta$ and $\gamma$
subunits. When cellular energy status has been compromised, AMPK is activated
by increases in AMP:ATP or ADP:ATP ratios and acts to restore energy
homeostasis by stimulating energy production via catabolic pathways while
decreasing non-essential energy-consuming pathways. Although the primary
function of AMPK is to regulate energy homeostasis at a cell-autonomous level,
in multicellular organisms, the AMPK system has evolved to interact with
hormones to regulate energy intake and expenditure at the whole body level.
Thus, AMPK functions as a signaling hub, coordinating anabolic and catabolic
pathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand at both the cellular and
whole-body levels. AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses such as
ischemia or hypoxia or glucose deprivation and has both acute and long-term
effects on metabolic pathways and key cellular functions. In addition, AMPK
appears to be a major sensor of energy demand in exercising muscle and acts
both as a multitask gatekeeper and an energy regulator in skeletal muscle.
Acute activation of AMPK has been shown to promote glucose transport and fatty
acid oxidation while suppressing glycogen synthase activity and protein
synthesis. Chronic activation of AMPK induces a shift in muscle fiber type
composition, reduces markers of muscle degeneration and enhances muscle
oxidative capacity potentially by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.
Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that AMPK may not only regulate
metabolism during exercise but also in the recovery phase. AMPK acts as a
molecular transducer between exercise and insulin signaling and is necessary
for the ability of prior contraction/exercise to increase muscle insulin
sensitivity. Based on these observations, drugs that activate AMPK might be
expected to be useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders and insulin
resistance in various conditions.

atoms are confined within a standing-wave resonator and an atomic metastable
dipolar transition couples to a cavity mode. The atomic dipole is incoherently
pumped in the parameter regime that would correspond to stationary
superradiance in absence of inhomogeneous broadening. Starting from the master
equation for cavity field and atomic degrees of freedom we derive a mean-field
model that allows us to determine a threshold temperature, above which thermal
fluctuations suppress superradiant emission. We then analyze the dynamics of
superradiant emission when the motion is described by a mean-field model. In
the semiclassical regime and below the threshold temperature we observe that
the emitted light can be either coherent or chaotic, depending on the
incoherent pump rate. We then analyze superradiant emission from an ideal Bose
gas at zero temperature when the superradiant decay rate $\Lambda$ is of the
order of the recoil frequency $\omega_R$. We show that the quantized exchange
of mechanical energy between the atoms and the field gives rise to a threshold,
$\Lambda_c$, below which superradiant emission is damped down to zero. When
$\Lambda>\Lambda_c$ superradiant emission is accompanied by the formation of
matter-wave gratings diffracting the emitted photons. The stability of these
gratings depends on the incoherent pump rate $w$ with respect to a second
threshold value $w_c$. For $w>w_c$ the gratings are stable and the system
achieves stationary superradiance. Below this second threshold the coupled
dynamics becomes chaotic. We characterize the dynamics across these two
thresholds and show that the three phases we predict (incoherent, coherent,
chaotic) can be revealed via the coherence properties of the light at the
cavity output.

applications in graph mining, particularly in areas like social network

problem is a fundamentally a non-linear optimization problem. Nevertheless, it
can be solved in polynomial time by an exact algorithm based on the iterative
solution of a series of maximum flow sub-problems. Despite its polynomial time
complexity, the computing time required by the exact algorithms on very large

and edges, one has to resort to heuristic algorithms. We provide an efficient
implementation of a greedy heuristic from the literature that is extremely fast
and has some nice theoretical properties. We also introduce a new heurisitic
algorithm that is built on top of the greedy and the exact methods. An
extensive computational study is presented to evaluate the performance of
various solution methods on a benchmark composed of 86 instances taken from the

brightening ($\Delta m \sim -2$ mag). Unlike typical cometary outbursts, each
of the three events are long-lived, with enhanced activity for at least 3 to 6

characterizes, and corrects one-dimensional signals. Specifically, it allows to
check and correct for stationarity, detect spurious samples, check for
normality, check for periodicity, filter, perform spectral analysis, determine
the integral time scale, and perform uncertainty analysis on individual and on
propagated signals through a data reduction equation. The novelty of SCOUT lies
in combining these various methods into one compact and easy-to-use toolbox,
which enables students and professionals alike to analyze, characterize, and
correct for signals without expert knowledge. The program is oriented towards
time traces, but an easy adaptation to spatial distributions can be performed
by the user. SCOUT is available in two variants: a graphical user interface
(GUI) and a script-based version. A key motivation of having two variants is to
offer maximum flexibility to adaptively and visually adjust the analysis
settings using the GUI version and to enable large batch processing
capabilities and own code-integration using the script-based version. The
package includes both variants as well as three example scripts with their
corresponding signals.

systems (NCSs) with asymmetric partial information sharing between two
controllers. In this NCSs model, the controller 2 (C2) shares its observations
and part of its historical control inputs with the controller 1 (C1), whereas
C2 cannot obtain the information of C1 due to network constraints. We present
the optimal estimators for C1 and C2 respectively based on asymmetric
observations. Since the information for C1 and C2 are asymmetric, the
estimation error covariance (EEC) is coupled with the controller which means
that the classical separation principle fails. By applying the Pontryagin's
maximum principle, we obtain a solution to the forward and backward stochastic
difference equations. Based on this solution, we derive the optimal controllers
to minimize a quadratic cost function. Combining the optimal controllers with
the EEC, the controller C1 is decoupled from the ECC. It should be emphasized
that the control gain is dependent on the estimation gain. What's more, the
estimation gain satisfies the forward Riccati equation and the control gain
satisfies the backward Riccati equation which makes the problem more
challenging. We propose iterative solutions to the Riccati equations and give a
suboptimal solution to the optimal decentralized control problem.

the non-linear matter power spectrum ($P_k$), the halo mass function (HMF), and
the two-point correlation function (2PCF). On quantifying the nature of steep
(SEoS-I) and smooth transitions in DE field (CPL-lim), no signature of steep
transition is observed, rather found the overall impact of DE behaviors in
$P_k$ at level of $\sim 2-3\%$ and $\sim 3-4\%$ differences w.r.t $\Lambda$CDM
at $z=0$ respectively. HMF shows the possibility to distinguish between the
models at the high mass ends. The best-fitted model assuming only background
and linear perturbations dubbed as SEoS-II largely deviates from $\Lambda$CDM
and current observations on studying the nonlinear growth. This large deviation
in SEoS-II also quantified the combined effect of the dynamical DE and the
larger amount of matter contained, $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_{0}$ accordingly. 2PCF
results are relatively robust with $\sim 1-2 \%$ deviation for SEoS-I and
CPL-lim and a significant deviation for SEoS-II throughout $r$ from

the SEoS) must include non-linear growth constraints.

use of target speaker information by minimizing the distance between the
speaker representations of reference and source separation output. We also
propose triplet speaker representation loss as an additional criterion to
remove the target speaker information from residual spectrogram output.
VoiceFilter framework is adopted to evaluate source separation performance
using the VCTK database, and we achieved improved performances compared to the
baseline loss function without any additional network parameters.

from $z\geq10$ to $z\sim7$ the black holes shine as luminous as
$10^{11}\hbox{--}10^{12}L_\odot$, with a cumulative spectrum consisting of the
intrinsic continuum from hot accretion disk, nebular hydrogen and helium
spectral lines and free-free continuum from gas of host halos. Here we address
the question of whether such a plain spectrum would allow us to trace evolution
of these growing SMBHs. In our calculations we assume that host galaxies have
stellar populations with masses smaller than the mass of their central black
holes -- the so-called obese black hole galaxies. Within this model we show
that for a sufficiently high mass of gas in a host galaxy -- not smaller than
the mass of a growing black hole, the cumulative spectrum in the far-infrared
reveals a sharp transition from a quasi-blackbody Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum of
the black hole $\propto\lambda^{-2}$ to a flat free-free nebular continuum
$\lambda^{0.118}$ on longer wavelength limit. Once such a transition in the
spectrum is resolved, the black hole mass can be inferred as a combination of
the observed wavelength at the transition $\lambda_k$ and the corresponding
spectral luminosity. Possible observability of this effect in spectra of
growing high-$z$ SMBHs and determination of their mass with the upcoming JWST

is of great interest. However, it is difficult to find a universal expression
to predict the elastic moduli according to the glass composition before
synthesis since the elastic moduli are a complex function of interatomic bonds
and their ordering at different length scales. Here we show that the densities
and elastic moduli of SiO2-based glasses can be efficiently predicted by
machine learning (ML) techniques across a complex compositional space with
multiple (>10) types of additive oxides besides SiO2. Our machine learning
approach relies on a training set generated by high-throughput molecular
dynamic (MD) simulations, a set of elaborately constructed descriptors that
bridges the empirical statistical modeling with the fundamental physics of
interatomic bonding, and a statistical learning/predicting model developed by
implementing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a gradient
boost machine (GBM-LASSO). The predictions of the ML model are comprehensively
compared and validated with a large amount of both simulation and experimental
data. By just training with a dataset only composed of binary and ternary glass
samples, our model shows very promising capabilities to predict the density and
elastic moduli for k-nary SiO2-based glasses beyond the training set. As an
example of its potential applications, our GBM-LASSO model was used to perform
a rapid and low-cost screening of many (~105) compositions of a multicomponent
glass system to construct a compositional-property database that allows for a
fruitful overview on the glass density and elastic properties.

resource allocation for federated learning (FL) over wireless communication
networks is investigated. In the considered model, each user exploits limited
local computational resources to train a local FL model with its collected data
and, then, sends the trained FL model to a base station (BS) which aggregates
the local FL model and broadcasts it back to all of the users. Since FL
involves an exchange of a learning model between users and the BS, both
computation and communication latencies are determined by the learning accuracy
level. Meanwhile, due to the limited energy budget of the wireless users, both
local computation energy and transmission energy must be considered during the
FL process. This joint learning and communication problem is formulated as an
optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of
the system under a latency constraint. To solve this problem, an iterative
algorithm is proposed where, at every step, closed-form solutions for time
allocation, bandwidth allocation, power control, computation frequency, and
learning accuracy are derived. Since the iterative algorithm requires an
initial feasible solution, we construct the completion time minimization
problem and a bisection-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal
solution, which is a feasible solution to the original energy minimization
problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can reduce up to
59.5% energy consumption compared to the conventional FL method.

influences the ability of (re)insurers to estimate the reserve. The excess
over-threshold method provides a way to capture and model the typical behaviour
of insurance claim data. This paper discusses several composite models with
commonly used bulk distributions, combined with a 2-parameter Pareto
distribution above the threshold. We have explored how several threshold
selection methods perform when estimating the reserve as well as the effect of
the choice of bulk distribution, with varying sample size and tail properties.
To investigate this, a simulation study has been performed. Our study shows
that when data are sufficient, the square root rule has the overall best
performance in terms of the quality of the reserve estimate. The second best is
the exponentiality test, especially when the right tail of the data is extreme.
As the sample size becomes small, the simultaneous estimation has the best
performance. Further, the influence of the choice of bulk distribution seems to
be rather large, especially when the distribution is heavy-tailed. Moreover, it
shows that the empirical estimate of $p_{\leq b}$, the probability that a claim
is below the threshold, is more robust than the theoretical one.

as that in the cuprates. By using a three-step method, we successfully
synthesize the bulk samples of Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ (x=0, 0.2, 0.4). The
X-ray diffractions reveal that all the samples contain mainly the infinite

proved by the SEM image and the EDS composition analysis. The resistive
measurements on the Sr doped samples show insulating behavior without the
presence of superconductivity. Temperature dependence of the magnetic moment
under high magnetic fields exhibits a Curie-Weiss law feature with the
paramagnetic moment of about 2$\mu_B$/f.u.. By applying pressure on
Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ up to about 50.2 GPa, we find that the strong
insulating behavior at ambient pressure is significantly suppressed, but

  Wormhole NoCs under Bursty Traffic","21 pages, 22 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of worst-case timing analysis of
heterogeneous wormhole NoCs, i.e., routers with different buffer sizes and
transmission speeds, when consecutive packet queuing (CPQ) occurs. The latter
means that there are several consecutive packets of one flow queuing in the
network. This scenario happens in the case of bursty traffic but also for
non-schedulable traffic. Conducting such an analysis is known to be a
challenging issue due to the sophisticated congestion patterns when enabling
backpressure mechanisms. We tackle this problem through extending the
applicability domain of our previous work for computing maximum delay bounds
using Network Calculus, called Buffer-aware worst-case Timing Analysis (BATA).
We propose a new Graph-based approach to improve the analysis of indirect
blocking due to backpressure, while capturing the CPQ effect and keeping the
information about dependencies between flows. Furthermore, the introduced
approach improves the computation of indirect-blocking delay bounds in terms of
complexity and ensures the safety of these bounds even for non-schedulable
traffic. We provide further insights into the tightness and complexity issues
of worst-case delay bounds yielded by the extended BATA with the Graph-based
approach, denoted G-BATA. Our assessments show that the complexity has
decreased by up to 100 times while offering an average tightness ratio of 71%,
with reference to the basic BATA. Finally, we evaluate the yielded improvements
with G-BATA for a realistic use case against a recent state-of-the-art
approach. This evaluation shows the applicability of G-BATA under more general
assumptions and the impact of such a feature on the tightness and computation
time.

$2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}$ time for all $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\varepsilon >
0$, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Second, we extend
this by showing that there is no $2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}$-time algorithm for
approximating $\mathrm{CVP}_p$ to within a constant factor $\gamma$ for such
$p$ assuming a ""gap"" version of SETH, with an explicit relationship between
$\gamma$, $p$, and the arity $k = k(\varepsilon)$ of the underlying hard CSP.
Third, we show the same hardness result for (exact) $\mathrm{CVP}_p$ with
preprocessing (assuming non-uniform SETH).
  For exact ""plain"" $\mathrm{CVP}_p$, the same hardness result was shown in
[Bennett, Golovnev, and Stephens-Davidowitz FOCS 2017] for all but finitely
many $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$, where the set of exceptions depended on
$\varepsilon$ and was not explicit. For the approximate and preprocessing
problems, only very weak bounds were known prior to this work.
  We also show that the restriction to $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$ is in some sense
inherent. In particular, we show that no ""natural"" reduction can rule out even
a $2^{3n/4}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{CVP}_2$ under SETH. For this, we prove
that the possible sets of closest lattice vectors to a target in the $\ell_2$
norm have quite rigid structure, which essentially prevents them from being as
expressive as $3$-CNFs.
  We prove these results using techniques from many different fields, including
complex analysis, functional analysis, additive combinatorics, and discrete
Fourier analysis. E.g., along the way, we give a new (and tighter) proof of

is needed to avoid violating entanglement monogamy. Here we propose an
alternative approach to OTCs, allowing for monogamy violations. Specifically,
we describe the qubit in the OTC via a pseudo-density operator - a unified
descriptor of both temporal and spatial correlations. We also simulate the
monogamy violation with polarization-entangled photons, providing a
pseudo-density operator quantum tomography. Remarkably, our proposal applies to
any space-time correlations violating entanglement monogamy, such as those

discovered. We re-examine the pulsational predictions for such WDs on the basis
of new full evolutionary sequences. We analyze all the warm DAs observed by
TESS satellite up to Sector 9 in order to search for the possible pulsational

\lesssim \log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -10$, appropriate for the study of
warm DA WDs. We use a new full-implicit treatment of time-dependent element
diffusion. Non-adiabatic pulsations were computed in the effective temperature
range of $30\,000-10\,000$ K, focusing on $\ell= 1$ $g$ modes with periods in
the range $50-1500$ s. We find that extended He/H transition zones inhibit the
excitation of $g$ modes due to partial ionization of He below the H envelope,
and only in the case that the H/He transition is assumed much more abrupt,
models do exhibit pulsational instability. In this case, instabilities are
found only in WD models with H envelopes in the range of $-14.5 \lesssim
\log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -10$ and at effective temperatures higher
than those typical of ZZ Ceti stars, in agreement with previous studies. None
of the 36 warm DAs observed so far by TESS satellite are found to pulsate. Our
study suggests that the non-detection of pulsating warm DAs, if WDs with very
thin H envelopes do exist, could be attributed to the presence of a smooth and
extended H/He transition zone. This could be considered as an indirect proof
that element diffusion indeed operates in the interior of WDs.

spectra provide further insights but requires more observational resources, it
would be valuable to know which objects should we prioritize to have spectrum
in addition to time series. We propose a methodology in a probabilistic setting
that determines a-priory which objects are worth taking spectrum to obtain
better insights, where we focus 'insight' as the type of the object
(classification). Objects for which we query its spectrum are reclassified
using their full spectrum information. We first train two classifiers, one that
uses photometric data and another that uses photometric and spectroscopic data
together. Then for each photometric object we estimate the probability of each
possible spectrum outcome. We combine these models in various probabilistic
frameworks (strategies) which are used to guide the selection of follow up
observations. The best strategy depends on the intended use, whether it is
getting more confidence or accuracy. For a given number of candidate objects
(127, equal to 5% of the dataset) for taking spectra, we improve 37% class
prediction accuracy as opposed to 20% of a non-naive (non-random) best

VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) by introducing the concept
of the bright edge, and use this to derive constraints on the quenching of star
formation activity in galaxies over the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.1$. The
bright-edge of the colour-magnitude diagram evolves with little dependence on
galaxy colour, and therefore on the amount of star formation taking place in
bright galaxies. We modelled this evolution with delayed exponential star
formation histories (SFHs), to better understand the time-scale of the turn-off
in star formation activity. We show that using SFHs without quenching, the
transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence is too slow. This indicates
that a scenario purely driven by the consumption of the gas inside each galaxy
does not reproduce the observed evolution of the colour-magnitude bright edge.
Among the quenching scenarios explored, the one that best matches the
observations assumes that galaxies stop their star formation at a randomly
selected time with a uniform distribution up to $2.5$ Gyr. We argue that
quenching is required over a wide range of stellar masses. Qualitatively
similar evolution of the bright edge is found in the predictions of a
semi-analytical galaxy formation model, but quantitatively there are marked
differences with the observations. This illustrates the utility of the bright
edge as a test of galaxy formation models. The evolution changes and no longer
matches the observed trend if feedback from heating by active galactic nuclei
is turned off.

experimentally the most prominent theoretical four-point many-body system
described by the Hubbard model. By varying the coupling strength of the
four-point interaction in relation to the kinetic term, one can analyze the
phase structure of the model. This intriguing fact leads us to investigate
whether similar Hamiltonians with four-point interactions can also be studied
as a function of their four-point coupling strength. In this paper, we
reexamine the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, regarding it generally beyond the
context of quantum chromodynamics. Essentially, it is a model in which
particle-antiparticle pairing leads to a BCS-like condensate, with the result
that chiral symmetry is broken dynamically in the strong-coupling regime. To
study the behavior of the system, it is necessary to move from this regime to a
hypothetical regime of weak coupling, altering the coupling strength of the
interaction arbitrarily. In order to do this, the gap equation must be regarded
as complex and its Riemann surface structure must be known. We do this and
obtain a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the development
of a complex order parameter (the dynamically generated mass) from the second
sheet of the Riemann surface, as we move into the weak-coupling regime. The
power-law behavior of the order parameter in the vicinity of the phase
transition point is demonstrated to be independent of the choice of the
regularization scheme with the critical exponent as $\beta \approx 0.55$. At
the same time, the isovector pseudoscalar modes retain their feature as
Goldstone modes and still have zero mass, while the isoscalar scalar meson
follows the behavior of the order parameter and gains a width. Energetically,
this mode is not favored over the normal, uncondensed mode but would have to be
accessed through an excitation process.

stars. The $f(R,T)$ theory is important, especially in cosmology, because it
solves certain incompleteness of the standard model. In general, there is no
intrinsic conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in the $f(R,T)$ gravity.
Since this conservation is important in the astrophysical context, we impose
the condition $\nabla T_{\mu\nu}=0$, so that we obtain a function $f(R,T)$ that
implies conservation. This choice of a function $f(R,T)$ that conserves the
momentum-energy tensor gives rise to a strong link between gravity and the
microphysics of the compact object. We obtain the TOV by taking into account a
linear equation of state to describe the matter inside strange stars, such as
$p=\omega\rho$ and the MIT bag model $p=\omega(\rho-4B)$. With these

one of the main barriers restricting access to their unique properties. Recent
advances in synthesizing metastable phases of crystalline materials can help to
overcome this barrier and offer new platforms to experimentally study and

functional material applications (including optoelectronic devices,
light-emitting diodes, and highly efficient solar cells), and because Bi-doped

revisit the effect of bismuth substitution in metastable III-V semiconductors.
Through first-principles calculation methods, we show that in wurtzite

and induce nontrivial topological properties. Specifically, we identify that
GaBi and InBi are Dirac-Weyl semimetals, characterized by the coexistence of

discovery measurement of cosmic neutrinos, announced by IceCube in 2013, has
opened a new window of observation that has already resulted in new fundamental
information that holds the potential to answer key questions associated with
the high-energy universe, including: what are the sources in the PeV sky and
how do they drive particle acceleration; where are cosmic rays of extreme
energies produced, and on which paths do they propagate through the universe;
and are there signatures of new physics at TeV-PeV energies and above? The
planned advancements in neutrino telescope arrays in the next decade, in
conjunction with continued progress in broad multimessenger astrophysics,
promise to elevate the cosmic neutrino field from the discovery to the
precision era and to a survey of the sources in the neutrino sky. The planned

their requirements, which should be both understandable and precise. Most
requirements are written in natural language, good for understandability but
lacking in precision. To make requirements precise, researchers have for years
advocated the use of mathematics-based notations and methods, known as
""formal"". Many exist, differing in their style, scope and applicability. The
present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them
to informal methods. The analysis uses a set of 9 complementary criteria, such
as level of abstraction, tool availability, traceability support. It classifies
the approaches into five categories: general-purpose, natural-language,
graph/automata, other mathematical notations, seamless
(programming-language-based). It presents approaches in all of these
categories, altogether 22 different ones, including for example SysML, Relax,
Eiffel, Event-B, Alloy. The review discusses a number of open questions,
including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make
industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal
approaches.

form of a static problem, corresponding to the determination of the local
stress field for a given dislocation density distribution, complemented by an
evolution problem, corresponding to the transport of the dislocation density.
The static problem is solved using FFT-based techniques (Brenner et al., 2014).
The main contribution of the present study is an efficient numerical scheme
based on high resolution Godunov-type solvers to solve the evolution problem.
Model problems of dislocation-mediated plasticity are finally considered in a

considered, which permits to reproduce annihilation of dislocations and
expansion of dislocation loops. Then, the FDM theory is applied to several

management framework for wireless networks using neighborhood-based
optimization rather than fully centralized or fully decentralized methods. We
propose hierarchical clustering with a minimax linkage criterion for the
formation of the virtual cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider
two cooperation models: the interference coordination model and the coordinated
multi-point decoding model. In the first model base stations in a virtual cell
decode their signals independently, but allocate the communication resources
cooperatively. In the second model base stations in the same virtual cell
allocate the communication resources and decode their signals cooperatively. We
address the resource allocation problem for each of these cooperation models.
For the interference coordination model this problem is an NP-hard
mixed-integer optimization problem whereas for the coordinated multi-point
decoding model it is convex. Our numerical results indicate that proper design
of the neighborhood-based optimization leads to significant gains in sum rate
over fully decentralized optimization, yet may also have a significant sum rate
penalty compared to fully centralized optimization. In particular,
neighborhood-based optimization has a significant sum rate penalty compared to
fully centralized optimization in the coordinated multi-point model, but not
the interference coordination model.

physical systems and processes in domains like fluid dynamics. Such
simulations, although used frequently, have many limitations which could arise
either due to the inability to accurately model a physical process owing to
incomplete knowledge about certain facets of the process or due to the
underlying process being too complex to accurately encode into a simulation
model. In such situations, it is often useful to rely on machine learning
methods to fill in the gap by learning a model of the complex physical process
directly from simulation data. However, as data generation through simulations
is costly, we need to develop models, being cognizant of data paucity issues.
In such scenarios it is often helpful if the rich physical knowledge of the
application domain is incorporated in the architectural design of machine
learning models. Further, we can also use information from physics-based
simulations to guide the learning process using aggregate supervision to
favorably constrain the learning process. In this paper, we propose PhyDNN, a
deep learning model using physics-guided structural priors and physics-guided
aggregate supervision for modeling the drag forces acting on each particle in a
Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method(CFD-DEM). We conduct
extensive experiments in the context of drag force prediction and showcase the
usefulness of including physics knowledge in our deep learning formulation both

particularly worth of interest: quarks in the fundamental representation,
quarks in the 2-indice (anti)symmetric representation and quarks in the adjoint
representation. The last three corresponding QCD-like theories are equivalent
at large-$N$ for bosonic observables: It is the orientifold equivalence. The
behavior of the lightest vector meson mass versus $N$ has been studied in
quenched lattice QCD in the chiral limit in these theories. We show that the
observed behaviors are compatible with a string tension proportional to the
quadratic Casimir of $SU(N)$ in the quark color representation, $\textit{i.e.}$
with the Casimir scaling hypothesis. The large-$N$ limit of some excited meson

their input modalities, especially when they must generalize to degradations
not seen during training. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion
scheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and
unknown degradations. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty
measures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we
propose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output
softmax probabilities. We additionally propose a novel data-dependent spatial
temperature scaling method to complement these existing uncertainty measures.
Finally, we integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality using a
probabilistic noisy-or fusion method. In a photo-realistic simulation
environment (AirSim), we show that our method achieves significantly better
results on a semantic segmentation task, compared to state-of-art fusion
architectures, on a range of degradations (e.g. fog, snow, frost, and various

content and services through various means. It has been a challenge for less
tech-savvy parents to protect children from harmful content and services.
Internet of Things (IoT) has made the situation much worse as IoT devices allow
children to connect to the Internet in novel ways (e.g., connected
refrigerators, TVs, and so on). In this paper, we propose mySafeHome, an
approach which utilises family dynamics to provide a more natural, and
intuitive access control mechanism to protect children from harmful content and
services in the context of IoT. In mySafeHome, access control dynamically
adapts based on the physical distance between family members. For example, a
particular type of content can only be consumed, through TV, by children if the
parents are in the same room (or hearing distance). mySafeHome allows parents
to assess a given content by themselves. Our approach also aims to create
granular levels of access control (e.g., block / limit certain content,
features, services, on certain devices when the parents are not in the
vicinity). We developed a prototype using OpenHAB and several smart home
devices to demonstrate the proposed approach. We believe that our approach also
facilitates the creation of better relationships between family members. A demo
