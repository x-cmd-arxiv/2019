it, yet, allows the exact recovery of $w$ given another value $w'$ that is

lower entropy compared to the error itself, formally called ""more error than

concrete construction for secure sketch. We show security to all noisy sources,

multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique which provides high energy
efficiency and reduces system complexity. In SM, only one transmitter is active
at any given time while the rest of them remain silent. The index of the active
transmitter carries information. This spatial information is in addition to the
data carried by the constellation symbols in the signal domain. Therefore, SM
increases the transmission rate of the communication system compared to
single-input-single-output and space-time block coding (STBC)-MIMO. For signal
domain data encoding, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has
been widely adopted. The key benefits in multi-carrier intensity-modulation and
direct-detection (IM/DD) systems are: i) the capability to achieve high
spectral efficiency and ii) the ability to effectively mitigate direct-current
(DC) wander effects and the impact of ambient light. However, current off-the
shelf light emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used as transmit entities are
primarily bandwidth limited. Thus, there are benefits of combining SM and OFDM
to enhance transmission speeds while maintaining low complexity. In this paper,
the two most common OFDM-based SM types, namely frequency domain SM (FD-SM) and
time domain SM (TD-SM), are investigated for optical wireless communications
(OWC). Moreover, proof-ofconcept experimental results are presented to showcase
practical feasibility of both techniques. The obtained results are also
compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that TDSM with an
optimal maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detector significantly
outperforms FD-SM. It can be inferred from the results that TD SM is a strong
candidate among OFDM-based optical SM systems for future optical IM/DD wireless
communication systems.

this study, we apply the HHD to study certain types of vector fields. In

algebraic Riccati equation. Subsequently, a method to explicitly construct a
Lyapunov function is established. In particular, if A is normal, there exists
an easy solution to this equation. Next, we study planar vector fields. In this

notion in hydrodynamics with the same name. We demonstrate the convenience of
the complex potential formalism by analyzing vector fields given by homogeneous

theory conflict with a classical worldview, it is necessary to articulate a
notion of classicality within an operational framework. A widely applicable
notion of classicality of this sort is whether or not the predictions of a
given operational theory can be explained by a generalized-noncontextual
ontological model. We here explore what notion of classicality this implies for
the generalized probabilistic theory (GPT) that arises from a given operational
theory, focusing on prepare-measure scenarios. We first show that, when mapping
an operational theory to a GPT by quotienting relative to operational
equivalences, the constraint of explainability by a generalized-noncontextual
ontological model is mapped to the constraint of explainability by an
ontological model. We then show that, under the additional assumption that the
ontic state space is of finite cardinality, this constraint on the GPT can be
expressed as a geometric condition which we term simplex-embeddability. Whereas
the traditional notion of classicality for a GPT is that its state space be a
simplex and its effect space be the dual of this simplex, simplex-embeddability
merely requires that its state space be embeddable in a simplex and its effect
space in the dual of that simplex. We argue that simplex-embeddability
constitutes an intuitive and freestanding notion of classicality for GPTs. Our
result also has applications to witnessing nonclassicality in prepare-measure
experiments.

A single most
effective way to achieve that is to increase the amount of copying while still
allowing for text abstraction. Human editors can usually exercise control over
copying, resulting in summaries that are more extractive than abstractive, or
vice versa. However, it remains poorly understood whether modern neural
abstractive summarizers can provide the same flexibility, i.e., learning from
single reference summaries to generate multiple summary hypotheses with varying
degrees of copying. In this paper, we present a neural summarization model
that, by learning from single human abstracts, can produce a broad spectrum of
summaries ranging from purely extractive to highly generative ones. We frame
the task of summarization as language modeling and exploit alternative
mechanisms to generate summary hypotheses. Our method allows for control over
copying during both training and decoding stages of a neural summarization
model. Through extensive experiments we illustrate the significance of our
proposed method on controlling the amount of verbatim copying and achieve
competitive results over strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals

damage is key for the design of future nuclear fission and fusion reactors.
Self-ion implantation is an attractive tool for mimicking the effects of
neutron irradiation. However, the damaged layer of implanted samples is only
few microns thick, making it difficult to estimate macroscopic properties. Here
we address this challenge using a combination of experimental and modelling
techniques. We concentrate on self-ion-implanted tungsten, the front-runner for
fusion armour components and a prototypical bcc material. To capture
dose-dependent evolution of properties, we experimentally characterise samples
with damage levels from 0.01 to 1 dpa. Spherical nano-indentation of <001>
grains shows hardness increasing up to a dose of 0.032 dpa, beyond which it
saturates. AFM measurements show pile-up increasing up to the same dose, beyond
which large pile-up and slip-steps are seen. Based on the observations we
develop a crystal plasticity (CPFE) model for the irradiated material. It
captures irradiation-induced hardening followed by strain-softening through
interaction of irradiation-defects and gliding dislocations. Shear resistance
of irradiation-defects is derived from TEM observations of similarly irradiated
samples. Nano-indentation of pristine and implanted tungsten of doses 0.01,
0.1, 0.32 and 1 dpa is simulated. Two model parameters are fitted to the
experimental results of the 0.01 dpa sample and are kept unchanged for all
other doses. Peak load, indent surface profiles and damage saturation predicted
by the CPFE model closely match experimental observations. Predicted lattice
distortions and dislocation distributions around indents agree with
corresponding measurements from HR-EBSD. Finally, the CPFE model is used to

Dahleh","On the Abstract Structure of the Behavioral Approach to Systems Theory","25 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.CT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the behavioral approach to systems theory and make explicit the
abstract pattern that governs it. Our end goal is to use that pattern to
understand interaction-related phenomena that emerge when systems interact.
Rather than thinking of a system as a pair $(\mathbb{U}, \mathcal{B})$, we
begin by thinking of it as an injective map from $\mathcal{B} \rightarrow
\mathbb{U}$. This relative perspective naturally brings about the sought
structure, which we summarize in three points. First, the separation of
behavioral equations and behavior is developed through two spaces, one of
syntax and another of semantics, linked by an interpretation map. Second, the
notion of interconnection and variable sharing is shown to be a construction of
the same nature as that of gluing topological spaces or taking amalgamated sums
of algebraic objects. Third, the notion of interconnection instantiates to both
the syntax space and the semantics space, and the interpretation map is shown
to preserve the interconnection when going from syntax to semantics. This
pattern, in its generality, is made precise by borrowing very basic constructs
from the language of categories and functors.

Requirements Engineering (RE). Several approaches use videos to represent
visions. However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This
missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We
propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision
videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality
characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which
together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality
characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) A
hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality
characteristics and (b) A mapping of these characteristics to the video
production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the
evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video
production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15
characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived
by the subjects from a developer's the point of view. Six characteristics
(video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability)
correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a
vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance
of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is
a sound basis for future refinements and extensions.

thermodynamic (TT) methodology, a novel material, which is called thermal-null

functionalities such as thermal bending devices, arbitrary shape heat
concentrators and omnidirectional thermal cloaks. In contrary to the
conventional TT-based conductivities, which are inhomogeneous and anisotropic,
TNMs are homogeneous and easy to realize. In addition, the attained TNMs are
independent of the device shape. That is if the geometry of the desired device
is changed, there is no need to recalculate the necessitating conductivities.
This feature of TNM will make it suitable for scenarios where
re-configurability is of utmost importance. Several numerical simulations are
carried out to demonstrate the TNM capability and its applications in
directional bending devices, heat concentrators and thermal cloaks. The
proposed TNM could open a new avenue for potential applications in solar
thermal panels and thermal-electric devices.

the case of isotropic and local point-interactions, our result is consistent

show that the scattered field consists of two parts: one is due to the
diffusion by the extended scatterer and the other one is a linear combination
of the interactions between the point-like obstacles and the interaction
between the point-like obstacles with the extended one.
  As to the inverse problem, the factorization method by Kirsch is adapted to
recover simultaneously the shape of an extended elastic body and the location
of point-like scatterers in the case of isotropic and local interactions. The
inverse problems using only one type of elastic waves (i.e. pressure or shear

configuration, which is distilled and mathematically captured by a dedicated

our knowledge, this is the first study to use learning-based registration
methods for the segmentation of head and neck patients and demonstrate its
utility in clinical applications. Methods: Our algorithm cascades rigid and
deformable deformation blocks, and takes on an atlas image (M), set of
atlas-space segmentations (S_A), and a patient image (F) as inputs, while
outputting patient-space segmentations of all OARs defined on the atlas. We

manual segmentation and supervised segmentation, while solving a much more

automate the segmentation process for a select few number of OARs, we
demonstrate that our methods can achieve similar performance for OARs of

continuous attributes such as political ideology or skin color. This division

seen as out-group by individuals on either side of the spectrum, becoming
inbetweeners. Here, we propose a quantitative, dynamical-system model that

two social groups draw the boundaries between ""us"" and ""them"" on a continuous

boundary than the middle of the spectrum. As a result, each group sees the
individuals in the middle of the attribute space as an out-group. We test this

  under Uncertainty","38 pages, 24 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of uncertainty in material properties and geometry of a
structure is ubiquitous. The design of robust engineering structures,
therefore, needs to incorporate uncertainty in the optimization process.
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method can alleviate the cost of optimization
under uncertainty, which includes statistical moments of quantities of interest
in the objective and constraints. However, the design may change considerably
during the initial iterations of the optimization process which impedes the
convergence of the traditional SGD method and its variants. In this paper, we
present two SGD based algorithms, where the computational cost is reduced by
employing a low-fidelity model in the optimization process. In the first
algorithm, most of the stochastic gradient calculations are performed on the
low-fidelity model and only a handful of gradients from the high-fidelity model
are used per iteration, resulting in an improved convergence. In the second
algorithm, we use gradients from low-fidelity models to be used as control
variate, a variance reduction technique, to reduce the variance in the search
direction. These two bi-fidelity algorithms are illustrated first with a
conceptual example. Then, the convergence of the proposed bi-fidelity
algorithms is studied with two numerical examples of shape and topology
optimization and compared to popular variants of the SGD method that do not use
low-fidelity models. The results show that the proposed use of a bi-fidelity
approach for the SGD method can improve the convergence. Two analytical proofs
are also provided that show the linear convergence of these two algorithms
under appropriate assumptions.

properties of a topological laser device built by including saturable gain on

lattices the Bogoliubov analysis applies, the emission is nearly a single-mode
one and the coherence time is almost determined by the total number of photons
in the device in agereement with the standard Schawlow-Townes phase diffusion.
In larger lattices, looking at the lasing edge mode in the comoving frame of
its chiral motion, the spatio-temporal correlations of long-wavelength
fluctuations display a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling. Still, at very long
times, when the finite size of the device starts to matter, the functional form
of the temporal decay of coherence changes from the KPZ stretched exponential
to a Schawlow-Townes-like exponential, while the nonlinear many-mode dynamics
of KPZ fluctuations remains visible as an enhanced linewidth as compared to the
single-mode Schawlow-Townes prediction. While we have established the above
behaviors also for non-topological laser arrays, the crucial role of topology
in protecting the coherence from static disorder is finally highlighted: our

non-topological devices. These results open exciting possibilities for both

Analytic post-Newtonian treatments are limited by unknown higher-order nontidal

post-Newtonian tidal terms are ""spliced"" onto numerical relativity simulations
of black-hole binaries. We improve on previous treatments of tidal splicing by
including spherical harmonic modes beyond the (2,2) mode, expanding the
post-Newtonian expressions for tidal effects to 2.5 order, including dynamical
tide corrections, and adding a partial treatment of the spin-tidal dynamics.
Furthermore, instead of numerical relativity simulations, we use the
spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) surrogate model ""NRHybSur3dq8"" to provide
the BBH waveforms that are input into the tidal slicing procedure. This allows
us to construct spin-aligned, inspiraling TaylorT2 and TaylorT4 splicing

several conceptual problems of this conjecture, which is in itself formulated
as a statement on the restriction of possible scenarios in a theory: by
contrast a standard swampland conjecture is a restriction of possible theories
in the landscape of the quantum gravity. We emphasize the concept of swampland
universality, i.e. that a swampland conjecture constrains any possible scenario
in a given effective field theory. In order to illustrate the problems clearly
we introduce several versions of the conjecture, where TCC condition is imposed
differently to scenarios realizable in a given theory. We point out that these
different versions of the conjecture lead to observable differences: a TCC
violation in another Universe can exclude a theory, and such reduction of the

the question of whether or not the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture can be

demonstrate good agreement between the observed values and the theoretically

co-optimizing for peak demand shaving, energy arbitrage and increase
self-sufficiency in the context of power network in Madeira, Portugal.
Feed-in-tariff for electricity network in Madeira is zero, which implies
consumers with excess production should locally consume the excess generation
rather than wasting it. Further, the power network {operator} applies a peak
power contract for consumers which imposes an upper bound on the peak power
seen by the power grid interfaced by energy meter. We investigate the value of
storage in Madeira, using four different types of prosumers, categorized based
on the relationship between their inelastic load and renewable generation. We
observe that the marginal increase in the value of storage deteriorates with
increase in size and ramping capabilities. We propose the use of profit per
cycle per unit of battery capacity and expected payback period as indices for
selecting the best-suited storage parameters to ensure profitability. This
mechanism takes into account the consumption and generation patterns, profit,
storage degradation, and cycle and calendar life of the battery. We also
propose the inclusion of a friction coefficient in the original co-optimization
formulation to increase the value of storage by reducing the operational cycles
and eliminate low returning transactions.

users with a simple interface to specify their privacy preferences with an IoT

app and its recipients using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Moreover, IoTWatcH informs the users with its findings to make them aware of
the privacy risks with the IoT app. We implemented IoTWatcH on real IoT

evaluate its effectiveness. IoTWatcH successfully classifies IoT app data sent
to external parties to correct privacy labels with an average accuracy of
94.25%, and flags IoT apps that leak privacy data to unauthorized parties.

volatile abundance in Semarkona chondrules suggest that chondrules formed in a
dense clump that had a higher solid density than the gas density in the solar
nebula. We investigate collisions between chondrules and matrix in the surface
region of dense clumps using fluffy aggregate growth models. Our simulations
show that the collisional growth of aggregates composed of chondrules and
matrix takes place in the clumps well before they experience gravitational
collapse. The internal structure of chondrite parent bodies (CPBs) can be
thereby determined by aggregate growth. We find that the aggregate growth
generates two scales within CPBs. The first scale is involved with the small
scale distribution of chondrules and determined by the early growth stage,
where chondrules accrete aggregates composed of matrix grains. This accretion
can reproduce the thickness of the matrix layer around chondrules found in
chondrites. The other scale is related to the large scale distribution of
chondrules. Its properties (e.g., the abundance of chondrules and the overall
size) depend on the gas motion within the clump, which is parameterized in this
work. Our work thus suggests that the internal structure of CPBs may provide
important clues about their formation conditions and mechanisms.

test coverage criteria for smart contracts, which are objective rules that

capture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the
notions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction
interaction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent
inter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum
transactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the
permutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two
notions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms
are given to the generation of coverage requirements. A case study is conducted

ContractGuard, the first intrusion detection system (IDS) to defend Ethereum
smart contracts against such attacks. Like IDSs for conventional programs,
ContractGuard detects intrusion attempts as abnormal control flow. However,
existing IDS techniques/tools are inapplicable to Ethereum smart contracts due
to Ethereum's decentralized nature and its highly restrictive execution
environment. To address these issues, we design ContractGuard by embedding it
in the contracts to profile context-tagged acyclic paths, and optimizing it
under the Ethereum gas-oriented performance model. The main goal is to minimize
the overheads, to which the users will be extremely sensitive since the cost
needs to be paid upfront in digital concurrency. Empirical investigation using
real-life contracts deployed in the Ethereum mainnet shows that on average,
ContractGuard only adds to 36.14% of the deployment overhead and 28.27% of the
runtime overhead. Furthermore, we conducted controlled experiments and show

$M_1=(S,{\cal I}_1)$ and $M_2=(S,{\cal I}_2)$ on the same ground set $S$, and
the goal is to determine the smallest number $k$ such that given arbitrary
lists $L_s$ of $k$ colors for $s\in S$, it is possible to choose a color from
each list so that every monochromatic set is independent in both $M_1$ and
$M_2$. When both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are partition matroids, Galvin's list coloring
theorem for bipartite graphs gives the answer. One of the main open questions
is to decide if there exists a constant $c$ such that if the coloring number is
$k$ (i.e., the ground set can be partitioned into $k$ common independent sets),
then the list coloring number is at most $c\cdot k$. We consider matroid
classes that appear naturally in combinatorial optimization problems, namely
graphic matroids, paving matroids and gammoids. We show that if both matroids
are from these fundamental classes, then the list coloring number is at most
twice the coloring number.
  The proof is based on a new approach that reduces a matroid to a partition
matroid without increasing its coloring number too much, and might be of
independent combinatorial interest. In particular, we show that if $M=(S,{\cal
I})$ is a matroid in which $S$ can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets,
then there exists a partition matroid $N=(S,{\cal J})$ with ${\cal
J}\subseteq{\cal I}$ in which $S$ can be partitioned into (A) $k$ independent

graphic matroid, (C) $\lceil kr/(r-1)\rceil$ independent sets if $M$ is a
paving matroid of rank $r$, and (D) $2k-2$ independent sets if $M$ is a
gammoid. We extend our results by showing that the existence of a matroid $N$
with $\chi(N)\leq 2\chi(M)$ implies the existence of a matroid $N'$ with
$\chi(N')\leq 2\chi(M')$ for every truncation $M'$ of $M$.

  Machine Replication",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the emergence of cross-organization attack-prone byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) systems, so-called Blockchains, providing asynchronous
state machine replication (SMR) solutions is no longer a theoretical concern.
This paper introduces ACE: a general framework for the software design of
fault-tolerant SMR systems. We first propose a new leader-based-view (LBV)
abstraction that encapsulates the core properties provided by each view in a
partially synchronous consensus algorithm, designed according to the
leader-based view-by-view paradigm (e.g., PBFT and Paxos). Then, we compose
several LBV instances in a non-trivial way in order to boost asynchronous
liveness of existing SMR solutions.
  ACE is model agnostic - it abstracts away any model assumptions that
consensus protocols may have, e.g., the ratio and types of faulty parties. For
example, when the LBV abstraction is instantiated with a partially synchronous
consensus algorithm designed to tolerate crash failures, e.g., Paxos or Raft,
ACE yields an asynchronous SMR for $n = 2f+1$ parties. However, if the LBV
abstraction is instantiated with a byzantine protocol like PBFT or HotStuff,
then ACE yields an asynchronous byzantine SMR for $n = 3f+1$ parties.
  To demonstrate the power of ACE, we implement it in C++, instantiate the LBV
abstraction with a view implementation of HotStuff -- a state of the art
partially synchronous byzantine agreement protocol -- and compare it with the
base HotStuff implementation under different adversarial scenarios. Our
evaluation shows that while ACE is outperformed by HotStuff in the optimistic,
synchronous, failure-free case, ACE has absolute superiority during network
asynchrony and attacks.

random removal of links while sharing the same $\lambda$ and $K$. With this
generalized power-law degree distribution, the critical point $K_c$ for the
appearance of the giant component remains zero not only for $\lambda\leq 3$ but
also for $3<\lambda<\lambda_l \simeq 3.81$. This is contrasted with $K_c=0$

unveil the mystery. For each image, we use a fully convolutional network to
produce an aesthetic score map, which is shared among all candidate crops

map to be both composition-aware and saliency-aware. In particular, the same
region is assigned with different aesthetic scores based on its relative
positions in different crops. Moreover, a visually salient region is supposed
to have more sensitive aesthetic scores so that our network can learn to place
salient objects at more proper positions. Such an aesthetic score map can be
used to localize aesthetically important regions in an image, which sheds light
on the composition rules learned by our model. We show the competitive
performance of our model in the image cropping task on several benchmark

Ising models where the order-disorder phase transition in the classical model
is mapped to the error threshold of the corresponding topological code. On the
other hand, there is a dual mapping between classical spin models and quantum
Calderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) states where the partition function of a classical
model defined on a hypergraph $H$ is written as an inner product of a product
state and a CSS state on dual hypergraph $\tilde{H}$. It is then interesting to
see what is the interpretation of the classical phase transition in the random
bond Ising model within the framework of the above duality and whether such an
interpretation has any connection to the error threshold of the corresponding
topological CSS code. In this paper, we consider the above duality relation
specifically for a two-dimensional random bond Ising model. We show that the
order parameter of this classical system is mapped to a coherence order
parameter in a noisy Toric code model. In particular, a quantum phase
transition from a coherent phase to a non-coherent phase occurs when the
initial coherent state is affected by two sequences of bit-flip quantum
channels where a quenched disorder is induced by measurement of the errors
after the first channel. On the other hand, the above transition is directly
related to error threshold of the Toric code model. Accordingly, and since the
noisy process can be applied to other topological CSS states, we conclude that
the dual correspondence can also provide a useful tool for the study of error
thresholds in different topological CSS codes.

there is an unobserved confounder for history, question, and answer, leading to
spurious correlations from training data. In particular, to remove the

systematic RLNC schemes in wireless broadcast. In particular, we prove that the

much better trade-off between completion delay and decoding complexity. In

decoding complexity is only about 3 times the one of the RLNC scheme over

structure (e.g., edges) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks or failures. We
propose a robust and sustainable network flow model to effectively and
proactively counter plausible attacking behaviors of an adversary operating
under a budget constraint. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario
generation approach based on an iterative two-player game between a defender
and an adversary. We assume that the adversary always takes a best myopic
response (out of some feasible attacks) against the current flow scenario
prepared by the defender. On the other hand, we assume that the defender
considers all the attacking behaviors revealed by the adversary in previous
iterations in order to generate a new conservative flow strategy that is robust
(maximin) against all those attacks. This iterative game continues until the
objectives of the adversary and the administrator both converge. We show that
the robust network flow problem to be solved by the defender is NP-hard and
that the complexity of the adversary's decision problem grows exponentially
with the network size and the adversary's budget value. We propose two
principled heuristic approaches for solving the adversary's problem at the
scale of a large urban network. Extensive computational results on multiple
synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the solution provided by
the defender's problem significantly increases the amount of flow pushed
through the network and reduces the expected lost flow over four

many computer vision applications in the absence of labeled data. Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that learn representations
useful for data generation. However, due to inherent challenges in the training

tasks. Regularization-based methods that attempt to improve the representation
learning aspect of VAEs come at a price: poor sample generation. In this paper,
we explore this representation-generation trade-off for regularized VAEs and
introduce a new family of priors, namely decoupled priors, or dpVAEs, that
decouple the representation space from the generation space. This decoupling
enables the use of VAE regularizers on the representation space without
impacting the distribution used for sample generation, and thereby reaping the
representation learning benefits of the regularizations without sacrificing the
sample generation. dpVAE leverages invertible networks to learn a bijective
mapping from an arbitrarily complex representation distribution to a simple,
tractable, generative distribution. Decoupled priors can be adapted to the
state-of-the-art VAE regularizers without additional hyperparameter tuning. We
showcase the use of dpVAEs with different regularizers. Experiments on MNIST,

dramatically when the gating geometry is properly taken into account. This
effect is implemented by a self-consistent calculation of the Coulomb

tight-binding approximation. Thereby we consider both, single- and double-sided
gating. Our results show that, at low doping levels of $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, the
electronic bands of monolayer TMDs shift rigidly for both types of gating, and
subsequently undergo a Lifshitz transition. When approaching the doping level
of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, the band structure changes dramatically, especially in
the case of single-sided gating where we find that monolayer \ce{MoS2} and
\ce{WS2} become indirect gap semiconductors. The optical conductivities
calculated within linear response theory also show clear signatures of these
doping-induced band structure renormalizations. Our numerical results based on

Indeed, the effective prediction of city-wide parking availability can improve

availability because of three major challenges: 1) the non-Euclidean spatial
autocorrelation among parking lots, 2) the dynamic temporal autocorrelation

which are often exploited by various entities for the dissemination of false
information. Yet, we lack tools and techniques to effectively track the
propagation of information across the multiple diverse communities, and to
model the interplay and influence between them. Also, we lack an understanding
of what the role and impact of emerging communities and services on the Web
are, and how such communities are exploited by bad actors that spread false and
weaponized information. In this thesis, we study the information ecosystem on
the Web by presenting a typology that includes the various types of false
information, the involved actors and their possible motives. Then, we follow a
data-driven cross-platform quantitative approach to analyze billions of posts
from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan's /pol/, and Gab, to shed light on: 1) how news and
memes travel from one Web community to another and how we can model and
quantify the influence between Web communities; 2) characterizing the role of
emerging Web communities and services on the Web, by studying Gab and two Web
archiving services, namely the Wayback Machine and archive.is; and 3) how
popular Web communities are exploited by state-sponsored actors for the purpose
of spreading disinformation. Our analysis reveal that fringe Web communities
like 4chan's /pol/ and The_Donald subreddit have a disproportionate influence
on mainstream communities like Twitter with regard to the dissemination of news
and memes. We find that Gab acts as the new hub for the alt-right community,
while for Web archiving services we find that they can be misused to penalize
ad revenue from news sources with conflicting ideology. Finally, when studying
state-sponsored actors, we find that they were particularly influential in
spreading news on popular communities like Twitter and Reddit.

optimal route avoiding any collisions with the obstacles present in the
environment. Route planning is an NP-hard optimization problem. In this paper,
a newly proposed Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is used, and its performance is
compared with deterministic and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs). The
results illustrate that SSA outperforms all the other meta-heuristic algorithms
in route planning for multiple UAVs in a 3D environment. The proposed approach
improves the average cost and overall time by 1.25% and 6.035% respectively
when compared to recently reported data. Route planning is involved in many
real-life applications like robot navigation, self-driving car, autonomous UAV

exemplar-domain aware image-to-image translator (EDIT for short). The principle
behind is that, for images from multiple domains, the content features can be
obtained by a uniform extractor, while (re-)stylization is achieved by mapping
the extracted features specifically to different purposes (domains and
exemplars). The generator of our EDIT comprises of a part of blocks configured
by shared parameters, and the rest by varied parameters exported by an
exemplar-domain aware parameter network. In addition, a discriminator is
equipped during the training phase to guarantee the output satisfying the
distribution of the target domain. Our EDIT can flexibly and effectively work
on multiple domains and arbitrary exemplars in a unified neat model. We conduct
experiments to show the efficacy of our design, and reveal its advances over

to the brand reputation. Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce
companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers'
questions, for example, chatbot and hotline. On one hand, each channel has
limited capacity to respond to customers' requests, on the other hand,
customers have different preferences over these channels. The current
production systems are mainly built based on business rules, which merely
considers tradeoffs between resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve
the optimal tradeoff between resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose
a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning, which directly takes both
resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also
propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning based routing method-double dueling
deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate
our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer
service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our
proposed deep-reinforcement-learning based framework is superior to the
existing production system. Moreover, we also show our proposed PER-DoDDQN is
better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a
more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method

  Network Calculus",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The network calculus (NC) analysis takes a simple model consisting of a
network of schedulers and data flows crossing them. A number of analysis
""building blocks"" can then be applied to capture the model without imposing
pessimistic assumptions like self-contention on tandems of servers. Yet, adding
pessimism cannot always be avoided. To compute the best bound on a single
flow's end-to-end delay thus boils down to finding the least pessimistic
contention models for all tandems of schedulers in the network - and an
exhaustive search can easily become a very resource intensive task. The
literature proposes a promising solution to this dilemma: a heuristic making
use of machine learning (ML) predictions inside the NC analysis.
  While results of this work were promising in terms of delay bound quality and
computational effort, there is little to no insight on when a prediction is
made or if the trained algorithm can achieve similarly striking results in
networks vastly differing from its training data. In this paper, we address
these pending questions. We evaluate the influence of the training data and its
features on accuracy, impact and scalability. Additionally, we contribute an
extension of the method by predicting the best $n$ contention model
alternatives in order to achieve increased robustness for its application
outside the training data. Our numerical evaluation shows that good accuracy
can still be achieved on large networks although we restrict the training to
networks that are two orders of magnitude smaller.

of the square of the Wasserstein distance, with exponent $2,$ between two
samples of $N$ uniformly distributed points in the unit square is $\log N/2\pi
N$ plus corrections, while the expected value of the square of the Wasserstein
distance between one sample of $N$ uniformly distributed points and the uniform
measure on the square is $\log N/4\pi N$. These conjectures has been proved by
Ambrosio et al. arXiv:1611.04960.
  Here we consider the case in which the points are sampled from a non uniform

the density is regular and positive in a regular, bounded and connected domain
$\Lambda$ in the plane, then the leading term of the expected values of the
Wasserstein distances are exactly the same as in the case of uniform density,
but for the multiplicative factor equal to the measure of $\Lambda$.

  Bias-Variance Tradeoff for Effective Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
continuous action spaces is often approached by directly training parametric
policies along the direction of estimated policy gradients (PGs). Previous
research revealed that the performance of these PG algorithms depends heavily
on the bias-variance tradeoffs involved in estimating and using PGs. A notable
approach towards balancing this tradeoff is to merge both on-policy and
off-policy gradient estimations. However existing PG merging methods can be
sample inefficient and are not suitable to train deterministic policies
directly. To address these issues, this paper introduces elite PGs and
strengthens their variance reduction effect by adopting elitism and policy
consolidation techniques to regularize policy training based on policy
behavioral knowledge extracted from elite trajectories. Meanwhile, we propose a
two-step method to merge elite PGs and conventional PGs as a new extension of
the conventional interpolation merging method. At both the theoretical and
experimental levels, we show that both two-step merging and interpolation
merging can induce varied bias-variance tradeoffs during policy training. They
enable us to effectively use elite PGs and mitigate their performance impact on
trained policies. Our experiments also show that two-step merging can
outperform interpolation merging and several state-of-the-art algorithms on six
benchmark control tasks.

diagonalizing matrices which make Yukawa matrices diagonal. Although most of
the diagonalizing matrices are unknown ones, grand unified theories (GUTs) can
fix these matrices. In particular, if we consider a GUT model based on the
$SO(10)$ group, these diagonalizing matrices are strongly related to each other
because of the matter unification. However, this unification causes the problem
on the realization of measured SM fermion masses and mixing angles. Up to now,
many people showed that supersymmetric (SUSY) threshold corrections can solve
this problem, especially unfavorable fermion mass relations. In this paper, we
show that how these SUSY threshold corrections affect unknown diagonalizing
matrices. Since these contributions are also related to the FVs induced by SUSY
particles, we can estimate the maximal effect to the diagonalizing matrices. We
found that the $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$ elements of diagonalizing matrices for
quarks can be as large as the corresponding mixing angle of the CKM matrix.
Moreover, we found that the higher SUSY scale can predict the larger mixing
angles, although strong cancellation between the Higgs mass parameters is
needed to realize the electroweak symmetry breaking.

of the membrane when increasing the coupling and propose a scaling procedure
that allows us to effectively reach arbitrary large system sizes. We find that
the critical value of the coupling rapidly decays as the system increases its
size, in agreement with the experimental observation of an unavoidable stable
rippled state for suspended graphene membranes. This decay turns out to be
controlled by a power law with a critical exponent $\sim 1/2$.

proposes that the logarithmic layer is populated by a set of energetic and
geometrically self-similar eddies. These eddies scale with a single length
scale, their distance to the wall, while their velocity scale remains constant
across their size range. To investigate the existence of such structures in
fully developed turbulent pipe flow, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry
measurements were performed in two parallel cross-sectional planes, spaced
apart by a varying distance from 0 to 9.97$R$, for $Re_\tau = 1310$, 2430 and
3810.
  The instantaneous turbulence structures are sorted by width using an
azimuthal Fourier decomposition, allowing us to create a set of average eddy
velocity profiles by performing an azimuthal alignment process. The resulting
eddy profiles exhibit geometric self-similar behavior in the $(r,\theta)$-plane
for eddies with spanwise length scales ($\lambda_\theta/R$) spanning from 1.03
to 0.175. The streamwise similarity is further investigated using two-point
correlations between the two planes, where the structures exhibit a
self-similar behaviour with length scales ($\lambda_\theta/R$) ranging from
approximately $0.88$ to $0.203$. The candidate structures thereby establish
full three-dimensional geometrically self-similarity for structures with a
volumetric ratio of $1:80$. Beside the geometric similarity, the velocity
magnitude also exhibit self-similarity within these ranges. However, the
velocity scale depends on eddy size, and follow the trends based on the scaling
arguments proposed by \cite{Perry1986}.

  domains through change-point testing",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The nucleus of eukaryotic cells spatially packages chromosomes
into a hierarchical and distinct segregation that plays critical roles in
maintaining transcription regulation. High-throughput methods of chromosome
conformation capture, such as Hi-C, have revealed topologically associating
domains (TADs) that are defined by biased chromatin interactions within them.
  Results: Here, we introduce a novel method, HiCKey, to decipher hierarchical
TAD structures in Hi-C data and compare them across samples. We first derive a
generalized likelihood-ratio (GLR) test for detecting change-points in an
interaction matrix that follows a negative binomial distribution or general
mixture distribution. We then employ several optimal search strategies to
decipher hierarchical TADs with p-values calculated by the GLR test.
Large-scale validations of simulation data show that HiCKey has good precision
in recalling known TADs and is robust against random collision noise of
chromatin interactions. By applying HiCKey to Hi-C data of seven human cell
lines, we identified multiple layers of TAD organization among them, but the
vast majority had no more than four layers. In particular, we found that TAD
boundaries are significantly enriched in active chromosomal regions compared to
repressed regions, indicating finer hierarchical architectures in active
regions for precise gene transcription regulation.
  Conclusions: HiCKey is optimized for processing large matrices constructed
from high-resolution Hi-C experiments. The method and theoretical result of the
GLR test provide a general framework for significance testing of similar
experimental chromatin interaction data that may not fully follow negative
binomial distributions but rather more general mixture distributions.

and bundle methods, as the most efficient methods in nonsmooth optimization, to
develop a robust method for solving unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization
problems. The main aim of the proposed method is to take advantage of both GS
and bundle methods, meanwhile avoiding their drawbacks. At each iteration of
this method, to find an efficient descent direction, the GS technique is
utilized for constructing a local polyhedral model for the objective function.
If necessary, via an iterative improvement process, this initial polyhedral
model is improved by some techniques inspired by the bundle and GS methods. The
convergence of the method is studied, which reveals the following positive
features (i) The convergence of our method is independent of the number of
gradient evaluations required to establish and improve the initial polyhedral
models. Thus, the presented method needs much fewer gradient evaluations in
comparison to the original GS method. (ii) As opposed to GS type methods, the
objective function need not be continuously differentiable on a full measure
open set in $\mathbb R^n$ to ensure the convergence for the class of convex
problems. Apart from the mentioned advantages, by means of numerical
simulations, we show that the presented method provides promising results in
comparison with GS methods, especially for large scale problems. Moreover, in
contrast with bundle methods, our method is not very sensitive to the accuracy
of supplied gradients.

integral over a closed curve, while in the integral, in addition to the vortex
electric field strength, a determinant of the metric tensor also appears.
Similarly, the magnetic flux is expressed by a surface integral from the
product of magnetic field induction by the determinant of the metric tensor. A
new physical quantity is introduced - the integral scalar potential, the rate
of change of which over time determines the flux of vector potential through a
closed surface. It is shown that the commonly used four-dimensional
Kelvin-Stokes theorem does not allow one to deduce fully the integral laws of
the electromagnetic field and in the covariant notation requires the addition
of determinant of the metric tensor, besides the validity of the Kelvin-Stokes
theorem is limited to the cases when determinant of metric tensor and the
contour area are independent from time. This disadvantage is not present in the
approach that uses the divergence theorem and equation for the dual
electromagnetic field tensor. A new effect is predicted, according to which the
circulation of magnetic field can appear even in the absence of electric
current and with a constant electric field through the contour, if the area of
this contour would change. By analogy with electromagnetic induction, for the
magnetic field circulation to appear it is important that electric field flux
that passes through the area of the contour would change over time.

  overlap with arXiv:1704.08740",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve
person-related attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that the
probability of an attribute to appear in an image is far from being uniform in
the spatial domain. We build our attribute prediction model jointly with a deep
semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by
the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to
the regions where different attributes naturally show up. Therefore, in
addition to prediction, we are able to localize the attributes despite merely
having access to image-level labels (weak supervision) during training. We
first propose semantic segmentation-based pooling and gating, respectively
denoted as SSP and SSG. In the former, the estimated segmentation masks are
used to pool the final activations of the attribute prediction network, from
multiple semantically homogeneous regions. In SSG, the same idea is applied to
the intermediate layers of the network. SSP and SSG, while effective, impose
heavy memory utilization since each channel of the activations is pooled/gated
with all the semantic segmentation masks. To circumvent this, we propose
Symbiotic Augmentation (SA), where we learn only one mask per activation
channel. SA allows the model to either pick one, or combine (weighted
superposition) multiple semantic maps, in order to generate the proper mask for
each channel. SA simultaneously applies the same mechanism to the reverse
problem by leveraging output logits of attribute prediction to guide the
semantic segmentation task. We evaluate our proposed methods for facial
attributes on CelebA and LFWA datasets, while benchmarking WIDER Attribute and
Berkeley Attributes of People for whole body attributes. Our proposed methods
achieve superior results compared to the previous works.

scheme for the \textit{load-modulated} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transmitters with central power amplifiers (CPA). However, it is difficult to
obtain the precise channel state information (CSI), and the traditional optimal
maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme incurs high complexity which increases
exponentially with the number of antennas and the number of bits carried per
antenna in the PMH modulation. To detect the PMH signals without knowing the
prior CSI, we first propose a signal detection scheme, termed as the
hypersphere clustering scheme based on the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm with maximum likelihood detection (HEM-ML). By leveraging machine
learning, the proposed detection scheme can accurately obtain information of
the channel from a few of the received symbols with little resource cost and
achieve comparable detection results as that of the optimal ML detector. To
further reduce the computational complexity in the ML detection in HEM-ML, we
also propose the second signal detection scheme, termed as the hypersphere
clustering scheme based on the EM algorithm with KD-tree detection (HEM-KD).
The CSI obtained from the EM algorithm is used to build a spatial KD-tree
receiver codebook and the signal detection problem can be transformed into a
nearest neighbor search (NNS) problem. The detection complexity of HEM-KD is
significantly reduced without any detection performance loss as compared to
HEM-ML. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed
detection schemes.

consists of a mentor model and a student model. Employing a mentor model
trained on a small portion of the labeled data and then feeding it only with
unlabeled data, we show how to obtain a (simplified) student model that reaches
the same accuracy and loss as the mentor model, on the same test set, without
using any of the original data labels in the training of the student model. Our
experiments demonstrate that even on challenging classification tasks the
student network architecture can be simplified significantly with a minor
influence on the performance, i.e., we need not even know the original network
architecture of the mentor. In addition, the time required for training the
student model to reach the mentor's performance level is shorter, as a result
of a simplified architecture and more available data. The proposed method
highlights the disadvantages of regular supervised training and demonstrates
the benefits of a less traditional training approach.

design is targeted at an Artix-7 Nexys 4 FPGA. The transmitters are accordingly
modulated by analog signals and fixed-point signals of different resolutions,

introduction of a modulating signal, we show that with a special detection

chaotic system. Furthermore, in order to ascertain the robustness of the
adaptive controller, the modulated signal is transmitted via an awgn channel
and the probability of error and bit-error-rate (BER) computed by sweeping
across sets of SNR and noise power values in a Monte Carlo simulation. It turns
out that the probabilities of error or error rates are reasonably low for
effective communication through mediums with certain noise conditions. Hence,
the adaptive controlled communication system can be robust.

continue to be addressed: a robot bypass with a generator of random bits of

devoted to bypassing the maze with a finite state machine with a random bit
generator. This task is part of the rapidly evolving theme of bypassing the
maze by various finite state machines. or their teams, which is closely related
to problems from the theory of computational complexity and probability theory.
In this paper, it is shown at what dimensions a robot with a random bit
generator and a stone can bypass integer space with a subspace of flags. In
this paper, we will study the behavior of a finite state machine with a random
bit generator on integer spaces. In particular, it was proved that the robot
bypasses $ \ zs ^ 2 $ and cannot bypass $ \ zs ^ 3 $; a robot with a stone
bypasses $ \ zs ^ 4 $ and cannot bypass $ \ zs ^ 5 $; a robot with a stone and

trajectory by the Earth's magnetic field. This measurement can be used to
correct for this effect and set proper electron bunch injection parameters. The
advanced wakefield experiment at CERN (AWAKE) relies on these measurements for

properties based on an input molecule $X$. The state-of-the-art approaches
partition the molecules into a large set of substructures $S$ and grow the new
molecule structure by iteratively predicting which substructure from $S$ to
add. However, since the set of available substructures $S$ is large, such an
iterative prediction task is often inaccurate especially for substructures that
are infrequent in the training data. To address this challenge, we propose a
new generating strategy called ""Copy & Refine"" (CORE), where at each step the
generator first decides whether to copy an existing substructure from input $X$
or to generate a new substructure, then the most promising substructure will be
added to the new molecule. Combining together with scaffolding tree generation
and adversarial training, CORE can significantly improve several latest
molecule optimization methods in various measures including drug likeness
(QED), dopamine receptor (DRD2) and penalized LogP. We tested CORE and
baselines using the ZINC database and CORE obtained up to 11% and 21%
relatively improvement over the baselines on success rate on the complete test
set and the subset with infrequent substructures, respectively.

topic of considerable interest over the past decades. Most of the studies so
far focused on reducing the visibility by reshaping the electromagnetic
scattering in the spatial domain. In fact, by manipulating the electromagnetic
scattering in the time domain, the visibility of an object can also be reduced.
Importantly, unlike previous studies on phase-switched screens and time-varying
metasurfaces, where the effect is narrow band due to the dispersive resonance,
for microwave frequency range, we introduce a broadband switchable metasurface
integrated with p-i-n diodes. The reflection phase of the metasurface can be
changed by approximately {\pi} over a fractional bandwidth of 76%. By
modulating the metasurface quasirandomly in the time domain, the incident
narrow-band signal is spread into a white-noiselike spectrum upon reflection,
creating a spectral camouflage. The broadband feature of the proposed
time-varying metasurface can provide practical insight for various
applications, including radar stealth and ultrawide-band wireless
communication.
