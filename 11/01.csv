two-scale kinematics and two-scale surface tension effects based on geometric
variables at small scale. At large scale, the flow and the full geometry of the
interface may be retrieved thanks to the bulk variables, while at small scale
the interface is accurately described by volume fraction, interfacial area
density and mean curvature, called the geometric variables. Our work mainly
relies on the Least Action Principle. The resulting system is an extension of a
previous work modeling small scale pulsation in which surface tension was not
taken into account at large or small scale. Whereas the original derivation
assumes a cloud of monodispersed spherical bubbles, the present context allows
for polydispersed, non-spherical bubbles. The resulting system of equations
solely involves small scale geometric variables, thus contributing in the
construction of a unified model describing both large and small scales.

  In a paper published in 1972 Hoare articulated the fundamental notions of
hiding invariants and simulations. Hiding: invariants on encapsulated data
representations need not be mentioned in specifications that comprise the API
of a module. Simulation: correctness of a new data representation and
implementation can be established by proving simulation between the old and new
implementations using a coupling relation defined on the encapsulated state.
These results were formalized semantically and for a simple model of state,
though the paper claimed this could be extended to encompass dynamically
allocated objects. In recent years, progress has been made towards formalizing
the claim, for simulation, though mainly in semantic developments. In this
article, hiding and simulation are combined with the idea in Hoare's 1969
paper: a logic of programs. For an object-based language with dynamic
allocation, we introduce a relational Hoare logic with stateful frame
conditions that formalizes encapsulation, hiding of invariants, and couplings
that relate two implementations. Relations and other assertions are expressed
in first-order logic. Specifications can express a wide range of relational
properties such as conditional equivalence and noninterference with
declassification. The proof rules facilitate relational reasoning by means of
convenient alignments and are shown sound with respect to a conventional
operational semantics. A derived proof rule for equivalence of linked programs
directly embodies representation independence. Applicability to representative
examples is demonstrated using an SMT-based implementation.

utility function that depends on their relative reputation and their costs for

growth of GaAs nanowires on epi-ready Si substrates by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
(MBE) are studied. The interaction of Ga nano-droplets (NDs) with the silica
overlayer is investigated by X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic
Force Microscopy (AFM). We show how Ga NDs drill the silica overlayer and make
contact with bulk Si to allow GaAs nanowires (NWs) epitaxial growth by studying
each of the three steps of the NW growth process sequentially: Ga NDs
pre-deposition, post-deposition annealing to reach the NW growth temperature,
and finally NW growth itself. The pre-deposition temperature allows to control
the density and morphology of the NDs. A high enough annealing temperature
enhances the reduction of SiOx by Ga oxidation and leads to the formation of
holes which is seen by a new component in XPS spectra, assumed to be the
consequence of the Ga-Si interaction. Finally, these nano-holes act as
nucleation sites for the epitaxial GaAs VLS growth. During the GaAs growth,
three different chemical environments of Ga are identified in Ga2p core level:
metallic Ga due to the droplets at the top of the NWs, Ga oxide in contact with
the SiOx overlayer and Ga arsenide from NWs.

network verification approaches have recently been proposed. However, these
approaches afford limited scalability, and applying them to large networks can
be challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enhance neural
network verification techniques by using over-approximation to reduce the size
of the network - thus making it more amenable to verification. We perform the
approximation such that if the property holds for the smaller (abstract)
network, it holds for the original as well. The over-approximation may be too
coarse, in which case the underlying verification tool might return a spurious
counterexample. Under such conditions, we perform counterexample-guided
refinement to adjust the approximation, and then repeat the process. Our
approach is orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing
verification techniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with the
recently proposed Marabou framework, and observe a significant improvement in
Marabou's performance. Our experiments demonstrate the great potential of our

an imaginary quadratic field F, and let P be a prime of F at which f is new.
Let K be a quadratic extension of F, and L(f/K,s) the L-function of the
base-change of f to K. Under certain hypotheses on f and K, the functional
equation of L(f/K,s) ensures that it vanishes at the central point. The
Bloch--Kato conjecture predicts that this should force the existence of
non-trivial classes in an appropriate global Selmer group attached to f and K.
In this paper, we use the theory of double integrals developed by Barrera
Salazar and the second author to construct certain P-adic Abel--Jacobi maps,
which we use to propose a construction of such classes via ""Stark--Heegner
cycles"". This builds on ideas of Darmon and in particular generalises an
approach of Rotger and Seveso in the setting of classical modular forms.

the energetics of the UFO to the observed multi-phase outflows at kiloparsec
scales yields an efficiency factor of $f\sim0.05$ for an energy-driven outflow.
Given the uncertainties, however, we cannot exclude the possibility of a
momentum-driven outflow. Comparing IRAS F05189-2524 with nine other objects

that the small dependence of certain ratios on the latter allows for a direct
comparison with lattice QCD results, provided that the same cuts are applied to
all hadronic species. Finally, we perform a comparison for the constructed
quantities for experimentally available measurements from the STAR
Collaboration. Thus, we estimate the chemical freeze-out temperature to 165 MeV

use of the Hadron Resonance Gas, thus, further lattice studies are necessary to

studying only quantities at mid-rapidity. We explore an extension to 3
dimensions, in order to determine whether a similar understanding can be
obtained for the rapidity dependence of the collision system. In particular, we
introduce rapidity-dependent eccentricities and investigate a trivial extension
of the 2D eccentricity scaling of elliptic and triangular flow, as well as a
way to systematically improve these initial-state estimators. We then explore
the dependence of the resulting response coefficients on shear viscosity and

We use these data to derive the electron temperatures and metallicities for

nitrogen) are the dominant cooling mechanism in HII regions, the nebular
metallicity can be inferred from the electron temperature. Including previous

temperature and either parallax or kinematic distance determinations. The
interferometric electron temperatures are systematically 10% larger than those
found in previous single dish studies, likely due to incorrect data analysis

the interferometer. By combining the interferometer and single dish samples, we
find an oxygen abundance gradient across the Milky Way disk with a slope of
-0.052 +/- 0.004 dex/kpc. We also find significant azimuthal structure in the
metallicity distribution. The slope of the oxygen gradient varies by a factor
of ~2 when Galactocentric azimuths near 30 deg are compared with those near 100

relevant positivity conditions are trivialized, then the all-loop consistency
requires that we get lower loop amplituhedra as ""residues"". These decoupling
relations connect higher loop DCI integrals with the lower ones, enabling us to
identify their coefficients starting from the 3-loop case. And surprisingly,
the delicate mechanism of this process is the simple Mondrian rule D=X+Y, which
forces those visually non-Mondrian DCI integrals to have the correct

  Simulations: Efficient Dynamics of Ions near Polarizable Nanoparticles","16 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulating the dynamics of ions near polarizable nanoparticles (NPs) using
coarse-grained models is extremely challenging due to the need to solve the
Poisson equation at every simulation timestep. Recently, a molecular dynamics
(MD) method based on a dynamical optimization framework bypassed this obstacle
by representing the polarization charge density as virtual dynamic variables,
and evolving them in parallel with the physical dynamics of ions. We highlight
the computational gains accessible with the integration of machine learning
(ML) methods for parameter prediction in MD simulations by demonstrating how
they were realized in MD simulations of ions near polarizable NPs. An
artificial neural network based regression model was integrated with MD
simulation and predicted the optimal simulation timestep and optimization
parameters characterizing the virtual system with $94.3\%$ success. The
ML-enabled auto-tuning of parameters generated accurate dynamics of ions for
$\approx 10$ million steps while improving the stability of the simulation by
over an order of magnitude. The integration of ML-enhanced framework with
hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization techniques reduced the computational time of
simulating systems with thousands of ions and induced charges from thousands of
hours to tens of hours, yielding a maximum speedup of $\approx 3$ from ML-only
acceleration and a maximum speedup of $\approx 600$ from the combination of ML
and parallel computing methods. Extraction of ionic structure in concentrated
electrolytes near oil-water emulsions demonstrates the success of the method.
The approach can be generalized to select optimal parameters in other MD
applications and energy minimization problems.

longitudinal spin susceptibility of the $t$-$t'$-Rashba-Hubbard model on the
square lattice. The combined effect of the second-neighbor hopping $t'$ and the
spin-orbit coupling leads to ferromagnetic fluctuations in a broad filling
region. The spin-orbit coupling splits the energy bands, leading to two van
Hove fillings, where the sheets of the Fermi surface change their topology.
Between these two van Hove fillings the model shows ferromagnetic fluctuations.
We find that these ferromagnetic fluctuations originate from interband
contributions to the spin susceptibility. These interband contributions only
arise if there is one holelike and one electronlike Fermi surface, which is the
case for fillings in between the two van Hove fillings. We discuss implications
for experimental systems and propose a test on how to identify these types of
ferromagnetic fluctuations in experiments.

The success of such electrodes strongly depends on the implementation of
effective production and processing methods for graphene. In this work, we take
advantage of two different graphene production methods to design an advanced,
conductive oxide- and platinum-free, graphene-based counter electrode for
dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In particular, we exploit the combination
of a graphene film, produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (CVD-graphene),
with few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes, produced by liquid phase exfoliation. The
CVD-graphene is used as charge collector, while the FLG flakes, deposited atop
by spray coating, act as catalyst for the reduction of the electrolyte redox
couple (i.e., I3-/I-- and Co+2/+3). The as-produced counter electrodes are
tested in both I3-/I-- and Co+2/+3-based semitransparent DSSCs, showing power
conversion efficiencies of 2.1% and 5.09%, respectively, under 1 SUN
illumination. At 0.1 SUN, Co+2/+3-based DSSCs achieve a power conversion

become increasingly under control, magnetic analogs are still largely
unexplored territories with novel rich structures. In particular, topological
magnetic insulators can also host a quantized axion term in the presence of
lattice symmetries. Since these symmetries are naturally broken on the

In this work, we combine theoretical analysis, density functional calculations
and experimental evidence to reveal intrinsic axion insulating behavior in
MnBi6Te10. The quantized axion term arises from the simplest possible mechanism
in the antiferromagnetic regime where it is protected by inversion symmetry and
a fractional translation symmetry. The anticipated gapping of the Dirac surface

for image generation, recovery, and restoration. A major contributing factor to
this success is that convolutional networks impose strong prior assumptions
about natural images. A surprising experiment that highlights this
architectural bias towards natural images is that one can remove noise and
corruptions from a natural image without using any training data, by simply
fitting (via gradient descent) a randomly initialized, over-parameterized
convolutional generator to the corrupted image. While this over-parameterized
network can fit the corrupted image perfectly, surprisingly after a few
iterations of gradient descent it generates an almost uncorrupted image. This
intriguing phenomenon enables state-of-the-art CNN-based denoising and
regularization of other inverse problems. In this paper, we attribute this
effect to a particular architectural choice of convolutional networks, namely

appropriate properties of a suitable homogeneous norm. We also use this idea to
extend to Carnot groups the definition of generalised flow, and it works
similarly to the euclidian setting. These results simplify the handling of the
singularities of the equation, for instance to study the asymptotic behaviour

realise trion-polaritons exhibiting significant energy shifts at very small

trion-polariton nonlinearity is found to be 10 to 1000 larger than in other
polariton systems, including neutral exciton-polaritons in TMDCs. Furthermore
it exceeds by factors of $\sim 10^3-10^5$ the magnitude of Kerr nonlinearity in
bare TMDCs, graphene and other widely used optical materials (e.g. Si, AlGaAs

physiological consequences. While the basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis

circumvent this issue, here we present a study of developing Vibrio cholerae
biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological
patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are
initially flat, but later experience a mechanical instability and become
wrinkled. Whereas the peripheral region develops ordered radial stripes, the
central region acquires a zigzag herringbone-like wrinkle pattern. Depending on
the agar concentration, the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral
region and propagate inward (low agar concentration) or in the central region
and propagate outward (high agar concentration). To understand these
experimental observations, we developed a model that considers diffusion of
nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix
production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the agar, and the
friction between them. Our model demonstrates that depletion of nutrients
beneath the central region of the biofilm results in radially-dependent growth
profiles, which in turn, produce anisotropic stresses that dictate the
morphology of wrinkles. Furthermore, we predict that increasing surface
friction (agar concentration) reduces stress anisotropy and shifts the location
of the maximum compressive stress, where the wrinkling instability first
occurs, toward the center of the biofilm, in agreement with our experimental
observations. Our results are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with
similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms
form distinct wrinkle patterns.

complexity-theoretic perspective. Specifically we give evidence for the
existence of computationally pseudorandom states in the CFT, and argue that
wormhole volume is measureable in a non-physical but computational sense, by
amalgamating the experiences of multiple observers in the wormhole. In other
words the conjecture equates a quantity which is difficult to compute with one
which is easy to compute. The pseudorandomness argument further implies that
this is a necessary feature of any resolution of the wormhole growth paradox,
not just of Susskind's Complexity=Volume conjecture. As a corollary we conclude
that either the AdS/CFT dictionary map must be exponentially complex, or the

applications in the natural and engineering sciences. From a modeling point of
view the Gaussian setting may be too restrictive, since applications in
mathematical finance and phenomena such as porous media or pollution models
indicate an influence of noise of a different nature. In order to capture
temporal discontinuities and allow for heavy-tailed distributions, Hilbert
space-valued L\'evy processes (or L\'evy fields) as driving noise terms are
considered. The numerical discretization of the corresponding SPDE involves
several difficulties: Low spatial and temporal regularity of the solution to
the problem entails slow convergence rates and instabilities for
space/time-discretization schemes. Furthermore, the L\'evy process admits
values in a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, hence projections onto
a finite-dimensional subspace for each discrete point in time are necessary.
Finally, unbiased sampling from the resulting L\'evy field may not be possible.
We introduce a novel fully discrete approximation scheme that addresses all of
these aspects. Our central contribution is a novel discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin scheme for the spatial approximation that naturally arises from
the weak formulation of the SPDE. We prove optimal convergence of this approach
and couple it with a suitable time stepping scheme to avoid numerical
oscillations. Moreover, we approximate the driving noise process by truncated
Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansions. The latter essentially yields a sum of scaled and
uncorrelated one-dimensional L\'evy processes, which may be simulated with
controlled bias by Fourier inversion techniques.

different definition: consider all chains of subspaces of G and take the least
upper bound of their lengths as the rank of G. If G is finitely generated then
these two definitions yield the same number. On the other hand, as we shall
show in this paper, if infinitely many points are needed to generate G then the
rank as defined in the latter way is often (perhaps always) larger than the

accordingly discard the second one or modify it. We can modify it as follows:
consider only well ordered chains instead of arbitrary chains. As we shall
prove, the least upper bound of the lengths of well ordered chains of subspaces
is indeed equal to the generating rank. According to this result, the (possibly

enriched SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with a theta term at $\theta=\pi$ in $(3+1)$d.
Due to a mixed anomaly between time reversal symmetry and the center symmetry,
the low energy dynamics must be nontrivial. We focus on two possible scenarios:
1) time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken by the two confining vacua,
and 2) the low energy theory is described by a U(1) Maxwell gauge theory (e.g.
U(1) spin liquid in condensed matter) which is deconfined and gapless while
preserving time reversal symmetry. In the first scenario, we first identify the
global symmetry on the time reversal domain wall, where time reversal symmetry
in the bulk induces a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ unitary symmetry on the domain wall. We
discuss how the Lorentz symmetry and the unitary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enrich
the domain wall theory. In the second scenario, we relate the symmetry
enrichments of the SU(2) Yang-Mills to that of the U(1) Maxwell gauge theory.
This further opens up the possibility that SU(2) QCD with large and odd flavors
of fermions could be a direct second order phase transition between two phases
of U(1) gauge theories as well as between a U(1) gauge theory and a trivial
vacuum (e.g. a trivial paramagnet), where the gauge group is enhanced to be
non-Abelian at and only at the transition. We characterize these transitions,
and name them as Gauge Enhanced Quantum Critical Points.

of the lowest mass and metal-poorest known ($M_{\star} \simeq 1.16{\times}10^9
M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $\simeq {-}1.2$) $-$ indicating a relatively quiet prior
accretion history. Yet, our global halo census finds that tidally unbound
material from M82 and NGC 3077 provides a substantial infusion of metal-rich
material ($M_{\star} \simeq 5.4{\times}10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $\simeq
{-}$0.9). We further show that, following the accretion of its massive
satellite M82 (and the LMC-like NGC 3077), M81 will host one of the most
massive and metal-rich stellar halos in the nearby universe. Thus, the saga of
M81: following a passive history, M81's merger with M82 will completely
transform its halo from a low-mass, anemic halo rivaling the MW, to a
metal-rich behemoth rivaled only by systems such as M31. This dramatic
transformation indicates that the observed diversity in stellar halo properties
is primarily driven by diversity in the largest mergers these galaxies have
experienced.

  introduction, removed unnecessary hypotheses",,,,"math.GT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  This paper is the third in a sequence establishing a dictionary between the
combinatorics of veering triangulations equipped with appropriate filling
slopes, and the dynamics of pseudo-Anosov flows (without perfect fits) on
closed three-manifolds.
  Our motivation comes from the work of Agol and Gu\'eritaud. Agol introduced
veering triangulations of mapping tori as a tool for understanding the surgery
parents of pseudo-Anosov mapping tori. Gu\'eritaud gave a new construction of
veering triangulations of mapping tori using the orbit spaces of their
suspension flows. Generalizing this, Agol and Gu\'eritaud announced a method
that, given a closed manifold with a pseudo-Anosov flow (without perfect fits),
produces a veering triangulation equipped with filling slopes.
  In this paper we build, from a veering triangulation, a canonical circular
order on the cusps of the universal cover. Using this we build the veering
circle and the link space. These are the first entries in the promised
dictionary. The latter corresponds to the orbit space of a flow; the former
corresponds to Fenley's boundary at infinity of the orbit space.
  In the other direction, and using our previous work, we prove that the
veering triangulation is recovered (up to canonical isomorphism) from the
dynamics of the fundamental group acting on the link space. This is the first
step in proving that our dictionary gives a bijection between the two theories.

this broken symmetry state are a charge transfer excitonic insulator and a

${\sim}$200-1400 UDGs inside the virial radius ($R_{200}$), consistent with the
UDG abundance halo-mass relation found in the local universe, and suggests that
UDGs may be formed in clusters. Within each cluster, however, we find that UDGs
are not evenly distributed. Instead their projected spatial distributions are
lopsided, and they are deficient in the regions of highest mass density as
traced by gravitational lensing. While the deficiency of UDGs in central
regions is not surprising, the lopsidedness is puzzling. The UDGs, and their
lopsided spatial distributions, may be associated with known substructures late
in their infall into the clusters, meaning that we find evidence both for
formation of UDGs in clusters and for UDGs falling into clusters. We also
investigate the ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) residing in the clusters, and find
the spatial distributions of UDGs and UCDs appear anti-correlated. Around 15%
of UDGs exhibit either compact nuclei or nearby point sources. Taken together,
these observations provide additional evidence for a picture in which at least
some UDGs are destroyed in dense cluster environments and leave behind a
residue of UCDs.

shock acceleration close to the Bohm limit. Provided that protons are

strength of the Balmer jump in hydrogen-atmosphere DA white dwarfs to separate
them from helium-dominated objects in SDSS colour space. Across the effective
temperature range from 20000K to 9000K we find that 22% of white dwarfs will
undergo a spectral change, with no spectral evolution being ruled out at
5$\sigma$. The most likely explanation is that the increase in He-rich objects
is caused by the convective mixing of DA stars with thin hydrogen layers, in
which helium is dredged up from deeper layers by a surface hydrogen convection
zone. The rate of change in the fraction of He-rich objects as a function of
temperature, coupled with a recent grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations of convective DA white dwarfs - which include the full overshoot
region - lead to a discussion on the distribution of total hydrogen mass in
white dwarfs. We find that 60% of white dwarfs must have a hydrogen mass larger
than $M_{\rm H}/M_{\rm WD} = 10^{-10}$, another 25% have masses in the range
$M_{\rm H}/M_{\rm WD} = 10^{-14}-10^{-10}$, and 15% have less hydrogen than

characteristic funnel shape, formed by a highly collimated filamentary emission
at the base, likely tracing the jet propagation through a tenuous medium, until
a bifurcation point at $440\, \rm{pc}$ where the jet hits a dense molecular
core and shatters, dispersing the molecular gas into several clumps and
filaments within the expansion cone. We also trace the jet in ionised gas
within the inner $\lesssim 340\, \rm{pc}$ using the [NeII]$_{\rm 12.8 \mu m}$
line emission, where the molecular gas follows a circular rotation pattern. The
wind outflow carries a mass of $\sim 8 \times 10^6\, \rm{M_\odot}$ at an
average wind projected speed of $\sim 160\, \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which implies a
mass outflow rate of $\sim 14\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. Based on the structure
of the outflow and the budget of energy and momentum, we discard radiation
pressure from the active nucleus, star formation, and supernovae as possible
launching mechanisms. ESO 420-G13 is the second case after NGC 1377 where the
presence of a previously unknown jet is revealed due to its interaction with
the interstellar medium, suggesting that unknown jets in feeble radio nuclei
might be more common than expected. Two possible jet-cloud configurations are
discussed to explain the presence of an outflow at such distance from the AGN.
The outflowing gas will likely not escape, thus a delay in the star formation
rather than quenching is expected from this interaction, while the feedback
effect would be confined within the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy.

XRGs possess slightly less massive central black holes than the normal radio

systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion and additional
Alfv\'en-wave cooling affect the galactic disc and the circum-galactic medium
(CGM). Global properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary
little between simulations with and without various CR transport physics,
whereas structural properties such as disc sizes, CGM densities or temperatures
can be strongly affected. In our simulations, CRs affect the accretion of gas
onto galaxies by modifying the CGM flow structure. This alters the angular
momentum distribution which manifests itself as a difference in stellar and
gaseous disc size. The strength of this effect depends on the CR transport
model: CR advection results in the most compact discs while the Alfv\'en-wave
model resembles more the AURIGA model. The advection and diffusion models
exhibit large ($r\sim50$ kpc) CR pressure-dominated gas haloes causing a
smoother and partly cooler CGM. The additional CR pressure smoothes small-scale
density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower
CGM temperatures. In contrast, the Alfv\'en-wave model is only CR pressure
dominated at the disc-halo interface and only in this model the gamma-ray
emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations. In contrast to

($\sigma$)--star formation rate (SFR) relation in the FIRE-2 (Feedback in
Realistic Environments) cosmological simulations. We specifically focus on
Milky Way mass disk galaxies at late times. In agreement with observations, we
find a relatively flat relationship, with $\sigma \approx 15-30$ km/s in
neutral gas across 3 dex in SFRs. We show that higher dense gas fractions
(ratios of dense gas to neutral gas) and SFRs are correlated at constant
$\sigma$. Similarly, lower gas fractions (ratios of gas to stellar mass) are
correlated with higher $\sigma$ at constant SFR. The limits of the
$\sigma$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation correspond to the onset of strong
outflows. We see evidence of ""on-off"" cycles of star formation in the
simulations, corresponding to feedback injection timescales of 10-100 Myr,
where SFRs oscillate about equilibrium SFR predictions. Finally, SFRs and
velocity dispersions in the simulations agree well with feedback-regulated and
marginally stable gas disk (Toomre's $Q =1$) model predictions, and the data
effectively rule out models assuming that gas turns into stars at (low)
constant efficiency (i.e., ${\rm 1\%}$ per free-fall time). And although the
simulation data do not entirely exclude gas accretion/gravitationally powered
turbulence as a driver of $\sigma$, it appears to be strongly subdominant to
stellar feedback in the simulated galaxy disks.

observing the Ly$\alpha$, forest towards densely-sampled lines-of-sight of
bright background sources, such as quasars and star forming galaxies. We
investigate the scientific potential of MOSAIC, a planned multi-object
spectrograph on the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), for the 3D

\lesssim 4$ galaxies down to a limiting magnitude of $m_{r}\sim 25.5$ mag in an
area of 1 degree$^2$ in the sky. Galaxies and their spectra (including the
line-of-sight Ly$\alpha$ absorption) are taken from the lightcone extracted
from the Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. The quality of the
reconstruction of the original density field is studied for different spectral
resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra. We demonstrate that the
minimum $S/N$ (per resolution element) of the faintest galaxies that such
survey has to reach is $S/N = 4$. We show that a survey with such sensitivity
enables a robust extraction of cosmic filaments and the detection of the
theoretically-predicted galaxy stellar mass and star-formation rate gradients
towards filaments. By simulating the realistic performance of MOSAIC we obtain
$S/N(T_{\rm obs}, R, m_{r})$ scaling relations. We estimate that $\lesssim
35~(65)$ nights of observation time are required to carry out the survey with
the instrument's high multiplex mode and with the spectral resolution of
$R=1000~(2000)$. A survey with a MOSAIC-concept instrument on the ELT is found
to enable the mapping of the IGM at $z > 3$ on Mpc scales, and as such will be
complementary to and competitive with other planned IGM tomography surveys.

arguably the most ubiquitous many-body effect. The associated Fermi surface
(FS) has broad implications for physical phenomena, ranging from
electromagnetic responses to entanglement entropy (EE) area law violations.
Given recent fruitful studies in condensed-matter physics under effectively
non-Hermitian descriptions, it becomes urgent to study how QDP and many-body
interactions interplay with non-Hermitian effects. Through a prototypical
critical 1D fermionic lattice with asymmetric gain/loss, a real space FS is
shown to naturally emerge, in addition to any existing momentum space FS. We
also carefully characterize such real space FS with the EE, via a renormalized
temperature that encapsulates the interplay of thermal excitations and
non-Hermiticity. Nearest neighbor repulsion is also found to induce competing
charge density wave (CDW) that may erode the real space FS. The underlying
physics surrounding criticality and localization is further analyzed with
complex flux spectral flows. Our findings can be experimentally demonstrated
with ultracold fermions in a suitably designed optical lattice.

radio luminosity, radio-IR galaxies are split into: galaxies that host either
high or low f$_{\text{AGN}}$ AGN (high-/low-f$_{\text{AGN}}$), and star forming
galaxies with little to no AGN activity (SFGs). We study the colour, stellar
mass, radio luminosity, L$_{\text{AGN}}$ and SFR properties of the three
radio-IR sub-samples, comparing to a spec-IR sample drawn from
spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies that are also detected in MIR. No
significant difference between radio luminosity of these sub-samples was found,
which could be due to the combined contribution of radio emission from AGN and
star formation. We find a positive relationship between L$_{\text{AGN}}$and
specific SFR (sSFR) for both AGN sub-samples, strongly suggesting a
co-evolution scenario of AGN and SF in these galaxies. A toy model is designed
to demonstrate this co-evolution scenario, where we find that, in almost all

of AGN quenching. The environmental preference for intermediate/infall regions
of clusters/groups remains across the co-evolution scenario, which suggests
that galaxies might be in an orbital motion around the cluster/group during the

on all observations and actions. The critic input concatenates agent

our model to scale to 30 times more agents and to achieve improvements of test

constraint on CO luminosity functions (LFs) in this redshift range via a direct
measurement of their second moments in the three-dimensional (3D) auto-power
spectrum, finding a total CO shot noise power
$P_{\textrm{CO,CO}}(k_{\textrm{CO(2-1)}}) \leq 1.9\times10^2$ $\mu$K$^2$ (Mpc

ASPECS CO LFs in Decarli et al. 2019, but rules out a large space in the range
of $P_{\textrm{CO,CO}}(k_{\textrm{CO(2-1)}})$ inferred from these LFs, which we
attribute primarily to large uncertainties in the normalization $\Phi_*$ and
knee $L_*$ of the Schechter-form CO LFs at $z > 2$. Also, through power
spectrum analyses of ASPECS LP data with 415 positions from galaxies with
available optical spectroscopic redshifts, we find that contributions to the
observed mean CO intensity and shot noise power of MUSE galaxies are largely
accounted for by ASPECS blind detections, though there are $\sim20$%
contributions to the CO(2-1) mean intensity due to sources previously
undetected in the blind line search. Finally, we sum the fluxes from individual
blind CO detections to yield a lower limit on the mean CO surface brightness at

components dusty plasma system containing inertialess electrons featuring
non-thermal non-extensive distribution as well as inertial warm ions and
negative dust grains. A nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE), which
governs the conditions of the modulational instability (MI) of DIA waves
(DIAWs), is obtained by using the reductive perturbation method. It has been
observed from the numerical analysis of NLSE that the plasma system supports
both modulationally stable domain in which dispersive and nonlinear
coefficients of the NLSE have same sign and unstable domain in which dispersive
and nonlinear coefficients of the NLSE have opposite sign, and also supports
the DIARWs only in the unstable domain. It is also observed that the basic
features (viz. stability of the DIAWs, MI, growth rate, amplitude, and width of
the DIARWs, etc.) are significantly modified by the related plasma parameters
(viz. dust charge state, number density of electron and ion, non-extensive
parameter q, and non-thermal parameter $\alpha$, etc.). The present study is
useful for understanding the mechanism of the formation of DIARWs in the
laboratory and space environments where inertialess mixed distributed electrons
can exist with inertial ions and dust grains.

users that often comes at the expense of a significant drop in utility. The
classical definition of LDP assumes that all elements in the data domain are

application's context into the privacy definition. For binary data domains, we
provide a universally optimal privatization scheme and highlight its
connections to Warner's randomized response (RR) and Mangat's improved

data domains, we consider two special cases of context-aware LDP:
block-structured LDP and high-low LDP. We study discrete distribution
estimation and provide communication-efficient, sample-optimal schemes and
information-theoretic lower bounds for both models. We show that using
contextual information can require fewer samples than classical LDP to achieve
the same accuracy.

bridge this research gap, this paper proposes a novel technique that
appropriately incorporates the robust weight total least squares (RWTLS) and
the full information maximum likelihood optimal estimation (FIMLOE) to improve
the positioning accuracy of the MLS system under GPS-denied environment. First
of all, the coordinate transformation relationship and the observation

is used to correct the 3D point observation model; then the uncertainty
propagation parameter vector and the boresight alignment errors between the
laser scanner frame and the IMU frame are calibrated by FIMLOE. Lastly,
experimental investigation in indoor scenarios was performed to evaluate the

function at finite volume is proportional to a polynomial of the fugacity
$e^{\mu/T}$. The zero of this Lee-Yang polynomial closest to the origin
determines the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the pressure
around $\mu=0$. The computationally cheapest formulation of lattice QCD, rooted
staggered fermions, with the usual definition of the rooted determinant, does
not admit such a Lee-Yang polynomial. We argue that the radius of convergence
is then bounded by the spectral gap of the reduced matrix of the unrooted
staggered operator. This is a cutoff effect that potentially affects all
estimates of the radius of convergence with the standard staggered rooting. We
suggest a new definition of the rooted staggered determinant at finite chemical
potential that allows for a definition of a Lee-Yang polynomial, and, therefore
of the numerical study of Lee-Yang zeros. We also describe an algorithm to
determine the Lee-Yang zeros and apply it to configurations generated with the
2-stout improved staggered action at $N_t = 4$. We perform a finite-volume
scaling study of the leading Lee-Yang zeros and estimate the radius of
convergence of the Taylor expansion extrapolated to an infinite volume. We show
that the limiting singularity is not on the real line, thus giving a lower
bound on the location of any possible phase transitions at this lattice
spacing. In the vicinity of the crossover temperature at zero chemical
potential, the radius of convergence turns out to be $\mu_B/T \approx 2$ and
roughly temperature independent. Our simulations are performed at strange quark

for field theories with interactions, the CPT-odd one violates causality and
unitarity. This feature is a consequence of the vacuum birefringence

Cycle 5, GO-5829 (Feldman (1995)) acquired on UT 1996 March 11.3 and 12.1,
which serendipitously imaged the Centaur shortly after a major outburst. A
multi-component coma was detected consisting of: an expanding outburst dust
coma with complex morphology possessing an east-west asymmetry and north-south
symmetry contained within 5$''$ ($\sim$19,000 km) of the nucleus, the residual
dust shell of an earlier UT 1996 February outburst, and a nearly circular
underlying quiescent activity level coma detectable to $\sim$70$''$
($\sim$267,000 km) away from the nucleus. Photometry of the calibrated WFPC2
images resulted in a measured 5$''$ radius aperture equivalent R-band magnitude
of 12.86 $\pm$ 0.02 and an estimated (2.79 $\pm$ 0.05)$\times 10^8$ kg for the
lower limit of dust material emitted during the outburst. No appreciable
evolution of morphologic features, indicating signatures of nucleus rotation,
were detected between the two imaging epochs. The observations were modeled
using a 3-D Monte Carlo coma model (Samarasinha (2000)) to place constraints on
the nucleus' rotation state. Modeling indicated the morphology is
representative of a non-isotropic ejection of dust emitted during a single
outburst event with a duration on the order of hours from a single source
region corresponding to $\sim$1\% of the surface area. A spin period with lower
limit on the order of days is suggested to reproduce the coma morphology seen

through under an applied pressure difference. One side-effect of this applied
pressure, however, is that it compresses the filter. This changes the
permeability, which may affect its performance. As the applied pressure
increases the flux of fluid processed by the filter will also increase but the
permeability will decrease. Eventually the permeability reaches zero at a point
in the filter and the fluid flux falls to zero. In this paper we derive a model
for the fluid transport through a filter due to an applied pressure difference
and the resulting compression. We use this to determine the maximum operating
flux that can be achieved without the permeability reaching zero and the filter
shutting down. We determine the material properties that balance the desire to
maximize flux while minimizing power use. We also show how choosing an initial
spatially dependent permeability can lead to a uniformly permeable filter under
operation and we find the permeability distribution that maximizes the flux for
a given applied pressure, both of which have desirable industrial implications.

connections among neurons and by pruning others. The so-called neural or brain
plasticity facilitates the modification of brain structure and function over
different time scales. Plasticity might occur due to external stimuli received
from the environment, during recovery from brain injury, or due to
modifications within the body and brain itself. In this paper, we study the
combined effect of short-term (STP) and spike-timing-dependent plasticities
(STDP) on the synaptic strength of excitatory coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons
and show that plasticity can facilitate the formation of modular neural
networks with complex topologies that resemble those of networks with
preferential attachment properties. In particular, we use an STDP rule that
alters the synaptic coupling intensity based on time intervals between spikes
of postsynaptic and presynaptic neurons. Previous works have shown that STDP
may induce the appearance of directed connections from high to low-frequency
spiking neurons. On the other hand, STP is attributed to the release of
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft of neurons that alter its synaptic
efficiency. Our results suggest that the combined effect of STP and STDP with
high recovery time facilitates the formation of connections among neurons with
similar spike frequencies only, a kind of preferential attachment. We then
pursue this further and show that, when starting with all-to-all neural
configurations, depending on the STP recovery time and distribution of neural
frequencies, modular neural networks can emerge as a direct result of the
combined effect of STP and STDP.

features in the inflaton potential. A bump-like feature behaves like a local
speed-breaker and lowers the speed of the scalar field, thereby locally
enhancing the scalar power spectrum. A bump-like feature emerges naturally if
the base inflaton potential $V_b(\phi)$ contains a local correction term such
as $V_b(\phi)\left[1+\varepsilon(\phi)\right]$ at $\phi=\phi_0$. The presence
of such a localised correction term at $\phi_0$ leads to a large peak in the
curvature power spectrum and to an enhanced probability of black hole
formation. Remarkably this does not significantly affect the scalar spectral
index $n_{_S}$ and tensor to scalar ratio $r$ on CMB scales. Consequently such
models can produce higher mass primordial black holes ($M_{\rm PBH}\geq 1
M_{\odot}$) in contrast to models with `near inflection-point potentials' in
which generating higher mass black holes severely affects $n_{_S}$ and $r$.
With a suitable choice of the base potential - such as the string theory based
(KKLT) inflation or the $\alpha$-attractor models - the amplification of
primordial scalar power spectrum can be as large as $10^7$ which leads to a
significant contribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) to the dark matter
density today, $f_{\rm PBH} = \Omega_{0,\rm PBH}/\Omega_{0,\rm DM} \sim O(1)$.
Interestingly, our results remain valid if the bump is replaced by a dip. In
this case the base inflaton potential $V_b(\phi)$ contains a negative local
correction term such as $V_b(\phi)\left[1-\varepsilon(\phi)\right]$ at
$\phi=\phi_0$ which leads to an enhanced probability of PBH formation. We
conclude that primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-17} M_{\odot} \leq
M_{\rm PBH} \leq 100\, M_{\odot}$ can easily form in single field inflation in
the presence of small bump-like and dip-like features in the inflaton
potential.

first-principles simulations of pulsar magnetospheres using Particle-in-Cell

creation through photon-photon collision at the light cylinder is required to
sustain the pulsar engine. However, for many rotation-powered pulsars pair
creation operates effectively only near the stellar surface where magnetic
field is high. How these ""weak pulsars"" fill their magnetospheres without
efficient photon-photon pair conversion in the outer magnetosphere is still an
open question. In this paper, we present a range of self-consistent solutions
to the pulsar magnetosphere that do not require pair production near the light
cylinder. When pair production is very efficient near the star, the pulsar
magnetosphere converges to previously-reported solutions. However, in the
intermediate regime where pair supply is barely enough to sustain the
magnetospheric current, we observe a time-dependent solution with quasi-period
about half of the rotation period. This new quasi-periodic solution may explain
the observed pulsar death line without invoking multipolar components near the
star, and can potentially explain the core vs. conal emission patterns observed
in pulsar radio signals.

show that the number of distinct eigenvectors that appear in \,(\ref{SSA})\, is
equal to the rank of $W^{S}.$ Several theorems can be derived from this result.
We show that $W^{S}$ determines the adjacency matrix of $G$ if $W^{S}$ has rank

social network alignment. Hence, we for the first time propose to study the
problem of aligning dynamic social networks. Towards this end, we propose a
novel Dynamic social Network Alignment (DNA) framework, a unified optimization
approach over deep neural architectures, to unfold the fruitful dynamics to
perform alignment. However, it faces tremendous challenges in both modeling and
optimization: (1) To model the intra-network dynamics, we explore the local
dynamics of the latent pattern in friending evolvement and the global
consistency of the representation similarity with neighbors. We design a novel
deep neural architecture to obtain the dual embedding capturing local dynamics
and global consistency for each user. (2) To model the inter-network alignment,
we exploit the underlying identity of an individual from the dual embedding in
each dynamic social network. We design a unified optimization approach
interplaying proposed deep neural architectures to construct a common subspace
of identity embeddings. (3) To address this optimization problem, we design an
effective alternating algorithm with solid theoretical guarantees.We conduct
extensive experiments on real-world datasets and show that the proposed DNA
framework substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

alternative approach which focuses instead on label quality by characterizing
and identifying label errors in datasets, based on the principles of pruning
noisy data, counting with probabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and
ranking examples to train with confidence. Whereas numerous studies have
developed these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on
the assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the
joint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown)
labels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and
experimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly
finds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive
approaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the
CL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use
CL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and
improve sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews). We also
employ CL on ImageNet to quantify ontological class overlap (e.g., estimating
645 ""missile"" images are mislabeled as their parent class ""projectile""), and
moderately increase model accuracy (e.g., for ResNet) by cleaning data prior to
training. These results are replicable using the open-source cleanlab release.

charge - they engender a spin memory phenomenon, generated by the
nonequilibrium charge currents controlled by localized spins. The negative
magnetoresistance (MR) in the extensive spin-memory phase space is isotropic.

follows the predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices.
However, the randomness decreases when the brain is engaged in attending to
painful inputs in patients suffering with early stages of back pain. A
persistence of this pattern is observed in the patients that develop chronic

randomness no longer varies with the pain task. The study demonstrates the

in granular environments. We use a fluidized bed to prepare GM with a desired
global packing fraction, and use empirical force measurements and the Discrete
Element Method (DEM) to elucidate interaction mechanics during
locomotion-relevant intrusions in GM such as vertical penetration and
horizontal drag. We develop a resistive force theory (RFT) to account for more
complex intrusions. We use these force models to understand the locomotor
performance of two bio-inspired robots moving on and within GM.

between pairs of actors. Regression models of such data allow for the
estimation of effects of exogenous covariates on the network and for prediction
of unobserved data. Ideally, estimators of the regression parameters should
account for the inherent dependencies among relations in the network that
involve the same actor. To account for such dependencies, researchers have
developed a host of latent variable network models, however, estimation of many
latent variable network models is computationally onerous and which model is
best to base inference upon may not be clear. We propose the Probit
Exchangeable (PX) model for undirected binary network data that is based on an
assumption of exchangeability, which is common to many of the latent variable
network models in the literature. The PX model can represent the first two
moments of any exchangeable network model. We leverage the EM algorithm to
obtain an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of the PX model that is
extremely computationally efficient. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate
the improvement in estimation of regression coefficients of the proposed model

to interpret observational data on Hot Jupiters. Localized ""equatorial
$\beta$-plane"" simulations by Fromang et al. (2016) have revealed that a
barotropic (horizontal shear) instability of the equatorial jet appears at
horizontal resolutions beyond those typically achieved in global models; this
instability could limit wind speeds and lead to increased atmospheric
variability. To address this possibility, we adapt the computationally
efficient, pseudo-spectral PlaSim GCM, originally designed for Earth studies,
to model Hot Jupiter atmospheric flows and validate it on the Heng et al.
(2011) reference benchmark. We then present high resolution global models of
HD209458b, with horizontal resolutions of T85 (128x256) and T127 (192x384). The
barotropic instability phenomenology found in $\beta$-plane simulations is not
reproduced in these global models, despite comparably high resolutions.
Nevertheless, high resolution models do exhibit additional flow variability on
long timescales (of order 100 planet days or more), which is absent from the
lower resolution models. It manifests as a breakdown of north-south symmetry of
the equatorial wind. From post-processing the atmospheric flows at various
resolutions (assuming a cloud-free situation), we show that the stronger flow
variability achieved at high resolution does not translate into noticeably
stronger dayside infrared flux variability. More generally, our results suggest
that high horizontal resolutions are not required to capture the key features
of hot Jupiter atmospheric flows.

depend on their state-space models, along with the respective inputs and

to be very effective for memory-based tasks, may fail to model physical
processes as they tend to memorize, rather than learn how to capture the
information on the underlying dynamics. The proposed DCRNN includes learnable
skip-connections across previously hidden states, and introduces a
regularization term in the loss function by relying on Lyapunov stability
theory. The regularizer enables the placement of eigenvalues of the transfer
function induced by the DCRNN to desired values, thereby acting as an internal
controller for the hidden state trajectory. The results show that, for
forecasting a chaotic dynamical system, the DCRNN outperforms the LSTM in $100$

from \cite{Aguerri2015}. We studied the errors related with (i) galaxy centre
determination, (ii) disc position angle (PA) emphasising the difficulties
triggered by outer non-axisymmetric structures besides the bar, (iii) the slits
length and (iv) the spatial resolution. In average, the PA uncertainties range
$\sim 15 \%$, the slit length $\sim 9 \%$ and the centring error $\sim 5 \%$.
Reducing the spatial resolution increases the sensitivity to the PA error.
Through Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the probability distribution of
the \R{} bar speed parameter. The present sample is composed of 7 slow, 4 fast
and 7 ultrafast bars, with no trend with morphological types. Although
uncertainties and low sample numbers may mask potential correlations between
physical properties, we present a discussion of them: We observe an
anti-correlation of \Om{} with the bar length and the stellar mass, suggesting
that massive galaxies tend to host longer and slower bars. We also observe a
correlation of the molecular gas fraction with \R{}, and a weak
anti-correlation with \Om{}, suggesting that bars rotate slower in gaseous
discs. Confirmation of such trends awaits future studies.

solutions of the action -- the instantons -- which correspond to visons
tunneling between lattice sites. By integrating out the instantons, we
calculate the effective vison Hamiltonian, including their mass. We show that

At low temperatures, however, thermally activated visons form a Debye plasma
and introduce a mass gap in the photon spectrum, equal to the plasma frequency,

which simple update rules from the common Dirichlet-multinomial model can be
adopted. From the frequentist perspective, this approach amounts to adding
pseudo-observations to the data and allows a joint shrinkage estimation of mean
vector and covariance matrix. For higher dimensions ($m > 10$), the extensive
model based on $2^m$ parameters starts to become numerically infeasible. To
counter this problem, we utilize a reduced parametrisation which has only $1 +
m(m + 1)/2$ parameters describing first and second order moments. A copula
model can then be used to approximate the (posterior) multivariate Beta
distribution. A natural inference goal is the construction of multivariate
credible regions. The properties of different credible regions are assessed in
a simulation study in the context of investigating the accuracy of multiple
binary classifiers. It is shown that the extensive and copula approach lead to
a (Bayes) coverage probability very close to the target level. In this regard,
they outperform credible regions based on a normal approximation of the
posterior distribution, in particular for small sample sizes. Additionally,
they always lead to credible regions which lie entirely in the parameter space
which is not the case when the normal approximation is used.

related to NOMA focuses on the system performance from Shannon's capacity
perspective, which, although a critical system design criterion, fails to
quantify the effect of delay constraints imposed by future wireless
applications. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) two-user downlink NOMA system, in terms of the
link-layer achievable rate, known as effective capacity (EC), which captures
the performance of the system under a delay-limited quality-of-service (QoS)
constraint. For signal combining at the receiver side, we use generalized
selection combining (GSC), which bridges the performance gap between the two
conventional diversity combining schemes, namely selection combining (SC) and
maximal-ratio combining (MRC). We also derive two approximate expressions for
the EC of NOMA-GSC which are accurate at low-SNR and at high-SNR, respectively.
The analysis reveals a tradeoff between the number of implemented receiver
radio-frequency (RF) chains and the achieved performance, and can be used to
determine the appropriate number of paths to combine in a practical receiver
design.

observe that when Schmitt stability parameter $q(m)$ becomes sufficiently
large, the moduli space of triples benefits from having a perfect relative and

our construction by gluing triple moduli spaces, and extend the earlier work of
Gholampour-Sheshmani-Yau [arXiv:1701.08899] where the obstruction theory of
nested Hilbert schemes over the surface was studied. Here we extend the earlier
results to the moduli space of chains$$E_{1}\xrightarrow{\phi_{1}}
E_{2}\xrightarrow{\phi_{2}} \cdots \xrightarrow{\phi_{n-1}} E_{n},$$ where
$\phi_{i}$ are injective morphisms and $rk(E_{i})\geq 1, \forall i$. There is a
connection, by wallcrossing in the master space in the sense of Mochizuki,
between the theory of such higher rank flags, and the theory of Higgs pairs on
the surface, which provides the means to relate the flag invariants to the
local DT invariants of threefold given by a line bundle on the surface, $X
:=Tot(\mathcal{L} \to S)$. The latter, when $\mathcal{L}=\omega_{S}$, provides
the means to compute the contribution of higher rank flag sheaves to partition

The model was developed using 250 patients and tested internally using the
remaining 63 patients from the PROSTATEX (internal testing dataset (ITD)) and
tested again (n=46) externally using the ETD. The Dice Similarity Coefficient
(DSC) was used to evaluate the segmentation performance. DSCs for PZ and TZ

0.74 and 0.792, respectively. The inter-reader consistency (Expert 2 vs. Expert

segmentation of PZ and TZ with high accuracy on both ITD and ETD without a
performance difference for PZ and less than 10% TZ difference. In the ETD, the
proposed method can be comparable to experts in the segmentation of prostate

  Feasibility Study","12 pages, 1 figure",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been suggested that a certain class of UV-incomplete quantum field
theories can avoid unitarity violation above the cut-off energy scale by
forming classical configurations at a length scale much larger than the cut-off
length. This phenomenon has been named classicalization and is characterized by
a length scale called classicalization radius $r_*$ which increases with
energy. It has been argued that scalar field theories with derivative
self-interactions are likely candidate for UV-completetion by classicalization
and are much likely to form classicalons compared to non-classicalizing
theories like $\phi^4$ scalar field theory. To look further into this claim, in
this paper 2 to N particle scattering amplitude, scattering cross-section and
the amplitude of classical structure formation has been calculated and compared
for a classicalizing and non-classicalizing theory. As the phenomenon of
classicalization relies on creating a large number of low energy particles from
high energy two particle scattering, the ratios between the scattering
amplitudes and the amplitude of classical structure formation in these two
cases are an indicator of the feasibility of the classicalization process. From
our calculation, it has been observed that with the increase of energy, the
ratios of the relevant quantities between classicalizing and non-classicalizing
theory actually decrease which is quite contrary to the expected behaviour if
classicalization is supposed to self-unitarize certain class of theories beyond
cut-off energy.

gives rise to a geometry induced potential. Due to the annular geometric shape
of the sample, only the mean curvature has relevant effects to the model.
Nevertheless, the most significant contribution of the mean curvature occurs in
the state $m=0$, which tends to decrease the energies when the magnetic field
is null. The effects of curvature are also manifested in the cyclotron
frequency as well as in the effective angular momentum through the $\alpha$
parameter, which can be controlled in such a way that the magnitude of these
effects becomes explicit. This is verified in the energies and wave functions
of the system. A decrease in the number of occupied states in the Fermi energy
is observed. As a consequence, there is an alteration in the radial range of
the conducting region of the sample. This fact is confirmed by studying the
variations in the radii of the states.

proposed based on a feasible experimental setup in a realistic laboratory
environment. The improved design aims to provide milliampere (mA)
mega-electron-volt (MeV) quasi-continuous (cw) electron beams for
plasma-astrophysical applications. Such a design utilizes a so-called
mixed-guiding-field magnetic system right after the cut disk structure (CDS)
booster cavity to provide a periodic longitudinal focusing field. The
transportation of the produced cw beam with large energy spread to the plasma
cell location is improved. The magnetic field serves as well as a seeding field
in the plasma environment for the growth of electromagnetic instabilities. In
conjunction with the appliance of a circular collimator at the exit of the CDS,
the new design allows production of quasi-cw beams with a three orders higher
number density at the entrance of the plasma cell compared to the previous
design for a seeding magnetic field of about 50 mT while the locally enhanced
electric field at the cathode is up to 8 GV/m. The associated beam dynamics
simulation results are presented. As proof of principle studies, the produced
electron beams are applied in nonlinear plasma-astrophysical simulations for
exploring the growth of the instabilities. The extracted parameters and/or
distributions from the generated electron beams in the laboratory environment
are used in these particle-in-cell simulations. The obtained results are
presented and discussed.

form of verbal entertainment similar to a combination of one-person stand-up
comedy and comic storytelling and is popular even today. In rakugo, a performer
plays multiple characters, and conversations or dialogues between the
characters make the story progress. To investigate how close the quality of
synthesized rakugo speech can approach that of professionals' speech, we
modeled rakugo speech using Tacotron 2, a state-of-the-art speech synthesis
system that can produce speech that sounds as natural as human speech albeit
under limited conditions, and an enhanced version of it with self-attention to
better consider long-term dependencies. We also used global style tokens and
manually labeled context features to enrich speaking styles. Through a
listening test, we measured not only naturalness but also distinguishability of
characters, understandability of the content, and the degree of entertainment.
Although we found that the speech synthesis models could not yet reach the
professional level, the results of the listening test provided interesting
insights: 1) we should not focus only on the naturalness of synthesized speech
but also the distinguishability of characters and the understandability of the
content to further entertain audiences; 2) the fundamental frequency (fo)
expressions of synthesized speech are poorer than those of human speech, and
more entertaining speech should have richer fo expression. Although there is
room for improvement, we believe this is an important stepping stone toward
achieving entertaining speech synthesis at the professional level.

opportunities to boost performance, but also brings a bunch of challenges. The

respect to the surrounding organs and their deformable shape in CT images. The
U-Net has gained increasing popularity recently for image analysis tasks and

from three major drawbacks. To cope with these problems, we added a residual
path with deconvolution and activation operations to the skip connection of the
U-Net to avoid duplication of low resolution information of features. In the
case of small object inputs, features in the skip connection are not
incorporated with features in the residual path. Furthermore, the proposed

Each operation is analysed in two scenarios, one with the operation applied
transmitter-side to a Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum (TMSV) state and a second with
the operation applied to the TMSV state receiver-side. We numerically evaluate
the entanglement and calculate the QKD key rates produced in all four possible
scenarios. Our results show that for a fixed value of initial squeezing in the
TMSV state, the states produced by the non-Gaussian operations are more robust
to loss, being capable of generating higher key rates for a given loss. More
specifically, we find that for values of initial TMSV squeezing below 1.5dB the
highest key rates are obtained by means of transmitter-QS. On the other hand,
for squeezing above 1.5dB we find that receiver-PS produces higher key rates.
Our results will be important for future CV-QKD implementations over free-space

ecologists quantify species-environment relationships, and they are
increasingly being used to help determine the impacts of climate and habitat
changes on species. While high-quality survey-style data with known effort are
sometimes available, often researchers have multiple datasets of varying
quality and type. In particular, collections of sightings made by citizen
scientists are becoming increasingly common, with no information typically
provided on their observer effort. Many standard modelling approaches ignore
observer effort completely, which can severely bias estimates of an animal's
distribution. Combining sightings data from observers who followed different
protocols is challenging. Any differences in observer skill, spatial effort,
and the detectability of the animals across space all need to be accounted for.
To achieve this, we build upon the recent advancements made in integrative
species distribution models and present a novel marked spatio-temporal point
process framework for estimating the utilization distribution (UD) of the
individuals of a highly mobile species. We show that in certain settings, we
can also use the framework to combine the UDs from the sampled individuals to
estimate the species' distribution. We combine the empirical results from a
simulation study with the implications outlined in a causal directed acyclic
graph to identify the necessary assumptions required for our framework to
control for observer effort when it is unknown. We then apply our framework to
combine multiple datasets collected on the endangered Southern Resident Killer
Whales, to estimate their monthly effort-corrected space-use.

names and last names of people cannot be unique, their notation is not subject
to any rules of phonetics, while their length in different languages may not
match. With the advent of the Internet, this situation has become generally
critical and can lead to that multiple copies of e-mails are sent to one
address. It is possible to solve the specified problem by using phonetic
algorithms for comparing words Daitch-Mokotoff, Soundex, NYSIIS, Polyphone, and
Metaphone, as well as the Levenshtein and Jaro algorithms, Q-gram-based
algorithms, which make it possible to find distances between words. The most
widespread among them are the Soundex and Metaphone algorithms, which are
designed to index the words based on their sound, taking into consideration the
rules of pronunciation. By applying the Metaphone algorithm, an attempt has
been made to optimize the phonetic search processes for tasks of fuzzy
coincidence, for example, at data deduplication in various databases and
registries, in order to reduce the number of errors of incorrect input of last
names. An analysis of the most common last names reveals that some of them are
of the Ukrainian or Russian origin. At the same time, the rules following which
the names are pronounced and written, for example in Ukrainian, differ
radically from basic algorithms for English and differ quite significantly for
the Russian language. That is why a phonetic algorithm should take into
consideration first of all the peculiarities in the formation of Ukrainian last
names, which is of special relevance now.

of colored Gaussian noise, therefore, since the digital part of the combiner
and precoder do not have constraints for their generation, their designs can be
based on any traditional signal processing that takes into account this kind of
noise. To the best of our knowledge, this was not considered by previous works.
A more realistic and appropriate design is described in this paper. Also, the
approaches adopted in the literature for the designing of the

maintaining large SNR. In addition, one of the proposed hybrid combiners
reaches the maximum value of our objective function according with the

vulnerabilities---arise from the difference between the model a programmer has
in her head of how her program should run and the implementation that actually
executes. Previous attempts to reason about or identify weird machines have
viewed these models through the lens of formal computational structures such as
state machines and Turing machines. But because programmers rarely think about
programs in this way, it is difficult to effectively apply insights about weird
machines to improve security.
  We present a new view of weird machines based on techniques from programming
languages theory and secure compilation. Instead of an underspecified model
drawn from a programmers' head, we start with a program written in a high-level
source language that enforces security properties by design. Instead of state
machines to describe computation, we use the well-defined semantics of this
source language and a target language, into which the source program will be
compiled. Weird machines are the sets of behaviors that can be achieved by a
compiled source program in the target language that cannot be achieved in the
source language directly. That is, exploits are witnesses to insecure
compilation.
  This paper develops a framework for characterizing weird machines as insecure
compilation, and illustrates the framework with examples of common exploits. We
study the classes of security properties that exploits violate, the
compositionality of exploits in a compiler stack, and the weird machines and
mitigations that arise.

material science. All of these randomly packed systems exhibit forms of self
assembly, evident through their robust packing statistics, and a common,
unusual elastoplastic response to oedometric compression. In reviewing packing

spaces. Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of
elements or nodes. However, these relationships can be independent of each
other, and need not be defined for every pair of nodes. This is in contrast to
a metric space, which requires that a distance between every pair of elements
in the space be defined. To understand how to project networks onto metric
spaces, we take an axiomatic approach: we first state two axioms for projective
maps from the set of all networks to the set of finite metric spaces, then show
that only one projection satisfies these requirements. The developed technique
is shown to be an effective method for finding approximate solutions to
combinatorial optimization problems. Finally, we illustrate the use of metric
trees for efficient search in projected networks.

which is responsible for insufficient trustiness from users, unsatisfied
interpretation for human intervention, inadequate analysis for future
improvement, etc. This paper seeks to partially characterize the interplay
between dynamical environments and the DOB-net. The DOB-net obtained from RL
solves a set of Partially Observable Markovian Decision Processes (POMDPs). The
transition function of each POMDP is largely determined by the environments,
which are excessive external disturbances in this research. This paper proposes
an Attention-based Abstraction (A${}^2$) approach to extract a finite-state
automaton, referred to as a Key Moore Machine Network (KMMN), to capture the
switching mechanisms exhibited by the DOB-net in dealing with multiple such
POMDPs. This approach first quantizes the controlled platform by learning
continuous-discrete interfaces. Then it extracts the KMMN by finding the key
hidden states and transitions that attract sufficient attention from the
DOB-net. Within the resultant KMMN, this study found three patterns of cyclic
switchings (between key hidden states), showing controls near their saturation
are synchronized with unknown disturbances. Interestingly, the found switching
mechanism has appeared previously in the design of hybrid control for
often-saturated systems. It is further interpreted via an analogy to the
discrete-event subsystem in the hybrid control.

Hence, the dimension is effectively reduced from (3+1)-dimensional to

effective temperature and log g typical of red giant branch (RGB) populations,
which is consistent with our observational selection bias towards finding RGB
stars. We estimate that only a small fraction (0.5 per cent) of binary

s-process-rich candidates (95 per cent) show strong carbon enhancements,
whereas only five candidates (less than 3 percent) show evidence of sodium
enhancement. Our kinematic analysis reveals that 97 percent of our sample are
disc stars, with the other 3 percent showing velocities consistent with the
Galactic halo. The scaleheight of the disc is estimated to be zh=0.634kpc,
comparable with values in the literature. A comparison with the yields from
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models suggests that the main neutron source
responsible for the Ba and Sr enhancements is the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction. We
conclude that the s-process-rich candidates may have received their
overabundances via mass transfer from a previous ABG companion with an initial

described by a Boltzmann type-equation, where time, space, and velocities are
discretized to describe scattering and advection. Even though the LBM executes
advection along a lattice direction without numerical error, its usage in the
high Knudsen number regime (ballistic) has been hindered by the ray effect
problem (for dimensions greater than 1D). This problem has its origin in the
low number of available propagation directions on standard LBM lattices. Here,
to overcome this limitation, we propose the worm-lattice Boltzmann method
(worm-LBM), which allows a high number of lattice directions by alternating in
time the basic directions described within the next neighbor schemes.
Additionally, to overcome the velocity anisotropy issue, which otherwise
clearly manifests itself in the ballistic regime (e.g. the $\sqrt 2$ higher
grid velocity of the D2Q8 scheme along the diagonal direction compared to the
axial one), the time-adaptive scheme (TAS) is proposed. The TAS method makes
use of pausing advection on the grid, allowing to impose not only isotropic
propagation but also arbitrary direction-dependent grid velocity. Last but not
least, we propose a grid-mean free path (grid-MFP) correction to correctly
handle the aforementioned velocity issue in the diffusive limit, without
affecting the ballistic one. We provide a detailed description of the TAS
method and the worm-LBM algorithm, and verify their numerical accuracy by using
several transient diffusive-ballistic phonon transport cases, including
different initial and boundary conditions. Overall, the new, very accurate, and
efficient worm-LBM algorithm, free of numerical smearing and false scattering,
has the potential to be at the forefront of the numerical solvers to tackle the

potential to shape future forms of communication, control, and security.
Specifically, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based BCIs have
the advantages of better recognition accuracy, and higher information transfer
rate (ITR) compared to other BCI modalities. To fully exploit the capabilities
of such devices, it is necessary to understand the underlying biological
features of SSVEPs and design the system considering their inherent
characteristics. This paper introduces bio-inspired filter banks (BIFBs) for
improved SSVEP frequency recognition. SSVEPs are frequency selective,
subject-specific, and their power gets weaker as the frequency of the visual
stimuli increases. Therefore, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are
designed and tuned based on these characteristics while also incorporating
harmonic SSVEP responses. The BIFBs are utilized in the feature extraction
stage to increase the separability of classes. This method not only improves
the recognition accuracy but also increases the total number of available
commands in a BCI system by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies that elicit
weak SSVEP responses. The BIFBs are promising particularly in the
high-frequency band, which causes less visual fatigue. Hence, the proposed
approach might enhance user comfort as well. The BIFB method is tested on two
online benchmark datasets and outperforms the compared methods. The results
show the potential of bio-inspired design, and the findings will be extended by
including further SSVEP characteristics for future SSVEP based BCIs.

assisted solely by the interlayer-exchange coupling (IEC) between the fixed and
the free magnets, which are separated by two oxide barriers sandwiching a
spacer material known for exhibiting large IEC. The basic idea relies on the
formation of a quantum-well (QW) within the spacer material and controlling the
transmission coefficient across the structure with an electric-field via the
resonant tunneling phenomena. Using non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
method, we show that the structure can exhibit a bias-dependent oscillatory IEC
that can switch the free magnet to have either a parallel or an antiparallel
configuration with respect to the fixed magnet, depending on the sign of the
IEC. Such bi-directional switching can be achieved with the same voltage
polarity but different magnitudes. With proper choice of the spacer material,
the current in the structure can be significantly reduced. Due to the
conservative nature of the exerted torque by the IEC, the switching threshold
of the proposed mechanism is decoupled from the switching speed, while the
conventional spin-torque devices exhibit a trade-off due to the
non-conservative nature of the exerted torque.

range of functions in cellular and developmental processes, an increasing
number of methods have been proposed for distinguishing lncRNAs from coding
RNAs. However, most of the existing methods are designed for lncRNAs in animal
systems, and only a few methods focus on the plant lncRNA identification.
Different from lncRNAs in animal systems, plant lncRNAs have distinct
characteristics. It is desirable to develop a computational method for accurate
and robust identification of plant lncRNAs. Results: Herein, we present a plant
lncRNA identification method ItLnc-BXE, which utilizes multiple features and
the ensemble learning strategy. First, a diversity of lncRNA features is
collected and filtered by feature selection to represent RNA transcripts. Then,
several base learners are trained and further combined into a single
meta-learner by ensemble learning, and thus an ItLnc-BXE model is constructed.
ItLnc-BXE models are evaluated on datasets of six plant species, the results
show that ItLnc-BXE outperforms other state-of-the-art plant lncRNA
identification methods, achieving better and robust performances (AUC>95.91%).
We also perform some experiments about cross-species lncRNA identification, and
the results indicate that dicots-based and monocots-based models can be used to
accurately identify lncRNAs in lower plant species, such as mosses and algae.

While extrinsic reflectional
symmetry can be easily parametrized and detected, intrinsic symmetry is much
harder due to the high solution space. Previous works usually solve this
problem by voting or sampling, which suffer from high computational cost and
randomness. In this paper, we propose \YL{a} learning-based approach to
intrinsic reflectional symmetry detection. Instead of directly finding
symmetric point pairs, we parametrize this self-isometry using a functional map
matrix, which can be easily computed given the signs of Laplacian
eigenfunctions under the symmetric mapping. Therefore, we train a novel deep
neural network to predict the sign of each eigenfunction under symmetry, which
in addition takes the first few eigenfunctions as intrinsic features to
characterize the mesh while avoiding coping with the connectivity explicitly.
Our network aims at learning the global property of functions, and consequently
converts the problem defined on the manifold to the functional domain. By
disentangling the prediction of the matrix into separated basis, our method
generalizes well to new shapes and is invariant under perturbation of
eigenfunctions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of
our method in challenging cases, including different topology and incomplete
shapes with holes. By avoiding random sampling, our learning-based algorithm is
over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, and meanwhile, is more
robust, achieving higher correspondence accuracy in commonly used metrics.

force leaking through this region of spacetime also known as brane. Despite the
success of the mathematical description for the hierarchy issue through simple
thin branes, it is also possible to derive a consistent theory of gravity using
thick branes. The present work unveils a new procedure to determine analytic
hybrid thick braneworld models. The discussions were based on the so-called
Bloch branes, which are constructed via a two-field model coupled with gravity
in 5-dimensional spacetime. Both fields used to build the Bloch branes depend
only on the extra dimension, and the hybrid branes present internal structure,
characterizing them as thick. In this work, we were able to derive new analytic
thick brane models by using the extension method. Some of these new branes
present a Minkowski spacetime immersed inside of the fifth-dimension. We showed
how the symmetry of the emergent branes can be controlled via specific

regression. In this paper, we propose to diagnose censored regression with
normalized randomized survival probabilities (RSP). The key idea of RSP is to
replace the survival probability of a censored failure time with a uniform
random number between 0 and the survival probability of the censored time. We
prove that RSPs always have the uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ under the true
model with the true generating parameters. Therefore, we can transform RSPs
into normally-distributed residuals with the normal quantile function. We call
such residuals by normalized RSP (NRSP residuals). We conduct simulation
studies to investigate the sizes and powers of statistical tests based on NRSP
residuals in detecting the incorrect choice of distribution family and
non-linear effect in covariates. Our simulation studies show that, although the
GOF tests with NRSP residuals are not as powerful as a traditional GOF test
method, a non-linear test based on NRSP residuals has significantly higher
power in detecting non-linearity. We also compared these model diagnostics
methods with a breast-cancer recurrent-free time dataset. The results show that
the NRSP residual diagnostics successfully captures a subtle non-linear
relationship in the dataset, which is not detected by the graphical diagnostics

tend to perform poorly in the source domain, a phenomenon known as catastrophic

  Parallel Schedule Sampling and Relative Positional Embedding",,,,,"cs.CL eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformer has shown promising results in many sequence to sequence
transformation tasks recently. It utilizes a number of feed-forward
self-attention layers to replace the recurrent neural networks (RNN) in
attention-based encoder decoder (AED) architecture. Self-attention layer learns
temporal dependence by incorporating sinusoidal positional embedding of tokens
in a sequence for parallel computing. Quicker iteration speed in training than
sequential operation of RNN can be obtained. Deeper layers of the transformer
also make it perform better than RNN-based AED. However, this parallelization
ability is lost when applying scheduled sampling training. Self-attention with
sinusoidal positional embedding may cause performance degradations for longer
sequences that have similar acoustic or semantic information at different
positions as well. To address these problems, we propose to use parallel
scheduled sampling (PSS) and relative positional embedding (RPE) to help the
transformer generalize to unseen data. Our proposed methods achieve a 7%
relative improvement for short utterances and a 70% relative gain for long
utterances on a 10,000-hour Mandarin ASR task.

InteractE is based on three key ideas -- feature permutation, a novel feature

homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) based on Lagrangian statistics of
propagating surfaces. The propagating surfaces with a constant displacement
speed are initially arranged on a plane, and they evolve in non-reacting HIT,
behaving like the propagation of a planar premixed flame front. The universal
constants in the model of $S_T$ characterize the enhancement of area growth of
premixed flames by turbulence, and they are determined by Lagrangian statistics
of propagating surfaces. The flame area is then modelled by the area of
propagating surfaces at a truncation time. This truncation time signals the
statistical stationary state of the evolutionary geometry of propagating
surfaces, and it is modelled by an explicit expression using limiting
conditions of very weak and strong turbulence. Another parameter in the model
of $S_T$ characterizes the effect of fuel chemistry on $S_T$, and it is
pre-determined by very few available data points of $S_T$ from experiments or
direct numerical simulation (DNS) in weak turbulence. The proposed model is
validated using three DNS series of turbulent premixed flames with various
fuels. The model prediction of $S_T$ generally agrees well with DNS in a wide
range of premixed combustion regimes, and it captures the basic trends of $S_T$
in terms of the turbulence intensity, including the linear growth in weak
turbulence and the `bending effect' in strong turbulence.

framework based on the concept of differential privacy (DP), in which
artificial noises are added to the parameters at the clients side before
aggregating, namely, noising before model aggregation FL (NbAFL). First, we
prove that the NbAFL can satisfy DP under distinct protection levels by
properly adapting different variances of artificial noises. Then we develop a
theoretical convergence bound of the loss function of the trained FL model in
the NbAFL. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key
properties: 1) There is a tradeoff between the convergence performance and
privacy protection levels, i.e., a better convergence performance leads to a
lower protection level; 2) Given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing
the number $N$ of overall clients participating in FL can improve the
convergence performance; 3) There is an optimal number of maximum aggregation
times (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given
protection level. Furthermore, we propose a $K$-random scheduling strategy,
where $K$ ($1<K<N$) clients are randomly selected from the $N$ overall clients
to participate in each aggregation. We also develop the corresponding
convergence bound of the loss function in this case and the $K$-random
scheduling strategy can also retain the above three properties. Moreover, we
find that there is an optimal $K$ that achieves the best convergence
performance at a fixed privacy level. Evaluations demonstrate that our
theoretical results are consistent with simulations, thereby facilitating the
designs on various privacy-preserving FL algorithms with different tradeoff
requirements on convergence performance and privacy levels.

(iv) Apply the splitting process recursively to the subtrees. This approach has
the attractive feature that Prim's algorithm for MST construction calculates
distances as needed, and hence there is no need to ever store the inter-point
distance matrix. The recursive partitioning algorithm requires us to determine
the vertices (and edges) of $T_L$ and $T_R$. We show how this can be done
easily and efficiently using information generated by Prim's algorithm without
any additional computational cost.

Active$\mathbf{^2}$ Learning (A$\mathbf{^2}$L), actively adapts to the deep

employing pulsed renewing flows with fixed kinetic helicity and nonzero
correlation time ($\tau$). We use plane shearing waves in terms of
time-dependent exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation as derived by
Singh \& Sridhar (2017). This allows us to self-consistently include the
anisotropic effects of shear on the stochastic flow. We determine the average
response tensor governing the evolution of mean magnetic field, and study the
properties of its eigenvalues which yield the growth rate ($\gamma$) and the
cycle period ($P_{\rm cyc}$) of the mean magnetic field. Non-axisymmetric modes
of the mean magnetic field decay as $t \to \infty$ and hence are deemed
unimportant for mean-field dynamo. Both, $\gamma$ and the wavenumber
corresponding to the fastest growing axisymmetric mode vary non-monotonically
with shear rate $S$ when $\tau$ is comparable to the eddy turnover time $T$, in
which case, we also find quenching of dynamo when shear becomes too strong.
When $\tau/T\sim{\cal O}(1)$, the cycle period ($P_{\rm cyc}$) of growing
dynamo wave scales with shear as $P_{\rm cyc} \propto |S|^{-1}$ at small shear,
and it becomes nearly independent of shear as shear becomes too strong.This
asymptotic behaviour at weak and strong shear has implications for magnetic
activity cycles of stars in recent observations. Our study thus essentially
generalizes the standard $\alpha \Omega$ (or $\alpha^2\Omega$) dynamo as also
the $\alpha$ effect is affected by shear and the modelled random flow has a

the random shift approach that has become a standard method for testing the

used in a plethora of practical applications. However, this method has a
problem of liberality caused by breaking the marginal spatial correlation
structure due to the toroidal correction. This indeed causes that the
assumption of exchangability, which is essential for the Monte Carlo test to be
exact, is not fulfilled.
  We present a number of permutation strategies and show that the random shift
with the variance correction brings a suitable improvement compared to the
torus correction in the random field case. It reduces the liberality and
achieves the largest power from all investigated variants. To obtain the
variance for the variance correction method, several approaches were studied.
The best results were achieved, for the sample covariance as the test
statistics, with the correction factor $1/n$. This corresponds to the
asymptotic order of the variance of the test statistics.
  In the point process case, the problem of deviations from exchangeability is
far more complex and we propose an alternative strategy based on the mean cross
nearest-neighbor distance and torus correction. It reduces the liberality but
achieves slightly lower power than the usual cross $K$-function. Therefore we
recommend it, when the point patterns are clustered, where the cross
$K$-function achieves liberality.

argue that these gaps are the result of interband coupling between electronic
states that reside predominantly on distinct 1D chains within the material. Two
such localized states are found to couple to an electronic state that extends
across multiple 1D chains, highlighting the importance of a higher-dimensional
interaction in stabilizing the CDW ordering in this material. In addition, the
temperature evolution of intrachain gaps caused by the CDW periodicities far
below $E_F$ deviate from the behavior expected for a Peierls-type mechanism
driven by nesting; the upper and lower bands of the renormalized CDW
dispersions maintain a fixed peak-to-peak distance while the gaps are gradually
removed at higher temperatures. This points toward a gradual loss of long-range
phase coherence as the dominant effect in reducing the CDW order parameter,
which may correspond to the loss of coherence between the coupled chains.
Furthermore, one of the gaps is observed above the bulk and surface CDW
transition temperatures, implying the persistence of short-range incoherent CDW
order. The influence of such higher-dimensional interactions likely plays an
important role in a range of low-dimensional systems.

the He I triplet becomes undetectable in our study. This dependence on
effective temperature may be related to a change in chromospheric conditions
along the M dwarf sequence. When an emission in the triplet is observed, we
attribute it to flaring. The absence of emission during quiescence is
consistent with line formation by photo-ionisation and recombination, while
flare emission may be caused by collisions within dense material. The He I

availability and low cost of fingerprint scanners. To avoid identity theft or
impersonation, fingerprint data is typically stored locally, e.g., in a trusted
hardware module, in a single device that is used for user enrollment and
authentication. Local storage, however, limits the ability to implement
distributed applications, in which users can enroll their fingerprint once and
use it to access multiple physical locations and mobile applications
afterwards.
  In this paper, we present a distributed authentication system that stores
fingerprint data in a server or cloud infrastructure in a privacy-preserving
way. Multiple devices can be connected and perform user enrollment or
verification. To secure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, we employ
a cryptographic construct called fuzzy vault. We highlight challenges in
implementing fuzzy vault-based authentication, for which we propose and compare
alternative solutions. We conduct a security analysis of our biometric

access control using resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pis) connected to
fingerprint scanners and the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Furthermore, we
evaluate the fingerprint matching algorithm against the well-known FVC2006

application at the home/enterprise network, our approach is to place the
enforcement upstream at the provider network, combining an NFV (Network
Function Virtualization) with router/switching filtering capabilities, e.g.,
ACLs. The VNF monitors many home networks simultaneously, and therefore, is a
highly-scalable managed service solution that provides both the end customers
and the ISP with excellent visibility and security of the IoT devices at the
customer premises.
  The system includes a mechanism to distinguish between flows of different
devices at the ISP level despite the fact that most home networks (and their
IoT devices) are behind a NAT and all the flows from the same home come out
with the same source IP address. Moreover, the NFV system needs to receive only
the first packet of each connection at the VNF, and rules space is proportional
to the number of unique types of IoT devices rather than the number of IoT
devices. The monitoring part of the solution is off the critical path and can
also uniquely protect from incoming DDoS attacks.
  To cope with internal traffic, that is not visible outside the customer
premise and often consists of P2P communication, we suggest a hybrid approach,
where we deploy a lightweight component at the CPE, whose sole purpose is to
monitor P2P communication. As current MUD solution does not provide a secure
solution to P2P communication, we also extend the MUD protocol to deal also

Because of the ground-state degeneracy of the single-particle Hamiltonian at
vanishing detuning, several angular-stripe phases, which are superposition of
states with different angular quantum numbers, appear in the phase diagram.
However, these phases normally exist at small detuning, which makes them hard
to be probed in experiments. We show that for a large OAM difference of the
laser beams, an asymmetric kind of angular-stripe phase can exist even at large
detuning. The excitation spectra in different phases exhibit distinct features:
In the angular-stripe phase there exist two gapless bands corresponding to the
broken U(1) and rotational symmetries, while in the half-skyrmion phase the
gapless band exhibits a roton-like structure. Our predictions of the
angular-stripe phases and the low-energy excitations can be examined in

phase, three-dimensional tether-cutting reconnection at the HFT is most likely
resulting in the heating and buildup of the hot channel. In this process, the
forming hot channel was rapidly enlarged at its spatial size and slipped its
feet to two remote positions. Afterward, it instantly erupted outwards with an
exponential acceleration, leaving two core dimmings near its feet. We suggest
that pre-flare reconnection at the HFT played a crucial role in enlarging the
seed MFR and facilitating the onset of its final solar eruption. Moreover, a
recently predicted drifting of MFR's footpoints was detected at both core
dimmings. In particular, we find that MFR's west footpoint drift was induced by
a new reconnection geometry among the erupting MFR's leg and thereby inclined
arcades. As MFR's west footpoints gradually drifted to a new position, a set of
newborn atypical flare loops connected into the west core dimming, causing a
rapid decrease of dimmed area inside this core dimming and also generating a
secondary flare ribbon at their remote feet. This reveals that core dimmings
may suffer a pronounced diminishment due to the eruptive MFR's footpoint drift,
implying that mapping the real footpoints of the erupting MFR down to the Sun's

based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). Therefore, the most important part of
those systems is to compute the similarity between numerical data points. In
2016, the new similarity TS-SS metric is proposed, which showed
state-of-the-art results in the field of textual mining for unsupervised

distance and Cosine similarity --- that showed the best predictive results over
several benchmark corpora. The results show surprising inappropriateness of

theoretically analyze nonlinear ICA models in the presence of outliers. Our

sorting inputs arising from time-to-digital converters, i.e., measurement

small circuits. We show that this is indeed possible, by providing a circuit
that sorts Gray code inputs (possibly containing a metastable bit) and has
asymptotically optimal depth and size. Our solution utilizes the parallel
prefix computation (PPC) framework (JACM 1980). We improve this construction by
bounding its fan-out by an arbitrary $f \geq 3$, without affecting depth and
increasing circuit size by a small constant factor only. Thus, we obtain the
first PPC circuits with asymptotically optimal size, constant fan-out, and
optimal depth. To show that applying the PPC framework to the sorting task is
feasible, we prove that the latter can, despite potential metastability, be
decomposed such that the core operation is associative. We obtain
asymptotically optimal metastability-containing sorting networks. We complement
these results with simulations, independently verifying the correctness as well

incentivize honest reports and some of them achieve dominantly truthfulness:
truth-telling is a dominant strategy and strictly dominate other
""non-permutation strategy"" with some mild conditions. However, a major issue
hinders the practical usage of those mechanisms: they require the participants
to perform an infinite number of tasks. When the participants perform a finite
number of tasks, these mechanisms only achieve approximated dominant
truthfulness. The existence of a dominantly truthful multi-task peer prediction
mechanism that only requires a finite number of tasks remains to be an open
question that may have a negative result, even with full prior knowledge.
  This paper answers this open question by proposing a new mechanism,
Determinant based Mutual Information Mechanism (DMI-Mechanism), that is
dominantly truthful when the number of tasks is at least 2C and the number of
participants is at least 2. C is the number of choices for each question (C=2

DMI-Mechanism can also be transferred into an information evaluation rule that
identifies high-quality information without verification when there are at

dominantly truthful mechanism that works for a finite number of tasks, not to

substantially different radii and tidal deformabilities. We demonstrate that
while for purely hadronic stiff EOS the obtained maximum mass is inconsistent
with the upper limit on this quantity placed by GW170817, the inclusion of the

protoplanets. Planets formed via giant impacts have highly eccentric orbits. A
swarm of planetesimals around the planets may lead to eccentricity damping for
the planets via the equipartition of random energies (dynamical friction).
However, dynamical friction increases eccentricities of planetesimals,
resulting in high velocity collisions between planetesimals. The collisional
cascade grinds planetesimals to dust until dust grains are blown out due to
radiation pressure. Therefore, the total mass of planetesimals decreases due to
collisional fragmentation, which weakens dynamical friction. We investigate the
orbital evolution of protoplanets in a planetesimal disk, taking into account
collisional fragmentation of planetesimals. For 100 km-sized or smaller
planetesimals, dynamical friction is insignificant for eccentricity damping of
planets because of collisional fragmentation. On the other hand, giant impacts
eject collisional fragments. Although the total mass of giant impact ejecta is
0.1-0.3 Earth masses, the largest impact ejecta are ~ 1,000 km in size. We also
investigate the orbital evolution of single planets with initial eccentricities
0.1 in a swarm of such giant impact ejecta. Although the total mass of giant
impact ejecta decreases by a factor of 3 in 30 Myrs, eccentricities of planets
are damped down to the Earth level (~0.01) due to interaction with giant impact
ejecta. Therefore, giant impact ejecta play an important role for determination

fractional economy to address empirical regularities related to both investor
protection and past information. Our newly developed model features not only in
terms with a controlling shareholder who diverts a fraction of the output, but
also good (or bad) memory in his budget dynamics which can be well-calibrated
by a pathwise way from the historical data. We find that poorer investor
protection leads to higher stock holdings of controlling holders, lower gross
stock returns, lower interest rates, and lower modified stock volatilities if
the ownership concentration is sufficiently high. More importantly, by
establishing an approximation scheme for good (bad) memory of investors on the
historical market information, we conclude that good (bad) memory would
increase (decrease) aforementioned dynamics and reveal that good (bad) memory
strengthens (weakens) investor protection for minority shareholder when the
ownership concentration is sufficiently high, while good (bad) memory inversely
weakens (strengthens) investor protection for minority shareholder when the
ownership concentration is sufficiently low. Our model's implications are
consistent with a number of interesting facts documented in the recent
literature.

density field within a Gibbs-sampling scheme. This allows us to map galaxies,
observed in a light-cone, to a single high redshift and hereby provide tracers
and the corresponding survey completeness in Lagrangian space including
phase-space mapping. These Lagrangian tracers in turn permit us to efficiently
obtain the primordial density field, making the COSMIC BIRTH code general to
any structure formation model. Our tests are restricted for the time being to
Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation theory. We show how to robustly compute the
non-linear Lagrangian bias from clustering measurements in a numerical way,
enabling us to get unbiased dark matter field reconstructions at initial cosmic
times. We also show that we can greatly recover the information of the dark
matter field from the galaxy distribution based on a detailed simulation. Novel
key ingredients to this approach are a higher-order Hamiltonian sampling
technique and a non-diagonal Hamiltonian mass-matrix. This technique could be
used to study the Eulerian galaxy bias from galaxy surveys and could become an
ideal baryon acoustic reconstruction technique. In summary, this method

differences are related to fluctuations accompanying the discontinuous change

fluctuation at all. In the canonical ensemble, one observes power-law
fluctuations, which are, however, size-dependent and disappear in the

interferometric data. Using the power of a convolutional autoencoder we embed
kinematic features, unattainable by the human eye or standard tools, into a

varying the level of noise added to the input data and we are able to explain
the roles of all dimensions of our mapped space. Our models also allow fast
predictions of input galaxies' position angles with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty
range of $\pm17^{\circ}$ to $\pm23^{\circ}$ (for galaxies with inclinations of

show that the conventional channel capacity obtained by optimizing the input
distribution for a fixed channel may not reflect the global optimum. In a new
approach we analytically identify both input distributions and input-output
curves that optimally transmit information, given constraints from noise and
the dynamic range of the channel. We find a universal optimal input
distribution only depending on the input noise, and we generalize our formalism
to multiple outputs (or inputs). Applying our formalism to Escherichia coli
chemotaxis, we find that its pathway is compatible with optimal information
transmission despite the ultrasensitive rotary motors.

external observer. In this work, we calculate the emission rate of charged

emitted particles is also observed to decrease with the scalar charge as well.

(D2D) communication is expected to be supported in the 5G mobile system. D2D
communication aims to improve system spectrum efficiency, overall system
throughput, energy efficiency and reduce the connection delay between devices.
However, new security threats and challenges need to be considered regarding
device and user authentication to avoid unauthorized access, abuse and attacks
on the whole system. In this paper, a strong standalone authentication
technique therefore is proposed. It is based on combining users biometric
identities and a new clone-resistant device identity. The novel property of the
proposal is that it is fully independent on both device manufacturer and mobile
system operator. The biometric identity deploys user keystroke dynamics and
accelerometer to generate user biometric identity by deploying a machine
learning technique. The proposed mobile device clone-resistant identity is
based on deploying a new concept of a pure digital clone-resistant structure
which is both manufacturer and mobile operator-independent. When combining both
identities, a mutually authenticated D2D secured link between any two devices
can be established in addition to a strong user-device authentication.
Furthermore, the concept does not allow the managing trusted authority to
intercept users private links. Being an independent and standalone system, the
technique would offer a broad spectrum of attractive future smart applications
over the 5G mobile system infrastructure.

Magnetoresistance measurements point to the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of

for institutions' archives. The common functionality among cold and warm/hot
data storage is that the data is stored on some physical medium for read-back
at a later time. However in cold storage, write and read operations are not
necessarily done in the same exact geographical location. Hence, a third party
assistance is typically utilized to bring together the medium and the drive. On
the other hand, the reliability modeling of such a decomposed system poses few
challenges that do not necessarily exist in other warm/hot storage alternatives
such as fault detection and absence of the carrier, all totaling up to the data
unavailability issues. In this paper, we propose a generalized non-homogenous
Markov model that encompasses the aging of the carriers in order to address the
requirements of today's cold data storage systems in which the data is encoded
and spread across multiple nodes for the long-term data retention. We have
derived useful lower/upper bounds on the overall system availability.
Furthermore, the collected field data is used to estimate parameters of a
Weibull distribution to accurately predict the lifetime of the carriers in an
example scale-out setting. In this study, we numerically demonstrate the
significance of carriers' presence and the key role that their timely
maintenance plays on the long-term reliability and availability of the stored

that all of the instruments are independent of the outcome conditional on the

with large numbers of genetic variants used as instruments, it is unlikely that
this condition will be met. Any given genetic variant could be associated with
a large number of traits, all of which represent potential pathways to the
outcome which bypass the risk factor of interest. Such pleiotropy can be
accounted for using standard multivariable Mendelian randomization with all
possible pleiotropic traits included as covariates. However, the estimator
obtained in this way will be inefficient if some of the covariates do not truly
sit on pleiotropic pathways to the outcome. We present a method which uses
regularization to identify which out of a set of potential covariates need to
be accounted for in a Mendelian randomization analysis in order to produce an
efficient and robust estimator of a causal effect. The method can be used in
the case where individual-level data are not available and the analysis must
rely on summary-level data only. It can also be used in the case where there
are more covariates under consideration than instruments, which is not possible

explore how a deep learning algorithm trained on screening mammograms from the
US and UK generalizes to mammograms collected at a hospital in China, where
screening is not widely implemented. For the evaluation, we use a top-scoring
model developed for the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge. Despite the change
in institution and population composition, we find that the model generalizes
well, exhibiting similar performance to that achieved in the DREAM Challenge,
even when controlling for tumor size. We also illustrate a simple but effective
method for filtering predictions based on model variance, which can be
particularly useful for deployment in new settings. While there are many
components in developing a clinically effective system, these results represent
a promising step towards increasing access to life-saving screening mammography

self-heating phenomena. The optimization of device designs can be assisted by
numerical simulations using the non-isothermal drift-diffusion system, where
the magnitude of the thermoelectric cross effects is controlled by the Seebeck
coefficient. We show that the model equations take a remarkably simple form
when assuming the so-called Kelvin formula for the Seebeck coefficient. The
corresponding heat generation rate involves exactly the three classically known
self-heating effects, namely Joule, recombination and Thomson-Peltier heating,
without any further (transient) contributions. Moreover, the thermal driving
force in the electrical current density expressions can be entirely absorbed in
the diffusion coefficient via a generalized Einstein relation. The efficient
numerical simulation relies on an accurate and robust discretization technique
for the fluxes (finite volume Scharfetter-Gummel method), which allows to cope
with the typically stiff solutions of the semiconductor device equations. We
derive two non-isothermal generalizations of the Scharfetter-Gummel scheme for
degenerate semiconductors (Fermi-Dirac statistics) obeying the Kelvin formula.
The approaches differ in the treatment of degeneration effects: The first is
based on an approximation of the discrete generalized Einstein relation
implying a specifically modified thermal voltage, whereas the second scheme
follows the conventionally used approach employing a modified electric field.
We present a detailed analysis and comparison of both schemes, indicating a

a careful Ward identity analysis, as well as from semi-classically exact
AdS$_3$ solutions that are pinned to the boundary. The world-sheet correlators
therefore have exactly the same structure as in the Lunin-Mathur construction

chemical compositions and temperature structures will improve the understanding
of their mass loss rate as well as their formation and evolution. We present
the detection of ionized calcium in the two hottest giant exoplanets - KELT-9b
and WASP-33b. By utilizing transit datasets from CARMENES and HARPS-N
observations, we achieved high confidence level detections of Ca II using the
cross-correlation method. We further obtain the transmission spectra around the
individual lines of the Ca II H&K doublet and the near-infrared triplet, and
measure their line profiles. The Ca II H&K lines have an average line depth of
2.02 $\pm$ 0.17 % (effective radius of 1.56 Rp) for WASP-33b and an average
line depth of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.04 % (effective radius of 1.47 Rp) for KELT-9b,
which indicates that the absorptions are from very high upper atmosphere layers
close to the planetary Roche lobes. The observed Ca II lines are significantly
deeper than the predicted values from the hydrostatic models. Such a
discrepancy is probably a result of hydrodynamic outflow that transports a
significant amount of Ca II into the upper atmosphere. The prominent Ca II
detection with the lack of significant Ca I detection implies that calcium is
mostly ionized in the upper atmospheres of the two planets.

personality traits is essential, have gained increasing interest and attention
in many research areas recently. We propose a novel approach to recognize the
Big Five personality traits of people from videos. Personality and emotion
affect the speaking style, facial expressions, body movements, and linguistic
factors in social contexts, and they are affected by environmental elements. We
develop a multimodal system to recognize apparent personality based on various
modalities such as the face, environment, audio, and transcription features. We
use modality-specific neural networks that learn to recognize the traits
independently and we obtain a final prediction of apparent personality with a
feature-level fusion of these networks. We employ pre-trained deep
convolutional neural networks such as ResNet and VGGish networks to extract
high-level features and Long Short-Term Memory networks to integrate temporal
information. We train the large model consisting of modality-specific
subnetworks using a two-stage training process. We first train the subnetworks
separately and then fine-tune the overall model using these trained networks.
We evaluate the proposed method using ChaLearn First Impressions V2 challenge
dataset. Our approach obtains the best overall ""mean accuracy"" score, averaged
over five personality traits, compared to the state-of-the-art.

is transmitted throughout the hospitals. The watermarking system can help for
the confidentiality of medical information distributed over the internet. In
medical images, regions-of-interest (ROI) contain diagnostic information. The
watermark should be embedded only into non-regions-of-interest (NROI) to keep
diagnostic information without distortion. Recently, ROI based watermarking has
attracted the attention of the medical research community. The ROI map can be
used as an embedding key for improving confidentiality protection purposes.
However, in most existing works, the ROI map that is used for the embedding
process must be sent as side-information along with the watermarked image. This
side information is a disadvantage and makes the extraction process non-blind.
Also, most existing algorithms do not recover NROI of the original cover image
after the extraction of the watermark. In this paper, we propose a framework
for blind diagnostically-lossless watermarking, which iteratively embeds only
into NROI. The significance of the proposed framework is in satisfying the
confidentiality of the patient information through a blind watermarking system,
while it preserves diagnostic/medical information of the image throughout the
watermarking process. A deep neural network is used to recognize the ROI map in
the embedding, extraction, and recovery processes. In the extraction process,
the same ROI map of the embedding process is recognized without requiring any
additional information. Hence, the watermark is blindly extracted from the
NROI.

entails the computation of CH column densities. Reliable N(CH) values are of
importance owing to the status of CH as a powerful tracer for H$_2$ in the
diffuse regions of the interstellar medium. The N(OH)/N(CH) column density
ratio is found to vary within an order of magnitude with values ranging from
one to 10, for the individual sources that are located outside the Galactic
centre. Using CH as a surrogate for H$_2$, we determined the abundance of the

distribution of CH column densities along the sightlines probed in this study,

the map. milliMap makes two key technical contributions. First, it autonomously
overcomes the sparsity and multi-path noise of mmWave signals by combining
cross-modal supervision from a co-located lidar during training and the strong
geometric priors of indoor spaces. Second, it takes the spectral response of
mmWave reflections as features to robustly identify different types of objects
e.g. doors, walls etc. Extensive experiments in different indoor environments
show that milliMap can achieve a map reconstruction error less than 0.2m and
classify key semantics with an accuracy around 90%, whilst operating through
dense smoke.

non-smooth convex optimization in Banach spaces, and novel rates of convergence
are provided. As objective function a composition of a smooth and a non-smooth
part is considered with the latter being block-separable, e.g., corresponding
to convex constraints or regularization. For the smooth part, three different
relaxations of strong convexity are considered: (i) quasi-strong convexity;
(ii) quadratic functional growth; and (iii) plain convexity. Linear convergence
is established for the first two cases, generalizing and improving previous
results for strongly convex problems; sublinear convergence is established for
the third case, also improving previous results from the literature. All the
convergence results have in common, that opposing to previous corresponding
results for the general block coordinate descent, the performance of the
alternating minimization is beneficially governed by properties of the single
blocks, instead of global properties. Ultimately, not only the better
conditioned block determines the performance, as has been similarly observed in
the literature. But also the worse conditioned problem enhances the performance
additionally, resulting in potentially significantly improved convergence
rates. Furthermore, by solely using the convexity and smoothness properties of
the problem, the results immediately apply in general Banach spaces.

This
notion generalizes the notions of the much studied permutation graphs and
co-interval graphs. It is known that any 12-representable graph is a
comparability graph, and also that a tree is 12-representable if and only if it
is a double caterpillar. Moreover, Jones et al.\ initiated the study of
12-representability of induced subgraphs of a grid graph, and asked whether it
is possible to characterize such graphs. This question in is meant to be about
induced subgraphs of a grid graph that consist of squares, which we call square
grid graphs. However, an induced subgraph in a grid graph does not have to
contain entire squares, and we call such graphs line grid graphs.
  In this paper we answer the question of Jones et al.\ by providing a complete
characterization of $12$-representable square grid graphs in terms of forbidden

terms quadratic in spin and will generally stay very small in the
small-mass-ratio limit. Last but not least, we compute gravitational waveforms

more fun and better quality of image generation due to supervised interaction.
However, when a sketch poorly aligned with the true face is given as input,
existing supervised image-to-image translation methods often cannot generate
acceptable photo-realistic face images. To address this problem, in this paper
we propose Cali-Sketch, a human-like-sketch to photo-realistic-image generation
method. Cali-Sketch explicitly models stroke calibration and image generation
using two constituent networks: a Stroke Calibration Network (SCN), which
calibrates strokes of facial features and enriches facial details while
preserving the original intent features; and an Image Synthesis Network (ISN),
which translates the calibrated and enriched sketches to photo-realistic face
images. In this way, we manage to decouple a difficult cross-domain translation
problem into two easier steps. Extensive experiments verify that the face
photos generated by Cali-Sketch are both photo-realistic and faithful to the
input sketches, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

in a finite dimensional space, making it computationally tractable. Moreover,
Banach space methods for learning have been receiving more and more attention.
Considering the representer theorem in Banach spaces is hence of increasing
importance. Recently the question of the necessary condition for a representer

considered. It has been shown that a classical representer theorem cannot exist
in general in non-reflexive Banach spaces. In this paper we propose a notion of
approximate solutions and approximate representer theorem to overcome this

results to obtain a unified theory for the existence of representer theorems in
any general Banach spaces, in particular including $l_1$-type spaces. We give a
precise characterisation when a regulariser admits a classical representer

spectrum poisoning attacks. A transmitter applies deep learning on its spectrum
sensing results to predict idle time slots for data transmission. In the
meantime, an adversary learns the transmitter's behavior (exploratory attack)
by building another deep neural network to predict when transmissions will
succeed. The adversary falsifies (poisons) the transmitter's spectrum sensing
data over the air by transmitting during the short spectrum sensing period of
the transmitter. Depending on whether the transmitter uses the sensing results
as test data to make transmit decisions or as training data to retrain its deep
neural network, either it is fooled into making incorrect decisions (evasion
attack), or the transmitter's algorithm is retrained incorrectly for future
decisions (causative attack). Both attacks are energy efficient and hard to
detect (stealth) compared to jamming the long data transmission period, and
substantially reduce the throughput. A dynamic defense is designed for the
transmitter that deliberately makes a small number of incorrect transmissions
(selected by the confidence score on channel classification) to manipulate the
adversary's training data. This defense effectively fools the adversary (if
any) and helps the transmitter sustain its throughput with or without an
adversary present.

rotating analyzer, representing residual polarized light and carrying
information on the object, is detected with the help of a lock-in amplifier.
When turbidity increases beyond a level, the lock-in amplifier fails to detect
the weak sinusoidal component in the transmitted light. In this work we have
employed the principle of Stochastic Resonance and used a 3-level quantizer to
detect the amplitude of the sinusoids, which was not detectable with a lock-in
amplifier. In using the three level quantizer we have employed three different
approaches to extract the amplitude of the weak sinusoids: (a) using the
probability of the quantized output to crossover a certain threshold in the
quantizer (b) maximizing the likelihood function for the quantized detected
intensity data and (c) arriving at an expression for the expected power in the
detected output and comparing it with the experimentally measured power. We
have proven these non-linear estimation methods by detecting the hidden object
from experimental data from a polarization discrimination imaging system. When
the turbidity increased to L/l = 5.05 (l is the transport mean-free-path and L
is the thickness of the turbid medium) the data through analysis by the
proposed methods revealed the presence of the object from the estimated
amplitudes. This was not possible by using only the lock-in amplifier system.

model with low memory-cost. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
the relation between neural architecture and ODE discretization is introduced.
Some architectures are not motivated by ODE, but they are later found to be
associated with some specific discretization schemes. Some architectures are
designed based on ODE discretization and expected to achieve some special
properties. Section 3 formulates the optimization problem where a traditional
neural network is replaced by a continuous model (ODE). The formulated
optimization problem is an optimal control problem. Therefore, two different
types of controls will also be discussed in this section. In Section 4, we will
discuss how we can utilize the optimization methods that are popular in optimal
control literature to help the training of machine learning problems. Finally,
two applications of using a continuous model will be shown in Section 5 and 6
to demonstrate some of its advantages over traditional neural networks.

  arXiv:1904.10938",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the notion of combinatorial encoding of continuous dynamical
systems and suggest the first examples, which are the most interesting and
important, namely, the combinatorial encoding of a Bernoulli process with
continuous state space, e.g., a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with values
in the interval with the Lebesgue measure (or a Lebesgue space).
  The main idea is to associate with a random object (a trajectory of the
random process) a path in an $\N$-graded graph and parametrize it with the
vertices of the graph that belong to this path. This correspondence (encoding)
is based on the definition of a decreasing sequence of cylinder partitions, and
the first problem is to verify whether or not the given combinatorial encoding
has the property of distinguishability, which means that our encoding is an
isomorphism, or, equivalently, the limit of the increasing sequence of finite
partitions is the partition into singletons $\bmod\,0$. This is a
generalization of the problem of generators in ergodic theory.
  The existence of a suitable $\N$-graded graph is equivalent to the so-called
standardness of the orbit partition in the sense of the theory of filtrations
in measure spaces.
  In the last section, we define the notion of a so-called transfer, a
transformation of paths in a graded graph, as a generalization of the shift in
stationary dynamics.

devices to measure plasma parameter like electron density and temperature based
on the concept of active plasma resonance spectroscopy. The dynamical
interaction between the probe and the plasma in electrostatic, kinetic
description can be modeled in an abstract notation based on functional analytic
methods. These methods provide the opportunity to derive a general solution,
which is given as the response function of the probe-plasma system. It is
defined by the matrix elements of the resolvent of an appropriate dynamical

this manuscript an explicit response function of the multipole resonance probe
is derived. Therefore, the resolvent is determined by its algebraic
representation based on an expansion in orthogonal basis functions. This allows
to compute an approximated response function and its corresponding spectra,

medical imaging, with the potential to function as clinical aid to
radiologists. However, DL models in medical imaging are often trained on public
research cohorts with images acquired with a single scanner or with strict
protocol harmonization, which is not representative of a clinical setting. The
aim of this study was to investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen
clinical data sets---collected with different scanners, protocols and disease
populations---and whether more heterogeneous training data improves
generalization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple dementia
research cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually rated by a
neuroradiologist according to Scheltens' scale of medial temporal atrophy
(MTA), were included in this study. By training multiple versions of a
convolutional neural network on different subsets of this data to predict MTA
ratings, we assessed the impact of including images from a wider distribution
during training had on performance in external memory clinic data. Our results
showed that our model generalized well to data sets acquired with similar
protocols as the training data, but substantially worse in clinical cohorts
with visibly different tissue contrasts in the images. This implies that future
DL studies investigating performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) MRI data need
to assess multiple external cohorts for reliable results. Further, by including
data from a wider range of scanners and protocols the performance improved in
OOD data, which suggests that more heterogeneous training data makes the model
generalize better. To conclude, this is the most comprehensive study to date
investigating the domain shift in deep learning on MRI data, and we advocate
rigorous evaluation of DL models on clinical data prior to being certified for
deployment.

design purposes. However, computing the probability of rare events can be
expensive because only a few events, if any, can be observed. To this end, it
is necessary to accelerate the observation of rare events using methods such as
the importance splitting technique, which is the main focus here. In this work,
it is shown how a genealogical importance splitting technique can be made more
efficient if one knows how the rare event occurs in terms of the mean path
followed by the observables. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that
one can estimate this path using less rare paths. A self-similarity model is
formulated and tested using an a priori and a posteriori analysis. The
self-similarity principle is also tested on more complex systems including a
turbulent combustion problem with $10^7$ degrees of freedom. While the
self-similarity model is shown to not be strictly valid in general, it can
still provide a good approximation of the rare mean paths and is a promising
route for obtaining the statistics of rare events in chaotic high-dimensional
systems.

reviewing the logs for identifying issues is the scale - there could easily be
millions of entities, each described by hundreds of features. In this paper we
present a fast dimensional analysis framework that automates the root cause

The technical benefits of APIs have been reported in numerous studies. Several
reports from industry offer useful practical design considerations for APIs,
including advice on collecting usage data, monetization strategies, and at what
point to open an API to external parties. Although this advice can be useful,
the focus is still often on the API, only without considering the role the API
plays in the wider organization or how it fits into an organizational strategy.
Our industrial experiences show that more information is needed about the
challenges and best practices of API design and management in an organizational
context. Furthermore, it has become apparent that APIs are able to play a key
role as part of a strategic business plan for software-intensive companies. In
this report, we present the results of our work with companies to build a

one-stop solution for device interaction in the IoT. We show how rIoT exploits
similarities between contexts and employs a decision-tree like method to
adaptively capture a user's preferences from a small number of interactions
with the IoT space. We measure the performance of rIoT on two real-world data
sets and a real mobile device in terms of accuracy, learning speed, and latency
in comparison to two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

  from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Sensing Data",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transit ridership flow and origin-destination (O-D) information is essential
for enhancing transit network design, optimizing transit route and improving
service. The effectiveness and preciseness of the traditional survey-based and
smart card data-driven method for O-D information inference have multiple
disadvantages due to the insufficient sample, the high time and energy cost,
and the lack of inferring results validation. By considering the ubiquity of
smart mobile devices in the world, several methods were developed for
estimating the transit ridership flow from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensing data by
filtering out the non-passenger MAC addresses based on the predefined
thresholds. However, the accuracy of the filtering methods is still
questionable for the indeterminate threshold values and the lack of
quantitative results validation. By combining the consideration of the assumed
overlapped feature space of passenger and non-passenger with the above
concerns, a three steps data-driven method for estimating transit ridership
flow and O-D information from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensing data is proposed in
this paper. The observed ridership flow is used as ground truth for calculating
the performance measurements. According to the results, the proposed approach
outperformed all selected baseline models and existing filtering methods. The
findings of this study can help to provide real-time and precise transit
ridership flow and O-D information for supporting transit vehicle management
and the quality of service enhancement.

cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs,
vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body
shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial
robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we
challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded
body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams.
Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4
+/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches
primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to
rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s
traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells
nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired
by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot
with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots.
Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded
shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than
shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce
terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body
reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the
need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain

study of a motor-complete spinal cord injury user (AIS A, Th12) walking with a
powered exoskeleton on even and uneven ground over multiple sessions after
extensive training. Measurements with compliant or rigid exoskeleton knee
joints were performed on three different days for each configuration. Body
motion and crutch ground interaction forces were recorded to assess gait
performance. We observed higher walking speeds with a compliant exoskeleton
knee configuration (mean: 0.116 m/s on uneven and 0.145 m/s on even ground)
compared to a rigid configuration (mean: 0.083 m/s and 0.100 m/s). Crutch force
impulse was significantly reduced in the compliant configuration. Lastly, gait
was more symmetric when the knee joints were compliant. In conclusion,
compliant exoskeleton knee joints can help maneuver uneven ground faster and
with less user effort than rigid joints. Based on our findings, exoskeleton
designers should consider introducing compliance into their design to increase
gait robustness and performance, and render exoskeletons more suitable for

  Sorger","Strain-Engineered High Responsivity MoTe2 Photodetector for Silicon
  Photonic Integrated Circuits",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In integrated photonics, specific wavelengths are preferred such as 1550 nm
due to low-loss transmission and the availability of optical gain in this
spectral region. For chip-based photodetectors, layered two-dimensional (2D)
materials bear scientific and technologically-relevant properties leading to
strong light-matter-interaction devices due to effects such as reduced coulomb
screening or excitonic states. However, no efficient photodetector in the
telecommunication C-band using 2D materials has been realized yet. Here, we
demonstrate a MoTe2-based photodetector featuring strong photoresponse
(responsivity = 0.5 A/W) operating at 1550nm on silicon photonic waveguide
enabled by engineering the strain (4%) inside the photo-absorbing
transition-metal-dichalcogenide film. We show that an induced tensile strain of
~4% reduces the bandgap of MoTe2 by about 0.2 eV by microscopically measuring
the work-function across the device. Unlike Graphene-based photodetectors
relying on a gapless band structure, this semiconductor-2D material detector
shows a ~100X improved dark current enabling an efficient noise-equivalent
power of just 90 pW/Hz^0.5. Such strain-engineered integrated photodetector
provides new opportunities for integrated optoelectronic systems.
