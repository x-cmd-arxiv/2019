response variable and tensor-structured predictors, such that the regression
parameters form a tensor of order $d$ (i.e., a $d$-fold multiway array) in
$\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}$. It focuses on the task
of estimating the regression tensor from $m$ realizations of the response
variable and the predictors where $m\ll n = \prod \nolimits_{i} n_i$. Despite
the seeming ill-posedness of this problem, it can still be solved if the
parameter tensor belongs to the space of sparse, low Tucker-rank tensors.
Accordingly, the estimation procedure is posed as a non-convex optimization
program over the space of sparse, low Tucker-rank tensors, and a tensor variant
of projected gradient descent is proposed to solve the resulting non-convex
problem. In addition, mathematical guarantees are provided that establish the
proposed method linearly converges to an appropriate solution under a certain
set of conditions. Further, an upper bound on sample complexity of tensor
parameter estimation for the model under consideration is characterized for the
special case when the individual (scalar) predictors independently draw values
from a sub-Gaussian distribution. The sample complexity bound is shown to have
a polylogarithmic dependence on $\bar{n} = \max \big\{n_i: i\in \{1,2,\ldots,d
\} \big\}$ and, orderwise, it matches the bound one can obtain from a heuristic
parameter counting argument. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed tensor model and estimation method on a synthetic
dataset and a collection of neuroimaging datasets pertaining to attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder. Specifically, the proposed method exhibits
better sample complexities on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model and the method in settings where $n \gg m$.

exploration and exploitation in the optimal control of partially unknown
systems. While the problem can be cast in the framework of stochastic dynamic
programming, exact solutions are only tractable for discrete state and action
spaces of very small dimension due to a series of nested minimization and
expectation operations. We propose an approximate dual control method for
systems with continuous state and input domain based on a rollout dynamic
programming approach, splitting the control horizon into a dual and an
exploitation part. The dual part is approximated using a scenario tree
generated by sampling the process noise and the unknown system parameters, for
which the underlying distribution is updated via Bayesian estimation along the
horizon. In the exploitation part, we fix the resulting parameter estimate of
each scenario branch and compute an open-loop control sequence for the
remainder of the horizon. The key benefit of the proposed sampling-based
approximation is that it enables the formulation as one optimization problem
that computes a collection of control sequences over the scenario tree, leading
to a dual model predictive control formulation.

task. In this thesis it is argued that in general there is insufficient
information in a single task for a learner to generalise well and that what is
required for good generalisation is information about many similar learning
tasks. Similar learning tasks form a body of prior information that can be used
to constrain the learner and make it generalise better. Examples of learning
scenarios in which there are many similar tasks are handwritten character
recognition and spoken word recognition.
  The concept of the environment of a learner is introduced as a probability
measure over the set of learning problems the learner might be expected to
learn. It is shown how a sample from the environment may be used to learn a
representation, or recoding of the input space that is appropriate for the
environment. Learning a representation can equivalently be thought of as
learning the appropriate features of the environment. Bounds are derived on the
sample size required to ensure good generalisation from a representation
learning process. These bounds show that under certain circumstances learning a
representation appropriate for $n$ tasks reduces the number of examples
required of each task by a factor of $n$.
  Once a representation is learnt it can be used to learn novel tasks from the
same environment, with the result that far fewer examples are required of the
new tasks to ensure good generalisation. Bounds are given on the number of
tasks and the number of samples from each task required to ensure that a
representation will be a good one for learning novel tasks.
  The results on representation learning are generalised to cover any form of

chemistry in microdroplets are increasingly being investigated for catalysis.
The mechanisms underlying the enhanced reactivity in alternate solvent
environments, and whether the enhanced reactivity due to nanoconfinement is a
universal phenomenon, are not fully understood. Here, we use ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the free energy of a
retro-Diels-Alder reaction in bulk water at very different densities and in
water nanoconfined by parallel graphene sheets. We find that the broadly
different global solvation environments accelerate the reactions to a similar
degree with respect to the gas phase reaction, with activation free energies
that do not differ by more than kbT from each other. The reason for the same
acceleration factor in the extremely different solvation environments is that
it is the microsolvation of the dienophile's carbonyl group that governs the
transition state stabilization and mechanism, which is not significantly
disrupted by either the lower density in bulk water or the strong
nanoconfinement conditions used here. Our results also suggest that significant
acceleration of Diels Alder reactions in microdroplets or on-water conditions
can't arise from local microsolvation when water is present, but instead must
come from highly altered reaction environments that drastically change the
reaction mechanisms.

  Models for Image Description","145 pages, 41 figures, 15 tables, Doctoral thesis",,,,"cs.NE cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A neural language model can be conditioned into generating descriptions for
images by providing visual information apart from the sentence prefix. This
visual information can be included into the language model through different
points of entry resulting in different neural architectures. We identify four
main architectures which we call init-inject, pre-inject, par-inject, and
merge.
  We analyse these four architectures and conclude that the best performing one
is init-inject, which is when the visual information is injected into the
initial state of the recurrent neural network. We confirm this using both
automatic evaluation measures and human annotation.
  We then analyse how much influence the images have on each architecture. This
is done by measuring how different the output probabilities of a model are when
a partial sentence is combined with a completely different image from the one
it is meant to be combined with. We find that init-inject tends to quickly
become less influenced by the image as more words are generated. A different
architecture called merge, which is when the visual information is merged with
the recurrent neural network's hidden state vector prior to output, loses
visual influence much more slowly, suggesting that it would work better for
generating longer sentences.
  We also observe that the merge architecture can have its recurrent neural
network pre-trained in a text-only language model (transfer learning) rather
than be initialised randomly as usual. This results in even better performance
than the other architectures, provided that the source language model is not
too good at language modelling or it will overspecialise and be less effective
at image description generation.

explainable AI, and transfer learning.

  Estimator","Updated version",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers estimation of a random variable in Poisson noise with
signal scaling coefficient and dark current as explicit parameters of the noise
model. Specifically, the paper focuses on properties of the conditional mean
estimator as a function of the scaling coefficient, the dark current parameter,
the distribution of the input random variable and channel realizations. With
respect to the scaling coefficient and the dark current, several identities in
terms of derivatives are established. For example, it is shown that the
gradient of the conditional mean estimator with respect to the scaling
coefficient and dark current parameter is proportional to the conditional
variance. Moreover, a score function is proposed and a Tweedie-like formula for
the conditional expectation is recovered. With respect to the distribution,
several regularity conditions are shown. For instance, it is shown that the
conditional mean estimator uniquely determines the input distribution.
Moreover, it is shown that if the conditional expectation is close to a linear
function in terms of mean squared error, then the input distribution is
approximately gamma in the L\'evy distance. Furthermore, sufficient and
necessary conditions for linearity are found. Interestingly, it is shown that
the conditional mean estimator cannot be linear when the dark current parameter
of the Poisson noise is non-zero.

however, that prevent a broader adoption of this technology is the need for

Inno-EAV, an open-source charging framework for EAVs that employs
machine-to-machine (M2M) distributed communication. The idea behind M2M is to
have networked devices that can interact, exchange information and perform
actions without any manual assistance of humans. The advantages of the Inno-EAV
include the automation of charging processes and the collection of relevant

significant attention. However, up to date, the specific mechanisms of these

Hartree-Fock variational method, we have explained the correlated insulating
states and QAH effects at various integer fillings of the flat bands in TBG.
Our results indicate that states breaking flavor (valley and spin) symmetries
are energetically favored at all integer fillings. In particular, the
correlated insulating states at $\pm 1/2$ filling and at the charge neutrality
point are all valley polarized sates which break $C_{2z}$ and time-reversal
($\mathcal{T}$) symmetries, but preserves $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Such
valley polarized states exhibit ""moir\'e orbital antiferromagnetic ordering"" on
an emergent honeycomb lattice with compensating circulating current pattern in
the moir\'e supercell. Within the same theoretical framework, our calculations
indicate that the $C\!=\!\mp 1$ QAH states at $\pm 3/4$ fillings of the
magic-angle TBG are spin and orbital ferromagnetic states, which emerge when a
staggered sublattice potential is present. We find that the nonlocalness of the
exchange interactions tend to enhance the bandwidth of the low-energy bands due
to the exchange-hole effect, which reduces the gaps of the correlated insulator
phases. The nonlocal exchange interactions also dramatically enhance the spin
polarization of the system, which significantly stabilize the orbital and spin
ferromagnetic QAH state at $3/4$ filling of TBG aligned with hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN). We also predict that, by virtue of the orbital ferromagnetic
nature, the QAH effects at electron and hole fillings of hBN-aligned TBG would
exhibit hysteresis loops with opposite chiralities.

of a vector dark matter mediator coupling to dark matter particles and quarks.
Translating to a model where the narrow vector resonance interacts only with
quarks, upper limits on this coupling range between 0.10 and 0.15, depending on
the resonance mass. These results represent the most stringent upper limits in
the mass range between 350 and 450 GeV obtained with a flavor-inclusive dijet
resonance search.

the attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) model with very limited adaptation
data from target speakers for end-to-end automatic speech recognition. The
first method is Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, in which the
output distribution of a speaker-dependent (SD) AED is forced to be close to
that of the speaker-independent (SI) model by adding a KLD regularization to
the adaptation criterion. To compensate for the asymmetric deficiency in KLD
regularization, an adversarial speaker adaptation (ASA) method is proposed to
regularize the deep-feature distribution of the SD AED through the adversarial
learning of an auxiliary discriminator and the SD AED. The third approach is
the multi-task learning, in which an SD AED is trained to jointly perform the
primary task of predicting a large number of output units and an auxiliary task
of predicting a small number of output units to alleviate the target sparsity
issue. Evaluated on a Microsoft short message dictation task, all three methods
are highly effective in adapting the AED model, achieving up to 12.2% and 3.0%
word error rate improvement over an SI AED trained from 3400 hours data for
supervised and unsupervised adaptation, respectively.

set of units over multiple time periods where the starting time of the
treatment may vary by unit. The design problem involves selecting an initial
treatment time for each unit in order to most precisely estimate both the
instantaneous and cumulative effects of the treatment. We first consider
non-adaptive experiments, where all treatment assignment decisions are made
prior to the start of the experiment. For this case, we show that the
optimization problem is generally NP-hard, and we propose a near-optimal
solution. Under this solution, the fraction entering treatment each period is
initially low, then high, and finally low again. Next, we study an adaptive
experimental design problem, where both the decision to continue the experiment
and treatment assignment decisions are updated after each period's data is
collected. For the adaptive case, we propose a new algorithm, the
Precision-Guided Adaptive Experiment (PGAE) algorithm, that addresses the
challenges at both the design stage and at the stage of estimating treatment
effects, ensuring valid post-experiment inference accounting for the adaptive
nature of the design. Using realistic settings, we demonstrate that our
proposed solutions can reduce the opportunity cost of the experiments by over
50%, compared to static design benchmarks.

operation, some criteria, such as the simultaneous reduction in operation
costs, losses, and voltage deviations, as well as the increase in reliability
are taken into consideration. Given the capacity of the installed units, a part
of the load of the demanded energy is always supplied by the grid. In line with
the objectives set, planning for the charge and discharge of storage systems as
well as the interaction among distributed power generators are investigated.
The operation process is considered as an optimization problem, and the created
problem is solved by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. In
addition, by implementing the Demand Response (DR) program in the optimal
operation, the acquired results are compared with those obtained when this
strategy is not employed. Simulation results indicate that the utilization of
the Demand Response (DR) program in the optimal operation of the microgrid
leads to a number of improvements. To elucidate it more, in addition to the
decrease in the operation costs of the microgrid, the voltage deviation
indices, reliability, and losses are improved contrary to non-DR schemes.

Through meta-learning, we could bring this cost down by adapting previously

and evaluate it on two unseen datasets of different difficulty. Our results
show that, under resource constraints, the agent effectively adapts its

evaluation on previously unseen environments. We also provide guidelines on the

establishes an ongoing downward flux of condensable elements. To understand the
efficiency of cloud formation, it is therefore crucial to quantify the
replenishment mechanism that is able to compensate for the element losses in
the upper atmosphere, to keep the extrasolar weather cycle running. In this
paper, we introduce a new cloud formation model by combining the cloud particle
moment method of Helling & Woitke with a diffusive mixing approach, taking into
account turbulent mixing and gas-kinetic diffusion for both gas and cloud
particles. The equations are of diffusion-reaction type and are solved
time-dependently for a prescribed 1D atmospheric structure, until the model has
relaxed toward a time-independent solution. In comparison to our previous
models, the new hot Jupiter model results (Teff=2000K, log g=3) show fewer but
larger cloud particles which are more concentrated towards the cloud base. The
abundances of condensable elements in the gas phase are featured by a steep
decline above the cloud base, followed by a shallower, monotonous decrease
towards a plateau, the level of which depends on temperature. The chemical
composition of the cloud particles also differs significantly from our previous
models. Due to the condensation of specific condensates like Mg2SiO4[s] in
deeper layers, certain elements, such as Mg, are almost entirely removed from
the gas phase early. This leads to unusual (and non-solar) element ratios in
higher atmospheric layers, which then favours the formation of SiO[s] and
SiO2[s], for example, rather than MgSiO3[s]. Such condensates are not expected
in phase-equilibrium models that start from solar abundances. Above the main
silicate cloud layer, which is enriched with iron and metal oxides, we find a
second cloud layer made of Na2S[s] particles in cooler models (Teff<1500K).

(even) boson, and the latter further decays to a b quark pair. The Z boson is
reconstructed via its decays to electron or muon pairs. The analysed data were
recorded in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = $
13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. Data and predictions from the
standard model are in agreement within the uncertainties. Upper limits at 95%
confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching
fraction, with masses of the new bosons up to 1000 GeV. The results are
interpreted in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet model.

science and engineering to collect samples of multiple network data in which a
network serves as a basic data object. The increasing prevalence of multiple
network data calls for developments of models and theory that can deal with
inference problems for populations of networks. In this work, we propose a
general procedure for hypothesis testing of networks and in particular, for
differentiating distributions of two samples of networks. We consider a very
general framework which allows us to perform tests on large and sparse
networks. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) We propose a test statistics based
on the singular value of a generalized Wigner matrix. The asymptotic null
distribution of the statistics is shown to follow the Tracy--Widom distribution
as the number of nodes tends to infinity. The test also yields asymptotic power
guarantee with the power tending to one under the alternative; (2) The test
procedure is adapted for change-point detection in dynamic networks which is
proven to be consistent in detecting the change-points. In addition to
theoretical guarantees, another appealing feature of this adapted procedure is
that it provides a principled and simple method for selecting the threshold
that is also allowed to vary with time. Extensive simulation studies and real
data analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our procedure with
competitors.

misclassifications for otherwise statistically accurate models. In this paper
we study how the choice of optimization algorithm influences the robustness of
the resulting classifier to adversarial examples. Specifically we show an
example of a learning problem for which the solution found by adaptive
optimization algorithms exhibits qualitatively worse robustness properties
against both $L_{2}$- and $L_{\infty}$-adversaries than the solution found by
non-adaptive algorithms. Then we fully characterize the geometry of the loss
landscape of $L_{2}$-adversarial training in least-squares linear regression.
The geometry of the loss landscape is subtle and has important consequences for
optimization algorithms. Finally we provide experimental evidence which
suggests that non-adaptive methods consistently produce more robust models than

network-based reconstruction, which enables both accurate and fast

spatial regularization and the capacity for the reconstruction. We evaluated
the method using MRF T1-FF, an MRF sequence for T1 relaxation time of water

benefit of incorporating spatial regularization during the reconstruction and
demonstrate that the method learns meaningful features from MR physics
perspective. Further, we investigate the ability of the method to handle highly
heterogeneous morphometric variations and its generalization to anatomical
regions unseen during training. The obtained results outperform the
state-of-the-art in deep learning-based MRF reconstruction. The method achieved
normalized root mean squared errors of 0.048 $\pm$ 0.011 for T1H2O maps and

century has seen considerable progress in data collection practices and methods

the role of migration in population redistribution. Coupling the extensive
range of migration data now available with these recent theoretical and
methodological advances, we endeavour to advance beyond Ravenstein's
understanding by examining the direction of population redistribution and
comparing the impact of internal migration on patterns of human settlement in
27 European countries. Results show that the overall redistributive impact of
internal migration is low in most European countries but the mechanisms differ
across the continent. In Southern and Eastern Europe migration effectiveness is
above average but is offset by low migration intensities, whereas in Northern
and Western Europe high intensities are absorbed in reciprocal flows resulting
in low migration effectiveness. About half the European countries are
experiencing a process of concentration toward urbanised regions, particularly
in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, whereas countries in the West and
South are undergoing a process of population deconcentration. These results
suggest that population deconcentration is now more common than it was in the
1990s when counterurbanisation was limited to Western Europe. The results show
that 130 years on, Ravenstein's law of migration streams and counter-streams
remains a central facet of migration dynamics, while underlining the importance

behaviors and patterns of interaction with other vehicles. In this paper, we
propose an LSTM-based trajectory prediction method for human drivers which can
help the autonomous vehicle make better decisions, especially in urban
intersection scenarios. Meanwhile, in order to collect human drivers' driving
behavior data in the urban scenario, we describe a system called UrbanFlow
which includes the whole procedure from raw bird's-eye view data collection via
drone to the final processed trajectories. The system is mainly intended for
urban scenarios but can be extended to be used for any traffic scenarios.

with gesture recognition via sparse multichannel surface Electromyography
(sEMG) signals, the paper proposes a novel deep learning model, referred to as
the XceptionTime architecture. The proposed innovative XceptionTime is designed
by integration of depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive average pooling,
and a novel non-linear normalization technique. At the heart of the proposed
architecture is several XceptionTime modules concatenated in series fashion
designed to capture both temporal and spatial information-bearing contents of
the sparse multichannel sEMG signals without the need for data augmentation
and/or manual design of feature extraction. In addition, through integration of
adaptive average pooling, Conv1D, and the non-linear normalization approach,
XceptionTime is less prone to overfitting, more robust to temporal translation
of the input, and more importantly is independent from the input window size.
Finally, by utilizing the depthwise separable convolutions, the XceptionTime
network has far fewer parameters resulting in a less complex network. The
performance of XceptionTime is tested on a sub Ninapro dataset, DB1, and the
results showed a superior performance in comparison to any existing
counterparts. In this regard, 5:71% accuracy improvement, on a window size
200ms, is reported in this paper, for the first time.

applications to other domains, such as the IoT (the Internet of Things) and

devices, and robots. The mathematical model represents such entities as
individual processes in Hoare's CSP model. Given a network of interacting
entities, called an \emph{environment}, and a temporal specification of
long-term behavior, the synthesis method constructs a \emph{coordinator}
process (if one exists) that guides the actions of the environment entities so
that the combined system is deadlock-free and satisfies the given

\emph{partial knowledge} of the environment state, due to non-determinism
within the environment, and environment actions that are hidden from the
coordinator. This is the first method to handle both sources of partial
knowledge, and to do so for arbitrary linear temporal logic specifications. It
is shown that the coordination synthesis problem is \PSPACE-hard in the size of

  This work develops a non-intrusive method to efficiently and accurately
approximate the expensive nonlinear terms that arise in reduced nonlinear

using only the simulation data used to construct the reduced basis and
evaluations of the nonlinear terms at these snapshots. Once trained, the neural

models has long been an important research problem. Its importance has further
increased recently due to the growing need for large-scale datasets to train
deep learning models. Weak or noisy supervision could originate from multiple
sources including non-expert annotators or automatic labeling based on
heuristics or user interaction signals. There is an extensive amount of
previous work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work
has shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting
approach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to
noisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as
label correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label
correction procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based
framework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels.
Specifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce
corrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage
the corrected labeled. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level
optimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise
levels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks. We
compare the reweighing and correction approaches showing that the correction
framing addresses some of the limitation of reweighting. We also show that the
proposed MLC approach achieves large improvements over previous methods in many

modeling diffusion remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we present a dynamic
contact graph model for generating contact networks with direct and indirect

of a node for capturing indirect transmission links. The SPDT graph model
builds on activity driven time-varying network modelling for generating dynamic
contact networks using simple statistical distributions. This model is fitted
with a large city-scale empirical dataset using maximum likelihood estimation
methods. Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated by analysing the
capability of capturing the network properties observed in empirical graphs

decay rate of the velocity so that the global solutions in $3D$ can be

paper, by exploiting the anisotropic decay rates of the velocity, which are
even not integrable, we prove the global well-posedness in both $2D$ and $3D$,
without any low frequency assumption of the initial data. One of key
observations here is a cancelation in nonlinear estimates of the viscous stress

propose two networks: 1) Auto-Fusion, which learns to compress information from
different modalities while preserving the context, and 2) GAN-Fusion, which
regularizes the learned latent space given context from complementing
modalities. A quantitative evaluation on the tasks of multimodal machine
translation and emotion recognition suggests that our lightweight, adaptive

symmetrized so that an entropy pair is obtained. We design an affordable fully
consistent two-point entropy conservative flux, which is not only consistent
with the physical flux, but also maintains the zero parallel magnetic
component, and then construct high-order accurate semi-discrete entropy stable
DG schemes based on the quadrature rules and the entropy conservative and
stable fluxes. They satisfy the semidiscrete entropy inequality for the given

accuracy and the ability to capture discontinuities of our schemes. Moreover,
our entropy conservative flux is compared to an existing flux through some
numerical tests. The results show that the zero parallel magnetic component in
the numerical flux can help to decrease the error in the parallel magnetic

similar results since the error in the magnetic field divergence seems

A data collector
wants to obtain data from individuals to perform some computations. To relieve
the privacy threat to the contributors, the data collector adopts a
privacy-preserving mechanism by adding random noise to the computation result,
at the cost of reduced accuracy. Individuals decide whether to contribute data
when faced with the privacy issue. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty in privacy
protection, we model individuals' privacy-related decision using Prospect
Theory. Such a theory more accurately models individuals' behavior under
uncertainty than the traditional expected utility theory, whose prediction
always deviates from practical human behavior. We show that the data
collector's utility maximization problem involves a polynomial of high and
fractional order, the root of which is difficult to compute analytically. We
get around this issue by considering a large population approximation, and
obtain a closed-form solution that well approximates the precise solution. We
discover that the data collector who considers the more realistic Prospect
Theory based individual decision modeling would adopt a more conservative
privacy-preserving mechanism, compared with the case based on the expected
utility theory modeling. We also study the impact of Prospect Theory
parameters, and concludes that more loss-averse or risk-seeking individuals
will trigger a more conservative mechanism. When individuals have different
Prospect Theory parameters, simulations demonstrate that the privacy protection
first becomes stronger and then becomes weaker as the heterogeneity increases

CaAl2Si2 as a system hosting a topological nodal-line setting around the

the SOC, the fragile nodal-line will be gapped and a pair of Dirac points
emerge along the high symmetric {\Gamma}-A direction, which is about 1.22 eV

significant degradation in model generalization. A promising method to address
this is to perform mixed-precision quantization, where more sensitive layers
are kept at higher precision. However, the search space for a mixed-precision
quantization is exponential in the number of layers. Recent work has proposed
HAWQ, a novel Hessian based framework, with the aim of reducing this
exponential search space by using second-order information. While promising,
this prior work has three major limitations: (i) HAWQV1 only uses the top
Hessian eigenvalue as a measure of sensitivity and do not consider the rest of
the Hessian spectrum; (ii) HAWQV1 approach only provides relative sensitivity
of different layers and therefore requires a manual selection of the
mixed-precision setting; and (iii) HAWQV1 does not consider mixed-precision
activation quantization. Here, we present HAWQV2 which addresses these
shortcomings. For (i), we perform a theoretical analysis showing that a better
sensitivity metric is to compute the average of all of the Hessian eigenvalues.
For (ii), we develop a Pareto frontier based method for selecting the exact bit
precision of different layers without any manual selection. For (iii), we
extend the Hessian analysis to mixed-precision activation quantization. We have
found this to be very beneficial for object detection. We show that HAWQV2

addressed with restratification techniques, where observations are reweighted

Yet, restratifaction is rarely evaluated for improving prediction. In this

techniques, finding they provide no improvement and often even degraded
prediction accuracies across four tasks of esimating U.S. county population

address these problems: (1) estimator redistribution to account for shrinking,
as well as (2) adaptive binning and (3) informed smoothing to handle sparse

in which the satellite lines at 1612 and 1720\,MHz flip -- one from emission to
absorption and the other the reverse -- across a closely blended double
feature. We highlight 30 examples of the flip from the literature, 27 of which
exhibit the same orientation with respect to velocity: the 1720\,MHz line is
seen in emission at more negative velocities. These same examples are also
observed toward bright background continuum, many (perhaps all) show stimulated
emission, and 23 of these are coincident in on-sky position and velocity with
H\textsc{ii}~radio recombination lines. To explain these remarkable
correlations we propose that the 1720\,MHz stimulated emission originates in
heated and compressed post-shock gas expanding away from a central
H\textsc{ii}~region, which collides with cooler and more diffuse gas hosting
the 1612\,MHz stimulated emission. The foreground gas dominates the spectrum
due to the bright central continuum, hence the expanding post-shock gas is
blue-shifted relative to the stationary pre-shock gas. We employ non-LTE
excitation modelling to examine this scenario, and find that indeed FIR
emission from warm dust adjacent to the H\textsc{ii}~region radiatively pumps
the 1612 MHz line in the diffuse, cool gas ahead of the expanding shock front,
while collisional pumping in the warm, dense shocked gas inverts the 1720 MHz

repetitions within utterances, (iii) overuse frequent words, and (iv) at a
deeper level, contain logical flaws. In this work we show how all of these
problems can be addressed by extending the recently introduced unlikelihood
loss (Welleck et al., 2019) to these cases. We show that appropriate loss
functions which regularize generated outputs to match human distributions are
effective for the first three issues. For the last important general issue, we
show applying unlikelihood to collected data of what a model should not do is
effective for improving logical consistency, potentially paving the way to
generative models with greater reasoning ability. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach across several dialogue tasks.

forgetting to find minority examples without prior knowledge of the spurious

show how these examples are related to minorities in our training sets. Then,
we introduce a new approach to robustify models by fine-tuning our models

PPVAE decouples the text generation module from the condition representation

emerges, only a lightweight network needs to be trained and works as a plug-in
for PPVAE, which is efficient and desirable for real-world applications.

the future given user historical behaviors. The order of user behaviors implies
that there are resourceful sequential patterns embedded in the behavior history
which reveal the underlying dynamics of user interests. Various sequential
recommendation methods are proposed to model the dynamic user behaviors.
However, most of the models only consider the user's own behaviors and
dynamics, while ignoring the collaborative relations among users and items,
i.e., similar tastes of users or analogous properties of items. Without
modeling collaborative relations, those methods suffer from the lack of
recommendation diversity and thus may have worse performance. Worse still, most
existing methods only consider the user-side sequence and ignore the temporal
dynamics on the item side. To tackle the problems of the current sequential
recommendation models, we propose Sequential Collaborative Recommender (SCoRe)
which effectively mines high-order collaborative information using
cross-neighbor relation modeling and, additionally utilizes both user-side and
item-side historical sequences to better capture user and item dynamics.
Experiments on three real-world yet large-scale datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed model over strong baselines.

The true random numbers generated by TRNG are typically applied to the

Recently, TRNGs have also been employed in emerging stochastic computing
paradigm for reducing power consumption. Roughly speaking, TRNG can be divided
into circuits-based, e.g., oscillator sampling or directly noise amplifying;
and quantum physics-based, e.g., photoelectric effect. The former generally
requires a large area and has a large power consumption, whereas the latter is
intrinsic random but is more difficult to implement and usually requires
additional post-processing circuitry. Very recently, magnetic skyrmion has
become a promising candidate for implementing TRNG because of their nanometer
size, high stability, and intrinsic thermal Brownian motion dynamics. In this
work, we propose a TRNG based on continuous skyrmion thermal Brownian motion in
a confined geometry at room temperature. True random bitstream can be easily
obtained by periodically detecting the relative position of the skyrmion
without the need for additional current pulses. More importantly, we implement
a probability-adjustable TRNG, in which a desired ratio of 0 and 1 can be
acquired by adding an anisotropy gradient through voltage-controlled magnetic
anisotropy (VCMA) effect. The behaviors of the skyrmion-based TRNG are verified
by using micromagnetic simulations. The National Institute of Standards and

  Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases
onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated
explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments
about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our
standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature
intended by the speaker -- that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most
semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in
which people express social biases and power differentials in language.
  We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to
model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and
stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference
Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured
annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a
thousand demographic groups.
  We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias
Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural
models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement
projects unwanted social bias (80% F1), they are not effective at spelling out
more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates
future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense
reasoning on social implications.

worthwhile to express solutions in an invariant manner in terms of torsion
invariants to distinguish between different solutions. In this paper we discuss
the symmetries of teleparallel gravity theories, describe the classification of
the torsion tensor and its covariant derivative and define scalar invariants in
terms of the torsion. In particular, we propose a modification of the
Cartan-Karlhede algorithm for geometries with torsion (and no curvature or

a solution and suggests an alternative frame-based approach to calculating
symmetries. We prove that the only maximally symmetric solution to any theory
of gravitation admitting a non-zero torsion tensor is Minkowski space. As an
illustration we apply the algorithm to six particular exact teleparallel

perform source separation on parallel sentences, isolating what they have in
common in a latent semantic vector, and explaining what is left over with
language-specific latent vectors. Our proposed approach differs from past work
on semantic sentence encoding in two ways. First, by using a variational
probabilistic framework, we introduce priors that encourage source separation,
and can use our model's posterior to predict sentence embeddings for
monolingual data at test time. Second, we use high-capacity transformers as
both data generating distributions and inference networks -- contrasting with
most past work on sentence embeddings. In experiments, our approach
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on a standard suite of

means of transparency and, as such, to shed light on the inner workings of the
architectures. Recently, there has been a growing interest in whether or not
this assumption is correct. In this paper we investigate the interpretability
of multi-head attention in abstractive summarization, a sequence-to-sequence
task for which attention does not have an intuitive alignment role, such as in
machine translation. We first introduce three metrics to gain insight in the
focus of attention heads and observe that these heads specialize towards
relative positions, specific part-of-speech tags, and named entities. However,
we also find that ablating and pruning these heads does not lead to a
significant drop in performance, indicating redundancy. By replacing the
softmax activation functions with sparsemax activation functions, we find that
attention heads behave seemingly more transparent: we can ablate fewer heads
and heads score higher on our interpretability metrics. However, if we apply
pruning to the sparsemax model we find that we can prune even more heads,
raising the question whether enforced sparsity actually improves transparency.

Here we report on the first modeling of spontaneous delta-spot generation as a
result of flux emergence from the turbulent convection zone. Utilizing
state-of-the-art radiative magnetohydrodynamics code R2D2, we simulate the
emergence of a force-free flux tube in the convection zone that stretches down
to -140 Mm. Elevated by large-scale convective upflows, the tube appears on the
photosphere as two emerging bipoles. The opposite polarities collide against
each other due to the subsurface connectivity, and they develop into a pair of
closely-packed delta-spots. The Lorentz force drives the spot rotation and a
strong counter-streaming flow of 10 km/s at the PIL in delta-spots, which, in
tandem with local convection, strengthens the horizontal field to 4 kG and
builds up a highly-sheared PIL. In the atmosphere above the PIL, a flux rope
structure is created. All these processes follow the multi-buoyant segment
theory of the delta-spot formation, and they occur as a natural consequence of
interaction between magnetic flux and turbulent convection, suggesting that the
generation of delta-spots and the resultant flare eruptions may be a
stochastically determined process.

either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix
truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization

perturbation of extra matter fields. Firstly, we propose that the cosmological
constant can be effectively derived from the matter fields and its value varies
with the matter fields perturbing the black hole. Meanwhile, we assume that the
perturbation satisfies the stability condition. This condition means that after
a long time of the perturbation, the black hole solution also belongs to the
family of the RN-AdS solution. After that, based on both the stability
condition and the null energy condition, while using the off-shell variation
method, the first-order and the second-order perturbation inequalities are
derived respectively when the cosmological constant is considered as a dynamic
variable. It is the first time to extend the two perturbation inequalities to
contain the term of the press and volume of thermodynamics. Finally, we perform
the two perturbation inequalities into testing the WCCC for the RN-AdS black
hole under the second-order approximation of the perturbation. It is shown that
if the variation of the cosmological constant is caused by the matter fields,
while the stability condition and the null energy condition are all satisfied,
the black hole cannot be destroyed after the perturbation. In other words, the
WCCC for the RN-AdS black hole is valid under the second-order approximation of
the perturbation.

behavior, and the results have been compared to the spatial travel patterns of
drivers of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in Maryland. The results
of this study showed that first, socio-demographic factors, including education
and income, played a significant role in preferences attributes of participants
for purchasing/leasing an EV and in the commuting travel behavior and pattern
and of EV drivers. Second, environmental issues are the main reason for
purchasing/leasing EVs, but the EV owners who had longer commutes were more
concerned about the price and status of the EV owner and efficiency and
performance than were those with shorter commutes. The results of this study
improve equity in transportation into the future and could be utilized by
transportation authorities, transport investment agencies, and collaborators in
developing and improving emerging transportation systems.

the so-called kinetic mixing and is characterized by the small parameter
$\epsilon$ describing the coupling strength relative to the electric charge

contribution in the Compton-type diagrams only since, in this case, the virtual
dark photon has time-like nature and its propagator has the Breit-Wigner form.
So, near the resonance, $A'$ can manifest itself. The contribution of $A'$ in
the Borsellino diagrams is negligible since, in this case, the virtual dark
photon is space-like, the $A'$ propagator does not peak and the effect is
proportional, at least, to $\epsilon^2$. We calculate the distributions over
the invariant mass of the produced $\ell^+_j \ell^-_j-$ pair and search for the

Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods make inefficient trade-offs between
these concerns by sacrificing one in favor of the other, especially if the
given data has a kernel-based representation. In this paper, we propose a novel
interpretable multiple-kernel prototype learning (IMKPL) to construct highly
interpretable prototypes in the feature space, which are also efficient for the
discriminative representation of the data. Our method focuses on the local
discrimination of the classes in the feature space and shaping the prototypes
based on condensed class-homogeneous neighborhoods of data. Besides, IMKPL
learns a combined embedding in the feature space in which the above objectives
are better fulfilled. When the base kernels coincide with the data dimensions,
this embedding results in a discriminative features selection. We evaluate
IMKPL on several benchmarks from different domains which demonstrate its
superiority to the related state-of-the-art methods regarding both
interpretability and discriminative representation.

sparked tremendous global interest. DL is widely used today and has expanded
into various interesting areas. It is becoming more popular in cross-subject
research, such as studies of smart city systems, which combine computer science
with engineering applications. Human action detection is one of these areas.
Human action detection is an interesting challenge due to its stringent
requirements in terms of computing speed and accuracy. High-accuracy real-time
object tracking is also considered a significant challenge. This paper
integrates the YOLO detection network, which is considered a state-of-the-art
tool for real-time object detection, with motion vectors and the Coyote
Optimization Algorithm (COA) to construct a real-time human action localization
and tracking system. The proposed system starts with the extraction of motion
information from a compressed video stream and the extraction of appearance
information from RGB frames using an object detector. Then, a fusion step
between the two streams is performed, and the results are fed into the proposed
action tracking model. The COA is used in object tracking due to its accuracy
and fast convergence. The basic foundation of the proposed model is the
utilization of motion vectors, which already exist in a compressed video bit
stream and provide sufficient information to improve the localization of the
target action without requiring high consumption of computational resources
compared with other popular methods of extracting motion information, such as
optical flows. This advantage allows the proposed approach to be implemented in
challenging environments where the computational resources are limited, such as
Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

three-way joint embedding network (Semi3-Net), which integrates three branches
(a sketch branch, a natural image branch, and an edgemap branch) to learn more
discriminative cross-domain feature representations for the SBIR task. The key
insight lies with how we cultivate the mutual and subtle relationships amongst
the sketches, natural images, and edgemaps. A semi-heterogeneous feature
mapping is designed to extract bottom features from each domain, where the
sketch and edgemap branches are shared while the natural image branch is
heterogeneous to the other branches. In addition, a joint semantic embedding is
introduced to embed the features from different domains into a common
high-level semantic space, where all of the three branches are shared. To
further capture informative features common to both natural images and the
corresponding edgemaps, a co-attention model is introduced to conduct common
channel-wise feature recalibration between different domains. A hybrid-loss
mechanism is designed to align the three branches, where an alignment loss and
a sketch-edgemap contrastive loss are presented to encourage the network to
learn invariant cross-domain representations. Experimental results on two

data traffic of the cells. The data and voice traffic are extremely important
for the owner of wireless networks because it is directly related to the
revenue and quality of service that users experience. These traffic changes
happen due to a couple of reasons: the subscriber behavior changes due to
special events, making neighbor sites on-air or down, or by shifting the
traffic to the other technologies, e.g. shifting the traffic from 3G to 4G.
Traditionally, in order to keep the network stable, the traffic should be
observed layer by layer during each interval to detect major changes in KPIs,
in large scale telecommunication networks it will be too time-consuming with
the low accuracy of anomaly detection. However, the proposed algorithm is
capable of detecting the abnormal KPIs for each element of the network in a
time-efficient and accurate manner. It observes the traffic layer trends and
classifies them into 8 traffic categories: Normal, Suddenly Increasing,
Gradually Increasing, Suddenly Decreasing, Gradually Decreasing, Faulty Site,
New Site, and Down Site. This classification task enables the vendors and
operators to detect anomalies in their live networks in order to keep the KPIs
in a normal trend. The algorithm is trained and tested on the real dataset over
a cellular network with more than 25000 cells.

fed to the decoder are randomly replaced by special mask tokens. The network is
required to predict the tokens corresponding to those mask tokens by taking
both unmasked context and input speech into consideration. During inference, we
start from all mask tokens and the network iteratively predicts missing tokens

functional significance of coronary stenoses. We combine our previous works for
the analysis of the complete coronary artery tree and the LV myocardium:
Coronary arteries are encoded by two disjoint convolutional autoencoders (CAEs)
and the LV myocardium is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN)
and a CAE. Thereafter, using the extracted encodings of all coronary arteries
and the LV myocardium, patients are classified according to the presence of
functionally significant stenosis, as defined by the invasively measured FFR.
To handle the varying number of coronary arteries in a patient, the
classification is formulated as a multiple instance learning problem and is
performed using an attention-based neural network. Cross-validation experiments
resulted in an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
of $0.74 \pm 0.01$, and showed that the proposed combined analysis outperformed
the analysis of the coronary arteries or the LV myocardium only. The results
demonstrate the feasibility of combining the analyses of the complete coronary
artery tree and the LV myocardium in CCTA images for the detection of patients
with functionally significant stenosis in coronary arteries.

finite element method for the elliptic diffusion equations. The numerical
scheme is based on the classical Galerkin finite element method enhanced by a
flux approximation on the boundary of a prescribed set of arbitrary control
volumes (either the finite element partition itself or dual voronoi mesh, etc).
The numerical approximations can be characterized as the solution of a
constrained-minimization problem with constraints given by the flux
conservation equations on each control volume. The discrete linear system is a
typical saddle-point problem, but with less number of degrees of freedom than
the standard mixed finite element method, particularly for elements of high

application domains. However, on-device inference on battery-powered,
resource-constrained embedding systems is often infeasible due to prohibitively
long inferencing time and resource requirements of many DNNs. Offloading
computation into the cloud is often unacceptable due to privacy concerns, high
latency, or the lack of connectivity. While compression algorithms often
succeed in reducing inferencing times, they come at the cost of reduced
accuracy. This paper presents a new, alternative approach to enable efficient
execution of DNNs on embedded devices. Our approach dynamically determines
which DNN to use for a given input, by considering the desired accuracy and
inference time. It employs machine learning to develop a low-cost predictive
model to quickly select a pre-trained DNN to use for a given input and the
optimization constraint. We achieve this by first off-line training a
predictive model, and then using the learned model to select a DNN model to use
for new, unseen inputs. We apply our approach to two representative DNN
domains: image classification and machine translation. We evaluate our approach
on a Jetson TX2 embedded deep learning platform and consider a range of
influential DNN models including convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
For image classification, we achieve a 1.8x reduction in inference time with a
7.52% improvement in accuracy, over the most-capable single DNN model. For
machine translation, we achieve a 1.34x reduction in inference time over the
most-capable single model, with little impact on the quality of translation.

alumina particles with a nominal size of 500 $\mu$m, captured by high-speed

approximately 1100 projected particles, we determined the acquired charge and
dynamics as a function of relative humidity (RH) and electric field intensity
and compared the results with classical theories. For RH levels of 50\% and
above, more than 85\% of disposed particles were projected, even when the
electric field intensity was at its minimum level. This suggests that, beyond a
critical value of electric field intensity, relative humidity plays a more
critical role in the projection process. We also observed that the charging
time is reduced dramatically for RH levels of 50\% and above, possibly due to
the build-up of thin water films around the particles which can facilitate
charge transfer. In contrast, projected particles at 30\% RH level exhibited an
excessive amount of electric charge, between two to four times than that of
saturation value, which might be attributed to triboelectric charging effects.
Finally, the physics of electrostatic projection is compared and contrasted
with those of induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena, which share similar

of intermediates, which is a critical bottleneck in silico reaction discovery.
Deep reinforcement learning has shown in other domains that a well-trained
agent with little or no prior human knowledge can surpass human performance.
While some effort has been made to adapt machine learning techniques to the
retrosynthesis planning problem, value-added chemical discovery presents unique
challenges. Specifically, the reaction can occur in several different sites in
a molecule, a subtle case that has never been treated in previous works. With a
more versatile formulation of the problem as a Markov decision process, we
address the problem using deep reinforcement learning techniques and present
promising preliminary results.

ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a challenging task in modern machine
learning. Producing solutions to this challenge will bring progress both in the
theoretical understanding of DNNs and in building new architectures
efficiently. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a new
complexity measure based on the concept of {Periodic Spectral Ergodicity} (PSE)
originating from quantum statistical mechanics. Based on this measure a
technique is devised to quantify the complexity of deep neural networks from
the learned weights and traversing the network connectivity in a sequential
manner, hence the term cascading PSE (cPSE), as an empirical complexity
measure. This measure will capture both topological and internal neural
processing complexity simultaneously. Because of this cascading approach, i.e.,
a symmetric divergence of PSE on the consecutive layers, it is possible to use
this measure for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We demonstrate the
usefulness of this measure in practice on two sets of vision models, ResNet and
VGG, and sketch the computation of cPSE for more complex network structures.

  Derivative-Free Batch Nonlinear State Estimation","Accepted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) on
  8 April 2020, # IJR-19-3748; 31 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a Gaussian Variational Inference (GVI) technique that can be
applied to large-scale nonlinear batch state estimation problems. The main
contribution is to show how to fit both the mean and (inverse) covariance of a
Gaussian to the posterior efficiently, by exploiting factorization of the joint
likelihood of the state and data, as is common in practical problems. This is
different than Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, which seeks the point
estimate for the state that maximizes the posterior (i.e., the mode). The
proposed Exactly Sparse Gaussian Variational Inference (ESGVI) technique stores
the inverse covariance matrix, which is typically very sparse (e.g.,
block-tridiagonal for classic state estimation). We show that the only blocks
of the (dense) covariance matrix that are required during the calculations
correspond to the non-zero blocks of the inverse covariance matrix, and further
show how to calculate these blocks efficiently in the general GVI problem.
ESGVI operates iteratively, and while we can use analytical derivatives at each
iteration, Gaussian cubature can be substituted, thereby producing an efficient
derivative-free batch formulation. ESGVI simplifies to precisely the
Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother in the batch linear estimation case, but
goes beyond the 'extended' RTS smoother in the nonlinear case since it finds
the best-fit Gaussian (mean and covariance), not the MAP point estimate. We
demonstrate the technique on controlled simulation problems and a batch
nonlinear Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem with an
experimental dataset.

can bring about social benefits, such as alleviating congestion and its adverse
environmental impacts, as well as personal benefits in terms of shorter travel

goal is to study the impact of availability of carpool lanes and traffic
conditions on ridesharing demand using an agent based simulation model. Agents
will be given the option to use their personal vehicles, or participate in a
ridesharing system. An exact many to many ride matching algorithm, where each
driver can pick up and drop off multiple passengers and each passenger can
complete his or her trip by transferring between multiple vehicle, is used to
match drivers with passengers. The proposed approach is implemented in AnyLogic
ABS software with a real travel data set of Los Angeles, California. The
results of this research will shed light on the types of urban settings that

the effect of bias on the predicted outcomes, introducing mitigation techniques

However, these works have been conducted in isolation, without a unifying
framework to organize efforts within the field. This leads to repetitive
approaches, and puts an undue focus on the effects of bias, rather than on
their origins. Research focused on bias symptoms rather than the underlying
origins could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this
paper, we propose a unifying conceptualization: the predictive bias framework
for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and propose a general mathematical
definition of predictive bias in NLP along with a conceptual framework,
differentiating four main origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model
overamplification, and semantic bias. We discuss how past work has countered
each bias origin. Our framework serves to guide an introductory overview of
predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure and
opening avenues for future research.

extensively studied with aids of nanofabrication technology for a decade. While
theoretical and experimental advances pushed the phenomenon to seminal
innovative applications, its basic observation has relied only on an indirect
analysis such as current-voltage relation or fluorescent imaging adjacent to
the nanostructures. Here we experimentally, for the first time, demonstrated a
direct visualization of perm-selective ion transportation through the
nanostructures using an ionic plasma generation. A micro/nanofluidic device was
employed for a micro bubble formation, plasma negation and penetration of the
plasma through the nanojunction. The direct observation provided a keen
evidence of perm-selectivity, i.e. allowing cationic species and rejecting
anionic species. Furthermore, we can capture the plasma of Li+, which has lower
mobility than Na+ in aqueous state, passed the nanojunction faster than Na+ due
to the absence of hydrated shells around Li+. This simple, but essential
visualization technique would be effective means not only for advancing the
fundamental nanoscale electrokinetic study but also for providing the insight
of new innovative engineering applications.

  study",,,,,"physics.soc-ph eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lightning is a natural phenomenon that takes place all around the world. The
enormous amount of energy released by lightning is extremely ruinous, so some
suitable protection schemes are required for power systems to minimize its
destructive effects. Given that the lightning surge passes through the
transmission line, the destruction caused by lightning would not always happen
at the strike point. Hence, the failure could take place at a point far from
the striking point. This paper investigates factors affecting the transition of
lightning surges through underground cables. These cables are utilized to
supply a sub-transmission substation whose repeated cable failures have imposed
enormous costs to regional electric distribution companies. To obtain reliable
results, the highly capable software of EMTP was employed to calculate
transient phenomena. In addition, various scenarios were simulated to identify
the effects of some factors, including the effectiveness of surge arresters,
bus-coupler switches, the grounding resistance of sheaths, and the like, on the
susceptibility of the studied substation. Based on simulation results, the
effects of the grounding resistance of cable sheaths at terminations and along
the cable are significant.
