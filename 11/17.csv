Guidance System ALGS. The system aims to propose a model for adaptive learning
environments where two major concerns arising from past studies are being
addressed; the marginal role of the teacher, and the need for a big data
approach. Most past studies marginalized the teacher role in adaptive learning
system, particularly the online ones. The most notable quality about ALGS is
empowering the teacher with the capability of having input in all stages. This
is where the hybrid recommendation system plays a crucial role in the 3-stage
ALGS architecture. The second issue addressed is the need for big data to
enhance the system functionality. The more the data collected by the system,
the more efficient its adaptation functionality which makes it difficult for a
first-time-run system and (or) a first-time user. Accordingly, collaborative
filtering is used at first until adequate data about the user interaction are
collected. ALGS architecture consists of a user, content, and 3-stage
adaptation models.

power-law attenuation, it is needed to use the fractional powers of symmetric
coercive elliptic operators in space and the Caputo tempered fractional
derivative in time. The model studied in this paper is semilinear stochastic
space-time fractional wave equations driven by infinite dimensional
multiplicative white noise and fractional Gaussian noise, because of the
potential fluctuations of the external sources. The purpose of this work is to
discuss the Galerkin finite element approximation for the semilinear stochastic
fractional wave equation. We first provide a complete solution theory, e.g.,
existence, uniqueness, and regularity. Then the space-time multiplicative white
noise and fractional Gaussian noise are discretized, which results in a
regularized stochastic fractional wave equation while introducing a modeling
error in the mean-square sense. We further present a complete regularity theory
for the regularized equation. A standard finite element approximation is used
for the spatial operator, and the mean-square priori estimates for the modeling
error and for the approximation error to the solution of the regularized
problem are established.

which aims to solve common real-world problems of learning new classes
continually. One drawback of standard DNNs is that they are prone to
catastrophic forgetting. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a commonly used
technique to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we demonstrate it can
indeed help the model to output more discriminative results within old classes.
However, it cannot alleviate the problem that the model tends to classify
objects into new classes, causing the positive effect of KD to be hidden and
limited. We observed that an important factor causing catastrophic forgetting
is that the weights in the last fully connected (FC) layer are highly biased in
class incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective
solution motivated by the aforementioned observations to address catastrophic
forgetting. Firstly, we utilize KD to maintain the discrimination within old
classes. Then, to further maintain the fairness between old classes and new
classes, we propose Weight Aligning (WA) that corrects the biased weights in
the FC layer after normal training process. Unlike previous work, WA does not
require any extra parameters or a validation set in advance, as it utilizes the
information provided by the biased weights themselves. The proposed method is
evaluated on ImageNet-1000, ImageNet-100, and CIFAR-100 under various settings.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate
catastrophic forgetting and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

them is XO-6b, which orbits an F5V-type star. Shortly after the discovery, we
started multicolor photometric and radial-velocity follow-up observations of
XO-6b, using the telescopes of Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of
Sciences. Our main scientific goals were to better characterize the planetary
system and to search for transit timing variations. We refined several
planetary and orbital parameters. Based on our measurements, the planet XO-6b
seems to be about 10% larger, which is, however, only about $2\sigma$
difference, but its orbit inclination angle, with respect to the plane of the
sky, seems to be significantly smaller, than it was determined originally by
the discoverers. In this case we found about $9.5\sigma$ difference. Moreover,
we observed periodic transit timing variations of XO-6b with a semi-amplitude
of about 14 min and with a period of about 450 days. There are two plausible
explanations of such transit timing variations: (1) a third object in the
system XO-6 causing light-time effect, or (2) resonant perturbations between
the transiting planet XO-6b and another unknown low-mass planet in this system.
From the O-C diagram we derived that the assumed third object in the system
should have a stellar mass, therefore significant variations are expected in
the radial-velocity measurements of XO-6. Since this is not the case, and since
all attempts to fit radial velocities and O-C data simultaneously failed to
provide a consistent solution, more realistic is the second explanation.

processes is obtained when in the harmonics of a signal with random amplitudes
and phases, frequencies can also vary randomly. In the resulting models, the
statistical distribution of frequencies determines the process spectrum while
the distribution of amplitudes governs the process distributional properties.
Since decoupling the distributional and spectral properties can be advantageous
in applications, we thoroughly investigate a variety of properties exhibited by
these models. We extend previous work that represented processes as finite sum
of harmonics, by conveniently embedding them into the class of harmonizable
processes. Harmonics are integrated with respect to independently scattered
second order non-Gaussian random measures. The proposed approach provides with
a proper mathematical framework that allows to study spectral, distributional,
and ergodic properties. The mathematical elegance of these representations
avoids serious conceptual and technical difficulties with limiting behavior of
the models while at the same time facilitates derivation of their fundamental
properties. In particular, the multivariate distributions are obtained and the
asymptotic behavior of time averages is formally derived through the strong
ergodic theorem. Several deficiencies following from the previous approaches
are resolved and some of the results appearing in the literature are corrected
and extended. It is shown that due to the lack of ergodicity processes exhibit
an interesting property of non-trivial randomness remaining in the limit of
time averages. This feature maybe utilized to modelling signals observed in the
presence of influential and variable random factors.

regularize the training process by predicting image rotations. Our method
(UDML-SS) jointly learns discriminative embeddings, unsupervised clustering
assignments of the embeddings, as well as a self-supervised pretext task.
UDML-SS iteratively cluster embeddings using traditional clustering algorithm
(e.g., k-means), and sampling training pairs based on the cluster assignment
for metric learning, while optimizing self-supervised pretext task in a
multi-task fashion. The role of self-supervision is to stabilize the training
process and encourages the model to learn meaningful feature representations
that are not distorted due to unreliable clustering assignments. The proposed
method performs well on standard benchmarks for metric learning, where it
outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin and it also
shows competitive performance with various metric learning loss functions.

field of considerable interest in the last two decades. However, since perfect
omnidirectional acoustic cloak relies on inhomogeneous and anisotropic
materials that posses extreme values in certain regions, this cloak was deemed
impossible to be attained even with metamaterials. Recently, our group was
competent to introduce a new kind of extreme acoustic material, named as
acoustic null medium (ANM), for attaining various devices. In this letter, an
extreme mapping function is exploited to achieve an omnidirectional acoustic
cloak. The attained extreme homogeneous material through this transformation
becomes ANM that can satisfy the extreme parameters requirement and as a
result, can hide the object from any incident acoustic waves. Several numerical
simulations were carried out to demonstrate the capability of the propounded
cloak in cloaking objects from sound fields. The propounded work will pave the
way towards cloaking arbitrary objects from any incident angle and obviate the
conventional challenges regarding this device.

non-detected clusters that, according to their literature parameters, should be
easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or disproving the existence of old,
inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially important as their survival or
disruption is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of the
Milky Way. We employed the Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment
procedure, as well as visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and
parallax distributions. We used membership lists provided by other authors when

already known prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481
clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify with the Gaia

high-altitude objects) are not true clusters. At present, the only confirmed
cluster located further than 500pc away from the Galactic plane within the
Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects discussed in this study
only represent a fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in

study the electrophysiological signal in a proper way. The early recognition of
the seizure build up could also be defined through the time space mapping of
the preictal gamma oscillations. The electrophysiological signals present three
types of wave: oscillations, spikes, and a mixture of both. Recent studies
prove that spikes and oscillations should be separated efficiently to define
the accurate neural connectivity for each activity. However retrieving the
transitory activity is a sensitive task due to the frequency interfering
between the gamma oscillatory and the transitory activities. Many filtering
techniques are highlighted to ensure a good separation: reducing false
oscillations in the transitory activity and vis versa. However and for a big
data set, this separation necessitate a big consumption in time execution, this
constraint will be overcome using embedded architecture. The integration of
these filtering techniques would also lead to creating instantaneous monitoring
of the seizure recognition, build up and neurofeedback devices. We propose here
to implement the stationary wavelet transform as a convenient filtering
technique to keep only the preictal gamma oscillations on a partial dynamic
configuration, then we will use the same architecture to integrate the time
space mapping for an early recognition of the build up seizure. We proved a
faster recognition of the build up seizure through the non contaminated
preictal gamma oscillations time space mapping (about 40 times faster),
obtained by the integration of the wavelet transform.

study two questions for this class of problems. The first of these questions is
the study of the optimal value of the problem as a function of the involved
parameters. For this sensitivity analysis problem, we provide formulas for the
derivatives of the value function with respect to the parameters and illustrate
their application on an inventory problem. Since these formulas involve optimal
dual solutions, we need an algorithm that computes such solutions to use them.
In this context, the second question we address is the study of solution
methods for the dual problem. Writing Dynamic Programming (DP) equations for
the dual, we can use an SDDP type method, called Dual SDDP, which solves these
DP equations. However, applying this method will only be possible if the
Relatively Complete Recourse (RCR) holds for the dual. Since the RCR assumption
may fail to hold, we design two variants of Dual SDDP, namely Dual SDDP with
penalizations and Dual SDDP with feasibility cuts. The study of this second
question allows us to take a fresh look at the notoriously difficult to solve
class of MSLP with interstage dependent cost coefficients. Indeed, for this
class of problems, cost-to-go functions are non-convex and solution methods
were so far using SDDP for a Markov chain approximation of the cost
coefficients process. For these problems, we propose to apply Dual SDDP with
penalizations to the cost-to-go functions of the dual which are concave. This
algorithm converges to the optimal value of the problem. Finally, as a proof of
concept of the tools developed, we present the results of numerical experiments
computing the sensitivity of the optimal value of an inventory problem as a
function of parameters of the demand process and compare Primal and Dual SDDP

in the context of gravitational wave observations of inspiraling neutron stars.
We consider upcoming detections of neutron star coalescences and model the
neutron star equations of state with phase transitions through the
Constant-Speed-of-Sound parametrization. We use the fact that neutron star
binaries with one or more hadron-quark hybrid stars can exhibit qualitatively
different tidal properties than binaries with hadronic stars of the same mass,
and hierarchically model the masses and tidal properties of simulated
populations of binary neutron star inspiral signals. We explore the parameter
space of phase transitions and discuss under which conditions future
observations of binary neutron star inspirals can identify this effect and
constrain its properties, in particular the threshold density at which the
transition happens and the strength of the transition. We find that if the
detected population of binary neutron stars contains both hadronic and hybrid
stars, the onset mass and strength of a sufficiently strong phase transition
can be constrained with 50-100 detections. If the detected neutron stars are
exclusively hadronic or hybrid, then it is possible to place lower or upper
limits on the transition density and strength.

the various experimental results published in the literature, demonstrating a

collision with a moving wall within the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
framework for the simulation of unsteady rarefied flows. This algorithm is able
to predict the particle-wall collision in a coupled manner by removing the
assumption employed by the approximate algorithm, in that the wall is frozen
during the collision. The trajectory equation of the particle is theoretically
constructed in a moving object coordinate system. It can accurately describe
the geometries of the collision between a particle and an arbitrarily shaped
object of which the motion incorporates both translation and rotation, thus
allowing to deal with complex problems. In contrast, the approximate algorithm
ignores the effect of the moving wall on the particle movement during the
collision, and therefore induces error that is an increasing function of the
wall velocity. Four rarefied flow problems are applied to validate the accurate
algorithm. It is shown that the algorithm can produce results perfectly
consistent with the Maxwellian theoretical solutions and ensure particle
conservation to avoid gas leakage. It is also shown in a three-dimensional case
of a re-entry module that the steady simulation fails to reproduce the
hysteresis effect while the unsteady simulation using the accurate algorithm
can do that, indicating that the unsteady simulation with an appropriate
algorithm as proposed in the present work is essentially required in such
applications.

consider a fiber bundle model where the strength of single fibers is sampled

upper cutoff of fibers' strength. Analytical calculations and computer
simulations, performed in the limit of equal load sharing, revealed that
depending on the disorder parameters the mechanical response of the bundle is
either perfectly brittle where the first fiber breaking triggers a catastrophic
avalanche, or it is quasi-brittle where macroscopic failure is preceded by a
sequence of bursts. In the quasi-brittle phase, the statistics of avalanche
sizes is found to show a high degree of complexity. In particular, we
demonstrate that the functional form of the size distribution of bursts depends
on the system size: for large upper cutoffs of fibers' strength, in small
systems the sequence of bursts has a high degree of stationarity characterized
by a power law size distribution with a universal exponent. However, for
sufficiently large bundles the breaking process accelerates towards the
critical point of failure which gives rise to a crossover between two power

detection. Suppose the majority of a dataset are drawn from a certain
distribution, outlier detection and novelty detection both aim to detect data
samples that do not fit the distribution. Outliers refer to data samples within
this dataset, while novelties refer to new samples. In the meantime, backdoor
poisoning attacks for machine learning models are achieved through injecting
poisoning samples into the training dataset, which could be regarded as
""outliers"" that are intentionally added by attackers. Differential privacy has
been proposed to avoid leaking any individual's information, when aggregated
analysis is performed on a given dataset. It is typically achieved by adding
random noise, either directly to the input dataset, or to intermediate results
of the aggregation mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying
differential privacy can improve the utility of outlier detection and novelty
detection, with an extension to detect poisoning samples in backdoor attacks.
We first present a theoretical analysis on how differential privacy helps with
the detection, and then conduct extensive experiments to validate the
effectiveness of differential privacy in improving outlier detection, novelty

turbulence is investigated. Resolvent analysis is used to identify the
principal forcing mode which produces the maximum amplification of the
velocities in numerical simulations of the minimal channel for the buffer layer
and a modified logarithmic (log) layer. The wavenumbers targeted in this study
are those of the fundamental mode that is infinitely long in the streamwise
direction and once periodic in the spanwise direction. The identified mode is
then projected out from the nonlinear term of the Navier-Stokes equations at
each time step from the simulation of the corresponding minimal channel. The
results show that the removal of the principal forcing mode of the fundamental
wavenumber can inhibit turbulence in both the buffer and log layer, with the
effect being greater in the buffer layer. Removing other modes instead of the
principal mode of the fundamental wavenumber only marginally affects the flow.
Closer inspection of the dyadic interactions in the nonlinear term shows that
contributions toward the principal forcing mode come from a limited set of
wavenumber interactions. Using conditional averaging, the flow structures that
are responsible for generating the nonlinear interaction to self-sustain
turbulence are identified as spanwise rolls interacting with oblique streaks.
This method, based on the equations of motion, validates the similarities in
the SSP of the buffer and log layer, and characterises the underlying quadratic
interactions in the SSP of the minimal channel.

the development of a theoretical framework capable of explaining many of their

occurring in the vicinity of the jamming point has received little attention
and the problem of finding a connection with the local structure of the
configuration remains unexplored. Here we address this issue by constructing
physically well defined structural variables using the information contained in
the network of contacts of jammed configurations, and then showing that such
variables yield a resilient statistical description of the particle-wise
dynamics near this critical point. Our results are based on extensive numerical
simulations of systems of spherical particles that allow us to statistically
characterize the trajectories of individual particles in terms of their first
two moments. We first demonstrate that, besides displaying a broad distribution
of mobilities, particles may also have preferential directions of motion. Next,
we associate each of these features with a structural variable computed
uniquely in terms of the contact vectors at jamming, obtaining considerably
high statistical correlations. The robustness of our approach is confirmed by
testing two types of dynamical protocols, namely Molecular Dynamics and Monte
Carlo, with different types of interaction. We also provide evidence that the
dynamical regime we study here is dominated by anharmonic effects and therefore
it cannot be described properly in terms of vibrational modes. Finally, we show
that correlations decay slowly and in an interaction-independent fashion,
suggesting a universal rate of information loss.

different FGM nanostructures is crucial in exploring their feasibility for
different applications. In this study, for the first time, we employed
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the mechanical and

Distribution of Cu and Ni along the radial direction follows power-law,
exponential and sigmoid functions for FGM NWs under consideration. Our results
demonstrate that, distribution function parameters play an important role in
modulating the mechanical (elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength) and
vibrational (natural frequency and quality factor) properties of FGM NWs. The
study also suggests that, elastic moduli of FGM NWs can be predicted with
relatively good accuracy using Tamura and Reuss micromechanical models,
regardless of NW diameter. We found that, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
under-predicts the natural frequencies of FGM NWs, whereas He-Lilley model
closely approximates the MD results. Interestingly, FGM NWs are always found to
exhibit beat vibration because of their asymmetrical cross sections. Finally,
this is the first atomistic scale study of FGMs that directly compares MD

abused to infer information about the training data. Since its first
introduction, such attacks have raised serious concerns given that training
data usually contain privacy-sensitive information. Thus far, successful
model-inversion attacks have only been demonstrated on simple models, such as
linear regression and logistic regression. Previous attempts to invert neural
networks, even the ones with simple architectures, have failed to produce
convincing results. We present a novel attack method, termed the generative
model-inversion attack, which can invert deep neural networks with high success
rates. Rather than reconstructing private training data from scratch, we
leverage partial public information, which can be very generic, to learn a
distributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs) and use it to
guide the inversion process. Moreover, we theoretically prove that a model's
predictive power and its vulnerability to inversion attacks are indeed two
sides of the same coin---highly predictive models are able to establish a
strong correlation between features and labels, which coincides exactly with
what an adversary exploits to mount the attacks. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed attack improves identification accuracy over the
existing work by about 75\% for reconstructing face images from a
state-of-the-art face recognition classifier. We also show that differential
privacy, in its canonical form, is of little avail to defend against our
attacks.

studied by performing oscillatory rheological measurements on two different
types of systems: a colloidal dispersion and a thermo-responsive polymer
solution under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. While undergoing
sol-gel transition, both the systems pass through a critical point. An approach
to the critical point is characterized in terms of divergence of zero shear
viscosity and the subsequent appearance of the low frequency modulus. In the
vicinity of the critical gel state, both the viscosity and the modulus show a
power-law dependence on relative distance from the critical point.
Interestingly, the longest relaxation time has been observed to diverge
symmetrically on both the sides of the critical point and also shows a
power-law dependence on relative distance from the critical point. The critical
(power-law) exponents of the zero-shear viscosity and modulus are observed to
be related to the exponents of the longest relaxation time by the hyper scaling
laws. The dynamic critical exponent has also been calculated from the growth of
the dynamic moduli. Remarkably, the critical relaxation exponent and dynamic
critical exponent predicted from the scaling laws precisely agree with the
experimental values from the isothermal as well as non-isothermal experiments.
The associated critical exponents show remarkable internal consistency and
universality for different kinds of systems undergoing the sol-gel transition.

evolution of hole doping (from the O K-edge pre-peak) and ferromagnetism (at
the Co L-edges), to establish a baseline. Operando soft XAS/XMCD of
electrolyte-gated films is then demonstrated, using optimized spin-coated gels
with thickness $\sim$1 ${\mu}$m, and specific composition. Application of gate
voltages up to +4 V is shown to dramatically suppress the O $K$-edge XAS

ferromagnetism to be tracked upon gate-induced reduction. Soft XAS and XMCD,
with appropriate electrolyte design, are thus established as viable for the

specific example is psychometrics, which has adapted high-dimensional Ising
models from machine learning, with a view to studying the interactions among
binary item responses in educational assessments. To estimate high-dimensional
Ising models from educational assessment data, $\ell_1$-penalized nodewise
logistic regressions have been used. Theoretical results in high-dimensional
statistics show that $\ell_1$-penalized nodewise logistic regressions can
recover the true interaction structure with high probability, provided that
certain assumptions are satisfied. Those assumptions are hard to verify in
practice and may be violated, and quantifying the uncertainty about the
estimated interaction structure and parameter estimators is challenging. We
propose a Bayesian approach that helps quantify the uncertainty about the
interaction structure and parameters without requiring strong assumptions, and
can be applied to Ising models with thousands of parameters. We demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed Bayesian approach compared with $\ell_1$-penalized
nodewise logistic regressions by simulation studies and applications to small
and large educational data sets with up to 2,485 parameters. Among other
things, the simulation studies suggest that the Bayesian approach is more
robust against model misspecification due to omitted covariates than
$\ell_1$-penalized nodewise logistic regressions.

simply-laced simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. This family was introduced by
David Hernandez and Bernard Leclerc in the context of monoidal categorification
of cluster algebras. The graded limit of a member of this family is an
indecomposable graded module for the current algebra $\mathfrak{g}[t]$; or
equivalently a module for the maximal standard parabolic subalgebra in the
affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. In this paper we study the case
when $\mathfrak{g}$ is of type $D_n$. We show that in certain cases the limit
is a generalized Demazure module, i.e., it is a submodule of a tensor product
of level one Demazure modules. We give a presentation of these modules and
compute their graded character (and hence also the character of the prime
representations) in terms of Demazure modules of level two.

  Spatial-Temporal Interaction","8 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.SI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online Social Networks (OSNs) evolve through two pervasive behaviors: follow
and unfollow, which respectively signify relationship creation and relationship
dissolution. Researches on social network evolution mainly focus on the follow
behavior, while the unfollow behavior has largely been ignored. Mining unfollow
behavior is challenging because user's decision on unfollow is not only
affected by the simple combination of user's attributes like informativeness
and reciprocity, but also affected by the complex interaction among them.
Meanwhile, prior datasets seldom contain sufficient records for inferring such
complex interaction. To address these issues, we first construct a large-scale
real-world Weibo dataset, which records detailed post content and relationship
dynamics of 1.8 million Chinese users. Next, we define user's attributes as two
categories: spatial attributes (e.g., social role of user) and temporal
attributes (e.g., post content of user). Leveraging the constructed dataset, we
systematically study how the interaction effects between user's spatial and
temporal attributes contribute to the unfollow behavior. Afterwards, we propose
a novel unified model with heterogeneous information (UMHI) for unfollow
prediction. Specifically, our UMHI model: 1) captures user's spatial attributes
through social network structure; 2) infers user's temporal attributes through
user-posted content and unfollow history; and 3) models the interaction between
spatial and temporal attributes by the nonlinear MLP layers. Comprehensive
evaluations on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed UMHI model
outperforms baseline methods by 16.44% on average in terms of precision. In
addition, factor analyses verify that both spatial attributes and temporal
attributes are essential for mining unfollow behavior.

drop when deployed in the wild due to domain gaps with training data.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt models
for new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. However, without
ground truth labels, most prior works on UDA for object detection tasks can
only perform coarse image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using
adversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based
methods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain
content distribution gap that is shown to be important for object detectors. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the Cross-Domain Semi-Supervised Learning
(CDSSL) framework by leveraging high-quality pseudo labels to learn better
representations from the target domain directly. To enable SSL for cross-domain
object detection, we propose fine-grained domain transfer,
progressive-confidence-based label sharpening and imbalanced sampling strategy
to address two challenges: (i) non-identical distribution between source and
target domain data, (ii) error amplification/accumulation due to noisy pseudo
labeling on the target domain. Experiment results show that our proposed
approach consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance (2.2% - 9.5%
better than prior best work on mAP) under various domain gap scenarios. The

comparing voting mechanisms. m voters and n candidates are jointly embedded in
an (unknown) metric space, and the voters submit rankings of candidates by
non-decreasing distance from themselves. Based on the submitted rankings, the
social choice rule chooses a winning candidate; the quality of the winner is
the sum of the (unknown) distances to the voters. The rule's choice will in
general be suboptimal, and the worst-case ratio between the cost of its chosen
candidate and the optimal candidate is called the rule's distortion. It was
shown in prior work that every deterministic rule has distortion at least 3,
while the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee worst-case distortion at
most 5; a very recent result gave a rule with distortion $2+\sqrt{5} \approx
4.236$.
  We provide a framework based on LP-duality and flow interpretations of the
dual which provides a simpler and more unified way for proving upper bounds on
the distortion of social choice rules. We illustrate the utility of this
approach with three examples. First, we give a fairly simple proof of a strong
generalization of the upper bound of 5 on the distortion of Copeland, to social
choice rules with short paths from the winning candidate to the optimal
candidate in generalized weak preference graphs. A special case of this result
recovers the recent $2+\sqrt{5}$ guarantee. Second, using this generalized
bound, we show that the Ranked Pairs and Schulze rules have distortion
$\Theta(\sqrt(n))$. Finally, our framework naturally suggests a combinatorial
rule that is a strong candidate for achieving distortion 3, which had also been
proposed in recent work. We prove that the distortion bound of 3 would follow
from any of three combinatorial conjectures we formulate.

color constancy has becoming a fundamental prerequisite for many computer

consider the spatial information of images, leaving plenty of room for
improvement of the accuracy of illuminant estimation. In this paper, by
exploiting the spatial information of images, we propose a color constancy
algorithm called Attention Dense Color Constancy (ADCC) using convolutional
neural network (CNN). Specifically, based on the 2D log-chrominance histograms
of the input images as well as their specially augmented ones, ADCC estimates
the illuminant with a self-attention DenseNet. The augmented images help to
tell apart the edge gradients, edge pixels and non-edge ones in log-histogram,
which contribute significantly to the feature extraction and color-ambiguity
elimination, thereby advancing the accuracy of illuminant estimation.
Simulations and experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm is effective for illuminant estimation compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. Thus, ADCC offers great potential in promoting
applications of smart cities, such as smart camera, where color is an important
factor for distinguishing objects.

arising from different tissue micro-structures of interest. A closed form
representation of this reference diffusion MRI signal has been derived twenty
years ago, called Matrix Formalism that makes explicit the link between the
Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the biological cell and its diffusion
MRI signal. In addition, once the Laplace eigendecomposition has been computed
and saved, the diffusion MRI signal can be calculated for arbitrary
diffusion-encoding sequences and b-values at negligible additional cost.
  Up to now, this representation, though mathematically elegant, has not been
often used as a practical model of the diffusion MRI signal, due to the
difficulties of calculating the Laplace eigendecomposition in complicated
geometries. In this paper, we present a simulation framework that we have
implemented inside the MATLAB-based diffusion MRI simulator SpinDoctor that
efficiently computes the Matrix Formalism representation for realistic neurons
using the finite elements method. We show the Matrix Formalism representation
requires around a few hundred eigenmodes to match the reference signal computed
by solving the Bloch-Torrey equation when the cell geometry comes from
realistic neurons. As expected, the number of required eigenmodes to match the
reference signal increases with smaller diffusion time and higher b-values. We
gave the transformation that links the Laplace eigenfunctions to the

Dirac nodes near the Fermi surface. Furthermore, it is unveiled that NiTe2
presents the Hall Effect, which is ascribed to orbital magnetoresistance. The
physical properties behavior of NiTe2 under high pressure attracts us. In this
paper, we investigate the electrical properties of polycrystalline NiTe2 by
application of pressure ranging from 3.4GPa to 54.45Gpa. Superconductivity
emerges at critical pressure 12GPa with a transition temperature of 3.7K, and
Tc reaches its maximum, 6.4 K, at the pressure of 52.8GPa. Comparing with the
superconductivity in MoP, we purposed the possibility of topological
superconductivity in NiTe2. Two superconductivity transitions are observed with
pressure increasing in single crystal.

in the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and nonlocal correlation of EPR. The
second-order anticorrelation on a beam splitter represents these phenomena
where it cannot be achieved classically. Here, the anticorrelation of
nonclassicality on a beam splitter is interpreted in a purely coherence manner.
Unlike a common belief in a particle nature of photons, the anticorrelation
roots in pure wave nature of coherence optics, where quantum superposition
between two input fields plays a key role. This interpretation may intrigue a
fundamental question of what nonclassicality should be and pave a road to

theory. When the probability density function of measurement noise is
unknown-but-bounded, multiple-source localization is a difficult problem since
not only the acoustic energy measurements are complicated nonlinear functions
of multiple sources, but also the multiple sources bring about a
high-dimensional state estimation problem. First, when the energy parameter and
the position of the source are bounded in an interval and a ball respectively,
the nonlinear remainder bound of the Taylor series expansion is obtained
analytically on-line. Next, based on the separability of the nonlinear
measurement function, an efficient estimation procedure is developed. It solves
the multiple-source localization problem by using an alternating optimization
iterative algorithm, in which the remainder bound needs to be known on-line.
For this reason, we first derive the remainder bound analytically. When the
energy decay factor is unknown but bounded, an efficient estimation procedure
is developed based on interval mathematics. Finally, numerical examples
demonstrate the effectiveness of the ellipsoidal localization algorithms for
multiple-source localization. In particular, our results show that when the

better than the EM localization algorithm.

clock rate of an FPGA-mapped design is set based on worst-case conditions to
ensure reliable operation under all circumstances. This usually leaves a
considerable timing margin that can be exploited to reduce power consumption by
scaling voltage without lowering clock frequency. There are hurdles for such
opportunistic voltage scaling in FPGAs because (a) critical paths change with
designs, making timing evaluation difficult as voltage changes, (b) each FPGA
resource has particular power-delay trade-off with voltage, (c) data corruption
of configuration cells and memory blocks further hampers voltage scaling. In
this paper, we propose a systematical approach to leverage the available
thermal headroom of FPGA-mapped designs for power and energy improvement. By
comprehensively analyzing the timing and power consumption of FPGA building
blocks under varying temperatures and voltages, we propose a thermal-aware
voltage scaling flow that effectively utilizes the thermal margin to reduce
power consumption without degrading performance. We show the proposed flow can
be employed for energy optimization as well, whereby power consumption and
delay are compromised to accomplish the tasks with minimum energy. Lastly, we
propose a simulation framework to be able to examine the efficiency of the
proposed method for other applications that are inherently tolerant to a

Experimental results over a set of industrial benchmarks indicate up to 36%
power reduction with the same performance, and 66% total energy saving when

allocate resources across D2D and cellular users, the knowledge of D2D channel
gains is needed. However, such knowledge is hard to obtain at reasonable
signaling costs. In this paper, we show this problem can be circumvented by
tapping into the information provided by the estimation of the cellular
channels between the users and surrounding BSs as this estimation is done
anyway for a normal operation of the network. While the cellular and D2D
channel gains exhibit independent fast fading behavior, we show that average
gains of the cellular and D2D channels share a non-explicit correlation

$X^1\Sigma^+(v=0, J=1)$ and a middle state $X^1\Sigma^+(v=0, J=2)$, while a
control MW field couples the middle state and a upper state $X^1\Sigma^+(v=0,

requires the inclusion of mass and mixing corrections to the external Higgs

we move away from a strict one-loop calculation and consequently mix orders in

and requires a lot of training data. Recent work has explored different
watermarking techniques to protect the pre-trained deep neural networks from
potential copyright infringements. However, these techniques could be
vulnerable to watermark removal attacks. In this work, we propose REFIT, a
unified watermark removal framework based on fine-tuning, which does not rely
on the knowledge of the watermarks, and is effective against a wide range of
watermarking schemes. In particular, we conduct a comprehensive study of a
realistic attack scenario where the adversary has limited training data, which
has not been emphasized in prior work on attacks against watermarking schemes.
To effectively remove the watermarks without compromising the model
functionality under this weak threat model, we propose two techniques that are
incorporated into our fine-tuning framework: (1) an adaption of the elastic
weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm, which is originally proposed for
mitigating the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon; and (2) unlabeled data
augmentation (AU), where we leverage auxiliary unlabeled data from other
sources. Our extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of REFIT against
diverse watermark embedding schemes. In particular, both EWC and AU
significantly decrease the amount of labeled training data needed for effective
watermark removal, and the unlabeled data samples used for AU do not
necessarily need to be drawn from the same distribution as the benign data for
model evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuning
based watermark removal attacks could pose real threats to the copyright of
pre-trained models, and thus highlight the importance of further investigating
the watermarking problem and proposing more robust watermark embedding schemes
against the attacks.

angle transport into the cold plasma, which leads to the generation of Langmuir
waves in the cold plasma and ion acoustic waves in the hot plasma. The large
pitch angle electrons can be confined by the magnetic mirror, resulting in the
different evolution time scale between electron parallel and perpendicular
temperature. This will cause the formation of electron temperature anisotropy,
which can generate the whistler waves near the interface between hot electrons
and cold electrons. The whistler waves can scatter the large pitch angle
electrons to smaller value through the cyclotron resonance, leading to
electrons escaping from the hot region. These results indicate that the

Recent works have made significant steps towards understanding harmonic

vibrational modes emerge in addition to phonon-like vibrational modes. In this
work, we study the anharmonic properties of these vibrational modes. We find
that vibrational modes exhibit anharmonicities that induce particle
rearrangements and cause transitions to different states. These anharmonicities
are distinct from those in crystals, where particle rearrangements never occur.
Remarkably, for both the phonon modes and quasi-localized modes, the
vibrational modes exhibit strong anharmonicities, and the induced particle
rearrangements are always localized in space and are composed of 1 to 1000
particles. Our findings contribute to the understanding of low-temperature
thermal properties, for which anharmonic vibrations are crucial.

complex-valued object distribution, be it a 2D or 3D sample. It is shown that
for a sample that can be approximated as a 2D sample, a single-shot in-line
hologram is sufficient to reconstruct the absorption and phase distributions of
the sample. Previously, the GS-based algorithms have been successfully employed
to reconstruct samples that are limited to a 2D plane. However, realistic
physical objects always have some finite thickness and therefore are 3D rather
than 2D objects. This study demonstrates that 3D samples, including 3D phase
objects, can be reconstructed from two or more holograms. It is shown that in
principle, two holograms are sufficient to recover the entire wavefront
diffracted by a 3D sample distribution. In this method, the reconstruction is
performed by applying iterative phase retrieval between the planes where
intensity was measured. The recovered complex-valued wavefront is then
propagated back to the sample planes, thus reconstructing the 3D distribution
of the sample. This method can be applied for 3D samples such as 3D
distribution of particles, thick biological samples, and other 3D phase
objects. Examples of reconstructions of 3D objects, including phase objects,
are provided.

connect this with imaging of the interfaces. We study the detection of pure
spin currents via the inverse spin Hall effect in Pt and the related spin
current absorption by Pt in Py-Cu-Pt lateral spin valves. Depending on the
fabrication process, we either find a large (inverse) spin Hall effect signal

results by the fabrication induced varying quality of the Cu/Pt interfaces,
which is directly revealed via a special scanning electron microscopy technique
for interface imaging and correlated to the spin transport.

model parameter posterior probability distributions that arise from solutions
to Bayesian inverse problems. The algorithm aims to mitigate some of the
hurdles faced by traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, through
constructing proposal probability densities that are both, easy to sample and
that provide a better approximation to the target density than a simple
Gaussian proposal distribution would. To achieve that, a Gaussian proposal
distribution is augmented with a Gaussian Process (GP) surface that helps
capture non-linearities in the log-likelihood function. In order to train the
GP surface, an iterative approach is adopted for the optimal selection of
points in parameter space. Optimality is sought by maximizing the information
gain of the GP surface using a minimum number of forward model simulation runs.
The accuracy of the GP-augmented surface approximation is assessed in two ways.
The first consists of comparing predictions obtained from the approximate
surface with those obtained through running the actual simulation model at
hold-out points in parameter space. The second consists of a measure based on
the relative variance of sample weights obtained from sampling the approximate
posterior probability distribution of the model parameters. The efficacy of
this new algorithm is tested on inferring reaction rate parameters in a 3-node
and 6-node network toy problems, which imitate idealized reaction networks in
combustion applications.

bacterium and hijacks cell functions to produce large numbers of new viruses
which burst from the cell. These viruses are well-studied, but there exist a
wide range of coexisting virus lifestyles that are less understood. Temperate
viruses exhibit both a lytic cycle and a latent (lysogenic) cycle, in which
viral genomes are integrated into the bacterial host. Meanwhile, chronic
(persistent) viruses use cell functions to produce more viruses without killing
the cell; chronic viruses may also exhibit a latent stage in addition to the
productive stage. Here, we study the ecology of these competing viral
strategies. We demonstrate the conditions under which each strategy is
dominant, which aids in control of human bacterial infections using viruses. We
find that low lysogen frequencies provide competitive advantages for both virus
types; however, chronic viruses maximize steady state density by eliminating
lysogeny entirely, while temperate viruses exhibit a non-zero `sweet spot'
lysogen frequency. Viral steady state density maximization leads to coexistence
of temperate and chronic viruses, explaining the presence of multiple viral
strategies in natural environments.

quantity spaces; both can be regarded as universal algebras. Scalable monoids
are related to rings and modules, and quantity spaces are to scalable monoids
as vector spaces are to modules. Subalgebras and homomorphic images of scalable
monoids can be formed, and tensor products of scalable monoids can be
constructed as well. We also define and investigate congruence relations on
scalable monoids, unit elements of scalable monoids, basis-like substructures
of scalable monoids and quantity spaces, and scalar representations of elements
of quantity spaces. The mathematical theory of quantity spaces is presented
with a view to metrological applications. This article supersedes

Heterogeneity is assessed on the basis of the predicted individual treatment
effects (PITE) framework and a permutation test is utilized to establish if
significant heterogeneity is present. We first use the novel test to show that
heterogeneity in the effects of interventions exists in the Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis Clinical Trials. We then show, using two different predictive models
(linear regression model and Random Forests) that the test has adequate type I
error control. Next, we use the ALS data as the basis for simulations to
demonstrate the ability of the permutation test to find heterogeneity in
treatment effects as a function of both effect size and sample size. We find
that the proposed test has good power to detected heterogeneity in treatment
effects when the heterogeneity was due primarily to a single predictor, or when
it was spread across the predictors. The predictive model, on the other hand is
of secondary importance to detect heterogeneity. The non-parametric property of
the permutation test can be applied with any predictive method and requires no
additional assumptions to obtain PITEs.

microresonators because their profile often resembles an elongated spheroid or
a microscopic bottle. These resonators are commonly fabricated from an optical
fiber by variation of its radius. Generally, variation of the bottle
microresonator (BMR) radius along the fiber axis can be quite complex
presenting, e.g., a series of coupled BMRs positioned along the fiber. Similar
to optical spherical and toroidal microresonators, BMRs support whispering
gallery modes (WGMs) which are localized inside the resonator due to the effect
of total internal reflection. The elongation of BMRs along the fiber axis
enables their several important properties and applications not possible to
realize with other optical microresonators. The paper starts with the review of
the BMR theory, which includes their spectral properties, slow WGM propagation
along BMRs, theory of Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) BMRs, theory of
resonant transmission of light through BMR microresonators coupled to
transverse waveguides (microfibers), theory of nonstationary WGMs in BMRs, and
theory of nonlinear BMRs. Next, the fabrication methods of BMRs including
melting of optical fibers, fiber annealing in SNAP technology, rolling of
semiconductor bilayers, solidifying of a UV-curable adhesive, and others are
reviewed. Finally, the applications of BMRs which either have been demonstrated
or feasible in the nearest future are considered. These applications include
miniature BMR delay lines, BMR lasers, nonlinear BMRs, optomechanical BMRs, BMR
for quantum processing, and BMR sensors.

a key primitive of 3D data processing widely used in high-level tasks such as
odometry, simultaneous localization and mapping, and 3D reconstruction. As
these applications are routinely deployed in energy-constrained environments,
real-time and energy-efficient point cloud registration is critical.
  We present Tigris, an algorithm-architecture co-designed system specialized
for point cloud registration. Through an extensive exploration of the
registration pipeline design space, we find that, while different design points
make vastly different trade-offs between accuracy and performance, KD-tree
search is a common performance bottleneck, and thus is an ideal candidate for
architectural specialization. While KD-tree search is inherently sequential, we
propose an acceleration-amenable data structure and search algorithm that
exposes different forms of parallelism of KD-tree search in the context of
point cloud registration. The co-designed accelerator systematically exploits
the parallelism while incorporating a set of architectural techniques that
further improve the accelerator efficiency. Overall, Tigris achieves
77.2$\times$ speedup and 7.4$\times$ power reduction in KD-tree search over an

improvements and 3.0$\times$ power reduction.

the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to be captured by

Of particular interest is to identify optimal arrangements of small absorbing
traps that minimize the average MFPT. Although the MFPT, and the associated
optimal trap arrangement problem, has been well-studied for disk-shaped
domains, there are very few analytical or numerical results available for
general star-shaped domains or for thin domains with large aspect ratio.
Analytical progress is challenging owing to the need to determine the Neumann
Green's function for the Laplacian, while the numerical challenge results from
a lack of easy-to-use and fast numerical tools for first computing the MFPT and
then optimizing over a class of trap configurations. In this direction, and for
the stationary trap problem, we develop a simple embedded numerical method,
based on the Closest Point Method (CPM), to perform MFPT simulations on
elliptical and star-shaped domains. For periodic mobile trap problems, we
develop a robust CPM method to compute the average MFPT. Optimal trap
arrangements are identified numerically through either a refined discrete
sampling approach or from a particle-swarm optimization procedure. To confirm
some of the numerical findings, novel perturbation approaches are developed to
approximate the average MFPT and identify optimal trap configurations for a
class of near-disk confining domains or for an arbitrary thin domain of large
aspect ratio.

weak form of authentication, a further concern arises when considering the
possibility for an attacker to recover the user passwords by leveraging the
loopholes in the password recovery mechanisms. Indeed, the adoption by a

robust password chosen by the registered users. In this paper, building on the
results of our previous work, we study the possible attacks to on-line password

popular Web-sites. In detail, we provide several contributions: (i) we revise
and detail the attacker model; (ii) we provide an updated analysis with respect

have basic user protection mechanisms in place---despite the fines threatened

Data sources for the buoys and weather events are identified, aggregated and
merged. For missing data imputation, we use Kalman filters as well as splines
for multivariate time series. Then, statistical tests are run to ascertain
increasing trends in weather event severity. Next, we use machine learning to
predict/forecast event severity using buoy variables, and report good
accuracies for the models built.

method for estimating the propagation pathloss from a point $x$ (transmitter
location) to any point $y$ on a planar domain. For applications such as
user-cell site association and device-to-device link scheduling, an accurate
knowledge of the pathloss function for all pairs of transmitter-receiver
locations is very important. Commonly used statistical models approximate the
pathloss as a decaying function of the distance between transmitter and
receiver. However, in realistic propagation environments characterized by the
presence of buildings, street canyons, and objects at different heights, such
radial-symmetric functions yield very misleading results. In this paper we show
that properly designed and trained deep neural networks are able to learn how
to estimate the pathloss function, given an urban environment, in a very
accurate and computationally efficient manner. Our proposed method, termed
RadioUNet, learns from a physical simulation dataset, and generates pathloss
estimations that are very close to the simulations, but are much faster to
compute for real-time applications. Moreover, we propose methods for
transferring what was learned from simulations to real-life. Numerical results
show that our method significantly outperforms previously proposed methods.

  De-En",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In sequence to sequence learning, the self-attention mechanism proves to be
highly effective, and achieves significant improvements in many tasks. However,
the self-attention mechanism is not without its own flaws. Although
self-attention can model extremely long dependencies, the attention in deep
layers tends to overconcentrate on a single token, leading to insufficient use
of local information and difficultly in representing long sequences. In this
work, we explore parallel multi-scale representation learning on sequence data,
striving to capture both long-range and short-range language structures. To
this end, we propose the Parallel MUlti-Scale attEntion (MUSE) and MUSE-simple.
MUSE-simple contains the basic idea of parallel multi-scale sequence
representation learning, and it encodes the sequence in parallel, in terms of
different scales with the help from self-attention, and pointwise
transformation. MUSE builds on MUSE-simple and explores combining convolution
and self-attention for learning sequence representations from more different
scales. We focus on machine translation and the proposed approach achieves
substantial performance improvements over Transformer, especially on long
sequences. More importantly, we find that although conceptually simple, its
success in practice requires intricate considerations, and the multi-scale
attention must build on unified semantic space. Under common setting, the
proposed model achieves substantial performance and outperforms all previous
models on three main machine translation tasks. In addition, MUSE has potential
for accelerating inference due to its parallelism. Code will be available at

take an advantage of experimental data collection of different wave types
(single pulses, sinusoidal waves, bi-harmonic waves, and frequency modulated
wave trains) and simulate their run-up using two models: (i) non-dispersive
nonlinear shallow water theory and (ii) dispersive Boussinesq type model based
on the modified Peregrine system. It is shown, that for long positive pulses,
dispersive effects are not so important and nonlinear shallow water theory can
be used. However, for periodic sinusoidal and bi-harmonic pulses of the same
period, the dispersive effects result in significant wave transformation during
its propagation, but do not have a strong impact on its maximal run-up height.
Overall, for maximum wave run-up height, we could not find a preference of
dispersive model against the nondispersive one, and, therefore, suggest using
nonlinear shallow water model for long wave run-up height estimation.

deep learning and statistical physics methods to solve the combinatorial

artificial neural network, demonstrate their efficiency for solving various
physical tasks for the quantum many-body systems, which may be related directly
to the problems of combinatorial optimization. One of them is a classical
Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem, which we ascribe here to the search of the ground
state of a quantum many-body system using an artificial neural network and deep
learning. We found that the exact solution received for a quantum system
corresponds to its counterpart in a classical MaxCut problem. As a proof, we
have realized our approach for two random graphs of different size, containing
60 vertices (885 edges) and 100 vertices (2475 edges), and achieved for them
the total performances p60~0.99 and $p100~0.97 of known maximal cuts,

We found that there are a lot of variations among the participants' time when
