  Recognition and Segmentation","19th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2019)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deep learning frameworks which are
well-known for their notable performance in classification tasks. Hence, many
skeleton-based action recognition and segmentation (SBARS) algorithms benefit
from them in their designs. However, a shortcoming of such applications is the
general lack of spatial relationships between the input features in such data
types. Besides, non-uniform temporal scalings is a common issue in
skeleton-based data streams which leads to having different input sizes even
within one specific action category. In this work, we propose a novel
deep-aligned convolutional neural network (DACNN) to tackle the above
challenges for the particular problem of SBARS. Our network is designed by
introducing a new type of filters in the context of CNNs which are trained
based on their alignments to the local subsequences in the inputs. These
filters result in efficient predictions as well as learning interpretable
patterns in the data. We empirically evaluate our framework on real-world
benchmarks showing that the proposed DACNN algorithm obtains a competitive
performance compared to the state-of-the-art while benefiting from a less
complicated yet more interpretable model.

quarter of a century; however, it has been difficult to design a classifier

systems and major improvements are reported. In this paper, a novel
convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier model is proposed to classify
modulation classes in terms of their families, i.e., types. The proposed
classifier is robust against realistic wireless channel impairments and in
relation to that when the data sets that are utilized for testing and
evaluating the proposed methods are considered, it is seen that RadioML2016.10a
is the main dataset utilized for testing and evaluation of the proposed
methods. However, the channel effects incorporated in this dataset and some
others may lack the appropriate modeling of the real-world conditions since it
only considers two distributions for channel models for a single tap
configuration. Therefore, in this paper, a more comprehensive dataset, named as
HisarMod2019.1, is also introduced, considering real-life applicability.
HisarMod2019.1 includes 26 modulation classes passing through the channels with
5 different fading types and several numbers of taps for classification. It is
shown that the proposed model performs better than the existing models in terms
of both accuracy and training time under more realistic conditions. Even more,
surpassed their performance when the RadioML2016.10a dataset is utilized.

semi-supervised AD (SSAD), the data also includes a small sample of labeled

`separate' between latent vectors for normal and outlier data. We show that
this idea can be derived from principled probabilistic formulations of the
problem, and propose simple and effective algorithms. Our methods can be
applied to various data types, as we demonstrate on SSAD datasets ranging from
natural images to astronomy and medicine, can be combined with any VAE model

we postulate that this comes from the multi-scale structure of musical
information and propose new architectures based on an iterative temporal
aggregation of input labels. Specifically, the input and ground truth labels
are merged into increasingly large temporal bags, on which we train a family of

  In this paper, we propose to exploit specific properties and relationships

we propose pure interaction effects: variance in the outcome which cannot be
represented by any smaller subset of features. This definition has an
equivalence with the Functional ANOVA decomposition. To compute this
decomposition, we present a fast, exact algorithm that transforms any
piecewise-constant function (such as a tree-based model) into a purified,

semi-supervised learning, especially for classification tasks. However,
existing GCN based methods have two main drawbacks. First, to increase the
receptive field and improve the representation capability of GCNs, larger
kernels or deeper network architectures are used, which greatly increases the
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Second, methods working
on higher order graphs computed directly from adjacency matrices may alter the
relationship between graph nodes, particularly for weighted graphs. In
addition, the direct construction of higher-order graphs introduces redundant
information, which may result in lower network performance. To address the
above weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a new method of multi-hop
convolutional network on weighted graphs. The proposed method consists of
multiple convolutional branches, where each branch extracts node representation
from a $k$-hop graph with small kernels. Such design systematically aggregates
multi-scale contextual information without adding redundant information.
Furthermore, to efficiently combine the extracted information from the
multi-hop branches, an adaptive weight computation (AWC) layer is proposed. We
demonstrate the superiority of our MultiHop in six publicly available datasets,
including three citation network datasets and three medical image datasets. The
experimental results show that our proposed MultiHop method achieves the
highest classification accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

variance reduction ratio at each point of the image, based on the given target
variance. Then, a space-variant filter with matching variance reduction power
is applied. A mathematical framework of atomic kernels is developed to
facilitate stable and fast computation of the filter bank kernels. Recursive
formulation allows using small kernel size, which makes the space-variant
filter more suitable for fast parallel implementation. Despite the small kernel
size, the recursive filter possesses strong variance reduction power. Filter
accuracy is measured by the variance reduction against the target variance;
testing demonstrated high accuracy of variance reduction of the recursive
filter compared to the fixed-size filter. The proposed filter was applied to
adaptive filtering in image reconstruction and edge-preserving denoising.

ensure approximate invariance under unitary transformations of the model states

between a state-specific and a state-average regime. The resulting extended
dynamically weighted CASPT2 (XDW-CASPT2) methodology possesses the most
desirable features of both MS-CASPT2 and XMS-CASPT2, i.e. the ability to
provide accurate transition energies and correctly describe avoided crossings
and conical intersections. The reliability of XDW-CASPT2 is assessed on a
number of molecular systems. First, we consider the dissociation of lithium

Second, the invariance of the theory is investigated by studying the conical
intersection of the distorted allene molecule. Finally, the relative accuracy
in the calculation of vertical excitation energies is benchmarked on a set of

frustrated magnetism, the understanding of a pair of coupled zigzag chains

problem through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on
$\text{BiCu}_2\text{PO}_6$ in magnetic fields up to 45 T, revealing a
field-induced spiral magnetic structure. Conjointly, we present advanced
numerical calculations showing that even moderate rung coupling dramatically
simplifies the phase diagram below half-saturation magnetization by stabilizing
a field-induced chiral phase. Surprisingly for a one-dimensional model, this
phase and its response to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions adhere to
classical expectations. While explaining the behavior at the highest accessible
magnetic fields, our results imply a different origin for the solitonic phases
occurring at lower fields in $\text{BiCu}_2\text{PO}_6$. An exciting
possibility is that the known, DM-mediated coupling between chirality and
crystal lattice gives rise to a new kind of spin-Peierls instability.

they can contribute to and fit within the field of neuroscience as a whole has
received careful treatment from philosophers. However, these philosophical
contributions have not yet reached many neuroscientists. Here we complement
formal philosophical efforts by providing an applied perspective from and for
neuroscientists. We discuss the mechanistic status of the explanations offered
by network neuroscience and how they contribute to, enhance, and interdigitate
with other types of explanations in neuroscience. In doing so, we rely on
philosophical work concerning the role of causality, scale, and mechanisms in
scientific explanations. In particular, we make the distinction between an
explanation and the evidence supporting that explanation, and we argue for a
scale-free nature of mechanistic explanations. In the course of these
discussions, we hope to provide a useful applied framework in which network
neuroscience explanations can be exercised across scales and combined with
other fields of neuroscience to gain deeper insights into the brain and
behavior.

increasingly used to inform robust and reliable design practices. In the

purposes often introduce significant uncertainties due to deficiencies in the
mathematical models employed. In this paper, we discuss two recent improvements
in the quantification and combination of uncertainties from multiple sources
that can help generate probabilistic aerodynamic databases for use in aerospace
engineering problems. We first discuss the eigenspace perturbation methodology
to estimate model-form uncertainties stemming from inadequacies in the
turbulence models used in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid
Dynamics (RANS CFD) simulations. We then present a multi-fidelity Gaussian
Process framework that can incorporate noisy observations to generate
integrated surrogate models that provide mean as well as variance information
for Quantities of Interest (QoIs). The process noise is varied spatially across
the domain and across fidelity levels. Both these methodologies are
demonstrated through their application to a full configuration aircraft
example, the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) in transonic conditions. First,
model-form uncertainties associated with RANS CFD simulations are estimated.
Then, data from different sources is used to generate multi-fidelity
probabilistic aerodynamic databases for the NASA CRM. We discuss the
transformative effect that affordable and early treatment of uncertainties can
have in traditional aerospace engineering practices. The results are presented
and compared to those from a Gaussian Process regression performed on a single

compressible Euler equations in $3$-D, for the Cauchy data of the velocity,
density and vorticity $(v,\varrho, \fw) \in H^s\times H^s\times H^{s'}$,
$2<s'<s$.
  The classical local well-posedness result for the compressible Euler
equations in $3$-D holds for the initial data $v, \varrho \in H^{s+\f12},\,
s>2$. Due to the works of Smith-Tataru and Wang for the irrotational isentropic
case, the local well-posedness can be achieved if the data satisfy $v, \varrho
\in H^{s}$, with $s>2$. In the incompressible case the solution is proven to be
ill-posed for the datum $\fw\in H^\frac{3}{2}$ by Bourgain-Li. The solution of
the compressible Euler equations is not expected to be well-posed if the data
merely satisfy $v, \varrho\in H^{s}, s>2$ with a general rough vorticity.
  By decomposing the velocity into the term $(I-\Delta_e)^{-1}\curl \fw$ and a
wave function verifying an improved wave equation, with a series of
cancellations for treating the latter, we achieve the $H^s$-energy bound and
complete the linearization for the wave functions by using the $H^{s-\f12}, \,
s>2$ norm for the vorticity. The propagation of energy for the vorticity
typically requires $\curl \fw\in C^{0, 0+}$ initially, stronger than our
assumption by 1/2-derivative. We perform trilinear estimates to gain regularity
by observing a div-curl structure when propagating the energy of the normalized
double-curl of the vorticity, and also by spacetime integration by parts. To
prove the Strichartz estimate for the linearized wave in the rough spacetime,
we encounter a strong Ricci defect requiring the bound of $\|\curl
\fw\|_{L_x^\infty L_t^1}$ on null cones. This difficulty is solved by
uncovering the cancellation structures due to the acoustic metric on the
angular derivatives of Ricci and the second fundamental form.

Rule Interpolation (FRI) methods against these ill conditions. Fuzzy Rule
Interpolation methods were originally proposed to handle the situation of
missing fuzzy rules (sparse rule-bases) and to reduce the decision complexity.
Fuzzy Rule Interpolation is an important technique for implementing inference
with sparse fuzzy rule-bases. Even if a given observation has no overlap with
the antecedent of any rule from the rule-base, FRI may still conclude a
conclusion. The first FRI method was the Koczy and Hirota proposed ""Linear
Interpolation"", which was later renamed to ""KH Fuzzy Interpolation"" by the
followers. There are several conditions and criteria have been suggested for
unifying the common requirements an FRI methods have to satisfy. One of the
most common one is the demand for a convex and normal fuzzy (CNF) conclusion,
if all the rule antecedents and consequents are CNF sets. The KH FRI is the
one, which cannot fulfill this condition. This paper is focusing on the
conditions, where the KH FRI fails the demand for the CNF conclusion. By
setting up some CNF rule examples, the paper also defines a Benchmark, in which
other FRI methods can be tested if they can produce CNF conclusion where the KH
FRI fails.

constraint into account so it is usually solved by heuristic methods such as
evolutionary algorithms. This paper introduces a simple, efficient and scalable
connectionist model as an alternative. We propose a novel reparametrisation
method and then solve the optimisation problem with stochastic neural networks.
The proposed approach is examined with S&P 500 index data for more than 10
years and compared with widely used index tracking approaches such as forward
and backward selection and the largest market capitalisation methods. The
empirical results show our model achieves excellent performance. Compared with
the benchmarked models, our model has the lowest tracking error, across a range
of portfolio sizes. Meanwhile it offers comparable performance to the others on
secondary criteria such as volatility, Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.

nebulae in the Universe, spanning ~440 kpc. Enormous Ly-alpha nebulae like
MAMMOTH-I typically trace the densest and most active regions of galaxy
formation. Using sensitive low-surface-brightness observations of CO(1-0) with
the Very Large Array, we trace the cold molecular gas in the inner 150 kpc of
the MAMMOTH-I Nebula. CO is found in four regions that are associated with
either galaxies or groups of galaxies that lie inside the nebula. In three of
the regions, the CO stretches up to ~30 kpc into the circum-galactic medium
(CGM). In the centermost region, the CO has a very low velocity dispersion
(FWHM$_{\rm CO}$ ~ 85 km/s), indicating that this gas is dynamically cold. This
dynamically cold gas coincides with diffuse restframe optical light in the CGM
around a central group of galaxies, as discovered with the Hubble Space
Telescope. We argue that this likely represents cooling of settled and enriched
gas in the center of MAMMOTH-I. This implies that the dynamically cold gas in
the CGM, rather than the obscured AGN, marks the core of the potential well of
this Ly-alpha nebula. In total, the CO in the MAMMOTH-I Nebula traces a
molecular gas mass of M$_{\rm H2}$ ~ 1.4 ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$/3.6) $\times$
10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, with roughly 50% of the CO(1-0) emission found in the
CGM. Our results add to the increasing evidence that extended reservoirs of
molecular gas exist in the CGM of massive high-z galaxies and proto-clusters.

This requirement poses a challenge for standard laser spectroscopy methods.
Here, we propose photon correlation measurements as a new tool to analyse
quantum dynamics in molecular aggregates in driven-dissipative situations. We
show that the photon correlation statistics on the light emitted by a molecular
dimer model can signal the presence of coherent dynamics. Deviations from the
counting statistics of independent emitters constitute a direct fingerprint of
quantum coherence in the steady state. Furthermore, the analysis of frequency
resolved photon correlations can signal the presence of coherent dynamics even
in the absence of steady state coherence, providing direct spectroscopic access
to the much sought-after site energies in molecular aggregates.

constant curvature, ii) leveraging gyro-barycentric coordinates that generalize
the classic Euclidean concept of the center of mass. Our class of models

regions like the Arches cluster. Whether such IMFs also exist in old dense
stellar systems like globular clusters is difficult to constrain, because
massive stars already became black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs).
However, studies of stellar dynamics find that BHs/NSs influence the long-term
evolution of star clusters. Following Breen & Heggie (2013) and by carrying out
two-component $N$-body simulations, we demonstrate how this dynamical impact
connects with the shape of IMFs. By investigating the energy balance between
the BH subsystem and the global, we find that to properly describe the
evolution of clusters, a corrected two-body relaxation time, $T_{rh,p} =
T_{rh}/\psi$, is necessary. Because $\psi$ depends on the total mass fraction
of BHs, $M_2 / M$, and the mass ratio, $m_2 / m_1$, the cluster dissolution
time is sensitive to the property of BHs or IMFs. Especially, the escape rate
of BHs via ejections from few-body encounters is linked to mass segregation. In
strong tidal fields, top-heavy IMFs easily lead to the fast dissolution of star
clusters and the formation of BH-dominant dark clusters, which suggests that
the observed massive GCs with dense cores are unlikely to have extreme
top-heavy IMFs. With the future observations of gravitational waves providing
unique information of BHs/NSs, it is possible to combine the multi-message
observations to have better constrains on the IMFs of old star clusters.

formation rate over time. The gravity-based method identifies bound objects,
which have masses M ~ 10^3 - 10^4 M_solar at densities n_H ~ 100 cm^-3, and
traditional virial parameters alpha_v ~ 0.5 - 5. For clouds defined by a
density threshold n_H,min , the average virial parameter decreases, and the
fraction of material that is genuinely bound increases, at higher n_H,min.
Surprisingly, these clouds can be unbound even when alpha_v < 2, and high mass
clouds (10^4 - 10^6 M_solar) are generally unbound. This suggests that the
traditional alpha_v is at best an approximate measure of boundedness in the
ISM. All clouds have internal turbulent motions increasing with size as sigma ~
1 km/s(R/ pc)^1/2, similar to observed relations. Bound structures comprise a
small fraction of the total simulation mass, with star formation efficiency per
free-fall time epsilon_ff ~ 0.4. For n_H,min = 10 - 100 cm^-3, epsilon_ff ~
0.03 - 0.3, increasing with density. Temporal correlation analysis between
SFR(t) and aggregate mass M(n_H,min;t) at varying n_H,min shows that time
delays to star formation are t_delay ~ t_ff(n_H,min). Correlation between
SFR(t) and M(nH,min;t) systematically tightens at higher n_H,min. Considering
moderate-density gas, selecting against high virial parameter clouds improves
correlation with SFR, consistent with previous work. Even at high n_H,min, the
temporal dispersion in (SFR-epsilon_ff M/t_ff )/<SFR> is ~ 50%, due to the
large-amplitude variations and inherent stochasticity of the system.

the surrounding wind-driven shell. The collision of the supernova blast wave
with the wind-driven shell leads to a transmitted shock that moves into the
shell and a reflected shock into the ejecta. The transmitted shock is capable
of destroying large amounts of the dust locked in the shell, but only if the
mass of the wind-driven shell is small, less than a few tens the ejected mass.
Conversely, massive wind-driven shells, with several times the ejected mass,
lead upon the interaction to strong radiative cooling, which inhibits the
Sedov-Taylor phase and weakens the transmitted shock, making it unable to
traverse the wind-driven shell. In such a case, the destruction/disruption of
the ambient dust is largely inhibited. On the other hand, the SNRs grow rapidly
in the very tenuous region excavated by the stellar winds, and thus a large
fraction of the dust generated within the ejecta is not efficiently destroyed
by the supernova reverse shock, nor by the reflected shock. Our calculations
favor a scenario in which core-collapse supernovae within sufficiently massive
wind-driven shells supply more dust to the ISM than what they are able to
destroy.

wide distribution on the sky does not support a recent group infall or

function with a power-law index $\alpha\sim-1.7$ ($\alpha\sim-2$ for
$M_{\mathrm{*,cl}}\gtrsim10^{3}\,M_{\odot}$) at all merger phases, while the
normalization and the highest SC masses (up to $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$) correlate
with $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. The cluster formation efficiency varies from
$\Gamma\sim20\%$ in early merger phases to $\Gamma\sim80\%$ at the peak of the
starburst and is compared to observations and model predictions. The massive
SCs ($\gtrsim10^4\,M_{\odot}$) have sizes and mean surface densities similar to
observed young massive SCs. Simulated lower mass clusters appear slightly more
concentrated than observed. All SCs form on timescales of a few Myr and lose
their gas rapidly resulting in typical stellar age spreads between
$\sigma\sim0.1-2$ Myr ($1\sigma$), consistent with observations. The age
spreads increase with cluster mass, with the most massive cluster ($\sim10^6\,
M_{\odot}$) reaching a spread of $5\, \mathrm{Myr}$ once its hierarchical
formation finishes. Our study shows that it is now feasible to investigate the
SC population of entire galaxies with novel high-resolution numerical
simulations.

bars and spiral arms. Using $N$-body simulations, we investigate the effects of
tidal forces on the formation of such disk features in disk dwarf galaxies
resembling VCC856. We consider 8 Cluster-Galaxy models in which disk dwarf
galaxies with differing pericenter distance and spin orientation experience the
tidal gravitational force of a Virgo-like NFW halo, and additional 8
Galaxy-Galaxy models in which two dwarf galaxies undergo tidal interactions
with different strength. We find that the cluster tidal effect is moderate due
to the small galaxy size, making the bars form earlier by $\sim1$--$1.5\Gyr$
compared to the cases in isolation. While the galactic halos significantly lose
their mass within the virial radius due to the cluster tidal force, the mass of
the stellar disks is nearly unchanged, suggesting that the inner regions of a
disk-halo system is secured from the tidal force. The tidal forcing from either
the cluster potential or a companion galaxy triggers the formation of two-armed
spirals at early time before a bar develops. The tidally-driven arms decay and
wind with time, suggesting that they are kinematic density waves. In terms of
the strength and pitch angle, the faint arms in VCC856 are best matched with
the arms in a marginally unstable galaxy produced by a distant tidal encounter
with its neighbor $\sim0.85\Gyr$ ago.

random variables $X_1\ldots X_n$ with known distributions. After observing the
realization of $X_i$, the player can either accept the observed reward from
$X_i$ and stop, or reject the observed reward from $X_i$ and continue to
observe the next variable $X_{i+1}$ in the sequence. Under any fixed ordering
of the random variables, an optimal stopping policy, one that maximizes the
player's expected reward, is given by the solution of a simple dynamic program.
In this paper, we investigate the relatively less studied question of selecting
the order in which the random variables should be observed so as to maximize
the expected reward at the stopping time. To demonstrate the benefits of order
selection, we prove a novel prophet inequality showing that, when the support
of each random variable has size at most 2, the optimal ordering can achieve an
expected reward that is within a factor of 1.25 of the expected hindsight
maximum; this is an improvement over the corresponding factor of 2 for the
worst-case ordering. We also provide a simple $O(n^2)$ algorithm for finding an
optimal ordering in this case. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that a
slightly more general case - each random variable $X_i$ is restricted to have
3-point support of form $\{0, m_i, 1\}$ - is NP-hard, and provide an FPTAS for

that properly accounting for the geographic sampling of weather stations can

different ways (both increasing and decreasing). We argue that the geographic

trained with 1623 montage images in equal distribution of all three code labels

(1) the QA scores can be used as a loss function to perform semi-supervised

multi-organ segmentation on unlabeled datasets can be fine-tuned with more

resources to meet a certain performance target, specified as a QoS constraint,

  Prior art has proposed resource management (RM) frameworks in which the share
of the last-level cache (LLC) assigned to each processor and the
voltage-frequency (VF) setting for each processor is managed in a coordinated
fashion to reduce energy. A drawback of such a scheme is that, while one core
gives up LLC resources for another core, the performance drop must be
compensated by a higher VF setting which leads to a quadratic increase in
energy consumption. By allowing each core to be adapted to exploit instruction
and memory-level parallelism (ILP/MLP), substantially higher energy savings are
enabled.
  This paper proposes a coordinated RM for LLC partitioning, processor
adaptation, and per-core VF scaling. A first contribution is a systematic study
of the resource trade-offs enabled when trading between the three classes of
resources in a coordinated fashion. A second contribution is a new RM framework
that utilizes these trade-offs to save more energy. Finally, a challenge to
accurately model the impact of resource throttling on performance is to predict
the amount of MLP with high accuracy. To this end, the paper contributes with a
mechanism that estimates the effect of MLP over different processor
configurations and LLC allocations. Overall, we show that up to 18% of energy,
and on average 10%, can be saved using the proposed scheme.

  Abstract",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monitoring physiological responses to hemodynamic stress can help in
determining appropriate treatment and ensuring good patient outcomes.
Physicians' intuition suggests that the human body has a number of
physiological response patterns to hemorrhage which escalate as blood loss
continues, however the exact etiology and phenotypes of such responses are not
well known or understood only at a coarse level. Although previous research has
shown that machine learning models can perform well in hemorrhage detection and
survival prediction, it is unclear whether machine learning could help to
identify and characterize the underlying physiological responses in raw vital
sign data. We approach this problem by first transforming the high-dimensional
vital sign time series into a tractable, lower-dimensional latent space using a
dilated, causal convolutional encoder model trained purely unsupervised.
Second, we identify informative clusters in the embeddings. By analyzing the
clusters of latent embeddings and visualizing them over time, we hypothesize
that the clusters correspond to the physiological response patterns that match
physicians' intuition. Furthermore, we attempt to evaluate the latent
embeddings using a variety of methods, such as predicting the cluster labels
using explainable features.

nodes communicate over encrypted overlay paths, provide an appealing solution
because of their distributed, computationally light-weight nature. Alas, these
schemes share a glaring security vulnerability: the two ends of every overlay
link can decrypt---and potentially modify and alter---the message. Plus, the
longer overlay paths impose traffic overhead and increase latency.
  We present a novel routing mechanism, KPsec, to address these issues. KPsec
deploys multiple disjoint paths and an initial key-exchange phase to secure
end-to-end communications. After the initial key-exchange phase, traffic in
KPsec follows the shortest paths and, in contrast to key pre-distribution
schemes, intermediate nodes cannot decrypt it. We measure the security and
performance of KPsec as well as three state-of-the-art key pre-distribution
schemes using a real 10-node testbed and large-scale simulations. Our

initial conditions problem lies within the scope of EFTs of inflation as they

intractable: their solution must await a more complete description of the very
early universe. I highlight recent work that addresses the initial conditions

compositions are modelled assuming parent bodies that differentiated into core,
mantle and crust components. Atmospheric levels of Ca, Mg and Fe in the model
are compared to a sample of 230 DZ white dwarfs for which such pollution is
measured. A good fit is obtained when each planetesimal has its core, mantle
and crust fractions chosen independently from logit-normal distributions which
lead to average mass fractions of $f_\text{Cru}=0.15$, $f_\text{Man}=0.49$ and
$f_\text{Cor}=0.36$. However, achieving this fit requires a factor 4 depletion
of Mg relative to stellar material. This depletion is unlikely to originate in
planetesimal formation processes, but might occur from heating while the star
is on the giant branch. Alternatively the accreted material has stellar
abundance, and either the inferred low Mg abundance was caused by an incorrect
assumption that Mg sinks slower than Ca and Fe, or there are unmodelled biases
in the observed sample. Finally, the model makes predictions for the timescale
on which the observed pollutant composition varies, which should be the longer
of the sinking and disc timescales, implying variability on decadal timescales
for DA white dwarfs.

two distinct fundamental features of the merely passive, not-bio-motor shuttled
material transport within the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium discoideum cells: the
anomalous non-linear scaling of the mean-squared displacement of a
150nm-diameter particle and non-Gaussian distribution of increments. Relying on
single-particle tracking data of 320,000 data points, we performed a systematic
analysis of four possible origins for non-Gaussian transport: (1) sample-based
variability, (2) rare occurring strong motion events, (3) ergodicity
breaking/ageing, and (4) spatio-temporal heterogeneities of the intracellular
medium. After excluding the first three reasons, we investigated the remaining
hypothesis of a heterogeneous cytoplasm as cause for non-Gaussian transport. A
novel fit model with randomly distributed diffusivities implementing medium
heterogeneities suits the experimental data. Strikingly, the non-Gaussian
feature is independent of the cytoskeleton condition and lag time. This reveals
that efficiency and consistency of passive intracellular transport and the
related anomalous scaling of the mean-squared displacement are regulated by
cytoskeleton components, while cytoplasmic heterogeneities are responsible for
the generic, non-Gaussian distribution of increments.

recovery after sunset. The amplitude of this variation is quite significant ( >
10%) at the observation site Tirunelveli, South India. However, further
investigation based on different energy ranges reveals that the mentioned
diurnal pattern is actually present only in the energies related to the
terrestrial background radioactivity. The study demonstrates that the pattern
is associated with the radioactivity of isotopes of radon ($^{222}$Rn and
$^{220}$Rn) and their daughter radionuclides. The amplitude of the diurnal
variation is found to have seasonal dependence, with the lowest amplitude
during June-October (~ 2%), and highest in April-May months (~ 14%). The
dependence of the amplitude of the diurnal variation on various atmospheric
parameters, namely temperature, relative humidity, and vertical wind is
examined. The observed diurnal pattern is attributed to the generation of the
inversion layer. The distribution of concentration of radon and thoron
progenies in an air column changes with the vertical mixing and atmospheric
boundary layer (ABL), resulting in the diurnal variation of $\gamma$-rays.

be particularly severe in remote digital health studies where the participants
self-select to enter the study. While many different confounding adjustment
approaches have been proposed in the literature, most of these methods rely on
modeling assumptions, and it is unclear how robust they are to violations of
these assumptions. This realization has recently motivated the development of
restricted permutation methods to quantify the influence of observed
confounders on the predictive performance of a machine learning models and
evaluate if confounding adjustment methods are working as expected. In this
paper we show, nonetheless, that restricted permutations can generate biased
estimates of the contribution of the confounders to the predictive performance
of a learner, and we propose an alternative approach to tackle this problem. By
viewing a classification task from a causality perspective, we are able to
leverage conditional independence tests between predictions and test set labels

a classifier. We illustrate the application of our causality-based approach to

  Gaia has sparked a new era in the study of stellar kinematics by measuring
precise distances and proper motions for 1.3 billion stars. These data have
already generated more than 1700 scientific papers and are guaranteed to remain
the source of many more papers for the upcoming decades. More than 900 new

consequence of the second Gaia data release. Some of these may already be host
stars to known exoplanet systems or may become so with the progress of the TESS

upcoming decade. This places Canada in a strategic position to leverage Gaia
data because it has access to several high-resolution spectrometers on 1-4 m

for open membership while using quorum-like structures typical for classical
Byzantine consensus with closed membership. This is achieved by constructing
quorums in a decentralised way: each participant independently chooses whom to
trust, and quorums arise from these individual decisions. Unfortunately, the
consensus protocols underlying such blockchains are poorly understood, and
their correctness has not been rigorously investigated. In this paper we
rigorously prove correct the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), with our proof
giving insights into the protocol structure and its use of lower-level
abstractions. To this end, we first propose an abstract version of SCP that
uses as a black box Stellar's federated voting primitive (analogous to reliable
Byzantine broadcast), previously investigated by Garc\'ia-P\'erez and Gotsman.
The abstract consensus protocol highlights a modular structure in Stellar and
can be proved correct by reusing the previous results on federated voting.
However, it is unsuited for realistic implementations, since its processes
maintain infinite state. We thus establish a refinement between the abstract
protocol and the concrete SCP that uses only finite state, thereby carrying
over the result about the correctness of former to the latter. Our results help
establish the theoretical foundations of decentralised blockchains like Stellar
and gain confidence in their correctness.

explore parallelization strategies like data-parallelism, model-parallelism,
and hybrid-parallelism. While data-parallelism has been extensively studied and
developed, several problems exist in realizing model-parallelism and
hybrid-parallelism efficiently. Four major problems we focus on are: 1)
defining a notion of a distributed model across processes, 2) implementing
forward/back-propagation across process boundaries that requires explicit
communication, 3) obtaining parallel speedup on an inherently sequential task,
and 4) achieving scalability without losing out on a model's accuracy. To
address these problems, we create HyPar-Flow --- a model-size/-type agnostic,
scalable, practical, and user-transparent system for hybrid-parallel training
by exploiting MPI, Keras, and TensorFlow. HyPar-Flow provides a single API that
can be used to perform data, model, and hybrid parallel training of any Keras

underlying properties of complex real-world networks. In this paper, we study a
class of random graphs known as the inhomogeneous random K-out graphs which
were recently introduced to analyze heterogeneous sensor networks secured by
the pairwise scheme. In this model, first, each of the $n$ nodes is classified
as type-1 (respectively, type-2) with probability $0<\mu<1$ (respectively,
$1-\mu)$ independently from each other. Next, each type-1 (respectively,
type-2) node draws 1 arc towards a node (respectively, $K_n$ arcs towards $K_n$
distinct nodes) selected uniformly at random, and then the orientation of the
arcs is ignored. From the literature on homogeneous K-out graphs wherein all
nodes select $K_n$ neighbors (i.e., $\mu=0$), it is known that when $K_n
\geq2$, the graph is $K_n$-connected asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) as
$n$ gets large. In the inhomogeneous case (i.e., $\mu>0$), it was recently
established that achieving even 1-connectivity a.a.s. requires $K_n=\omega(1)$.
Here, we provide a comprehensive set of results to complement these existing
results. First, we establish a sharp zero-one law for $k$-connectivity, showing
that for the network to be $k$-connected a.a.s., we need to set $K_n =
\frac{1}{1-\mu}(\log n +(k-2)\log\log n + \omega(1))$ for all $k=2, 3, \ldots$.
Despite such large scaling of $K_n$ being required for $k$-connectivity, we
show that the trivial condition of $K_n \geq 2$ for all $n$ is sufficient to
ensure that inhomogeneous K-out graph has a connected component of size
$n-O(1)$ whp.

transits its host star. Five planetary transits were observed by TESS, allowing
us to measure the radius of the planet to be $1.133 \pm 0.031 R_J$, and to

slightly evolved with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 5692 \pm 83$ K

show improved accuracy over a model trained using just WES data, suggesting the
ability of models to generalize insights from the greater WGS data while

approaches may apply to other problem areas in genomics, where several
specialized models would each see only a subset of the genome.

problems with computer vision models discussed in existing literature, these
intent-slot tagging models are often over-sensitive to small variations in

made to a query, thus reducing their accuracy and reliability. However,
evaluating a model's robustness to these changes is harder for language since
words are discrete and an automated change (e.g. adding `noise') to a query
sometimes changes the meaning and thus labels of a query. In this paper, we
first describe how to create an adversarial test set to measure the robustness

distinguish them from full-fledged molecular clouds. Some of this cloudlet
material may accrete onto the star+disk system, while other material may fly by

process will be a ""cloudlet flyby"" and/or ""cloudlet capture"" event: A
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton type accretion event, driven by the relative velocity
between the star and the cloudlet. As we will show in this paper, if the
cloudlet is small enough and has an impact parameter similar or less than
$GM_{*}/v^2_\infty$ (with $v_\infty$ being the approach velocity), such a flyby

nebulosity near the star. Those shapes of reflection nebulosity can be seen
around several transitional disks and FU Orionis stars. Although the masses in

we speculate that higher-mass cloudlet capture events may also happen
occasionally. If so, they may lead to the tilting of the outer disk, because
the newly infalling matter will have an angular momentum orientation entirely

such mechanisms (e.g., the CRM [1]), we still lack the quantitative method to
evaluate the coordination penitential and identify proper coordination groups
(CG) to implement the CRM. Thus, they hit prohibitive computing difficulty when
implemented with many opt-in travelers. Motived by this view, this study
develops mathematical approaches to quantify the coordination potential between
two and among multiple travelers. Next, we develop the adaptive centroid-based
clustering algorithm (ACCA), which splits travelers en route in a local network
into CGs, each with proper size and strong coordination potential. Moreover,
the ACCA is statistically secured to stop at a local optimal clustering
solution, which balances the inner-cluster and inter-cluster coordination
potential. It can be implemented by parallel computation to accelerate its
computing efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a clustering based coordinated
routing mechanism (CB-CRM), which implements a CRM on each individual CG. The
numerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks show
that the ACCA works efficiently to form proper coordination groups so that as
compared to the CRM, the CB-CRM significantly improves computation efficiency
with minor system performance loss in a large network. This merit becomes more
apparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition. Last, the
experiments validate the good features of the ACCA as well as the value of

Understanding preemption characteristics (such as frequency) is a key first
step in minimizing the effect of preemptions on application performance,
availability, and cost. However, little is understood about temporally
constrained preemptions---wherein preemptions must occur in a given time
window. We study temporally constrained preemptions by conducting a large scale

robot. The robot is able to travel along horizontal monkey bars using
continuous arm swings. We build a full order dynamics model for the robot and
formulate each cycle of robot swing motion as an optimal control problem. The
iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm is used to find the
optimal control strategy during one swing. We select suitable robot design
parameters by comparing the cost of robot motion generated by the iLQR
algorithm for different robot designs. In particular, using this approach we
show the importance of having a body link and low inertia arms for efficient
brachiation. Further, we propose a trajectory tracking controller that combines
a cascaded PID controller and an input-output linearization controller to
enable the robot to track desired trajectory precisely and reject external
disturbance during brachiation. Experiments on the simulated robot and the real
robot demonstrate that the robot can robustly swing between monkey bars with
same or different spacing of handholds.

main application of our results is to economic experiments, in which a learner
seeks to infer the parameters of a subject's preferences: for example their
attitudes towards risk, or their beliefs over uncertain events. By cleverly
adapting the experimental design, one can save on the time spent by subjects in
the laboratory, or maximize the information obtained from each subject in a
given laboratory session; but the resulting adaptive design raises
complications due to incentive compatibility. A subject in the lab may answer
questions strategically, and not truthfully, so as to steer subsequent

  We analyze two standard economic problems: inference of preferences over risk
from multiple price lists, and belief elicitation in experiments on choice over
uncertainty. In the first setting, we tune a simple and fast learning algorithm
to retain certain incentive compatibility properties. In the second setting, we
provide an incentive compatible learning algorithm based on scoring rules with
query complexity that differs from obvious methods of achieving fast learning
rates only by subpolynomial factors. Thus, for these areas of application,
incentive compatibility may be achieved without paying a large sample

address this problem, we introduce a new state estimation algorithm which we
term Contact-Centric Leg Odometry (COCLO). This new estimator uses a Square
Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-UKF) to fuse multiple proprioceptive sensors
available on a legged robot. In contrast to IMU-centric filtering approaches,
COCLO formulates prediction and measurement models according to the contact
status of legs. Additionally, COCLO has an indirect measurement model using
joint velocities to estimate the robot body velocity. In rough terrain, when
IMUs suffer from large amounts of noise, COCLO's contact-centric approach
outperforms previous IMU-centric methods. To demonstrate improved state
estimation accuracy, we compare COCLO with Visual Inertial Navigation System
(VINS), a state-of-the-art visual inertial odometry, in three different
environments: flat ground, ramps, and stairs. COCLO achieves better estimation
precision than VINS in all three environments and is robust to unstable motion.
Finally, we also show that COCLO and a modified VINS can work in tandem to
improve each other's performance.

storage and transaction volume, Bitcoin PoW's heavy reliance on electricity has
created scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks. Mining
efforts have concentrated in areas with low electricity costs, creating single

trivially verifiable economic cost on miners, there is no fundamental reason
for it to consist primarily of electricity cost. The authors propose a novel
PoW algorithm, Optical Proof of Work (oPoW), to eliminate energy as the primary
cost of mining. Proposed algorithm imposes economic difficulty on the miners,
however, the cost is concentrated in hardware (capital expense-CAPEX) rather
than electricity (operating expenses-OPEX). The oPoW scheme involves minimal
modifications to Hashcash-like PoW schemes, inheriting safety/security

  Rapid growth and improvement in silicon photonics over the last two decades
has led to the commercialization of silicon photonic co-processors (integrated
circuits that use photons instead of electrons to perform specialized computing
tasks) for low-energy deep learning. oPoW is optimized for this technology such
that miners are incentivized to use specialized, energy-efficient photonics for

comparisons, $K^\ast$ form factors are also computed. The analysis reveals
that: vector mesons are larger than pseudoscalar mesons; composite vector
mesons are non-spherical, with magnetic and quadrupole moments that deviate
$\sim 30$\% from point-particle values; in many ways, vector-meson properties
are as much influenced by emergent mass as those of pseudoscalars; and vector

Decodable Network Coding (IDNC) packets. Recently, a distributed solution,

intractability of the formulation, the coalition game is relaxed to a coalition
formation game (CFG) involving the formation of disjoint coalitions. A
distributed algorithm relying on merge-and-split rules is designed for solving
the relaxed problem. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated

makes the prediction task very challenging, especially for charge classes with
too few samples to cover the expression variation. In this work, we explore to
use the charge definitions from criminal law to alleviate this issue. The key
idea is that the expressions in a fact description should have corresponding
formal terms in charge definitions, and those terms are shared across classes
and could account for the diversity in the fact descriptions. Thus, we propose
to create auxiliary fact representations from charge definitions to augment
fact descriptions representation. The generated auxiliary representations are
created through the interaction of fact description with the relevant charge
definitions and terms in those definitions by integrated sentence- and

is found to be very powerful in distinguishing spectral patterns due to coupled

few years, but usually require a lot of labeled data. Recently, ClusterGAN
combines GAN with an encoder to achieve remarkable clustering performance via
unsupervised conditional generation. However, it ignores the real conditional
distribution of data, which leads to generating less diverse samples for each
class and makes the encoder only achieve sub-optimal clustering performance.
Here, we propose a new unsupervised conditional generation framework, Double
Cycle-Consistent Conditional GAN (DC3-GAN), which can generate diverse
class-conditioned samples. We enforce the encoder and the generator of GAN to
form an encoder-generator pair in addition to the generator-encoder pair, which
enables us to avoid the low-diversity generation and the triviality of latent
features. We train the encoder-generator pair using real data, which can
indirectly estimate the real conditional distribution. Meanwhile, this
framework enforces the outputs of the encoder to match the inputs of GAN and
the prior noise distribution, which disentangles latent space into two parts:
one-hot discrete and continuous latent variables. The former can be directly
expressed as clusters and the latter represents remaining unspecified factors.
This work demonstrates that enhancing the diversity of unsupervised conditional
generated samples can improve the clustering performance. Experiments on
different benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing
generative model-based clustering methods, and also achieves the optimal
disentanglement performance.

hydrogen atoms preferentially incorporate at grain boundaries and terminate
dangling bonds by means of several spectroscopic techniques. XPS measurements
cannot detect quantitative transitions of sp^2- and sp^3-hybridized carbons in
the films, resulting in 55-59 % of sp^3 contents. On the other hand, FT-IR and

interaction weakens and the equilibrium phase evolves from quasi-crystalline to
a non-superfluid liquid. At a critical value $\sigma_c$, the kinetic energy
becomes dominant and the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a
self-bound liquid to a gas. In the gaseous phase with $\sigma\to\sigma_c$, at
low density attractive interactions bring the system into a ""weak"" superfluid
regime. However, gas-liquid coexistence also occurs, as a result of which the
topologically protected superfluid regime is not approached.

the normal and superconducting states of high-Tc cuprates. The critical current
density, Jc, is no exception. Previous hole content dependent studies have
demonstrated that the role of intrinsic depairing current density in
determining the observed critical current density in copper oxide
superconductors. It is also widely agreed upon that the temperature and
magnetic field dependent vortex pinning energy plays a major role the Jc of a
system.This pinning energy depends directly on the superconducting condensation
energy. Superconducting condensation energy, on the other hand, is proportional
to the Cooper pair density (superpair density), which is found to be highly
dependent on the hole concentration, p, within the CuO2 plane. We have
calculated the Cooper pair density, rho_s, of YBCO (Y123), a typical hole doped
cuprate, as a function of p, in this study. A triangular pseudogap (PG), pinned
at the Fermi level, in the quasiparticle spectral density has been considered.
The low-temperature critical current density of a number of Y(Ca)BCO
superconductors over wide range of compositions and hole concentrations have
been explored. The normalized values of the superpair density and the critical
current density exhibit a clear correspondence as the in-plane hole content is
varied. This systematic behavior provides us with strong evidence that the
critical current density of hole doped cuprates is primarily dependent on the
superpair density, which in turn depends on the magnitude of the PG energy.The
agreement between the estimated p-dependent superpair density and the
previously experimentally determined superfluid density of Y(Ca)BCO is quite
remarkable.

where the next location of a robot depends only on its view of the current
configuration. Even in this seemingly weak model, most formation problems which
require constructing specific configurations, can be solved quite easily when
the robots are fully synchronized with each other. In this paper we introduce
and study a new class of problems which, unlike the formation problems so far,
cannot always be solved even in the fully synchronous model with atomic and
rigid moves. This class of problems requires the robots to permute their
locations in the plane. In particular, we are interested in implementing two
special types of permutations -- permutations without any fixed points and
permutations of order $n$. The former (called MOVE-ALL) requires each robot to
visit at least two of the initial locations, while the latter (called
VISIT-ALL) requires every robot to visit each of the initial locations in a
periodic manner. We provide a characterization of the solvability of these
problems, showing the main challenges in solving this class of problems for
mobile robots. We also provide algorithms for the feasible cases, in particular
distinguishing between one-step algorithms (where each configuration must be a
permutation of the original configuration) and multi-step algorithms (which
allow intermediate configurations). These results open a new research direction

good strain image if the underlying deformation is not suitable. Herein, we
introduce a new method for tracking the RF frames and selecting automatically
the best possible pair. We achieve this by decomposing the axial displacement
image into a linear combination of principal components (which are calculated
offline) multiplied by their corresponding weights. We then use the calculated

is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little
degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals
significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by
model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different
numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge
considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset
of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are
systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression
disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail
of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are
far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work
provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the
trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact
is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.

consistent with the distribution of masses for massive GMCs in the Milky Way

on average, with less than 2$\%$ of clouds living longer than 20 Myr. We find
decreasing GMC lifetimes with increasing virial parameter, and weakly
increasing GMC lifetimes with galactocentric radius, implying that environment
affects the evolutionary cycle of GMCs. However, our GMC lifetimes show no
systematic dependence on GMC mass or amount of star formation. These results
are broadly consistent with inferences from the literature and provide an
initial investigation into ultimately understanding the physical processes that
govern GMC lifetimes in a cosmological setting.

requires very high-resolution hydro-dynamical simulations with realistic models

present an analytical description to model the inner kinematic of satellites in
the Milky Way (MW). We use a Monte-Carlo method to produce merger trees for MW
mass halo and analytical models to produce stellar mass in the satellite
galaxies. We consider two important processes which can significantly modify
the inner mass distribution in satellite galaxy. The first is baryonic feedback
which can induce a flat inner profile depending on the star formation
efficiency in the galaxy. The second is the tidal stripping to reduce and
re-distribute the mass inside satellite. We apply this model to MW satellite
galaxies in both CDM and thermal relic WDM models. It is found that tidal
heating must be effective to produce a relatively flat distribution of the
satellite circular velocities, to agree with the data. The constraint on WDM
mass depends on the host halo mass. For a MW halo with dark matter mass lower
than $2\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$, a 2 keV WDM model can be safely excluded as
the predicted satellite circular velocities are systematically lower than the
data. For WDM with mass of 3.5 keV, it requires the MW halo mass to be larger
than $1.5\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$, otherwise the 3.5 Kev model can also be
excluded. Our current model can not exclude the WDM model with mass larger than

new window into the unexplored extreme gravity sector of physics, where the
gravitational fields are immensely strong, non-linear, and dynamical. 10 binary
black hole merger events observed so far can be used to test Einstein's theory
of general relativity, which has otherwise been proven to agree with
observations from several sources in the weak- or static-field regimes. One
interesting future possibility is to detect gravitational waves from
GW150914-like stellar-mass black hole binaries with both ground-based and
space-based detectors. We here demonstrate the power of testing extreme gravity
with such multi-band gravitational-wave observations. In particular, we
consider two theory-agnostic methods to test gravity using gravitational waves.
The first test is the parameterized test where we introduce generic
non-Einsteinian corrections to the waveform, which can easily be mapped to
parameters in known example theories beyond general relativity. The second test
is the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test where one derives the mass and
spin of a merger remnant from the inspiral and merger-ringdown independently
assuming general relativity is correct, and then check their consistency. In
both cases, we use Fisher analyses and compare the results with Bayesian ones
wherever possible. Regarding the first test, we find that multi-band
observations can be crucial in probing certain modified theories of gravity,
including those with gravitational parity violation. Regarding the second test,
we show that future single-band detections can improve upon the current tests
by roughly three orders of magnitude, and further 7-10 times improvement may be
realized with multi-band observations.

networks lies in the distribution of entanglement across many individually
controllable qubits. Colour centres in diamond have emerged as leading
solid-state 'artificial atom' qubits, enabling on-demand remote entanglement,
coherent control of over 10 ancillae qubits with minute-long coherence times,
and memory-enhanced quantum communication. A critical next step is to integrate
large numbers of artificial atoms with photonic architectures to enable
large-scale quantum information processing systems. To date, these efforts have
been stymied by qubit inhomogeneities, low device yield, and complex device
requirements. Here, we introduce a process for the high-yield heterogeneous
integration of 'quantum micro-chiplets' (QMCs) -- diamond waveguide arrays
containing highly coherent colour centres -- with an aluminium nitride (AlN)
photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Our process enables the development of a
72-channel defect-free array of germanium-vacancy (GeV) and silicon-vacancy
(SiV) colour centres in a PIC. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals long-term
stable and narrow average optical linewidths of 54 MHz (146 MHz) for GeV (SiV)
emitters, close to the lifetime-limited linewidth of 32 MHz (93 MHz).
Additionally, inhomogeneities in the individual qubits can be compensated in
situ with integrated tuning of the optical frequencies over 100 GHz. The
ability to assemble large numbers of nearly indistinguishable artificial atoms
into phase-stable PICs provides an architecture toward multiplexed quantum
repeaters and general-purpose quantum computers.

learning in general, is the modelling of non-parametric invariances that exist
in data. Most prior art has focused on enforcing priors in the form of
invariances to parametric nuisance transformations that are expected to be
present in data. Learning non-parametric invariances directly from data remains
an important open problem. In this paper, we introduce a new architectural
layer for convolutional networks which is capable of learning general
invariances from data itself. This layer can learn invariance to non-parametric
transformations and interestingly, motivates and incorporates permanent random
connectomes, thereby being called Permanent Random Connectome Non-Parametric
Transformation Networks (PRC-NPTN). PRC-NPTN networks are initialized with
random connections (not just weights) which are a small subset of the
connections in a fully connected convolution layer. Importantly, these
connections in PRC-NPTNs once initialized remain permanent throughout training
and testing. Permanent random connectomes make these architectures loosely more
biologically plausible than many other mainstream network architectures which
require highly ordered structures. We motivate randomly initialized connections
as a simple method to learn invariance from data itself while invoking
invariance towards multiple nuisance transformations simultaneously. We find
that these randomly initialized permanent connections have positive effects on
generalization, outperform much larger ConvNet baselines and the recently
proposed Non-Parametric Transformation Network (NPTN) on benchmarks that
enforce learning invariances from the data itself.

spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic (AFM; $J_2$, $\gamma J_2>0$) Heisenberg
legs coupled by zigzag-shaped ferromagnetic (FM; $J_1<0$) inter-leg

calculations the ground-state phase diagram is obtained as functions of
$\gamma$ and $J_2/|J_1|$. It contains four kinds of frustration-induced ordered
phases except a trivial FM phase. Two of the ordered phases are valence bond
solid (VBS) with spin-singlet dimerization, which is a rather conventional
order by disorder. Still, it is interesting to note that the VBS states possess
an Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki-type topological hidden order. The remaining two
phases are ferrimagnetic orders, each of which is distinguished by commensurate
or incommensurate spin-spin correlation. It is striking that the ferrimagnetic
orders are not associated with geometrical symmetry breaking; instead, the
global spin-rotation symmetry is broken. In other words, the system lowers its
energy via the FM inter-leg interaction by polarizing both of the AFM
Heisenberg legs. This is a rare type of order by disorder. Besides, the
incommensurate ferrimagnetic state appears as a consequence of the competition
between a polarization and a critical Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid behavior in the
AFM Heisenberg legs.

-- the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the efficient
unemployment rate. While lowering unemployment puts more people into work, it
forces firms to post more vacancies and to devote more resources to recruiting.
This unemployment-vacancy tradeoff, governed by the Beveridge curve, determines
the efficient unemployment rate. Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be
measured from three sufficient statistics: elasticity of the Beveridge curve,
social cost of unemployment, and cost of recruiting. Applying this formula to
the United States, 1951--2019, we find that the efficient unemployment rate
averages 4.3%, always remains between 3.0% and 5.4%, and has been stable
between 3.8% and 4.6% since 1990. As a result, the unemployment gap is
countercyclical, reaching 6 percentage points in slumps. The US labor market is
therefore generally inefficient and especially inefficiently slack in slumps.
In turn, the unemployment gap is a crucial statistic to design labor-market and
macroeconomic policies.

multifunctional utensils, smart windows, and automotive parts. Previous
strategies to impart electrical conductivity include modifying the glass
composition or forming a solid-in-solid composite of the glass and a conductive
phase. Here we demonstrate using the latter strategy the highest reported
room-temperature electrical conductivity in a bulk oxide glass 1800 S/m
corresponding to the theoretical limit for the loading fraction of the
conductive phase. This is achieved through glass-sintering of a mixture of
carbon nanofibers and oxide flint F2 or soda lime glasses, with the bulk
conductivity further enhanced by a polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol)
additive. A theoretical model provides predictions that are in excellent
agreement with the dependence of conductivity of these composites on the
carbon-loading fraction. Moreover, nanoscale electrical characterization of the
composite samples provides evidence for the existence of a connected network of
carbon nanofibers throughout the bulk. Our results establish a potentially
low-cost approach for producing large volumes of highly conductive glass

for a large-area, low-cost detector suitable for measuring the properties of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), having energies exceeding

prototype consisting of four 200\,mm diameter photo-multiplier tubes at the
focus of a segmented mirror of 1.6\,m in diameter. In October 2016, September
2017, and September 2018 we installed three such prototypes at the Black Rock
Mesa site of the Telescope Array experiment in central Utah, USA. All three
telescopes have been steadily taking data since installation. We report on the
design and installation of these prototypes, and present some preliminary
results, including measurements of artificial light sources, distant
ultraviolet lasers, and UHECRs. Furthermore, we discuss some additional uses
for these simplified low-cost fluorescence telescopes, including the
facilitation of a systematic comparison of the transparency of the atmosphere
above the Telescope Array experiment and the Pierre Auger Observatory, a study
of the systematic uncertainty associated with the existing fluorescence
detectors of these two experiments, and a cross-calibration of their energy and

transitions between equilibria is possible because of noise. We study the

we show that the control term has two effects: i) a stabilizing effect by
deepening the potential well around the desirable equilibrium, and ii) a

significantly reduce the computational cost of determining the suitable control

the simulated results, the error of the estimated temperature is commonly <
13%, and that of the estimated density is < 25% for a < 1% uncertainty of the

achieved if the uncertainty of the line fluxes are lower than 3%. In addition,
the estimated values are more representative of the properties in the
relatively high-density region if the gas density gradient is present in the H

But the accuracy will be improved if a line-to-continuum ratio at millimeter

the desorption energetics of H2 molecules on an amorphous diamond-like carbon

resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) method for H2 detection, the
H2 coverage-dependent activation energies for H2 desorption are determined. The
activation energies decrease with increasing H2 coverage and are centered at 30
meV with a narrow distribution. Using a combination of photostimulated
desorption and REMPI methods, the time variations of the surface number density

these measurements, we show that H2 formation on a DLC surface is quite

recombination reactions suggests that H-atom diffusion on a DLC surface is
mediated by quantum mechanical tunneling. In astrophysically relevant
conditions, H2 recombination due to physisorbed H-atoms is unlikely to occur at
20 K, suggesting that chemisorbed H atoms might play a role in H2 formation at

exhibits a large magnetocaloric effect, making it useful for magnetic
refrigerator applications. We investigate the electronic structure of GdNi by
carrying out x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) at T = 25 K in the ferrimagnetic phase. We analyze the Gd
M$_{4,5}$-edge ($3d$ - $4f$) and Ni L$_{2,3}$-edge ($2p$ - $3d$) spectra using
atomic multiplet and cluster model calculations, respectively. The atomic
multiplet calculation for Gd M$_{4,5}$-edge XAS indicates that Gd is trivalent
in GdNi, consistent with localized $4f$ states. On the other hand, a model
cluster calculation for Ni L$_{2,3}$-edge XAS shows that Ni is effectively
divalent in GdNi and strongly hybridized with nearest neighbour Gd states,
resulting in a $d$-electron count of 8.57. The Gd M$_{4,5}$-edge XMCD spectrum
is consistent with a ground state configuration of S = 7/2 and L=0. The Ni
L$_{2,3}$-edge XMCD results indicate that the antiferromagnetically aligned Ni
moments exhibit a small but finite magnetic moment ( $m_{tot}$ $\sim$ 0.12
$\mu_B$ ) with the ratio $m_{o}/m_{s}$ $\sim$ 0.11. Valence band hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy shows Ni $3d$ features at the Fermi level,
confirming a partially filled $3d$ band, while the Gd $4f$ states are at high
binding energies away from the Fermi level. The results indicate that the Ni
$3d$ band is not fully occupied and contradicts the charge-transfer model for
rare-earth based alloys. The obtained electronic parameters indicate that GdNi
is a strongly correlated charge transfer metal with the Ni on-site Coulomb
energy being much larger than the effective charge-transfer energy between the
Ni $3d$ and Gd $4f$ states.

find that, in our model, although some $(s,S)$-type policy is indeed optimal in
some cases, the $(s,S)$-type policy can not always be optimal. In particular,
we show that there exist cases in which an $(s,S)$ policy is optimal for some
initial levels but it is strictly worse than a generalized $(s,\{S(x):x\leq

it orders nothing for $x>s$ and orders up to level $S(x)$ for $x\leq s$, where

Under these circumstances, we can use multiple classic strategies as multiple

the bandit algorithm by the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we present a portfolio bandit strategy through Thompson sampling
which aims to make online portfolio choices by effectively exploiting the
performances among multiple arms. Also, by constructing multiple strategic
arms, we can obtain the optimal investment portfolio to adapt different

different investment risk preferences, which can be adaptive to various

could be located close to the event horizon of the central black hole and how
it affects the gravitational lensing signal. We consider a simple toy model
where the matter is concentrated in the rather small region between the inner
photon sphere associated with the mass of central black hole and outer photon
sphere associated with the total mass outside. If no photon sphere is present
inside the matter distribution, then effective potential displays an
interesting trend with maxima at inner and outer photon sphere, with a peak at
inner photon sphere higher than that at outer photon sphere. In such a case we
get three distinct set of infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein
rings that occur due to the light rays that approach the black hole from a
distant source and get reflected just outside the outer photon sphere, due to
light rays that enter the outer photon sphere slightly above the outer peak and
get reflected off the potential barrier inside the matter distribution and due
to the light rays that get reflected just outside the inner photon sphere. This
kind of pattern of images is quite unprecedented. We show that since
relativistic images are highly demagnified, only three images are prominently
visible from the point of observations in the presence of matter as opposed to
only one prominent image in case of a single isolated black hole and also
compute the time delay between them. This provides a smoking gun signature of
the presence of matter lump around the black hole. We further argue that if the
mass of the black hole inferred from the observation of the size of its shadow
is less than the mass inferred from the motion of objects around it, it signals
the presence of matter in the vicinity of the black hole.

It mitigates the undesired properties of high-dimensional spaces to facilitate
classification, compression, and visualization of high-dimensional data. During
the last decade, researchers proposed many new (non-linear) techniques for
dimensionality reduction. Most of these techniques are based on the intuition
that data lies on or near a complex low-dimensional manifold that is embedded
in the high-dimensional space. New techniques for dimensionality reduction aim
at identifying and extracting the manifold from the high-dimensional space.
Isomap is one of widely-used low-dimensional embedding methods, where geodesic
distances on a weighted graph are incorporated with the classical scaling
(metric multidimensional scaling). The Isomap chooses the nearest neighbours
based on the distance only which causes bridges and topological instability. In
this paper, we propose a new algorithm to choose the nearest neighbours to
reduce the number of short-circuit errors and hence improves the topological
stability. Because at any point on the manifold, that point and its nearest
neighbours form a vector subspace and the orthogonal to that subspace is
orthogonal to all vectors spans the vector subspace. The prposed algorithmuses
the point itself and its two nearest neighbours to find the bases of the
subspace and the orthogonal to that subspace which belongs to the orthogonal
complementary subspace. The proposed algorithm then adds new points to the two
nearest neighbours based on the distance and the angle between each new point
and the orthogonal to the subspace. The superior performance of the new
algorithm in choosing the nearest neighbours is confirmed through experimental
work with several datasets.

SNR, contrast, and higher resolution derived from the higher magnetic field
(B0). Nonetheless, with the increased B0 of UHF MRI, the transmit RF magnetic
field (B1+) inhomogeneity also became one of the critical issues requiring
attention. As the effective wavelength of RF becomes comparable or smaller than
the dimension of the brain at B0 larger than 7 Tesla, the increased B1+
inhomogeneity of UHF MRI results in poor SNR and uneven contrast. While
parallel transmission techniques (PTx) and high permittivity material (HPM)
structures for the mitigation of B1+ inhomogeneity have been suggested, the
associated complexity in PTx and restricted volume of homogenization with HPM
approach still remain as challenges. In this work, we address the B1+
inhomogeneity in the notion of mode-shaping. Treating a brain phantom as a
dielectric potential-well resonator, we apply a phantom-conformal HPM
potential-well in combination with a low-index potential barrier (air), to
achieve the homogeneity of B1+ in the region of interest (ROI). Based on the
electromagnetic simulations using a realistic brain model at 7T, we show that
the proposed HPM structure reduces both the average deviation of B1+ in axial
slices by 54% and peak SAR by 42%, respectively.

algorithm is a neural network which essentially trains to ignore sequencing

reads. Mixture components are then reconstructed by finding consensus of the

contribution to the radial velocity variations, at least for solar-like stars.
A common technique to correct for this component is to model the RV as a linear
function of chromospheric emission, because both are strongly correlated with
the coverage by plages. This correction is not perfect: the aim of the present
study is to understand the limits of this correction and to improve it. We
investigate these questions by analysing a large set of synthetic time series
corresponding to old main sequence F6-K4 stars modelled using a consistent set
of parameters. We focus here on the analysis of the correlation between time
series, in particular between RV and chromospheric emission on different
timescales. We also study the temporal variation for each time series.
Inclination strongly impacts these correlations, as well as additional signals
(granulation and supergranulation). Although RV and LogR'HK are often well
correlated, a combination of geometrical effects (butterfly diagrams related to
dynamo processes and inclination) and activity level variations over time
create an hysteresis pattern during the cycle, which produces a departure from
an excellent correlation: for a given activity level, the RV is higher or lower
during the ascending phase compared to the descending phase of the cycle
depending on inclination, with a reversal for inclinations about 60 deg from
pole-on. This hysteresis is also observed for the Sun and other stars. This
property is due to the spatio-temporal distribution of the activity pattern and
to the difference in projection effects of the RV and chromospheric emission.
These results allow us to propose a new method which significantly improves the
correction for long timescales, and could be crucial to improving detection
rates of planets in the habitable zone around F6-K4 stars.

exchange (CX) with cold gas. To determine which physical process(es) may be
responsible for this inconsistency, we present a systematic spectroscopic
analysis based on 0.8 Ms XMM-Newton/RGS data, together with complementary
Chandra/ACIS-S images. The combination of these data enables us to reveal
multiple non-CIE spectroscopic diagnostics, including but not limited to the
large G-ratios of He$\alpha$ triplets (OVII, NVI, and NeIX) and the high Lyman
series line ratios (OVIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\gamma$/Ly$\alpha$, and
NVII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$), which are not expected for a CIE plasma, and the
high iron line ratios (FeXVIII 14.2 \AA/FeXVII~17 \AA and FeXVII~15 \AA/17
\AA), which suggest much higher temperatures than other line ratios, as well as
their spatial variations. Neither CX nor RS explains all these spectroscopic
diagnostics satisfactorily. Alternatively, we find that an active galactic

extrapolated the 3D coronal magnetic fields based on time series of the
photospheric vector magnetic fields under a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
approximation. The NLFFFs nicely reproduced the observed sigmoidal structure
which is widely considered to be preeruptive magnetic configuration. In
particular, we found that the sigmoid is composed of two branches of sheared
arcade loops. On the basis of the NLFFFs, we investigated the sheared arcade
loops to explore the onset process of the eruptive flare using three
representative magnetohydrodynamic instabilities: the kink, torus, and double
arc instabilities (DAI). The DAI, recently proposed by Ishiguro & Kusano, is a
double arc loop that can be more easily destabilized than a torus loop.
Consequently, the NLFFFs are found to be quite stable against the kink and
torus instabilities. However, the sheared arcade loops formed prior to the
flare possibly become unstable against the DAI. As a possible scenario for the
onset process of the M6.5 flare, we suggest a three-step process: (1) double
arc loops are formed by the sheared arcade loops through the tether-cutting
reconnection during an early phase of the flare, (2) the DAI contributes to the
expansion of destabilized double arc loops, and (3) finally, the torus
instability makes the full eruption.

these systems to collapse in an avalanche or cascading manner in the case of
random failures or malicious attacks. The robustness of multilayer networks has
attracted great interest, where the modeling and theoretical studies of which
always rely on the concept of multilayer networks and percolation methods. A
straightforward and tacit assumption is that the interdependence across network
layers is strong, which means that a node will fail entirely with the removal
of all links if one of its interdependent neighbours fails. However, this
oversimplification cannot describe the general form of interactions across the
network layers in a real-world multilayer system. In this paper, we reveal the
nature of the avalanche disintegration of general multilayer networks with
arbitrary interdependency strength across network layers. Specifically, we
identify that the avalanche process of the whole system can essentially be
decomposed into two microscopic cascading dynamics in terms of the propagation
direction of the failures: depth penetration and scope extension. In the
process of depth penetration, the failures propagate from layer to layer, where
the greater the number of failed nodes is, the greater the destructive power
that will emerge in an interdependency group. In the process of scope
extension, failures propagate with the removal of connections in each network
layer. Under the synergy of the two processes, we find that the percolation
transition of the system can be discontinuous or continuous with changes in the
interdependency strength across network layers, which means that sudden
system-wide collapse can be avoided by controlling the interdependency strength
across network layers.

decays of the heavy quarkonium $\eta_Q$ ($Q$ being $c$ or $b$) has been done in
the literature within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD. One may observe
that the NNLO decay width still has large conventional renormalization scale
dependence due to its weaker pQCD convergence, e.g. about $(^{+4\%}_{-34\%})$
for $\eta_c$ and $(^{+0.0}_{-9\%})$ for $\eta_b$, by varying the scale within
the range of $[m_Q, 4m_Q]$. The principle of maximum conformality (PMC)
provides a systematic way to fix the $\alpha_s$-running behavior of the
process, which satisfies the requirements of renormalization group invariance
and eliminates the conventional renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities.
Using the PMC single-scale method, we show that the resultant PMC conformal
series is renormalization scale independent, and the precision of the $\eta_Q$
inclusive decay width can be greatly improved. Taking the relativistic
correction $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}v^2)$ into consideration, the ratios of the
$\eta_{Q}$ decays to light hadrons or $\gamma\gamma$ are: $R^{\rm
NNLO}_{\eta_c}|_{\rm{PMC}}=(3.93^{+0.26}_{-0.24})\times10^3$ and $R^{\rm
NNLO}_{\eta_b}|_{\rm{PMC}}=(22.85^{+0.90}_{-0.87})\times10^3$, respectively.
Here the errors are for $\Delta\alpha_s(M_Z) = \pm0.0011$. As a step forward,
by applying the Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation approach (PAA) over the PMC
conformal series, we obtain approximate NNNLO predictions for those two ratios,
e.g. $R^{\rm NNNLO}_{\eta_c}|_{\rm{PAA+PMC}} =(5.66^{+0.65}_{-0.55})\times10^3$
and $R^{\rm NNNLO}_{\eta_b}|_{\rm{PAA+PMC}}=(26.02^{+1.24}_{-1.17})\times10^3$.
The $R^{\rm NNNLO}_{\eta_c}|_{\rm{PAA+PMC}}$ ratio agrees with the latest PDG
value $R_{\eta_c}^{\rm{exp}}=(5.3_{-1.4}^{+2.4})\times10^3$, indicating the
necessity of a strict calculation of NNNLO terms.

4-dimensional universe on a brane is modified at high temperatures while the
standard Big Bang cosmology is reproduced at low temperatures. Based on two
well-known scenarios, the Randall-Sundrum and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld
cosmologies, we investigate the braneworld cosmological effect on the relic
density of a non-thermal dark matter particle whose interactions with the
Standard Model particles are so weak that its relic density is determined by
the freeze-in mechanism. For dark matter production processes in the early
universe, we assume a simple scenario with a light vector-boson mediator for
the dark matter particle to communicate with the Standard Model particles. We
find that the braneworld cosmological effect can dramatically alters the
resultant dark matter relic density from the one in the standard Big Bang
cosmology. As an application, we consider a right-handed neutrino dark matter
in the minimal $B-L$ extended Standard Model with a light $B-L$ gauge boson
($Z^\prime$) as a mediator. We find an impact of the braneworld cosmological
effect on the search for the long-lived $Z^\prime$ boson at the

  non-clinical claims data",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problems of modeling and predicting a long-term and
``blurry'' relapse that occurs after a medical act, such as a surgery. The
relapse is observed only indirectly, in a ``blurry'' fashion, through
longitudinal prescriptions of drugs over a long period of time after the
medical act. We introduce a new model, called ZiMM (Zero-inflated Mixture of
Multinomial distributions) in order to capture long-term and blurry relapses.
On top of it, we build an end-to-end deep-learning architecture called ZiMM
Encoder-Decoder (ZiMM ED) that can learn from the complex, irregular, highly
heterogeneous and sparse patterns of health events that are observed through a
claims-only database. ZiMM ED is applied on a ``non-clinical'' claims database,
that contains only timestamped reimbursement codes for drug purchases, medical
procedures and hospital diagnoses, the only available clinical feature being
the age of the patient. This setting is more challenging than a setting where
bedside clinical signals are available. Our motivation for using such a
non-clinical claims database is its exhaustivity population-wise, compared to
clinical electronic health records coming from a single or a small set of
hospitals. Indeed, we consider a dataset containing the claims of almost
\emph{all French citizens} who had surgery for prostatic problems, with a
history between 1.5 and 5 years. We consider a long-term (18 months) relapse
(urination problems still occur despite surgery), which is blurry since it is
observed only through the reimbursement of a specific set of drugs for
urination problems. Our experiments show that ZiMM ED improves several
baselines, including non-deep learning and deep-learning approaches, and that
it allows working on such a dataset with minimal preprocessing work.

  Modulated Side Information","Submitted to IEEE VTC 2020 Spring Conference",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a proposal to improve the reliability of a downlink multiuser
(MU) MIMO transmission scheme is investigated with the use of a new approach in
orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) and network coding with a
superposition modulated system and side information. With the new encoded OSTBC
approach, diversity is offered where each user receives all other users'
symbols, which allows the recovery of symbols in several ways. In addition,
multiple users can be accommodated with the same resource, which is quite
useful in a wireless system where resources are always restricted. By employing
superposition modulation, the side information needed for error recovery can be
transmitted over the same resource used for the normal information frame. In
addition, the proposed system exploits diversity through a novel technique of
sub-constellation alignment-based signal combining for efficient side
information dissemination. A detailed analysis of the new OSTBC approach is
carried out. It is shown that the performance of the MU-MIMO system can be
improved significantly in terms of block and frame error rates (BLER, FER)
considered as reliability measures. By accommodating a reasonable number of
multiple users, high reliability is achieved at the expense of the rate. To
compensate for the low rate, conventional OSTBC can be considered and
simulation results are shown, where, as a penalty to pay, multiple orthogonal
resources are required.

trapped fluxons are present, they can move solely but also simultaneously with
the pairs. Locking between the rotating excitations (fluxons and antifluxons)
and the Josephson frequency leads to the appearance of zero field steps in the
current-voltage characteristics, which can further exhibit branching due to
resonance between the rotating excitations and plasma oscillations in their
tale. The number of zero field steps and their branching are strongly
determined by the total number of excitations present in the system. High
resolution analysis further reveals not only some interesting properties of
zero field steps, but also shows that the current-voltage characteristics is

evolve and sustain progress in society. No studies to date allows us to explain
the endogenous processes that support the evolution of scientific disciplines
and emergence of new scientific fields in applied sciences of physics. This
study confronts this problem here by investigating the evolution of
experimental physics to explain and generalize some characteristics of the
dynamics of applied sciences. Empirical analysis suggests properties about the
evolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as:
a) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a
process of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous
entities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of
science via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new
technologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific
disciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by
development of general purpose technologies, the evolution of experimental
physics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and
theoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer,
information systems and applied computational science. Results also reveal that
average duration of the upwave of scientific production in scientific fields
supporting experimental physics is about 80 years. Overall, then, this study
begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, some
characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics of scientific disciplines that can
lay a foundation for the development of comprehensive properties explaining the
evolution of science as a whole for supporting fruitful research policy
implications directed to advancement of science and technological progress in
society.

  We compute time-dependent evolution of a black hole accretion disk, in

accounts for nuclear structure of dense, degenerate matter. Free protons,
neutrons, and electron-positron pairs form a neutron-rich, magnetically driven

  Here the heavy elements up to the Uranium and Gold are synthesized and may
contribute to the chemical enrichment of the circum-burst medium. Their
radio-active decay will give signal in lower energies in a timescale of
weeks-months after the GRB prompt phase.
  In addition, the magnetic fields are responsible for the launching of
ultra-relativistic jets along the rotation axis of the central black hole,
according to the well-known Blandford-Znajek mechanism. These jets are sites of
variable high energy emission in gamma rays. We find that the magnetic field
and the black hole spin account for the observed variability timescales and jet
energetics.

measuring $P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ in the ""Foreground Avoidance"" technique.
Though the foregrounds are largely localised within a wedge. we find that the
small leakage beyond the wedge surpasses the 21-cm signal across a significant
part of the $(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ plane. The extent of foreground leakage
is extremely sensitive to the frequency window function used to estimate
$P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$. It is possible to reduce the leakage by making
the window function narrower, however this comes at the expense of losing a
larger fraction of the 21-cm signal. It is necessary to balance these competing
effects to identify an optimal window function. Considering a broad class of
cosine window functions, we identify a six term window function as optimal for
21-cm power spectrum estimation with OWFA. Considering only the $k$-modes where
the expected 21-cm power spectrum exceeds the predicted foregrounds by a factor
of $100$ or larger, a $5\,\sigma$ detection of the binned power spectrum is

we formulate the learning of the two hyper-parameters as an architecture

can lead to significant accuracy improvements, which we referred to as

reduce the computational resource significantly with similar or better
accuracy. Besides, the resource needed for CSPN++ can be adjusted w.r.t. the
computational budget automatically. Finally, to avoid the side effects of noise

thermotherapeutic research for breast cancer. Here, we report that iron oxide
nanoparticles have the dual capacity to act as both magnetic and drug delivery
agents. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro effect of the
loading of doxorubicin (DOX) on negatively charged polycarboxylic iron-oxide
nanoparticles (SPIONs) and Rhodamine B functionalized SPIONs on breast
carcinoma cell lines. For proper analysis and understanding of cell behavior
after administration of DOX-SPIONs compared with free DOX, a complex set of in

cellular uptake, were utilized. In summary, we have developed a magnetic
nanoparticle-based drug delivery system that sequentially delivers the
cytotoxic drug doxorubicin to breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The
drug-coated nanoparticles, DOX-NPs, were assembled stepwise, with doxorubicin
adsorbed to bare iron oxide nanoparticles first, by electrostatic reaction and
allowed for the complexation of doxorubicin. In contrast, they were
internalized to a much greater extent in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and were
cytotoxic due to the synergistic action of the two drugs and the effects of
hyperthermia. The drug-coated particles were able to inhibit growth and
proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, indicating that the system has

better detection time determined by the true null state. Third, when the
parameter value under the null hypothesis is unknown, but is known to be equal
for all normal processes, the proposed algorithm is consistent in terms of
achieving error probability that decays to zero with the detection delay.
Finally, an explicit upper bound on the error probability under the proposed
algorithm is established for the finite sample regime. Extensive experiments on
synthetic dataset and DARPA intrusion detection dataset are conducted,
demonstrating strong performance of the proposed algorithm over existing
methods.

criticality' (SOC), for systems tuning themselves to the edge of bistability of
a discontinuous phase transition, rather than to the critical point of a
continuous one. The equations defining the mathematical theory of SOB turn out
to bear strong resemblance to a (Landau-Ginzburg) theory recently proposed to
analyze the dynamics of the cerebral cortex. This theory describes the neuronal
activity of coupled mesoscopic patches of cortex, homeostatically regulated by
short-term synaptic plasticity. The theory for cortex dynamics entails,
however, some significant differences with respect to SOB, including the lack
of a (bulk) conservation law, the absence of a perfect separation of timescales
and, the fact that in the former, but not in the second, there is a parameter
that controls the overall system state (in blatant contrast with the very idea
of self-organization). Here, we scrutinize --by employing a combination of
analytical and computational tools-- the analogies and differences between both
theories and explore whether in some limit SOB can play an important role to
explain the emergence of scale-invariant neuronal avalanches observed
empirically in the cortex. We conclude that, actually, in the limit of
infinitely slow synaptic-dynamics, the two theories become identical, but the
timescales required for the self-organization mechanism to be effective do not
seem to be biologically plausible. We discuss the key differences between
self-organization mechanisms with/without conservation and with/without
infinitely separated timescales. In particular, we introduce the concept of
'self-organized collective oscillations' and scrutinize the implications of our
findings in neuroscience, shedding new light into the problems of scale
invariance and oscillations in cortical dynamics.

hard walls of a prescribed roughness profile, using a method that fully
accounts for the fluid mechanics of the solvent between the particles, and
between the particles and the walls, as well as for the solid mechanics of
changes in the particle shapes. We thus capture the widely observed phenomenon
of elastohydrodynamic wall slip, in which the soft particles become deformed in
shear and lift away from the wall slightly, leaving behind a thin lubricating
solvent layer of high shear. For imposed stresses below the material's bulk
yield stress, we show the observed wall slip to be dominated by this thin
solvent layer. At higher stresses, it is augmented by an additional
contribution arising from a fluidisation of the first few layers of particles
near the wall. By systematically varying the roughness of the walls, we
quantify a suppression of slip with increasing wall roughness. For smooth
walls, slip radically changes the steady state bulk flow curve of shear stress
as a function of shear rate, by conferring a branch of apparent (slip-induced)
flow even for $\sigma<\sigma_y$, as seen experimentally. We also elucidate the
effects of slip on the dynamics of yielding following the imposition of a
constant shear stress, characterising the timescales at which bulk yielding
arises, and at which slip first sets in.

manipulation and transfer of magnetically stored information. Thermal magnon
currents, generated by temperature gradients, can be used to move magnetic
textures, from domain walls, to magnetic vortices and skyrmions. In the last
years, theoretical studies have centered in ferro- and antiferromagnetic spin
structures, where domain walls always move towards the hotter end of the
thermal gradient. Here we perform numerical studies using atomistic spin
dynamics simulations and complementary analytical calculations to derive an
equation of motion for the domain wall velocity. We demonstrate that in
ferrimagnets, domain wall motion under thermal magnon currents shows a much
richer dynamics. Below the Walker breakdown, we find that the temperature
gradient always pulls the domain wall towards the hot end by minimizating its
free energy, in agreement with the observations for ferro- and antiferromagnets
in the same regime. Above Walker breakdown, the ferrimagnetic domain wall can
show the opposite, counterintuitive behavior of moving towards the cold end. We
show that in this case, the motion to the hotter or the colder ends is driven
by angular momentum transfer and therefore strongly related to the angular
momentum compensation temperature, a unique property of ferrimagnets where the
intrinsic angular momentum of the ferrimagnet is zero while the sublattice
angular momentum remains finite. In particular, we find that below the
compensation temperature the wall moves towards the cold end, whereas above it,
towards the hot end. Moreover, we find that for ferrimagnets, there is a torque
compensation temperature at which the domain wall dynamics shows similar
characteristics to antiferromagnets, that is, quasi-inertia-free motion and the
absence of Walker breakdown.

produces radial caustics, followed by multi-stream flows of accreted dark
matter inside the halos. In particular, the radius of the outermost caustic
called the splashback radius exhibits a sharp drop in the slope of the density
profile. Here, we focus on the multi-stream structure of CDM halos inside the
splashback radius. To analyze this, we use and extend the SPARTA algorithm
developed by Diemer. By tracking the particle trajectories accreting onto the
halos, we count their number of apocenter passages, which is then used to
reveal the multi-stream flows of the dark matter particles. The resultant
multi-stream structure in radial phase space is compared with the prediction of
the self-similar solution by Fillmore & Goldreich for each halo. We find that
$\sim30\%$ of the simulated halos satisfy our criteria to be regarded as being
well fitted to the self-similar solution. The fitting parameters in the
self-similar solution characterizes physical properties of the halos, including
the mass accretion rate and the size of the outermost caustic (i.e., the
splashback radius). We discuss in detail the correlation of these fitting
parameters and other measures directly extracted from the $N$-body simulation.

  Applications using Formal Specifications",,,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There have been many studies on automated test generation for mobile
Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. These studies successfully
demonstrate how to detect fatal exceptions and achieve high code and activity
coverage with fully automated test generation engines. However, it is unclear
how many GUI functions these engines manage to test. Furthermore, these engines
implement only implicit test oracles. We propose Fully Automated Reinforcement
LEArning-Driven Specification-Based Test Generator for Android
(FARLEAD-Android). FARLEAD-Android accepts a GUI-level formal specification as
a Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. By dynamically executing the
Application Under Test (AUT), it learns how to generate a test that satisfies
the LTL formula using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The LTL formula does not
just guide the test generation but also acts as a specified test oracle,
enabling the developer to define automated test oracles for a wide variety of
GUI functions by changing the formula. Our evaluation shows that
FARLEAD-Android is more effective and achieves higher performance in generating
tests for specified GUI functions than three known approaches, Random, Monkey,
and QBEa. To the best of our knowledge, FARLEAD-Android is the first fully
automated mobile GUI testing engine that uses formal specifications.

standard is a well-known problem in scenarios where multiple long range and
faulty links compete for the shared medium. The alternatives found in the
literature are mostly focused on point-to-point and rarely on long range links.
Currently, there is no solution optimized for maritime scenarios, where the
point-to-multipoint links can reach several tens of kilometers, while suffering
from degradation due to the harsh environment. This paper presents a novel MAC
protocol that uses explicit signalling messages to control access to the medium
by a central node. In this solution, this role is played by an Access Point
that sends token messages addressed to each associated station, which is
granted exclusive access to the medium and assigned a number of credits; after
sending its own packets (if any), a station must release control of the token.
Simulation results show that this mechanism has superior performance in
point-to-multipoint, long range and faulty links, allowing a fairly and more
efficient usage of the shared resources among all nodes.

on. The task is challenging since legal case documents are usually not
well-structured, and these rhetorical roles may be subjective (as evident from
variation of opinions between legal experts). In this paper, we address this
task for judgments from the Supreme Court of India. We label sentences in 50
documents using multiple human annotators, and perform an extensive analysis of
the human-assigned labels. We also attempt automatic identification of the
rhetorical roles of sentences. While prior approaches towards this task used
Conditional Random Fields over manually handcrafted features, we explore the
use of deep neural models which do not require hand-crafting of features.
Experiments show that neural models perform much better in this task than
baseline methods which use handcrafted features.

PLAL was developed, where a doubled frequency Nd:YAG laser beam (532 nm, ~ 5
ns, 10 Hz) at different fluences and for different times was directed into a
sealed vessel, toward the interface of the meniscus of ethanol with a tilted
bulk metal target. Palladium, copper and silver NPs, synthesized in the
performed proof of concept experiments, were mass quantified, by an inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and characterized by
ultraviolet-visible extinction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy
and X-ray diffraction. The NPs consist of crystalline metals of a few nm size
and their ablation rates and agglomeration levels depend on the employed laser
fluences. The ensuing laser power-specific productivity curves for each metal,
peaked at specific laser fluences, were fitted to the results of a simple model
accounting for plasma absorption and heat transfer. The resulting peaked yields
and concentrations were more than an order of magnitude higher than those
obtained for totally immersed targets. Besides, the measured productivities
showed nearly linear dependencies during time intervals up to 30 min of
ablation, but became saturated at 1 h, due to accumulation of a significant
number of NPs along the laser beam path, reducing the laser intensity reaching
the target. This suggested approach could inspire future studies that will
contribute to further developments of efficient generation of NPs with
controlled characteristics.

composition. To constrain the bulk density one needs an estimate for the mass
of the asteroid. The mass is estimated by analyzing an asteroid's gravitational
interaction with another object, such as another asteroid during a close
encounter. An estimate for the mass has typically been obtained with linearized
least-squares methods despite the fact that this family of methods is not able
to properly describe non-Gaussian parameter distributions. In addition, the
uncertainties reported for asteroid masses in the literature are sometimes
inconsistent with each other and suspected to be unrealistically low. We
present a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the asteroid mass
estimation problem based on asteroid-asteroid close encounters. We verify that
our algorithm works correctly by applying it to synthetic data sets. We then
use astrometry available through the Minor Planet Center to estimate masses for
a few example cases and compare our results to results reported in the
literature.
  Our mass estimates for the synthetic data sets are fully consistent with the
ground truth. The nominal masses for real example cases typically agree with
the literature but tend to have greater uncertainties than what is reported in
recent literature. Possible reasons for this include different astrometric
datasets and/or weights, different test asteroids, different force models and
different algorithms. For (16) Psyche, the target of NASA's Psyche mission, our
maximum likelihood mass is approximately 55% of what is reported in the
literature. Such a low mass would imply that the bulk density is significantly
lower than previously expected and hence disagrees with the theory of (16)
Psyche being the metallic core of a protoplanet. We however note that masses

cases by determining the best model in forecasting its future number of cases.
The data set was retrieved from National HIV/AIDS and STI Surveillance and
Strategic Information Unit (NHSSS) of the Department of Health containing 132
observations. This data set was divided into two parts, one for model building
and another for forecast evaluation. The original series has an increasing
trend and is nonstationary with indication of non-constant variance. Box-Cox
transformation and ordinary differencing were performed on the series. The
differenced series is stationary and tentative models were identified through
ACF and PACF plots. SARIMA has the smallest chosen AIC value. The chosen model
undergoes the diagnostic checking. The residuals of the model behave like a
white noise while the forecast errors behave like a Gaussian white noise.
Considering all diagnostics, the model may be used for forecasting the monthly
cases of HIV in the Philippines. Forecasted values show that HIV cases will
maintain their current trend.

applying a small voltage perturbation the current signal is recorded and the
recombination processes and defect distributions are among the typical outcomes
in IS studies. In this work a photo-impedance approach, named light intensity
modulated impedance spectroscopy (LIMIS), is first tested in all-solid-state
photovoltaic cells by recording the individual photocurrent (IMPS) and
photovoltage (IMVS) responsivity signals due to a small light perturbation at
open-circuit (OC), and combining them: LIMIS=IMVS/IMPS. The experimental LIMIS
spectra from silicon, organic, and perovskite solar cells are presented and
compared with IS. An analysis of the equivalent circuit numerical models for
total resistive and capacitive features is discussed. Our theoretical findings
show a correction to the lifetimes evaluations by obtaining the total
differential resistances and capacitances combining IS and LIMIS measurements.
This correction addresses the discrepancies among different techniques, as
shown with transient photovoltage. The experimental differences between IS and

bias-dependent photo-current correction to the empirical Shockley equation of
the steady-state current at different illumination intensities around OC and
(iii) are proposed as a potential figure of merit for characterizing
performance and stability of solar cells. In addition, new features are
reported for the low-frequency capacitance of perovskite solar cells, measured

modeling to regulate the prediction, which achieved better performance compared
to traditional loss functions. More specifically, a new distribution regression
method, Deep Distribution Regression (DDR), is proposed to estimate arbitrary
quantiles of the response variable. Our DDR method consists of two models: a Q
model, which predicts the corresponding value for arbitrary quantile, and an F
model, which predicts the corresponding quantile for arbitrary value.
Furthermore, the duality between Q and F models enables us to design a novel
loss function for joint training and perform a dual inference mechanism. Our

considered to be a promising method to overcome those challenges. Current AI
systems that incorporate radiography tend to use bremsstrahlung beams, which

and, due to its generality, it deals with possibly nonconvex constraints,
enforced either in a hard or soft way. Motivated by recent progresses in the
field of distributed and constrained nonconvex optimization, we apply the

shows that such a method allows us to support scenarios where selected
constraints (i.e., knowledge), data, and outcomes of the learning process can
be locally stored in each computational node without being shared with the rest
of the network, opening the road to further investigations into
privacy-preserving LfC. Constraints act as a bridge between what is shared over
the net and what is private to each node and no central authority is required.
We demonstrate the applicability of these ideas in two distributed real-world

superiorization can approach the solution of the optimization problem and leads

sampling parameter space, we measure the accretion and torque on a binary
system from a circumbinary disk. In agreement with previous studies, we find
that the net torque on the binary is positive for mass ratios close to unity,
and that accretion always drives the binary towards equal mass. Accretion
variability depends sensitively on the numerical sink prescription, but the
torque and relative accretion onto each component do not depend on the sink
timescale. Positive torque and highly variable accretion occurs only for mass
ratios greater than around $0.05$. This means that for mass ratios below
$0.05$, the binary would migrate inward until the secondary accreted sufficient
mass, after which it would execute a U-turn and migrate outward. We explore a
range of viscosities, from $\alpha = 0.03$ to $\alpha = 0.15$, and find that
this outward torque is proportional to the viscous torque, simply proportional
to viscosity in this range. Dependence of accretion and torque on mass ratio is
explored in detail, densely sampling mass ratios between $0.01$ and unity. For
mass ratio $q > 0.6$, accretion variability is found to exhibit a distinct
sawtooth pattern, typically with a five-orbit cycle that provides a ""smoking
gun"" prediction for variable quasars observed over long periods, as a potential
means to confirm the presence of a binary.

particles. Imposing a single $Z_N$ symmetry, which may be a remnant of a
spontaneously broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, seems to be the simplest way to
simultaneously stabilize several dark matter particles. In this paper we
systematically study scenarios for multi-component dark matter based on various
$Z_N$ symmetries ($N\leq 10$) and with different sets of scalar fields charged
under it. A generic feature of these scenarios is that the number of stable
particles is not determined by the Lagrangian but depends on the relations
among the masses of the different fields charged under the $Z_N$ symmetry. We
explicitly obtain and illustrate the regions of parameter space that are
consistent with up to five dark matter particles. For $N$ odd, all these
particles turn out to be complex, whereas for $N$ even one of them may be real.
Within this framework, many new models for multi-component dark matter can be
implemented.

distant qubits (two-level atom) which are separately trapped in their own (in

We consider the case in which the qubits can move along their cavity axes
rather than a static state of motion. We first examine the role of movement of
the qubit by studying the entropy evolution for each subsystem. We calculate
the average entropy over the initial states of the qubit. Then by performing a
Bell state measurement on the fields leaving the cavities, we swap the
entanglement between qubit-field in each cavity into qubit-qubit and
field-field subsystems. We use the entangling power to measure the average
amount of swapped entanglement over all possible pure initial states. Our
results are presented in two weak and strong coupling regimes. Our results
illustrate the positive role of the movement of the qubits on the swapped
entanglement. It is revealed that by considering certain conditions for the
initial state of qubits, it is possible to achieve a maximally long-leaving
stationary entanglement (Bell state) which is entirely independent of the
environmental variables as well as the velocity of qubits. This happens when
the two qubits have the same velocities.

in-trap laser-induced desorption of atoms from a sample brought very close to

have demonstrated a steady production of HCI of the stable isotope
$^{165}\mathrm{Ho}$ from samples of only $10^{12}$ atoms ($\sim$ 300 pg) in

use in other experiments or stored in the trapping volume of the EBIT for

high-precision measurement of the $Q_{\mathrm{EC}}$-value of the electron

achieved through off-line analysis of recorded biological signals such as

inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent.
Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended
periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of
non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for
diagnosing professionals.
  In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing
system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis
of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible
pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for
further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system to real-time
classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and
pathological rhythms.
  Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary
events and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a
reservoir computing paradigm. An event-driven neuron output layer is then
trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally, the filtered activity
of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating the
presence or absence of a pathological pattern.

exploits Interference Alignment and perfect, but delayed, channel state
information at the transmitters (delayed CSIT), improving the degrees of
freedom (DoF) that can be achieved for the broadcast channel (BC). Since its
appearance, many works have extended the concept of Retrospective Interference
Alignment (RIA) to other multi-user channel configurations. However, little is
known about the broadcast channel with multiple cells, i.e. the interference
broadcast channel (IBC). In this work, the DoF are studied for the $K$-user
$C$-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) IBC with delayed CSIT (with $K/C$
users per cell).
  We show that the straightforward application of the MAT scheme over the IBC
fails because it requires all interference to be received from the same source.
Hence, in this case not all the interference can be cancelled, thus blocking
the decoding of the received messages. We call this phenomenon as

provide a short review of the current status of the nuclear EDF and the
theoretical results obtained for properties of nuclei and nuclear matter. We
will first describe a method for determining the parameters of the EDF,

Hartree-Fock based fit to extensive set of data of ground state properties and
constraints. We will then describe the fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock based
random-phase-approximation theory for calculating the strength functions S(E)

of isoscalar and isovector giant resonances of multipolarities L=0-3 for a wide
range of spherical nuclei, using 33 EDFs associated with standard form of the
Skyrme type interactions, commonly employed in the literature. We investigate
the sensitivities E_CEN of the giant resonances to bulk properties of NM and
determine constraints on NM properties, such as the incompressibility
coefficient and effective mass, by comparing with experimental data on E_CEN of

features typically outperform non-text features in sentiment analysis or

advanced language models or word embeddings trained on massive data sources
while audio and video features are human-engineered and comparatively

all three modes via deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) and the proposed

straining of the flame shape into an elongated alligator flame maintained by
the anchoring mechanism of Gamezo in a bifurcated lambda shock due to boundary

orders of magnitude without any turbulence on the flame time scale. The

the convergence as a function of smoothing scale contains information similar
to standard shear 2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness,
contains additional non-Gaussian information. We present the formalism for
obtaining the convergence maps from the measured shear and for obtaining the

the covariance matrix from a large suite of numerical simulations. We test our

Much of the speech and vocal emotion research has relied on acted emotion
databases as valid proxies for studying natural emotions. To create models that
generalize to natural settings, it is crucial to work with valid prototypes --
ones that can be assumed to reliably represent natural emotions. More
concretely, it is important to study emulated emotions against natural emotions
in terms of their physiological, and psychological concomitants. In this paper,
we present an on-scale systematic study of the differences between natural and

model to understand the phonetic bases of emotions by discovering the most
'attended' phonemes for each class of emotions. We then compare these
attended-phonemes in their importance and distribution across acted and natural

phonemes in acted and natural speech, concluding moderate to low validity and

states via a continuous transition. Since $c^2_s > 0$, the neutrino density is
stable. For all cases the predicted late-time acceleration of the Universe is
asymptotically very close to that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Further extensions
of the theory to modify the neutrino sector of the Standard Model and to
incorporate inflation are also discussed. It is also shown that in the stable
regimes where the neutrino mass is given by the minimum of the thermodynamic
potential, the tree-level dynamics of the scalar field is robust with respect
to one-loop bosonic and fermionic corrections to the potential.

leverages a BERT model fine-tuned on the source dataset along with the

The Nakano circuit consists of a simple RLC circuit with a switch
voltage-depending reset rule which generates a discontinuous dynamics. Thus,
the model that we study is a network of identical spiking oscillators with
integrate-and-fire dynamics. The coupling between oscillators is linear, but
the network is subject to a common regime of reset depending on the global
state of the oscillator population. This constitutes the simplest way of build
pulse-coupled networks with arbitrary topology for this type of oscillators,
and it allows the emergence of synchronous states and different reset regimes.
The main result is that under certain hypothesis over the weight matrix (that
represents the network topology) the different reset regimes match and the
formalism of the master stability function can be generalized in order to study
the stability of the synchronous state and the discontinuous dynamic of the
network. Also, the low dimensionality of the Nakano's circuit allows to
implement the saltation-matrix method and numerical simulations can be
performed in order to analyze the role of the coupling mode in the
synchronization regime of the network and the influence of the voltage-type
variables.

multi-user scenario. We show that the diversity gain is independent of the
number of data streams and full spatial multiplexing order can be achieved in
both scenarios. Also, we show that the diversity gain in the multi-user
scenario is independent of the number of users in the system and only depends
on the number of the remote antenna units (RAUs) at the transmitter side, when
each user has only one RAU. The assumption here is that the channel state
information (CSI) is known at both sides of the transmitter and the receiver
and the number of antennas in each RAU goes to infinity. This latter assumption
can be relaxed by a large number of antennas in each RAU, similar to the case
for all massive MIMO research. Based on these assumptions, the diversity gain
for the single-user scenario is
$\frac{\left(\sum_{i,j}\beta_{ij}\right)^2}{\sum_{i,j}\beta_{ij}^2L_{ij}^{-1}}$
where $L_{ij}$ is the number of propagation paths and $\beta_{ij}$ is the large
scale fading coefficient between the $i$th RAU in the transmitter and the $j$th
RAU in the receiver. The diversity gain in the multi-user scenario for the
$k$-th user is $\frac{M^2}{\sum_{j}L_{kj}^{-1}}$ where $M$ represents the
number of RAUs at the transmitter. Simulation results show that when the
perfect channel state information assumption is satisfied, the use of BICMB
results in the diversity gain values predicted by the analysis.

  Broadcast Model","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.11677",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider Byzantine consensus in a synchronous system where nodes are
connected by a network modeled as a directed graph, i.e., communication links
between neighboring nodes are not necessarily bi-directional. The directed
graph model is motivated by wireless networks wherein asymmetric communication
links can occur. In the classical point-to-point communication model, a message
sent on a communication link is private between the two nodes on the link. This
allows a Byzantine faulty node to equivocate, i.e., send inconsistent
information to its neighbors. This paper considers the local broadcast model of
communication, wherein transmission by a node is received identically by all of
its outgoing neighbors. This allows such neighbors to detect a faulty node's
attempt to equivocate, effectively depriving the faulty nodes of the ability to
send conflicting information to different neighbors.
  Prior work has obtained sufficient and necessary conditions on undirected
graphs to be able to achieve Byzantine consensus under the local broadcast
model. In this paper, we obtain tight conditions on directed graphs to be able
to achieve Byzantine consensus with binary inputs under the local broadcast
model. The results obtained in the paper provide insights into the trade-off
between directionality of communication and the ability to achieve consensus.

solutions to help manage fire. Managing wildfire can include proactive fire
management such as prescribed burning within constrained areas or advancements
for reactive fire management (e.g., fire suppression). Because of the growing
societal impact, the JPL BlueSky program sought to assess the current state of
fire management and technology and determine areas with high return on
investment. To accomplish this, we met with the national interagency Unmanned
Aerial System (UAS) Advisory Group (UASAG) and with leading technology transfer
experts for fire science and management applications. We provide an overview of
the current state as well as an analysis of the impact, maturity and
feasibility of integrating different technologies that can be developed by JPL.
Based on the findings, the highest return on investment technologies for fire
management are first to develop single micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) autonomy,
autonomous sensing over fire, and the associated data and information system
for active fire local environment mapping. Once this is completed for a single
MAV, expanding the work to include many in a swarm would require further
investment of distributed MAV autonomy and MAV swarm mechanics, but could
greatly expand the breadth of application over large fires. Important to
investing in these technologies will be in developing collaborations with the
key influencers and champions for using UAS technology in fire management.

disabling hearing loss, and out of these 34 million are children. Estimates
suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling
hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US$
750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an
individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost.
  This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an
open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The
framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which
separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the
development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM
pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and
business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change
business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance
overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it
possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other
researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss
diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an
otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to
reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and

key aspect in addressing contemporary global challenges, such as climate
change, via self-amplifying positive feedbacks similar to the processes

latter is intended to avoid both inappropriate approximation of posterior
