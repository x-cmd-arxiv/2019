electron beams and X-rays. Self-injection is the most straightforward scheme
leading to high current and peak energies, but is susceptible to variations in
laser parameters and target characteristics. In this work improved control of
electron self-injection in the nonlinear cavity regime using two laser-pulses
propagating in tandem is investigated. In particular the advantages of the
tandem-pulse scheme in terms of injection threshold, electron energy and beam
properties in a regime relevant to betatron radiation are demonstrated.
Moreover it is shown that the laser power threshold for electron self-injection
can be reduced by up to a factor of two compared to the standard, single-pulse
wakefield scheme.

amount of heavy elements accreted by the planet, and its comparison with recent
structure models. Our model assumes an initial core growth dominated by pebble
accretion, and a second growth phase that is characterized by a moderate
accretion of both planetesimals and gas. The third phase is dominated by
runaway gas accretion during which the planet becomes detached from the disk.
The second and third phases are computed in detail, considering two different
prescriptions for the planetesimal accretion and fits from hydrodynamical
studies to compute the gas accretion in the detached phase. In order for
Jupiter to consist of $\sim$20-40 $M_{\oplus}$ of heavy elements as suggested
by structure models, we find that Jupiter's formation location is preferably at
an orbital distance of $1\lesssim a \lesssim 10$ au once the accretion of
planetesimals dominates. We find that Jupiter could accrete between $\sim$1 and
$\sim$15 $M_{\oplus}$ of heavy elements during runaway gas accretion, depending
on the assumed initial surface density of planetesimals and the prescription
used to estimate the heavy-element accretion during the final stage of the
planetary formation. This would yield an envelope metallicity of $\sim$0.5 to
$\sim$3 times solar. By computing the solid accretion during the detached
phase, we infer a planetary mass-metallicity ($M_P$-$M_Z$) relation of $M_Z
\sim M_P^{2/5}$ when a gap in the planetesimal disk is created, and of $M_Z
\sim M_P^{1/6}$ without a planetesimal gap. Our hybrid pebble-planetesimal
model can account for Jupiter's bulk and atmospheric enrichment. The high bulk
metallicity inferred for many giant exoplanets is difficult to explain from
standard formation models. This might suggest a migration history for such
highly enriched giant exoplanets and/or giant impacts after the disk's
dispersal.

aimed at probing variability of the X-ray obscurer on the shortest possible
timescales. The main goals of this study are to obtain independent constraints
on the density, and ultimately on the distance of the obscuring gas, as well as
to characterise the impact of variable obscuration on the observed X-ray
spectral-timing characteristics of Seyfert galaxies. Methods. We carried out a
comparative analysis of NGC 3783 during unobscured (using archival 2000-2001
XMM-Newton data) and obscured states (using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from the
2016 observational campaign). The timescales analysed range between ten hours
and about one hour. This study was then generalized to discuss the signatures
of variable obscuration in the X-ray spectral-timing characteristics of Seyfert
galaxies as a function of the physical properties of the obscuring gas.
Results. The X-ray obscurer in NGC 3783 is found to vary on timescales between
about one hour to ten hours. This variability is incoherent with the variations
of the X-ray continuum. A fast response (on timescales shorter than about 1.5
ks) of the ionisation state of the obscuring gas to the short timescale
variability of the primary X-ray continuum provides a satisfactory
interpretation of all the observed X-ray spectral-timing properties. This study
enabled us to put independent constraints on the density and location of the
obscuring gas. We found the gas to have a density of $n_{e}> 7.1 \times 10^7

different sub-clones compete with each other for resources under conditions of
Darwinian natural selection. Predicting the growth of these sub-clones within a
tumour is among the key challenges of modern cancer research. Predicting tumor
behavior enables the creation of risk profiles for patients and the
optimisation of their treatment by therapeutically targeting sub-clones more
likely to grow. Current research efforts in this space are focused on
mathematical modelling of population genetics to quantify the selective
advantage of sub-clones, thus enabling predictions of which sub-clones are more
likely to grow. These tumor evolution models are based on assumptions which are
not valid for real-world tumor micro-environment. Furthermore, these models are
often fit on a single instance of a tumor, and hence prediction models cannot
be validated. This paper presents an alternative approach for predicting cancer
evolution using a data-driven machine learning method. Our proposed method is
based on the intuition that if we can capture the true characteristics of
sub-clones within a tumor and represent it in the form of features, a
sophisticated machine learning algorithm can be trained to predict its
behavior. The work presented here provides a novel approach to predicting
cancer evolution, utilizing a data-driver approach. We strongly believe that
the accumulation of data from microbiologists, oncologists and machine learning

with $k$ servers. A collection of clients arrive in an online fashion, and upon
arrival, a client should irrevocably be matched to an as-yet-unmatched server.
The goal is to find an online matching which minimizes the total cost, i.e.,
the sum of distances between each client and the server it is matched to. We
know deterministic algorithms~\cite{KP93,khuller1994line} that achieve a
competitive ratio of $2k-1$, and this bound is tight for deterministic
algorithms. The problem has also long been considered in specialized metrics
such as the line metric or metrics of bounded doubling dimension, with the
current best result on a line metric being a deterministic $O(\log k)$
competitive algorithm~\cite{raghvendra2018optimal}. Obtaining (or refuting)
$O(\log k)$-competitive algorithms in general metrics and constant-competitive
algorithms on the line metric have been long-standing open questions in this
area.
  In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these lower bounds by
considering the Online Metric Matching with Recourse problem where we are
allowed to change a small number of previous assignments upon arrival of a new
client. Indeed, we show that a small logarithmic amount of recourse can
significantly improve the quality of matchings we can maintain. For general
metrics, we show a simple \emph{deterministic} $O(\log k)$-competitive
algorithm with $O(\log k)$-amortized recourse, an exponential improvement over
the $2k-1$ lower bound when no recourse is allowed. We next consider the line
metric, and present a deterministic algorithm which is $3$-competitive and has
$O(\log k)$-recourse, again a substantial improvement over the best known
$O(\log k)$-competitive algorithm when no recourse is allowed.

go beyond static skyrmions and theoretically show that the
formation/annihilation of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions is enabled by the
transient creation and propagation of topological singularities (magnetic
monopole-like Bloch points). Critically, during the winding/unwinding of
skyrmionic textures, our results predict that the Bloch-point propagation will
give rise to an emergent electric field in a terahertz frequency range and with

dynamics, which directly enable the tuneability on both frequency and amplitude
of this signal. Our studies provide a concept of directly exploiting
topological singularities for terahertz skyrmion-based electronic devices.

case, the large magnetic flux tubes with a significant drag force escape along
the vertical axis due to buoyancy. Magnetic pressure rises close to the black
hole and together with the centrifugal force, it combats gravity. The
tug-of-war among these forces causes the centrifugal pressure supported shock
to oscillate radially. We study the effects of successive injection of flux
tubes and find how the flux tube could be trapped inside the disc in regions of
highest entropy. Most interestingly, the shock wave remains at its average

object recognition on the event data. In object recognition, it is important
for a neural network to be robust to the variations of the data during testing.
For traditional cameras, translations are well handled because CNNs are
naturally equivariant to translations. However, because event cameras record
the change of light intensity of an image, the geometric shape of event volumes
will not only depend on the objects but also on their relative motions with

electromagnetic waves, spectrum maps are complicated functions of the spatial
coordinates. For this reason, model-free approaches have been preferred.
However, all existing schemes rely on some interpolation algorithm unable to
learn from data. This work proposes a novel approach to spectrum cartography
where propagation phenomena are learned from data. The resulting algorithms can
therefore construct a spectrum map from a significantly smaller number of
measurements than existing schemes since the spatial structure of shadowing and
other phenomena is previously learned from maps in other environments. Besides
the aforementioned new paradigm, this is also the first work to perform
spectrum cartography with deep neural networks. To exploit the manifold

these influences we start with the steady, diverging, and field-free wind model
of our previous papers and add weak to moderate toroidal fields to the winds in
order to generate arrays of outcomes after 500 y, after which the structures
grow almost homologously. As expected, toroidal fields in the stellar winds
invariably form very thin and dense axial features whose structure is best
described as a thin cold jet with an ultra-dense and neutral leading knot, or
""bullet"", at its tip. The speed of the leading knot depends only on the density
contrast (the ratio of injected to ambient gas densities at the nozzle) and
wind injection speed, but not on the field strength or opening angle. The lobes
formed by the ram pressure of the winds take a variety of forms and sizes that
depend primarily on the geometric structure of the injected gas and the density
contrast. About 20% of the HST images of prePNe show the unique signatures of
shaping by toroidal fields. Pairs of low-ionization knots seen along the major
axis of fully ionized PNe, often called ""FLIERs"" are easily explained as the
very dense, cold , and neutral remnants of magnetically formed knots.

bright high-latitude chromospheric region that spatially overlaps with a large
dark photospheric spot, in which the radial magnetic field reaches -3.7kG. With
a polar strength of -1.7kG, the dipole component of the large-scale field is
able to evacuate the central regions of the disc up to about 50% of the
co-rotation radius (at which the Keplerian orbital period equals the stellar
rotation period) throughout our observations, during which the average
accretion rate was found to be unusually high. We speculate that the magnetic
field of CI Tau is strong enough to sustain most of the time a magnetospheric
gap extending to at least 70% of the co-rotation radius, which would explain
why the rotation period of CI Tau is as long as 9d. Our results also imply that

equivalence relations. The equivalence relations are defined by expanded
normalization operations and new functions that map permutation polynomials
(PPs) to other PPs. Our expanded normalization applies to almost all PPs,
including when the characteristic of the finite field divides the degree of the
polynomial. The equivalence relations make it possible to reduce the size of
the space, when doing an exhaustive search. As a result, we have been able to
compute almost all permutation polynomials of degree $d$ at most 10 over
$GF(q)$, where $q$ is at most 97. We have also been able to compute nPPs of
degrees 11 and 12 in a few cases. The techniques apply to arbitrary $q$ and
$d$. In addition, the equivalence relations allow the set all PPs for a given
degree and a given field $GF(q)$ to be succinctly described by their
representative nPPs. We give several tables at the end of the paper listing the
representative nPPs (\ie the equivalence classes) for several values of $q$ and
$d$. We also give several new lower bounds for $M(n,D)$, the maximum number of
permutations on $n$ symbols with pairwise Hamming distance $D$, mostly derived
from our results on PPs.

Considering potential mechanisms and additional observations, we favor a model
of acetylene enrichment at mid-latitudes resulting from an extension of the

extinction and obscure the intrinsic luminosity of the progenitor RSG. This may
lead to a difficulty in determining the range of progenitor masses that lead to
the different classes of supernovae. Even the nearby, well studied supernovae
with pre-explosion observations, such as SN 2013ej may suffer from this
uncertainty in the progenitor mass. We explore here two different masses
proposed for its progenitor. We compute their pre-supernova characteristics
using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We show that a
non-rotating star with the initial mass of 26 M$_{\odot}$ would require a
considerable amount of circum-stellar medium (A$_V \sim$ 3) to obscure its high
luminosity given the observed pre-explosion magnitudes detected by the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). Such a high value of visual extinction appears to be
inconsistent with that derived for SN 2013ej as well as SN 2003gd in the same
host galaxy M74. In contrast, the evolutionary models of lower mass (13
M$_{\odot}$) star are easily accommodated within the observed HST magnitudes.
Some of the 26 M$_{\odot}$ simulations show luminosity variation in the last
few years which could be discriminated by high cadence and multi-band
monitoring of supernova candidates in nearby galaxies. We demonstrate that our
calculations are well-resolved with adequate zoning and evolutionary
time-steps.

the composed privacy budget is shown to be less than that of independent
perturbation of key and value, which enables us to further optimize the

distribution provides better overall fit to these wave data than the translated
Weibull distribution. However, when the exponentiated Weibull distribution was
fitted using maximum likelihood estimation, model fit at the upper tail was
sometimes still poor. Thus, to ensure good model fit at the tail, we estimated
the distribution's parameters by prioritizing observations of high wave height
using weighted least squares estimation. Then, the distribution fitted well at
the bulks of the six datasets (mean absolute error in the order of 0.1 m) and
at the tails (mean absolute error in the order of 0.5 m). The proposed method

return samples to Earth. While there is significant science motivation for
these missions, there are also resource interests. Space agencies and
commercial entities are particularly interested in ices and water-bearing
minerals that could be used to produce rocket fuel in space. The
internationally coordinated roadmaps of major space agencies depend on
utilizing the natural resources of such celestial bodies. Several companies
have already created plans for intercepting and extracting water and minerals
from near-Earth objects, as even a small asteroid could have high economic
worth. However, the low surface gravity of asteroids could make the release of
mining waste and the subsequent formation of debris streams a consequence of
asteroid mining. Strategies to contain material during extraction could still
eventually require the purposeful jettison of waste to avoid managing unwanted
mass. Using simulations, we explore the formation of mining debris streams by
integrating particles released from four select asteroids. Radiation effects
are included, and a range of debris sizes are explored. The simulation results
are used to investigate the timescales for debris stream formation, the sizes
of the streams, and the meteoroid fluxes compared with sporadic meteoroids. We
find that for prodigious mining activities resulting in the loss of a few

that integer packing sets, ordered by inclusion, form a well-quasi-ordering.
This result allows us to answer a question recently posed by Bodur et al. In

policy for a given Markov Decision Problem (MDP). Simple Policy iteration (SPI)
is a type of policy iteration where the strategy is to change the policy at
exactly one improvable state at every step. Melekopoglou and Condon [1990]
showed an exponential lower bound on the number of iterations taken by SPI for
a 2 action MDP. The results have not been generalized to $k-$action MDP since.
In this paper, we revisit the algorithm and the analysis done by Melekopoglou

lower bound on the number of iterations taken by policy iteration for
$N-$state, $k-$action MDPs. We construct a family of MDPs and give an

scalability, SDPs can be approximated with lower and upper bounds through the
use of structured subsets (e.g., diagonally-dominant and scaled-diagonally

fully modeling urban dynamics becomes more and more challenging, but also a

activities and constructions are ubiquitous; urban landscape and life content
change anywhere and anytime. It's crucial due to the fact that only up-to-date
urban dynamics can enable governors to optimize their city planning strategy

Previous geographic topic model based methods attempt to solve this problem but
suffer from high computational cost and memory consumption, limiting their
scalability to city level applications. Also, strong prior assumptions make
such models fail to capture certain patterns by nature.
  To bridge the gap, we propose Macross, a metapath guided embedding approach

multiple input multiple output (MIMO) architecture is typically applied.
However, a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains make the system
unrealistic to low-cost communications. Therefore, a practical three-stage
hybrid analogue-digital precoding architecture, occupying fewer RF chains, is
proposed aiming for a non-orthogonal IoT signal in low-cost multiuser MIMO
systems. The non-orthogonal waveform can flexibly save spectral resources for
massive devices connections or improve data rate without consuming extra
spectral resources. The hybrid precoding is divided into three stages including
analogue-domain, digital-domain and waveform-domain. A codebook based beam
selection simplifies the analogue-domain beamforming via phase-only tuning.
Digital-domain precoding can fine-tune the codebook shaped beam and resolve
multiuser interference in terms of both signal amplitude and phase. In the end,
the waveform-domain precoding manages the self-created inter carrier
interference (ICI) of the non-orthogonal signal. This work designs over-the-air
signal transmission experiments for fully digital and hybrid precoding systems
on software defined radio (SDR) devices. Results reveal that waveform precoding
accuracy can be enhanced by hybrid precoding. Compared to a transmitter with
the same RF chain resources, hybrid precoding significantly outperforms fully
digital precoding by up to 15.6 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) gain. A fully
digital system with the same number of antennas clearly requires more RF chains

resampling (WCR) and modified within-cluster resampling (MWCR) - two existing
methods for analyzing longitudinal data. WCR is a simple but computationally
intensive method, in which a single observation is randomly sampled from each
cluster to form a new dataset. This process is repeated numerous times, and in
each resampled dataset (or outputation), we calculate beta using a generalized
linear model. The final resulting estimator is an average across estimates from
all outputations. MWCR is an extension of WCR that can account for the
within-cluster correlation of the dataset; consequently, there are two
noteworthy differences: 1) in MWCR, each resampled dataset is formed by
randomly sampling multiple observations without replacement from each cluster
and 2) generalized estimating equations (GEEs) are used to estimate the
parameter of interest. While WCR and MWCR are relatively simple to implement, a
key challenge is that the proposed moment-based estimator is often times
negative in practice. Our modified variance estimator is not only strictly
positive, but simulations show that it preserves the type I error and allows
statistical power gains associated with MWCR to be realized.

theoretical and experimental constraints, with a particular emphasis on dark
matter observables and collider signals. We show that the exotic neutrino
inherent to this class of models, the scotino, is a viable candidate for dark
matter satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints. This has
strong implications on the scotino mass restricting it to lie in a narrow
window, as well as on the spectrum of Higgs bosons, rendering it predictable,
with a few light scalar, pseudoscalar and charged states. Moreover, we also
show that the extra charged $W'$ gauge boson can be light, and investigate the
most promising signals at the future high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Our
findings show that the most optimistic cosmologically-favoured scenarios should
be observable at $5\sigma$, whilst others could leave visible hints provided
the background is under good control at the systematical level.

discipline dating back to the 1970s. In general, to match the left-hand graph

matching performance, D\""orr proposed to equip rules and host graphs with
distinguished root nodes. This model was implemented by Plump and Bak, but
unfortunately, such rules are not invertible. We address this problem by
defining rootedness using a partial function into a two-point set rather than
pointing graphs with root nodes, meaning derivations are natural double
pushouts. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition on rules to give constant
time rule application on graphs of bounded degree, and that, the graph class of
trees can be recognised in linear time, given an input graph of bounded degree.
Finally, we define a new notion of confluence up to garbage and non-garbage
critical pairs, showing it is sufficient to require strong joinability of only
the non-garbage critical pairs to establish confluence up to garbage. Finally,
this new result, presented for conventional graph transformation systems, can
be lifted to our rooted setting by encoding node labels and rootedness as
looped edges.

management challenges to clinicians. While the presentation, the pathology, and
the clinical course of these lesions are variable, the initial investigations
are usually similar. Patients who are suspected to have a brain tumor will be
assessed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The imaging findings are used by neurosurgeons to determine the feasibility of
surgical resection and plan such an undertaking. Imaging studies are also an
indispensable tool in tracking tumor progression or its response to treatment.
As these imaging studies are non-invasive, relatively cheap and accessible to
patients, there have been many efforts over the past two decades to increase
the amount of clinically-relevant information that can be extracted from brain
imaging. Most recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been
employed to segment and characterize brain tumors, as well as to detect
progression or treatment-response. However, the clinical utility of such
endeavours remains limited due to challenges in data collection and annotation,
model training, and the reliability of AI-generated information.
  We provide a review of recent advances in addressing the above challenges.
First, to overcome the challenge of data paucity, different image imputation
and synthesis techniques along with annotation collection efforts are
summarized. Next, various training strategies are presented to meet multiple
desiderata, such as model performance, generalization ability, data privacy
protection, and learning with sparse annotations. Finally, standardized
performance evaluation and model interpretability methods have been reviewed.
We believe that these technical approaches will facilitate the development of a
fully-functional AI tool in the clinical care of patients with gliomas.

Semi-analytical models of galaxy formation (SAMs) are a prime tool to
understand CGs. We investigate how the frequency and the three-dimensional
nature of CGs depends on the SAM and its underlying cosmological parameters.
Extracting 9 lightcones of galaxies from 5 different SAMs and selecting CGs as
in observed samples, we find that the frequency and nature of CGs depends
strongly on the cosmological parameters. Moving from the WMAP1 to the WMAP7 and
Planck cosmologies (increasing density of the Universe and decreasing
normalisation of the power spectrum), the space density of CGs is decreased by
a factor 2.5, while the fraction of CGs that are physically dense falls from 50
to 35 percent. The lower $\sigma_8$ leads to fewer dense groups, while the
higher $\Omega_{\rm m}$ causes more chance alignments. However, with increased
mass and spatial resolution, the fraction of CGs that are physically dense is
pushed back up to 50 percent. The intrinsic differences in the SAM recipes also
lead to differences in the frequency and nature of CGs, particularly those
related to how SAMs treat orphan galaxies. We find no dependence of CG
properties on the flux limit of the mock catalogues nor on the waveband in
which galaxies are selected. One should thus be cautious when interpreting a
particular SAM for the frequency and nature of CGs.

cognitive radio network is investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels.
Specifically, multiple secondary sources are taking turns in accessing the
licensed spectrum of the primary users and communicating with a multiantenna
secondary base station D through the aid of a multiantenna relay R in the
presence of M eavesdroppers that are also equipped with multiple antennas.
Among the remaining nodes, one jammer is randomly selected to transmit an
artificial noise to disrupt all the eavesdroppers that are attempting to
intercept the communication of the legitimate links i.e., S-R and R-D. The
received signals at each node are combined using maximal-ratio combining.
Secrecy analysis is provided by deriving closed-form and asymptotic expressions
for the secrecy outage probability. The impact of several key parameters on the
system's secrecy e.g., transmit power of the sources, number of eavesdroppers,
maximum tolerated interference power, and the number of diversity branches is
investigated. Importantly, by considering two scenarios, namely (i) absence and
(ii) presence of a friendly jammer, new insights are obtained for the
considered communication system. Especially, we tend to answer to the following
question: Can better secrecy be achieved without jamming by considering a
single antenna at eavesdroppers and multiple-ones at the legitimate users
(i.e., relay and end-user) rather than sending permanently an artificial noise
and considering that both the relay and the destination are equipped with a
single antenna, while multiple antennas are used by the eavesdroppers? The
obtained results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulation and show that
the system's security can be enhanced by adjusting the aforementioned
parameters.

retrieved from Google Earth at the same location but from different times. The

polarization axis rotation, a phenomena which can be used to better condition
the light transport matrix for non-line-of-sight imaging. Our analysis and
results show that the use of a polarizer in front of the camera is not only a

polarization can enhance passive NLOS imaging both with and without occluders.

aimed to evaluate their external predictability and identify their potential

model was evaluated using an independent dataset of 84 patients with 572 trough
concentrations prospectively collected from Huashan Hospital. Prediction and
simulation based diagnostics and Bayesian forecasting were conducted to
evaluate model predictability. Furthermore, the effect of model structure on
the predictive performance was investigated.Results:Sixteen published popPK
models were assessed. In prediction-based diagnostics,the prediction error
within 30% was below 50% in all the published models. The simulation based
normalised prediction distribution error test and visual predictive check
indicated large discrepancies between the observations and simulations in most
of the models. Bayesian forecasting showed improvement in model predictability
with two to three prior observations. Additionally, the predictive performance
of the nonlinear Michaelis Menten model was superior to that of linear
compartment models,indicating the underlying nonlinear kinetics of tacrolimus
in liver transplant recipients.Conclusions:The published models performed
inadequately in prediction and simulation based diagnostics. Bayesian
forecasting may improve the predictive performance of the models. Furthermore,
nonlinear kinetics of tacrolimus may be mainly caused by the properties of the
drug itself, and incorporating nonlinear kinetics may be considered to improve
model predictability.

amounts of available training data. Indeed, even the majority of few-shot
learning methods rely on a large set of ""base classes"" for pretraining. This
assumption, however, does not always hold. For some tasks, annotating a large
number of classes can be infeasible, and even collecting the images themselves
can be a challenge in some scenarios. In this paper, we study this problem and
call it ""Small Data"" setting, in contrast to ""Big Data"". To unlock the full
potential of small data, we propose to augment the models with annotations for
other related tasks, thus increasing their generalization abilities. In
particular, we use the richly annotated scene parsing dataset ADE20K to
construct our realistic Long-tail Recognition with Diverse Supervision (LRDS)
benchmark by splitting the object categories into head and tail based on their
distribution. Following the standard few-shot learning protocol, we use the
head classes for representation learning and the tail classes for evaluation.
Moreover, we further subsample the head categories and images to generate two
novel settings which we call ""Scarce-Class"" and ""Scarce-Image"", respectively
corresponding to the shortage of samples for rare classes and training images.
Finally, we analyze the effect of applying various additional supervision
sources under the proposed settings. Our experiments demonstrate that densely
labeling a small set of images can indeed largely remedy the small data
constraints.

Predicting air quality for any regions and at any time is a critical

factors affecting air pollution throughout the city. Collecting as many of them
could help us to forecast air pollution better. In this research, we present
many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is
currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well. These datasets
include air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic volume, average
driving speed, and air pollution indexes of external areas which are known to
impact Seoul's air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and
average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In
addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to
interpolate and predict air pollution in the city. Nevertheless, they mostly
focused on predicting air quality in discrete locations or used hand-crafted
spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we propose the usage of

automatically manipulates both the spatial and temporal features of the data.
Specially, we introduce how to transform the air pollution data into sequences

terrestrial bodies with silicate sand as the main sediment composition.
However, it has not been thoroughly studied for icy bodies such as Titan with
organic sand as the main dune-forming material. We used the colloidal probe
atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique to study triboelectric charging
processes using Titan and Earth sand analogs. We found that it is easy to
generate triboelectric charges between naphthalene (a simple aromatic
hydrocarbon), polystyrene (an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer), and borosilicate
glass (Earth silicate sand analog). Strong electrostatic forces can be measured
after contact and/or tribocharging. In contrast, tholin, a complex organic
material, does not generate any detectable electrostatic forces with contact or
tribocharging within the detection limit of the instrument. If Titan sand
behaves more like tholin, this indicates that the tribocharging capacity of
Titan sand is much weaker than Earth silicate sand and much less than
previously measured by Mendez-Harper et al., (2017), where only simple organics
were used for Titan sand analogs. Thus, triboelectrification may not contribute
to increasing interparticle forces between sand particles on Titan as much as
on Earth. Interparticle forces generated by other electrostatic processes or
other interparticle forces such as van der Waals and capillary cohesion forces
could be the dominant interparticle forces that govern Titan sand formation and
sediment transportation on the surface. Titan sand is also unlikely to produce
large electrical discharge through tribocharging to affect future missions to
Titan's surface.

zero-mean iid prior distribution over the parameters of a multi-layer

We extend this result firstly to independent priors with general zero or
non-zero means, and secondly to a family of partially exchangeable priors which
generalise iid priors. We discuss how the second prior arises naturally when
considering an equivalence class of functions in an MLP and through training
processes such as stochastic gradient descent.
  The model resulting from partially exchangeable priors is a GP, with an
additional level of inference in the sense that the prior and posterior
predictive distributions require marginalisation over hyperparameters. We
derive the kernels of the limiting GP in deep MLPs, and show empirically that
these kernels avoid certain pathologies present in previously studied priors.
We empirically evaluate our claims of convergence by measuring the maximum mean
discrepancy between finite width models and limiting models. We compare the
performance of our new limiting model to some previously discussed models on

without involving the blockchain, has become a promising proposal to improve
the scalability of decentralized ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Payment
channels have been extended to the payment network, through which users can
utilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others.
However, routing payments through multiple channels bears nontrivial overheads.
It requires every intermediary channel to lock a portion of its available
capacity until the payment is settled. This may lead to deadlock in a
concurrent situation. The intermediary nodes in a payment path may also charge
fees for routing a payment. The longer the routing path, the more serious the
above problems.
  In this paper, we design and develop a novel off-chain system to shorten the
routing path for the payment network. In particular, we propose the channel
hub, which is an extension of the payment hub, to allows transferring coins
directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub. That is, the
channel hub can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment
network. We design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain
cross-channel transfers through the channel hub. We not only present the
security definition of the Boros protocol formally but also prove its security
using the UC-framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Boros protocol,
we develop a proof-of-concept prototype running on the Ethereum. Our evaluation
shows that our system can effectively shorten the off-chain routing path.

sensitive information from multiple datasets, in particular the
privacy-preserving matching of records referring to the same entity. PPRL has
gained much attention in many application areas, with the most prominent ones
in the healthcare domain. PPRL techniques tackle this problem by conducting
linkage on masked (encoded) values. Employing PPRL on records from multiple
(more than two) parties/sources (multi-party PPRL, MP-PPRL) is an increasingly
important but challenging problem that so far has not been sufficiently solved.
Existing MP-PPRL approaches are limited to finding only those entities that are
present in all parties thereby missing entities that match only in a subset of
parties. Furthermore, previous MP-PPRL approaches face substantial scalability
limitations due to the need of a large number of comparisons between masked
records. We thus propose and evaluate new MP-PPRL approaches that find matches
in any subset of parties and still scale to many parties. Our approaches
maintain all matches within clusters, where these clusters are incrementally
extended or refined by considering records from one party after the other. An
empirical evaluation using multiple real datasets ranging from 3 to 26 parties
each containing up to $5$ million records validates that our protocols are
efficient, and significantly outperform existing MP-PPRL approaches in terms of
linkage quality and scalability.

field to derive an optimal Bitcoin-like blockchain mining strategy without

profitable mining strategy was believed to be honest mining encoded in the
default blockchain protocol. It was shown later that it is possible to gain
more mining rewards by deviating from honest mining. In particular, the mining
problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which can be
solved to give the optimal mining strategy. However, solving the mining MDP
requires knowing the values of various parameters that characterize the
blockchain network model. In real blockchain networks, these parameter values
are not easy to obtain and may change over time. This hinders the use of the
MDP model-based solution. In this work, we employ RL to dynamically learn a
mining strategy with performance approaching that of the optimal mining
strategy by observing and interacting with the network. Since the mining MDP
problem has a non-linear objective function (rather than linear functions of
standard MDP problems), we design a new multi-dimensional RL algorithm to solve
the problem. Experimental results indicate that, without knowing the parameter

still achieve the optimal performance over time-varying blockchain networks.

bandlimited input over known time intervals, it theoretically amounts to
applying a known linear operator on the input. We then approach the general
question of signal reconstruction by pseudo-inversion of this operator. We
perform this task numerically and iteratively using projections onto convex
sets (POCS). The algorithm can be implemented exactly in discrete time with
multiplications that are all reduced to scaling by signed powers of two, thanks
to the use of relaxation coefficients. Meanwhile, the algorithm achieves a rate
of convergence similar to that of Lazar and T\'oth. For real-time processing,
we propose an approximate time-varying FIR implementation, which avoids the
splitting of the input into blocks. We finally propose some preliminary
analysis of semi-convergence of the algorithm under data noise.

introduce the notion of prioritized preference to capture the incompleteness
possibility of methods. Specifically, the framework first computes the
preferred completion profile w.r.t. the prioritized preference to refine the
incomplete methods. Then it finds the minimal set of refined methods via a
method substitution operation. Experimental analysis demonstrates that our

a spatial and semantic modulated deep network framework for object

input, we design a spatial modulator to learn a mask for each image. The
spatial modulator captures the correlations of image feature descriptors via
unsupervised learning. The learned mask can roughly localize the shared
foreground object while suppressing the background. For the semantic modulator,
we model it as a supervised image classification task. We propose a
hierarchical second-order pooling module to transform the image features for

multi-resolution features by a shift-and-scale operation so that the features
focus on segmenting co-object regions. The proposed model is trained end-to-end

co-segmentation benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of the

simulations employing uniform and cyclic shear deformation. Recent results
characterise yielding as a discontinuous transition, with the degree of
annealing of glasses being a significant parameter. Under uniform shear,
discontinuous changes in stresses at yielding occur in the high annealing
regime, separated from the poor annealing regime in which yielding is gradual.
In cyclic shear simulations, relatively poorly annealed glasses become
progressively better annealed as the yielding point is approached, with a
relatively modest but clear discontinuous change at yielding. To understand
better the role of annealing on yielding characteristics, we perform athermal
quasistaic cyclic shear simulations of glasses prepared with a wide range of
annealing in two qualitatively different systems -- a model of silica (a
network glass), and an atomic binary mixture glass. Two strikingly different
regimes of behavior emerge: Energies of poorly annealed samples evolve towards
a unique threshold energy as the strain amplitude increases, before yielding
takes place. Well annealed samples, in contrast, show no significant energy
change with strain amplitude till they yield, accompanied by discontinuous
energy changes that increase with the degree of annealing. Significantly, the
threshold energy for both systems correspond to dynamical crossover
temperatures associated with changes in the character of the energy landscape
sampled by glass forming liquids. Uniform shear simulations support the
recently discussed scenario of a random critical point separating ductile and
brittle yielding, which our results now associate with dynamical crossover
temperatures in the corresponding liquids.

This paper enhances SOPF by incorporating network reconfiguration into the

Incorporating the correlation alignment module along with adversarial learning

executable meaning representations (MRs), which are later executed in certain
environment to obtain user-desired results. The fully-supervised training of
such parser requires NL/MR pairs, annotated by domain experts, which makes them
expensive to collect. However, weakly-supervised semantic parsers are learnt
only from pairs of NL and expected execution results, leaving the MRs latent.
While weak supervision is cheaper to acquire, learning from this input poses
difficulties. It demands that parsers search a large space with a very weak
learning signal and it is hard to avoid spurious MRs that achieve the correct
answer in the wrong way. These factors lead to a performance gap between
parsers trained in weakly- and fully-supervised setting. To bridge this gap, we
examine the intersection between weak supervision and active learning, which
allows the learner to actively select examples and query for manual annotations
as extra supervision to improve the model trained under weak supervision. We
study different active learning heuristics for selecting examples to query, and
various forms of extra supervision for such queries. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our method on two different datasets. Experiments on the
WikiSQL show that by annotating only 1.8% of examples, we improve over a
state-of-the-art weakly-supervised baseline by 6.4%, achieving an accuracy of
79.0%, which is only 1.3% away from the model trained with full supervision.
Experiments on WikiTableQuestions with human annotators show that our method
can improve the performance with only 100 active queries, especially for
weakly-supervised parsers learnt from a cold start.

dissipation capacity of heat sinks gradually becomes a bottleneck. Many
structural optimization methods, including topology optimization, have been
widely used for heat sinks. Due to its high design freedom, topology
optimization is suggested for the design of heat sinks using a transient
pseudo-3D thermofluid model to acquire better instantaneous thermal
performance. The pseudo-3D model is designed to reduce the computational cost
and maintain an acceptable accuracy. The model relies on an artificial heat
convection coefficient to couple two layers and establish the approximate
relationship with the corresponding 3D model. In the model, a constant pressure
drop and heat generation rate are treated. The material distribution is
optimized to reduce the average temperature of the base plate at the prescribed
terminal time. Furthermore, to reduce the intermediate density regions during
the density-based topology optimization procedure, a detailed analysis of
interpolation functions is made and the penalty factors are chosen on this
basis. Finally, considering the engineering application of the model, a
practical model with more powerful cooling medium and higher inlet pressure is
built. The optimized design shows a better instantaneous thermal performance
and provides 66.7% of the pumping power reduction compared with reference
design.

the size of neural networks for their deployments to resource-limited devices.
In order to overcome the nature of transforming continuous activations and
weights to discrete ones, recent study called Relaxed Quantization (RQ)
[Louizos et al. 2019] successfully employ the popular Gumbel-Softmax that
allows this transformation with efficient gradient-based optimization. However,
RQ with this Gumbel-Softmax relaxation still suffers from bias-variance
trade-off depending on the temperature parameter of Gumbel-Softmax. To resolve
the issue, we propose a novel method, Semi-Relaxed Quantization (SRQ) that uses
multi-class straight-through estimator to effectively reduce the bias and
variance, along with a new regularization technique, DropBits that replaces
dropout regularization to randomly drop the bits instead of neurons to further
reduce the bias of the multi-class straight-through estimator in SRQ. As a
natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning
heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer
using DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark

of near-Earth asteroids with the Earth. This method is a significantly modified
and improved method, which uses a special curvilinear coordinate system
associated with the nominal orbit of an asteroid. One of the coordinates of
this system is the mean anomaly in the osculating orbit of an asteroid. A
normal distribution of errors of coordinates and velocities of this system is
assumed. Because of the usage of the curvilinear coordinate system, the fact
that the confidence region is curved and stretched mainly along the nominal
asteroid orbit is taken into account. On the main axis of the curvilinear
confidence ellipsoid the virtual asteroid, which is the closest to the Earth,
is found. The part of the curvilinear confidence ellipsoid, around the found
virtual asteroid, is obtained and mapped on to its target plane. The impact
probability is calculated as the probability of the asteroid being in the
region of the found virtual asteroid multiplied by the probability of a
collision of the found virtual asteroid with the Earth. This approach is shown
to give more accurate and trustworthy results than the target plane method.

These two parameters have recently gained a lot of attention in the theoretical
research community as they offer the algorithmic advantage over treewidth by
supporting so-called fixed-parameter algorithms for certain problems that are
not fixed-parameter tractable with respect to treewidth. However, the existing
research has mostly been theoretical. A main obstacle for any practical or
experimental use of these two width parameters is the lack of any practical or
implemented algorithm for actually computing the associated decompositions. We
address this obstacle by providing the first practical decomposition
algorithms.
  Our approach for computing treecut width and treedepth decompositions is
based on efficient encodings of these decomposition methods to the
propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). Once an encoding is generated, any
satisfiability solver can be used to find the decomposition. Moreover, we
propose new characterisations for treecut width and treedepth that are based on
sequences of partitions of the vertex set, a method that was pioneered for
clique-width. We implemented and systematically tested our encodings on various
benchmark instances, including famous named graphs and random graphs of various
density. It turned out that for the considered width parameters, our
partition-based SAT encoding even outperforms the best existing SAT encoding
for treewidth.

We introduce new mixed-integer programming formulations for aircraft conflict

aircraft conflict resolution problem with speed and heading control represented
as continuous decision variables. We show that the proposed disjunctive linear
separation conditions are equivalent to the traditional nonlinear conditions
for aircraft separation. Further, we characterize conflict-free pairwise
aircraft trajectories and propose a simple pre-processing algorithm to identify
aircraft pairs which are either always conflict-free, or which cannot be
separated using speed and heading control only. We then incorporate altitude
control and propose a lexicographic optimization formulation that aims to
minimize the number of flight level changes before resolving outstanding
conflicts via two-dimensional velocity control. The proposed mixed-integer
programming formulations are nonconvex, and we propose convex relaxations,
decomposition methods and constraint generation algorithms to solve the
two-dimensional and lexicographic optimization formulations to guaranteed
optimality. Numerical experiments on four types of conflict resolution
benchmarking instances are conducted to test the performance of the proposed
mixed-integer formulations. Further, the proposed disjunctive formulations are
compared against state-of-the-art formulations based on the so-called shadow

the protoplanet's envelope. We find that the motion of planetesimals is excited
to the extent that encounters with the proto-planetary envelope become so fast
that ram pressure breaks up the planetesimals in most encounters. As a result,
the accretion rate is largely independent of the planetesimal size and
composition. For the case we explored of a planet forming at 5.2 AU from the
Sun in a disk with a solid surface density of 6 g/cm^2 (Lozovsky et al. 2017)
the accretion rate we compute differs in several respects from that assumed by
those authors. We find that only 4-5 M_Earth is accreted in the first 1.5x10^6
years before the onset of rapid gas accretion. Most of the mass, some 10
M_Earth, is accreted simultaneously with this rapid gas accretion. In addition,
we find that the mass accretion rate remains small, but non-zero for at least a
million years after this point, and an additional 0.3-0.4 M_Earth is accreted
during that time. This late accretion, together with a rapid infall of gas
could lead to the accreted material being mixed throughout the outer regions,
and may account for the enhancement of high-Z material in Jupiter's envelope.

three-dimensional (3D) gas flow, which may influence pebble accretion. In this
study, we investigate the influence of the 3D planet-induced gas flow on pebble
accretion. Assuming a non-isothermal, inviscid gas disk, we perform 3D
hydrodynamical simulations on the spherical polar grid. Then we numerically
integrate the equation of motion of pebbles in 3D using hydrodynamical
simulations data. We find that the trajectories of pebbles in the
planet-induced gas flow differ significantly from those in the unperturbed
shear flow for a wide range of pebble sizes investigated (${\rm
St}=10^{-3}$--$10^{0}$, where ${\rm St}$ is the Stokes number). The horseshoe
flow and outflow of the gas alter the motion of the pebbles, which leads to the
reduction of the width of the accretion window, $w_{\rm acc}$, and the
accretion cross section, $A_{\rm acc}$. On the other hand, the changes in
trajectories also cause an increase in relative velocity of pebbles to the
planet, which offsets the reduction of $w_{\rm acc}$ and $A_{\rm acc}$. As a
consequence, in the Stokes regime, the accretion probability of pebbles,
$P_{\rm acc}$, in the planet-induced gas flow is comparable to that in the
unperturbed shear flow except when the Stokes number is small, ${\rm
St}\sim10^{-3}$, in 2D accretion, or when the thermal mass of the planet is
small, $m=0.03$ in 3D accretion. In contrast, in the Epstein regime, $P_{\rm
acc}$ in the planet-induced gas flow becomes smaller than that in the shear
flow in the Stokes regime in both 2D and 3D accretion, regardless of assumed
${\rm St}$ and $m$. Our results suggest that the 3D planet-induced gas flow may
be helpful to explain the distribution of exoplanets as well as the
architecture of the solar system.

  depletion in cometary comae",,,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cometary comae are generally depleted in nitrogen. The main carriers for
volatile nitrogen in comets are NH3 and HCN. It is known that ammonia readily
combines with many acids like e.g. HCN, HNCO, HCOOH, etc. encountered in the
interstellar medium as well as in cometary ice to form ammonium salts (NH4+X-)
at low temperatures. Ammonium salts, which can play a significant role in
prebiotic chemistry, are hard to detect in space as they are unstable in the
gas phase and their infrared signature is often hidden by thermal radiation or
by e.g. OH in minerals. Here we report the presence of all possible sublimation
products of five different ammonium salts at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
measured by the ROSINA instrument on Rosetta. The relatively high sublimation
temperatures of the salts leads to an apparent lack of volatile nitrogen in the
coma. This then also explains the observed trend of higher NH3/H2O ratios with
decreasing perihelion distances in comets.

becoming a popular approach for the person re-identification (ReID) problem,
because previous works using global features alone have very limited capacity
at extracting discriminative local patterns in the obtained feature
representation. Existing works that attempt to collect local patterns either
explicitly slice the global feature into several local pieces in a handcrafted
way, or apply the attention mechanism to implicitly infer the importance of
different local regions. In this paper, we show that by explicitly learning the
importance of small local parts and part combinations, we can further improve
the final feature representation for Re-ID. Specifically, we first separate the
global feature into multiple local slices at different scale with a proposed
multi-branch structure. Then we introduce the Collaborative Attention Network
(CAN) to automatically learn the combination of features from adjacent slices.
In this way, the combination keeps the intrinsic relation between adjacent
features across local regions and scales, without losing information by
partitioning the global features. Experiment results on several widely-used
public datasets including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID and CUHK03 prove that the
proposed method outperforms many existing state-of-the-art methods.

Based on the framework, we propose a dynamic and distributed link scheduling

potential caching nodes, the scheme achieves three critical purposes of
wireless caching networks: 1) limiting the delay of user request satisfactions,
2) maintaining the power efficiency of caching nodes, and 3) managing
interference among users. In addition, we address the intrinsic problem of the
BP algorithm in our network model, proposing a matching algorithm for
one-to-one link scheduling. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme
provides almost the same delay performance as the optimal scheme found through
an exhaustive search at the expense of a little additional power consumption

This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis that emphasise on

objectives of this work are two-fold: (i) First, two frameworks for depicting
the main extensions and the uses of BSA are proposed. The first framework is a
general framework to depict the main extensions of BSA, whereas the second is
an operational framework to present the expansion procedures of BSA to guide
the researchers who are working on improving it. (ii) Second, the experiments
conducted in this study fairly compare the analytical performance of BSA with
four other competitive algorithms: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm
optimisation (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and firefly (FF) on 16
different hardness scores of the benchmark functions with different initial
control parameters such as problem dimensions and search space. The
experimental results indicate that BSA is statistically superior than the
aforementioned algorithms in solving different cohorts of numerical
optimisation problems such as problems with different levels of hardness score,
problem dimensions, and search spaces.

that has gained popularity in the symbolic artificial intelligence community.
In the literature, the different approaches to abstract argumentation that were
refined over the years are typically evaluated from a formal logics
perspective; an analysis that is based on models of economically rational
decision-making does not exist. In this paper, we work towards addressing this
issue by analyzing abstract argumentation from the perspective of the rational
man paradigm in microeconomic theory. To assess under which conditions abstract
argumentation-based decision-making can be considered economically rational, we
derive reference independence as a non-monotonic inference property from a
formal model of economic rationality and create a new argumentation principle
that ensures compliance with this property. We then compare the reference
independence principle with other reasoning principles, in particular with
cautious monotony and rational monotony. We show that the argumentation
semantics as proposed in Dung's seminal paper, as well as other semantics we
evaluate -- with the exception of naive semantics and the SCC-recursive CF2
semantics -- violate the reference independence principle. Consequently, we
investigate how structural properties of argumentation frameworks impact the
reference independence principle, and identify cyclic expansions (both even and
odd cycles) as the root of the problem. Finally, we put reference independence
into the context of preference-based argumentation and show that for this
argumentation variant, which explicitly models preferences, reference
independence cannot be ensured in a straight-forward manner.

among others, the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time
(PFASST). Inspired by nonlinear multigrid ideas, PFASST allows to integrate
multiple time-steps simultaneously using a space-time hierarchy of spectral

thermodynamic mechanisms have to be emphasised, or may be neglected in a

be considered consisting of a bulk phase $\Omega$ (chemical reactor) and an
active surface $\Sigma = \partial \Omega$ (catalytic surface), between which
chemical substances are exchanged via adsorption (transport of mass from the
bulk boundary layer adjacent to the surface, leading to surface-accumulation by
a transformation into an adsorbed form) and desorption (vice versa). Quite
typically, as is the purpose of catalysis, chemical reactions on the surface
occur several orders of magnitude faster than, say, chemical reactions within
the bulk, and sorption processes are often quite fast as well. Starting from
the non-dimensional version, different limit models, especially for fast
surface chemistry and fast sorption at the surface, are considered. For a

interacting with immersive Virtual Reality is to navigate the virtual
environments (VEs). Arguably, the best methods to accomplish this use of direct
control interfaces. Among those, natural walking (NW) makes for enjoyable user
experience. However, common techniques to support direct control interfaces in
VEs feature constraints that make it difficult to use those methods in cramped
home environments. Indeed, NW requires unobstructed and open space. To approach
this problem, we propose a new virtual locomotion technique, Combined Walking
in Place (CWIP). CWIP allows people to take advantage of the available physical
space and empowers them to use NW to navigate in the virtual world. For longer
distances, we adopt Walking in Place (WIP) to enable them to move in the
virtual world beyond the confines of a cramped real room. However, roaming in
immersive alternate reality, while moving in the confines of a cluttered
environment can lead people to stumble and fall. To approach these problems, we
developed Augmented Virtual Reality (AVR), to inform users about real-world
hazards, such as chairs, drawers, walls via proxies and signs placed in the
virtual world. We propose thus CWIP-AVR as a way to safely explore VR in the
cramped confines of your own home. To our knowledge, this is the first approach
to combined different locomotion modalities in a safe manner. We evaluated it
in a user study with 20 participants to validate their ability to navigate a
virtual world while walking in a confined and cluttered real space. Our results
show that CWIP-AVR allows people to navigate VR safely, switching between
locomotion modes flexibly while maintaining a good immersion.

probability density and flux (current) density of a quantum system. It can be
used to define trajectories which allow for a particle-based interpretation of
quantum mechanics, commonly known as Bohmian mechanics. However, quantum
hydrodynamics rests on the usual time-dependent formulation of quantum
mechanics where time appears as a parameter. This parameter describes the
correlation of the state of the quantum system with an external system -- a
clock -- which behaves according to classical mechanics. With the Exact
Factorization of a quantum system into a marginal and a conditional system,
quantum mechanics and hence quantum hydrodynamics can be generalized for
quantum clocks. In this article, the theory is developed and it is shown that
trajectories for the quantum system can still be defined, and that these
trajectories depend conditionally on the trajectory of the clock. Such
trajectories are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view, but
they can also find practical applications whenever a dynamics relative to an
external time parameter is composed of ""fast"" and ""slow"" degrees of freedom and
the interest is in the fast ones, while quantum effects of the slow ones (like
a branching of the wavepacket) cannot be neglected. As an illustration, time-
and clock-dependent trajectories are calculated for a model system of a
non-adiabatic dynamics, where an electron is the quantum system, a nucleus is
the quantum clock, and an external time parameter is provided, e.g. via an
interaction with a laser field that is not treated explicitly.

process, the circulating tumor cells inside the blood vessels adhere to the
cell monolayer of the blood vessel wall and passes through it, which allows
them to invade different organs and complete metastasis. In this process, it is
relevant to understand how the adhesions between cells that form the
endothelial monolayer are broken, resulting in intra-cellular gaps through
which tumor cells are able to extravasate the blood vessel wall.
  Within this process, we focus on studying the dynamics of cell-cell junctions
rupture produced in the endothelial monolayer by the effect of Calcium waves.
The regulation of this monolayer is of vital importance, not only in
metastasis, but also in diseases such as pulmonary edema or atherosclerosis.
  In order to understand this rupture dynamics in greater depth, we propose a
hybrid model that simulates endothelial cells as \textcolor{black}{an} elastic
material and cell-cell adhesions of the monolayer by means of a catch bond law.
  We study the effects that the cell contraction caused by a Calcium wave
presents on the endothelial monolayer depending on the diameter of the blood
vessel. For this purpose, we develop a three-dimensional model to study the
effect of the different blood vessel diameters.
  The results indicate that there are greater tractions on the joints located
in vertices common to several cells. This led to the formation of openings in
the endothelial monolayer, through which extravasation of tumor cells could
occur. For the different geometries studied, no significant effect of the blood
vessel diameter on the rupture of the adhesions of monolayer is observed.

non--trivial topological phase and found that this type of magnetic order is
not a stable ground state in the Fe and Co isolated chains. Further studies
showed that a coupling between the chain and substrate leads to strong
modification of the band structure. Moreover, the analysis of the topological

droplets consisting of lighter liquid dissolving in a denser host liquid. The
significance of buoyancy is quantified by the Rayleigh number Ra which is the
buoyancy force over the viscous damping force. In this study, Ra spans almost
four decades from 0.1 to 400. We focus on how the mass flux, characterized by
the Sherwood number Sh, and the flow morphologies depend on Ra. For single
droplet dissolution, we first show the transition of the Sh(Ra) scaling from a
constant value to $Sh\sim Ra^{1/4}$, which confirms the experimental results by
Dietrich et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 794, 2016, pp. 45--67). The two distinct
regimes, namely the diffusively- and the convectively-dominated regime, exhibit
different flow morphologies: when Ra>=10, a buoyant plume is clearly visible
which contrasts sharply to the pure diffusion case at low Ra. For multiple
droplet dissolution, the well-known shielding effect comes into play at low Ra
so that the dissolution rate is slower as compared to the single droplet case.
However, at high Ra, convection becomes more and more dominant so that a
collective plume enhances the mass flux, and remarkably the multiple droplets
dissolve faster than a single droplet. This has also been found in the
experiments by Laghezza et al. (Soft Matter, vol. 12, 2016, pp. 5787--5796). We
explain this enhancement by the formation of a single, larger plume rather than
several individual plumes. Moreover, there is an optimal Ra at which the
enhancement is maximized, because the single plume is narrower at larger Ra,
which thus hinders the enhancement. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism in
collective droplet dissolution, which is the merging of the plumes, that leads
to non-trivial phenomena, contrasting the shielding effect.

the fifth largest main belt asteroid and one of the few bodies that fills the
gap in size between the four largest bodies with $D$ > 400 km (Ceres, Vesta,
Pallas and Hygiea) and the numerous smaller bodies with $D$ $\lesssim$ 200 km.
However, despite its large size, little is known about the shape and spin state
of Interamnia and, therefore, about its bulk composition and past collisional
evolution. We aimed to test at what size and mass the shape of a small body
departs from a nearly ellipsoidal equilibrium shape (as observed in the case of
the four largest asteroids) to an irregular shape as routinely observed in the
case of smaller ($D$ $\lesssim$ 200 km) bodies. We observed Interamnia as part
of our ESO VLT/SPHERE large program (ID: 199.C-0074) at thirteen different
epochs. In addition, several new optical lightcurves were recorded. These data,
along with stellar occultation data from the literature, were fed to the
All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM) algorithm to reconstruct the 3D-shape model
of Interamnia and to determine its spin state. Interamnia's volume-equivalent
diameter of 332 $\pm$ 6 km implies a bulk density of $\rho$=1.98 $\pm$ 0.68
gcm$^{-3}$ , which suggests that Interamnia - like Ceres and Hygiea - contains
a high fraction of water ice, consistent with the paucity of apparent craters.
Our observations reveal a shape that can be well approximated by an ellipsoid,
and that is compatible with a fluid hydrostatic equilibrium at the 2 $\sigma$
level. The rather regular shape of Interamnia implies that the size and mass
limit, under which the shapes of minor bodies with a high amount of water ice
in the subsurface become irregular, has to be searched among smaller ($D$
$\lesssim$ 300km) less massive ($m$ $\lesssim$ 3x10$^{19}$ kg) bodies.

conventional Shannon's capacity formula is no longer applicable, and the
achievable data rate in finite blocklength becomes a complex expression with
respect to the decoding error probability and the blocklength. To provide URLLC
service in a factory automation scenario, we consider that the central
controller transmits different packets to a robot and an actuator, where the
actuator is located far from the controller, and the robot can move between the
controller and the actuator. In this scenario, we consider four fundamental
downlink transmission schemes, including orthogonal multiple access (OMA),
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), relay-assisted, and cooperative NOMA
(C-NOMA) schemes. For all these transmission schemes, we aim for jointly
optimizing the blocklength and power allocation to minimize the decoding error
probability of the actuator subject to the reliability requirement of the
robot, the total energy constraints, as well as the latency constraints. We
further develop low-complexity algorithms to address the optimization problems
for each transmission scheme. { For the general case with more than two
devices, we also develop a low-complexity efficient algorithm for the OMA
scheme.} Our results show that the relay-assisted transmission significantly
outperforms the OMA scheme, while NOMA scheme performs well when the
blocklength is very limited. We further show that the relay-assisted
transmission has superior performance over the C-NOMA scheme due to larger
feasible region of the former scheme.

effectiveness and efficiency of existing NAS solutions are unclear, with some
recent works going so far as to suggest that many existing NAS solutions are no
better than random architecture selection. The inefficiency of NAS solutions
may be attributed to inaccurate architecture evaluation. Specifically, to speed
up NAS, recent works have proposed under-training different candidate
architectures in a large search space concurrently by using shared network
parameters; however, this has resulted in incorrect architecture ratings and
furthered the ineffectiveness of NAS.
  In this work, we propose to modularize the large search space of NAS into

this reduces the representation shift caused by the shared parameters and leads
to the correct rating of the candidates. Thanks to the block-wise search, we
can also evaluate all of the candidate architectures within a block. Moreover,
we find that the knowledge of a network model lies not only in the network
parameters but also in the network architecture. Therefore, we propose to
distill the neural architecture (DNA) knowledge from a teacher model as the
supervision to guide our block-wise architecture search, which significantly
improves the effectiveness of NAS. Remarkably, the capacity of our searched
architecture has exceeded the teacher model, demonstrating the practicability

that the Wave Kinetic Equation can be derived assuming only initial random

found in the most radio-luminous, star-forming dwarf galaxies of non-tidal

source), or the $\rm SFR_{H_{\alpha}}$ estimate is lower due to the fact that
it traces the most recent star formation, while most of the detected radio

generative adversarial networks (GANs) regarding the problems of vanishing

convergence behaviour and improved image quality. However, Wasserstein-GANs
require the discriminator to be Lipschitz continuous. In current
state-of-the-art Wasserstein-GANs this constraint is enforced via gradient norm
regularization. In this paper, we demonstrate that this regularization does not
encourage a broad distribution of spectral-values in the discriminator weights,
hence resulting in less fidelity in the learned distribution. We therefore
investigate the possibility of substituting this Lipschitz constraint with an
orthogonality constraint on the weight matrices. We compare three different
weight orthogonalization techniques with regards to their convergence
properties, their ability to ensure the Lipschitz condition and the achieved
quality of the learned distribution. In addition, we provide a comparison to
Wasserstein-GANs trained with current state-of-the-art methods, where we
demonstrate the potential of solely using orthogonality-based regularization.
In this context, we propose an improved training procedure for Wasserstein-GANs

Twitter, examines current approaches to automatic mining of these feelings, and
proposes novel methods, which outperform state-of-the-art techniques. For this
purpose, I introduce a new corpus of German tweets that have been manually
annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms
and their contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of
sentiment research: (i) generation of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained
opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification, and (iv)
discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular
groups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and
word-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally
yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart from this, I propose a
linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic
lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to
automatic prediction of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random
fields and recurrent neural networks, obtaining higher scores with the former
model and improving these results even further by redefining the structure of
CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I
juxtapose three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and
deep-learning-based systems, and try to unite the first and last of these
groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network with lexicon-based
attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse
structure, I let it separately analyze the elementary discourse units of each
microblog and infer the overall polarity of a message from the scores of its
EDUs with the help of two new approaches: latent-marginalized CRFs and
Recursive Dirichlet Process.

  Bidders","Includes a new section on specification testing",,,,"econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper proposes a parsimonious and flexible semiparametric quantile
regression specification for asymmetric bidders within the independent private
value framework. Asymmetry is parameterized using powers of a parent private
value distribution, which is generated by a quantile regression specification.
As noted in Cantillon (2008) , this covers and extends models used for
efficient collusion, joint bidding and mergers among homogeneous bidders. The
specification can be estimated for ascending auctions using the winning bids
and the winner's identity. The estimation is in two stage. The asymmetry
parameters are estimated from the winner's identity using a simple maximum
likelihood procedure. The parent quantile regression specification can be
estimated using simple modifications of Gimenes (2017). Specification testing
procedures are also considered. A timber application reveals that weaker
bidders have $30\%$ less chances to win the auction than stronger ones. It is
also found that increasing participation in an asymmetric ascending auction may
not be as beneficial as using an optimal reserve price as would have been
expected from a result of BulowKlemperer (1996) valid under symmetry.

reduce authoring burden, limit storage space requirements, and enable
particular aesthetics, a large number of PCG methods have been devised by game

presence of a mild negative metallicity gradient and indications that the
metal-rich stars have a colder velocity dispersion than the metal-poor ones.
This work represents a significant improvement with respect to previous
measurements of the RGB stars of Aquarius, as it doubles the number of member
stars studied in the literature. We speculate that the misaligned rotation
between the HI gas and evolved stellar component might have been the result of
recent accretion of HI gas or re-accretion after gas-loss due to internal
stellar feedback.

work we build upon existing work that aims to understand the impact of
calibration errors on 21-cm power spectrum (PS) measurements. It is well
established that calibration errors have the potential to inhibit EoR
detections by introducing additional spectral features that mimic the structure
of EoR signals. We present a straightforward way to estimate the impact of a
wide variety of modelling residuals in EoR PS estimation. We apply this
framework to the specific case of broken dipoles in Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) to understand its effect and estimate its impact on PS estimation.
Combining an estimate of the percentage of MWA tiles that have at least one
broken dipole (15%-40%) with an analytic description of beam errors induced by
such dipoles, we compute the residuals of the foregrounds after calibration and
source subtraction. We find that that incorrect beam modelling introduces bias
in the 2D-PS on the order of $\sim 10^3\, \mathrm{mK}^2 \,h^{-3}\,
\mathrm{Mpc}^{3}$. Although this is three orders of magnitude lower than
current lowest limits, it is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected

of the tools and models that we use to carry out star formation studies rely
upon the assumption of cloud isotropy. However, structures like high-density
filaments in the presence of magnetic fields, and magnetosonic striations
introduce anisotropies into the cloud. In this study we use the two-dimensional
(2D) power spectrum to perform a systematic analysis of the anisotropies in the
column density for a range of Alfv\'en Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A=0.1$--$10$)
and turbulent Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}=2$--$20$), with 20 high-resolution,
three-dimensional (3D) turbulent magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that
for cases with a strong magnetic guide field, corresponding to
$\mathcal{M}_A<1$, and $\mathcal{M}\lesssim 4$, the anisotropy in the column
density is dominated by thin striations aligned with the magnetic field, while
for $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim 4$ the anisotropy is significantly changed by
high-density filaments that form perpendicular to the magnetic guide field.
Indeed, the strength of the magnetic field controls the degree of anisotropy
and whether or not any anisotropy is present, but it is the turbulent motions
controlled by $\mathcal{M}$ that determine which kind of anisotropy dominates
the morphology of a cloud.

kernel gradients has also been implemented for comparison purposes. We also
explore a matrix inversion formulation of SPH with a symmetrisation in the
particle indices that is not frequently used. We find interesting advantages of
this formulation in some of the tests, for example, a substantial reduction of
surface tension effects for non-ideal particle setups and more accurate peak
densities in Sedov blast waves. MAGMA2 uses artificial viscosity, but enhanced
by techniques that are commonly used in finite volume schemes such as
reconstruction and slope limiting. While simple to implement, this approach
efficiently suppresses particle noise, but at the same time drastically reduces
dissipation in locations where it is not needed and actually unwanted. We
demonstrate the performance of the new code in a number of challenging

Path-dependent PDEs can play a central role in the study of certain classes of

Typically, they do not admit a smooth solution satisfying the corresponding HJB
equation in a classical sense, it is therefore natural to search for a weaker

motion of phase-space sturctures (holes and clumps), associated with the
frequency chirping, occurs in generalized phase-space of slowing down energetic
particles. The radial profile of the GAE is expanded using finite elements
which allows update of the mode structure as the mode frequency chirps.
Constants of motion are introduced to track the dynamics of energetic particles
during frequency chirping by implementing proper Action-Angle variables and
canonical transformations which reduce the dynamics essentially to 1D.
Consequently, we specify whether the particles are drifting inward/outward as
the frequency deviates from the initial MHD eigenfrequency. Using the principle
of least action, we have derived the nonlinear equation describing the
evolution of the radial profile by varying the total Lagrangian of the system
with respect to the weights of finite elements. For the choice of parameters in
this work, it is shown that the peak of the radial profile is shifted and also
broadens due to frequency chirping. The time rate of frequency change is also
calculated using the energy balance and we show that the adiabatic condition
remains valid once it is satisfied. This model clearly illustrates the
theoretical treatment to study the long range adiabatic frequency sweeping

been one of the biggest goals of stellar astronomy. Among a considerable number
of different approaches, the Baade-Becker-Wesselink (BBW) method stands in the
foreground as one of the most universal and precise methods. We present a new
realization of the BBW method which is considered to be the generalization of
surface brightness (\citealt{Barnes+Evans+1976}) and \cite{Balona+1977}
approaches first proposed by \cite{Rastorguev+Dambis+2010} and described in
\cite{Paper1}. One of the main features of this method is using measured
effective temperature variations to determine the main parameters of Cepheid,
such as distance, radius, luminosity, colour excess, intrinsic colour. We apply
this method to 45 Cepheids of Northern sky, for which multiphase temperature
data are available. We take into account the effect of shock waves, whose
presence in stellar atmosphere distorts the observational data and the
calibrations used in this work. Within $0.0-0.87$ phase interval we derived PL
relation $<M_V>_I=-(2.67 \pm 0.17)\cdot logP - (1.58 \pm 0.16)$. It was used to
calculate the distances, rotation curve and kinematical parameters of the
sample of 435 Cepheids with GAIA DR2 proper motions.

wormhole spacetimes and the question of their stability with respect to
time-dependent perturbations. The consideration of linearized perturbations
usually leads to a master wave equation with effective potential which can then
be analyzed using standard tools from quantum mechanics. However, in the
wormhole case, particular care must be taken with the gauge conditions when
formulating the master equation. A poor coordinate choice, based for example on
fixing the areal radial coordinate, may lead to singularities at the throat
which complicate the stability analysis or might even lead to erroneous
conclusions regarding the stability of the underlying wormhole configuration.
In this work, we present a general method for deriving a gauge-invariant wave
system of linearized perturbation equations in the spherically symmetric case,
assuming that the matter supporting the wormhole is a phantom scalar field,
that is, a self-interacting scalar field whose kinetic energy has the reversed
sign. We show how this system can be decoupled and reduced to a single master
wave equation with a regular potential, with no intermediate steps involving
singularities at the throat. Two applications of our formalism are given.
First, we rederive the master equation for the linearly perturbed
Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole using our new, singularity-free method. Second, we
derive the master equation describing the linear perturbations of a certain
Anti de Sitter wormhole, provide a detailed analysis of the spectral properties
of the underlying operator and prove that this wormhole is linearly unstable.
In the final part of the paper, we consider a wormhole with de Sitter-type
ends, whose spacetime presents horizons and admits a nonstatic extension beyond
them; for this system we derive partial results of linear instability.

investigate the detailed timing and spectral behaviour of this hyper-luminous
X-ray source. Swift has detected 7 outbursts since 2009 mid-August. Using
different dynamical timing algorithms, we confirm an increasing trend for the
time intervals between outbursts, which is manifest in the delays between the
latest outbursts. The X-ray spectra of HLX-1 in quiescence can be described
with a single power-law model while the thermal component dominates the X-ray
emission during outburst. There is only marginal evidence for photon index (or
spectral hardness) changes between quiescent states with about 1{\sigma}
deviation. With the updated temporal and spectral features, we re-examine
different scenarios to explain the origin of the quasi-periodic modulation of
HLX-1. A significantly increasing trend without obvious stochastic fluctuations
on the timescale of the detected quasi-period may not fully support an orbital
period origin as might be due to mass transfer episodes from a donor star at
periastron of an extremely eccentric orbit. The outburst profile seems to be
consistent with the effect of tidal-induced-precession of an accretion disc or
an oscillating wind scenario in the inner disc. Based on these models, we
speculate that the true orbital period is much shorter than the detected
quasi-periodicity.

EPIC-pn detector, which allows us to measure bulk flows in the intracluster

instrumental lines present in all observations, in particular, Cu-Ka. By
studying their spatial and temporal variations, in addition to incorporating
calibration observations, we refined the absolute energy scale to better than
150 km/s at the Fe-K line, a large improvement over the nominal accuracy of 550
km/s. We then mapped the bulk motions over much of the central 1200 and 800 kpc
of Perseus and Coma, respectively, in spatial regions down to 65 and 140 kpc
size. We cross-checked our procedure by comparing our measurements with those
found in Perseus by Hitomi for an overlapping region, finding consistent
results. For Perseus, there is a LoS velocity increase of 480+-210 km/s
(1sigma) 250 kpc east of the nucleus. This region is associated with a cold
front, providing direct evidence of the ICM sloshing in the potential well.
Assuming the intrinsic distribution of bulk motions is Gaussian, its width is
214+-85 km/s, excluding systematics. Removing the sloshing region, this is
reduced to 20-150 km/s, which is similar in magnitude to the Hitomi line width
measurements in undisturbed regions. In Coma, the line-of-sight velocity of the
ICM varies between the velocities of the two central galaxies. Maps of the gas
velocity and metallicity provide clues about the merger history of the Coma,
with material to the north and east of the cluster core having a velocity
similar to NGC 4874, while that to the south and west has velocities close to
NGC 4889. Our results highlight the difference between a merging system, such
as Coma, where we observe a ~1000 km/s range in velocity, and a relatively
relaxed system, such as Perseus, with much weaker bulk motions. [abridged]

result is that the Alexander ideal induces a homomorphism from the

ideal class monoid of $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm1}]$. Consequently, any surface knot
with nonprincipal Alexander ideal is not 0-slice and in fact, not invertible in

the ideals of surface knots, generalizing a theorem of Kinoshita, and
generalize the knot determinant to the case of nonprincipal ideals. Lastly, we

for our sample of rotators by exploiting the Gaia DR2 data. For $\sim 20\%$ of
the sample, we compare the photometric rotation periods with those derived from

We compare our rotation periods distribution to the one obtained by the Kepler

stars in the mass range $0.07-0.25 M_\odot$. The APACHE and Kepler periods
distributions are in good agreement, confirming the reliability of our results,
while the APACHE distribution is consistent with the MEarth result only for the
older/slow rotators, and in the overlapping mass range of the two surveys.
Combining the APACHE/Kepler distribution with the MEarth distribution, we
highlight that the rotation period increases with decreasing stellar mass, in
agreement with previous work. Our findings also suggest that the spin-down time
scale, from fast to slow rotators, changes crossing the fully convective limit
at $\approx0.3 M_\odot$ for M dwarfs. The catalogue of 107 rotating M dwarfs

realize a type-I and type-II fracton phase, respectively. To this end a finite
uniform magnetic field is applied to induce quantum fluctuations in the fracton
phase resulting in zero-temperature phase transitions between fracton phases
and polarized phases. Using high-order series expansions and a variational
approach, all phase transitions are classified as strongly first order, which
turns out to be a consequence of the (partial) immobility of fracton
excitations. Indeed, single fractons as well as few-fracton composites can
hardly lower their excitation energy by delocalization due to the intriguing
properties of fracton phases, as demonstrated in this work explicitly in terms
of fracton quasi-particles.

surgical endoscopy. Being able to measure the 3D position of such instruments
can be useful for various tasks, such as controlling automatically robotized
instruments and analyzing motions. Methods. We propose an automatic method to
infer the 3D pose of a single bending section instrument, using only the images
provided by a monocular camera embedded at the tip of the endoscope. The
proposed method relies on colored markers attached onto the bending section.
The image of the instrument is segmented using a graph-based method and the
corners of the markers are extracted by detecting the color transition along
B{\'e}zier curves fitted on edge points. These features are accurately located
and then used to estimate the 3D pose of the instrument using an adaptive model
that allows to take into account the mechanical play between the instrument and
its housing channel. Results. The feature extraction method provides good
localization of markers corners with images of in vivo environment despite
sensor saturation due to strong lighting. The RMS error on the estimation of
the tip position of the instrument for laboratory experiments was 2.1, 1.96,
3.18 mm in the x, y and z directions respectively. Qualitative analysis in the
case of in vivo images shows the ability to correctly estimate the 3D position
of the instrument tip during real motions. Conclusions. The proposed method
provides an automatic and accurate estimation of the 3D position of the tip of
a bendable instrument in realistic conditions, where standard approaches fail.

plasmonic absorbers, which ensure a high absorptivity butonly for a narrow

the sheet resistance of a thin metallic film to half the free-space impedance.
Thereby, it is possible to achieve a wavelength-independent absorptivity of up

However, existing absorber films typicallyrequire a thickness of the order of
tens of nanometers, such as titanium nitride (14 nm), whichcan significantly

to be associated with fictitious effective temperatures and surface gravities
that are obtained in the same way as if these objects were observed as single
point sources. We evaluate the effects of unresolved double white dwarfs
assuming that the synthetic samples are observed both by the magnitude-limited
SDSS and the volume-limited Gaia surveys, the latter limited to a distance of
no more than 100pc. We find that, for our standard model, the impact of
unresolved double degenerates in the white dwarf luminosity function derived
from the Gaia sample is nearly negligible. Unresolved double degenerates are
hence expected to have no effect on the age of the Galactic disc, nor on the
star formation history from this population. However, for the SDSS sample, the
effect of unresolved double degenerates is significant at the brighter bins
(Mbol<6.5 mag), with the fraction of such systems reaching ~40% of the total
white dwarf population at Mbol=6 mag. This indicates unresolved double
degenerates may influence the constraints on the star formation history derived

by electrons that orbit the defect. By studying the effective action, we argue
that the phase diagram contains a non-magnetic transition between a large and a

Universe and is of high importance in the field of nucleosynthesis and galactic
and stellar evolution. Even nowadays, the origin of carbon and the relative
importance of massive and low- to intermediate-mass stars in producing it is
still a matter of debate. In this paper we aim at better understanding the
origin of carbon by studying the trends of [C/H], [C/Fe],and [C/Mg] versus
[Fe/H], and [Mg/H] for 2133 FGK dwarf stars from the fifth Gaia-ESO Survey
internal data release (GES iDR5). The availability of accurate parallaxes and
proper motions from Gaia DR2 and radial velocities from GES iDR5 allows us to
compute Galactic velocities, orbits and absolute magnitudes and, for 1751
stars, ages via a Bayesian approach. Three different selection methodologies
have been adopted to discriminate between thin and thick disk stars. In all the
cases, the two stellar groups show different abundance ratios, [C/H], [C/Fe],
and [C/Mg], and span different age intervals, with the thick disk stars being,
on average, older than those in the thin disk. The behaviours of [C/H], [C/Fe],
and [C/Mg] versus [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and age all suggest that C is primarily
produced in massive stars like Mg. The increase of [C/Mg] for young thin disk
stars indicates a contribution from low-mass stars or the increased C
production from massive stars at high metallicities due to the enhanced mass
loss. The analysis of the orbital parameters Rmed and |Zmax| support an
""inside-out"" and ""upside-down"" formation scenario for the disks of Milky Way.

state-of-the-art probabilistic latent network model to forecast multilayer

vertices through latent Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference
are illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the
US air transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters
from the models are related to the airline's connectivity dynamics, and their
ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full
network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification
of relevant communities. Reliable network predictions would allow policy-makers
to better understand the dynamics of the transport system, and help in their

either from the definition of a positive map or the novel method inspired by
the inverse reduction map. In the low-dimensional cases, for the permutation

define a measure of centrality of a shortest path, related to the

based on the idea of progressive sampling that, for {\it any fixed constants}
$0 < \epsilon$, $ \delta < 1$, given an undirected graph $G$ with non-negative
edge weights, outputs with probability $1 - \delta$ a data structure of size $n

$G$, in expected time $\mathcal{O}(\lg n \max(m + n \log n, n \cdot
\textrm{Diam}_V(G)))$ containing the (exact) distance and the shortest path
between every pair of vertices $(u,v)$ that has centrality at least $\epsilon$.
The progressive sampling technique is sensitive to the probability distribution
of the input (if we assume that $G$ is chosen from a prescribed random
distribution), but even in the case where we take no assumption about such
distribution, we show an upper bound for the sample size using VC-dimension
theory that is tighter than the bound given by standard Hoeffding and union
bounds, since VC-dimension theory captures the combinatorial structure of the

show that the absolutely separable states of rank-$(2d-1)$ are extreme points
of such sets. We then discuss conditions to examine if a given full-rank
absolutely separable state is an interior point or a boundary point of {\bf
AS}. Moreover, we construct two-qubit absolutely separable states which are
boundary points but not extreme points of {\bf AS} and prove the existence of
full-rank extreme points of {\bf AS}. Properties of certain interior points are
also explored. We further show that by examining the boundary of the above set,
it is possible to develop an algorithm to generate the absolutely separable
states which stay outside the maximal ball. By considering paradigmatic noise
models, we find the amount of local noise which the input entangled states can
sustain, so that the output states do not become absolutely separable.
Interestingly, we report that with the decrease of entanglement of the pure
input state, critical depolarizing noise value, transferring an entangled state
to an absolutely separable one, increases, thereby showing advantages of
sharing nonmaximally entangled states. Furthermore, when the input two-qubit
states are Haar uniformly generated, we report a hierarchy among quantum
channels according to the generation of absolutely separable states.

excited state contributions in observables that are dominated by a pion pole.
We apply this method to extract axial and (induced) pseudoscalar nucleon
isovector form factors, which satisfy the constraints due to the partial
conservation of the axial current up to expected discretization effects.
Effective field theory predicts that the leading contribution to the (induced)
pseudoscalar form factor originates from an exchange of a virtual pion, and
thus exhibits pion pole dominance. Using our new method, we can recover this
behavior directly from lattice data. The numerical analysis is based on a large
set of ensembles generated by the CLS effort, including physical pion masses,
large volumes (with up to $96^3 \times 192$ sites and $L m_\pi = 6.4$), and
lattice spacings down to $0.039 \, \text{fm}$, which allows us to take all the
relevant limits. We find that some observables are much more sensitive to the
choice of parametrization of the form factors than others. On the one hand, the
$z$-expansion leads to significantly smaller values for the axial dipole mass
than the dipole ansatz ($M_A^{\text{$z$-exp}}=1.02(10) \, \text{GeV}$ versus
$M_A^{\text{dipole}} = 1.31(8) \, \text{GeV}$). On the other hand, we find that
the result for the induced pseudoscalar coupling at the muon capture point is
almost independent of the choice of parametrization ($g_P^{\star \
\text{$z$-exp}} = 8.68(45)$ and $g_P^{\star \ \text{dipole}} = 8.30(24)$), and
is in good agreement with both, chiral perturbation theory predictions and
experimental measurement via ordinary muon capture. We also determine the axial
coupling constant $g_A$.

system is used to learn the automaton from observation traces perceived by the
RL agent. The reinforcement learning and automaton learning processes are
interleaved: a new refined automaton is learned whenever the RL agent generates
a trace not recognized by the current automaton. We evaluate ISA in several
gridworld problems and show that it performs similarly to a method for which
automata are given in advance. We also show that the learned automata can be
exploited to speed up convergence through reward shaping and transfer learning
across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the running time and the number of
traces that ISA needs to learn an automata, and the impact that the number of
observable events has on the learner's performance.

cases in the fifth-generation (5G) networks, and its research is still in its
infancy due to its stringent and conflicting requirements in terms of extremely
high reliability and low latency. To reduce latency, the channel blocklength
for packet transmission is finite, which incurs transmission rate degradation
and higher decoding error probability. In this case, conventional resource
allocation based on Shannon capacity achieved with infinite blocklength codes
is not optimal. Security is another critical issue in mission-critical internet
of things (IoT) communications, and physical-layer security is a promising
technique that can ensure the confidentiality for wireless communications as no
additional channel uses are needed for the key exchange as in the conventional
upper-layer cryptography method. This paper is the first work to study the
resource allocation for a secure mission-critical IoT communication system with
URLLC. Specifically, we adopt the security capacity formula under finite
blocklength and consider two optimization problems: weighted throughput
maximization problem and total transmit power minimization problem. Each
optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, and we develop
efficient methods to solve each optimization problem. Simulation results
confirm the fast convergence speed of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate
the performance advantages over the existing benchmark algorithms.

stakeholder-driven subdivision of obstacles into larger numbers of simpler
obstacles is proposed in order to obtain a list of ""what needs to be done,""
inviting a more rational and goal-driven conversation with resource providers.
Finally, obtaining and maintaining stakeholder buy-in over the course of the
problem-solving effort is reinforced by reflecting back to all stakeholders, as
a communication device, a dynamic, visual problem-solving model, taking into

  Given a vertex-weighted directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $T=\{t_1, t_2,
\ldots t_k\}$ of $k$ terminals, the objective of the SCSS problem is to find a
vertex set $H\subseteq V$ of minimum weight such that $G[H]$ contains a
$t_{i}\rightarrow t_j$ path for each $i\neq j$. The problem is NP-hard, but
Feldman and Ruhl [FOCS '99; SICOMP '06] gave a novel $n^{O(k)}$ algorithm for
the SCSS problem, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $k$ is
the number of terminals. We explore how much easier the problem becomes on
planar directed graphs:
  - Our main algorithmic result is a $2^{O(k)}\cdot n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ algorithm
for planar SCSS, which is an improvement of a factor of $O(\sqrt{k})$ in the
exponent over the algorithm of Feldman and Ruhl.
  - Our main hardness result is a matching lower bound for our algorithm: we
show that planar SCSS does not have an $f(k)\cdot n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ algorithm
for any computable function $f$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)
fails.
  The following additional results put our upper and lower bounds in context:
  - In general graphs, we cannot hope for such a dramatic improvement over the
$n^{O(k)}$ algorithm of Feldman and Ruhl: assuming ETH, SCSS in general graphs
does not have an $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ algorithm for any computable
function $f$.
  - Feldman and Ruhl generalized their $n^{O(k)}$ algorithm to the more general
Directed Steiner Network (DSN) problem; here the task is to find a subgraph of
minimum weight such that for every source $s_i$ there is a path to the
corresponding terminal $t_i$. We show that, assuming ETH, there is no
$f(k)\cdot n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm for DSN on acyclic planar graphs.

extend this method by a CBCT consistency constraint, which was proven to be
efficient for motions perpendicular to the acquisition plane. By the
synergistic combination of these two measures, in and out-plane motion is well
detectable, achieving an average artifact suppression of 93 [percent]. This
outperforms the entropy-based state-of-the-art autofocus measure which achieves

The ""lottery ticket"" was designed for centralized systems where a trusted third

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1806.07127",,,,"cs.LO math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a restricted second-order logic $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$
for finite structures where second-order quantification ranges over relations
of size at most poly-logarithmic in the size of the structure. We demonstrate
the relevance of this logic and complexity class by several problems in
database theory. We then prove a Fagin's style theorem showing that the Boolean
queries which can be expressed in the existential fragment of
$\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ corresponds exactly to the class of decision
problems that can be computed by a non-deterministic Turing machine with random
access to the input in time $O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k \ge 0$, i.e., to the
class of problems computable in non-deterministic poly-logarithmic time. It
should be noted that unlike Fagin's theorem which proves that the existential
fragment of second-order logic captures NP over arbitrary finite structures,
our result only holds over ordered finite structures, since
$\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ is too weak as to define a total order of the
domain. Nevertheless $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ provides natural levels of
expressibility within poly-logarithmic space in a way which is closely related
to how second-order logic provides natural levels of expressibility within
polynomial space. Indeed, we show an exact correspondence between the
quantifier prefix classes of $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ and the levels of
the non-deterministic poly-logarithmic time hierarchy, analogous to the
correspondence between the quantifier prefix classes of second-order logic and
the polynomial-time hierarchy. Our work closely relates to the constant depth
quasipolynomial size AND/OR circuits and corresponding restricted second-order
logic defined by David A. Mix Barrington in 1992. We explore this relationship
in detail.

alternative that best represents the preferences of the group. Agents may
manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does
not reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people
often do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can
be computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their
expected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote
truthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being
truthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we
examine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at
heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and
makes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a
behavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations
and prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these
behaviors maximize expected utility and show how the structure of the voting
environment affects both how well each heuristic performs and how humans employ
these heuristics.

different set of selected prototypes, i.e., representative of whole event data
and stops when conformance metrics decrease. The proposed method has been
implemented in both the ProM and the RapidProM platforms. We applied the
proposed method on several real event data with state-of-the-art, process

this work, we are mostly motivated by a consistent treatment of the anisotropy

Sundman's time transformation in the framework of the projective decomposition
of motion, which is the starting point of the Burdet-Ferr\'andiz linearisation,
combined with the Stumpff functions. In analogy with Deprit's ideal elements,
the formulation relies on a special reference frame that evolves slowly under
the action of external perturbations. We call it the intermediate frame, hence
the name of the elements. Two of them are related to the radial motion, the
next four, given by Euler parameters, fix the orientation of the intermediate
frame. The total energy and a time element complete the state vector. All the
necessary formulae for extending the method to orbit determination and
uncertainty propagation are provided. For example, the partial derivatives of
the position and velocity with respect to the intermediate elements are

look for a systematic way to parametrically approach the scale at which maximal

Chern Simons instability. We do so by considering possible realizations of the
effective field theory of Scalar-Tensor gravity, which could offer a rich
phenomenology. The gravitational action is extended to include derivatively
coupled interactions which, by means of a disformal transformation, are scaled
by negative powers of a small parameter which is identified with the graviton

change in the physical description of the system is necessary in order to
maintain sufficient parity violation as well ensure stability of the modes.

intuitive notion of function, called Flow Theory. Within our framework all
functions are monadic and none of them has any domain. Sets, proper classes,
categories, functors, and even relations are special cases of functions. In
this sense, functions in Flow are not equivalent to functions in ZFC.
Nevertheless, we prove both ZFC and Category Theory are naturally immersed
within Flow. Besides, our framework provides major advantages as a language for
axiomatization of standard mathematical and physical theories. Russell's
paradox is avoided without any equivalent to the Separation Scheme. Hierarchies
of sets are obtained without any equivalent to the Power Set Axiom. And a clear
principle of duality emerges from Flow, in a way which was not anticipated
neither by Category Theory nor by standard set theories. Besides, there seems
to be within Flow an identification not only with the common practice of doing
mathematics (which is usually quite different from the ways proposed by
logicians), but even with the common practice of teaching this formal science.

Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test
datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing
where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop
mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify
two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from
real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be
used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely
confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications
can be time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the
following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing
modes for DNNs: First, can we use simulator-generated data as a reliable
substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do
online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though
these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them
in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use
DNNs automating end-to-end control of cars' steering actuators. Our results
show that simulator-generated datasets are able to yield DNN prediction errors
that are similar to those obtained by testing DNNs with real-life datasets.
Further, offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety
violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline
testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led
to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.

However, the same technique may be employed by an attacker to analyze the

remotely exploitable attack point. Code obfuscation is used to hinder reverse
engineering of executable programs. In this paper, we focus on securing binary
distribution, where attackers gain access to binaries distributed to end
devices, in order to reverse engineer them and find potential vulnerabilities.
Attackers do not however have means to monitor the execution of said devices.
In particular, we focus on the control flow obfuscation --- a technique that
prevents an attacker from restoring the correct reachability conditions for the
basic blocks of a program. By doing so, we thwart attackers in their effort to
infer the inputs that cause the program to enter a vulnerable state (e.g.,
buffer overrun). We propose a compiler extension for obfuscation and a minimal
hardware modification for dynamic deobfuscation that takes advantage of a
secret key stored in hardware. We evaluate our experiments on the LLVM compiler
toolchain and the BRISC-V open source processor. On PARSEC benchmarks, our
deobfuscation technique incurs only a 5\% runtime overhead. We evaluate the
security of Drndalo by training classifiers on pairs of obfuscated and

winter solstice. These are caused by photoelectrons that were transported along
field lines from magnetically conjugate areas in the other hemisphere, where
those areas are still illuminated. We perform model calculations to demonstrate
that this process is the source of the emission, and obtain good agreement with
its morphology and intensity. In some regions, the observed emissions are not
as intense as the model simulations. Some of the reductions in electron flux
are explained by changes in magnetic field strength; in other cases,
particularly at high magnetic latitude, the cause is unknown, but must occur
along extended field lines as they reach into the plasma sheet.

quantum dissipation theories, which originally describe only the reduced system

in image analysis. This becomes particularly challenging for sketch images, due
to the varying nature of human drawing style, projection distortions and
viewport changes. In this paper we present the first attempt to obtain a
learned descriptor for dense registration in line drawings. Based on recent
deep learning techniques for corresponding photographs, we designed descriptors
to locally match image pairs where the object of interest belongs to the same
semantic category, yet still differ drastically in shape, form, and projection
angle. To this end, we have specifically crafted a data set of synthetic
sketches using non-photorealistic rendering over a large collection of
part-based registered 3D models. After training, a neural network generates
descriptors for every pixel in an input image, which are shown to generalize
correctly in unseen sketches hand-drawn by humans. We evaluate our method
against a baseline of correspondences data collected from expert designers, in
addition to comparisons with other descriptors that have been proven effective
in sketches. Code, data and further resources will be publicly released by the
time of publication.

a face. Many digital systems are available for the creation of such composites
but are either unable to reproduce features unless previously designed or do
not allow holistic changes to the image. In this paper, we improve the
efficiency of composite creation by removing the reliance on expert knowledge
and letting the system learn to represent faces from examples. The novel
approach, Composite Generating GAN (CG-GAN), applies generative and
evolutionary computation to allow casual users to easily create facial
composites. Specifically, CG-GAN utilizes the generator network of a pg-GAN to
create high-resolution human faces. Users are provided with several functions
to interactively breed and edit faces. CG-GAN offers a novel way of generating
and handling static and animated photo-realistic facial composites, with the
possibility of combining multiple representations of the same perpetrator,
generated by different eyewitnesses.

It introduces
numerous changes and potential improvements for physical layer data
transmissions, although only point-to-point (PTP) communications are
considered. In order to use physical data channels such as the Physical
Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), it is essential to guarantee a successful
transmission of control information via the Physical Downlink Control Channel
(PDCCH). Taking into account these two aspects, in this paper, we first analyze
the PDCCH processing chain in NR PTP as well as in the state-of-the-art Long
Term Evolution (LTE) point-to-multipoint (PTM) solution, i.e., evolved
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS). Then, via link level
simulations, we compare the performance of the two technologies, observing the
Bit/Block Error Rate (BER/BLER) for various scenarios. The objective is to
identify the performance gap brought by physical layer changes in NR PDCCH as
well as provide insightful guidelines on the control channel configuration
towards NR PTM scenarios.
