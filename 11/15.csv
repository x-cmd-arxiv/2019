of crucial importance for effectively implementing policy measures. We extend
the empirical econometric literature on the role of production networks in the
propagation of shocks along two dimensions. First, we allow for
industry-specific responses that vary over time, reflecting non-linearities and
cross-sectional heterogeneities in direct transmission channels. Second, we
allow for time-varying network structures and dependence. This feature captures
both variation in the structure of the production network, but also differences
in cross-industry demand elasticities. We find that impacts vary substantially
over time and the cross-section. Higher-order effects appear to be particularly
important in periods of economic and financial uncertainty, often coinciding
with tight credit market conditions and financial stress. Differentials in
industry-specific responses can be explained by how close the respective
industries are to end-consumers.

available to measure directly the strength of magnetic fields in regions of
star formation. We review the physics of the Zeeman effect and its practical
use in both extended gas and in masers. We discuss observational results for
the five species for which the Zeeman effect has been detected in the ISM --
H~I, OH, and CN in extended gas and OH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$O in masers. These
species span densities from $\sim10$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\sim10^{10}$ cm $^{-3}$,
which allows magnetic fields to be measured over the full range of cloud
densities. However, there are significant limitations, including that only the
line-of-sight component of the magnetic field strength can usually be measured
and that there are often significant uncertainties about the physical
conditions being sampled, particularly for masers. We discuss statistical
methods to partially overcome these limitations. The results of Zeeman
observations are that the mass to magnetic flux ratio is subcritical (gravity
dominates magnetic support) at lower densities but supercritical for $N_H
\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Above $n_H\sim 300$ cm$^{-3}$, which is roughly the
density at which clouds typically become self-gravitating, the strength of
magnetic fields increases approximately as $B \propto n^{2/3}$, which suggest
that magnetic fields do not provide significant support at high densities. This
is consistent with high-density clouds being supercritical. However, magnetic
fields have a large range in strengths at any given density, so the role of
magnetic fields should differ significantly from one cloud to another. And for
maser regions the dependence of field strength on density may have a slightly
lower slope. Turbulent reconnection theory seems to best match the Zeeman
observational results.

with qualitative information such as road type and speed limit. Unfortunately,
such information is often incomplete; for instance, OpenStreetMap only has
speed limits for 13% of all Danish road segments. This is problematic for
analysis tasks that rely on such information for machine learning. To enable
machine learning in such circumstances, one may consider the application of
network embedding methods to extract structural information from the network.
However, these methods have so far mostly been used in the context of social
networks, which differ significantly from road networks in terms of, e.g., node
degree and level of homophily (which are key to the performance of many network
embedding methods). We analyze the use of network embedding methods,
specifically node2vec, for learning road segment embeddings in road networks.
Due to the often limited availability of information on other relevant road
characteristics, the analysis focuses on leveraging the spatial network
structure. Our results suggest that network embedding methods can indeed be
used for deriving relevant network features (that may, e.g, be used for
predicting speed limits), but that the qualities of the embeddings differ from
embeddings for social networks.

initiation phase where the reconnection rate grows, a quasi-steady phase, and a
declining phase where both the reconnection rate and the energy spectrum
decrease. During the steady phase, the energy spectrum exhibits approximately a
double power-law behavior, with a slope near -5/3 at wavenumbers smaller than

reducing undesirable vibrations and trajectory tracking errors, especially for

likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\theta$ exists. We also study some truncated
one-step estimators and show that they are $\sqrt{n}-$consistent, and nearly
achieve the asymptotic efficiency bound. We also show that the rate of
convergence for the MLE is $O_p(n^{-2/5})$. Furthermore, we show that our
estimators are robust with respect to the violation of the log-concavity

$\sqrt{n}$-consistent under some mild conditions. These analytical conclusions
are supported by simulation studies.

about the leading order effect of non-sphericity on the maximum turnaround size
$R_{\rm TA,max}$ of large scale bound cosmic structures. Two of them describe
intrinsically axisymmetric static mass distributions whereas the other is the
Kerr-de Sitter metric where the axisymmetry is generated due to the rotation of
the structure. In all the cases the fractional change $\delta R_{\rm
TA,max}(\theta)/R^{(0)}_{\rm TA,max}$ of $R_{\rm TA,max}$ of a given structure,
compared to a spherical one with the same mass $M$, depends on the polar angle
$\theta$ and is proportional to the product of the relevant eccentricity
parameter, times the square of a small quantity. This quantity in the static
examples is the ratio of two characteristic length scales, while in the
spinning case it is the ratio $v_{\rm out}/c$ of the azimuthal speed of the
outmost members of the structure, over the speed of light. Furthermore, the
angular average $\langle \delta R_{\rm TA,max}(\theta)/R^{(0)}_{\rm
TA,max}\rangle$ is zero in the two static cases, while it is negative and
proportional to ${\cal O}(v^2_{\rm out}/c^2)$ for the Kerr-de Sitter. Thus,
$\delta R_{\rm TA,max}(\theta)/R^{(0)}_{\rm TA,max}$ for an axisymmetric
structure is very small for practically any value of the eccentricity
parameter. We speculate about some possible further implications of our result
on the maximum turn around radius of realistic cosmic structures.

To overcome this limitation, a linear comparison system is introduced, and
conditions are stated for when the asymptotic stability of its origin
corresponds to the asymptotic stability of the origin of linearized transverse

this comparison system which, when implemented on the dynamical system, renders
the desired motion asymptotically stable in the orbital sense.

survey made out of a wide total area $A_{\rm{tot}}$ imaged at a limiting
magnitude $\rm{mag_{W}}$ containing a subset of area $A_{\rm{deep}}$ where
observations are pushed to a deeper limiting magnitude $\rm{mag_{D}}$. We
present an updated procedure to match the theoretically predicted MFs to the
measured ones, taking into account the impact of map reconstruction from noisy
shear data. We validate this renewed method against simulated data sets with
different source redshift distributions and total number density, setting these
quantities in accordance with the depth of the survey. We can then rely on a
Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the improvement in the FoM due to the joint
use of shear tomography and MFs under different assumptions on
$(A_{\rm{tot}},\,A_{\rm{deep}},\,\rm{mag_{D}})$, and the prior on the MFs
nuisance parameters. It turns out that MFs can provide a valuable help in
increasing the FoM of the lensing survey, provided the nuisance parameters are
known with a non negligible precision. What is actually more interesting is the
possibility to compensate for the loss of FoM due to a cut in the multipole
range probed by shear tomography, which makes the results more robust against
uncertainties in the modeling of nonlinearities. This makes MFs a promising
tool to both increase the FoM and make the constraints on the cosmological
parameters less affected by theoretical systematic effects.

two-body localisation in terms of the rate of growth of entanglement entropy
and compute the localisation length. We find indications for two distinct
growth laws for the entanglement: a logarithmic law in the delocalised phase
and a double logarithmic law in the localised phase. We discuss similarities
with many-body localisation (MBL).

Tissues are remarkably resistant against mechanical deformations because
collagen molecules hierarchically self-assemble in fibrous networks that
stiffen with increasing strain. Nevertheless, collagen networks do fracture
when tissues are overloaded or subject to pathological conditions such as
aneurysms. Prior studies of the role of collagen in tissue fracture have mainly
focused on tendons, which contain highly aligned bundles of collagen. By
contrast, little is known about fracture of the orientationally more disordered
collagen networks present in many other tissues such as skin and cartilage.
Here, we combine shear rheology of reconstituted collagen networks with
computer simulations to investigate the primary determinants of fracture in
disordered collagen networks. We show that the fracture strain is controlled by
the coordination number of the network junctions, with less connected networks
fracturing at larger strains. The hierarchical structure of collagen fine-tunes
the fracture strain by providing structural plasticity at the network and fiber
level. Our findings imply that structural disorder provides a protective
mechanism against network fracture that can optimize the strength of biological
tissues.

this paper considers millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, which are

optimal beam and (ii) the reliability challenge due to the high sensitivity to

challenges. To do that, this paper exploits computer vision and deep learning
tools to predict mmWave beams and blockages directly from the camera RGB images

is capable of achieving over 90\% beam prediction accuracy, which only requires

  Remaining Useful Life Estimation in Condition-Based Maintenance","Withdrawn to resolve an authorship dispute",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decade, deep learning (DL) has outperformed model-based and
statistical approaches in predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of
machinery in the context of condition-based maintenance. One of the major
drawbacks of DL is that it heavily depends on a large amount of labeled data,
which are typically expensive and time-consuming to obtain, especially in
industrial applications. Scarce training data lead to uncertain estimates of
the model's parameters, which in turn result in poor prognostic performance.
Quantifying this parameter uncertainty is important in order to determine how
reliable the prediction is. Traditional DL techniques such as neural networks
are incapable of capturing the uncertainty in the training data, thus they are
overconfident about their estimates. On the contrary, Bayesian deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution to account for uncertainty in the
training process, achieving state-of-the-art performance in many classification
and regression tasks. In this work Bayesian DL techniques such as Bayesian
dense neural networks and Bayesian convolutional neural networks are applied to
RUL estimation and compared to their frequentist counterparts from the
literature. The effectiveness of the proposed models is verified on the popular
C-MAPSS dataset. Furthermore, parameter uncertainty is quantified and used to
gain additional insight into the data.

multiplicative functions which are close to their mean value. This enables us
to obtain various new results as well as strengthen existing results with new
proofs.
  As a first application, we show that for a completely multiplicative function
$f : \mathbb{N} \to \{-1,1\},$ \begin{align*}
\limsup_{x\to\infty}\Big|\sum_{n\leq x}\mu^2(n)f(n)\Big|=\infty. \end{align*}
This confirms a conjecture of Aymone concerning the discrepancy of square-free
supported multiplicative functions.
  Secondly, we show that a completely multiplicative function $f : \mathbb{N}
\to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies \begin{align*} \sum_{n\leq x}f(n)=cx+O(1)
\end{align*} with $c\neq 0$ if and only if $f(p)=1$ for all but finitely many
primes and $|f(p)|<1$ for the remaining primes. This answers a question of
Ruzsa.
  For the case $c = 0,$ we show, under the additional hypothesis $$\sum_{p
}\frac{1-|f(p)|}{p} < \infty,$$ that $f$ has bounded partial sums if and only
if $f(p) = \chi(p)p^{it}$ for some non-principal Dirichlet character $\chi$
modulo $q$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$ except on a finite set of primes that
contains the primes dividing $q$, wherein $|f(p)| < 1.$ This provides progress
on another problem of Ruzsa and gives a new and simpler proof of a stronger
form of Chudakov's conjecture.
  Along the way we obtain quantitative bounds for the discrepancy of the
generalized characters improving on the previous work of Borwein, Choi and
Coons.

WaveNet and WaveGlow. Both these vocoders are traditionally speaker dependent.
Here we first show that when trained on data from enough speakers, these
vocoders can generate speech from unseen speakers, both male and female, with
similar quality as seen speakers in training. Next using these two vocoders and
a new vocoder LPCNet, we evaluate the noise reduction quality of PR on unseen
speakers and show that objective signal and overall quality is higher than the
state-of-the-art speech enhancement systems Wave-U-Net, Wavenet-denoise, and
SEGAN. Moreover, in subjective quality, multiple-speaker PR out-performs the

combined vector is obtained in which the dependent variable is typically
shifted closer to its true value, as in a standard inpainting or denoising

initial state to better explore the complex energy landscape, is used to solve
the highly non-convex sparse coding optimization problem. The regression

achieved. The regression test is performed using six different values for the

resources (DERs), conventional load models cannot capture their dynamics.
Therefore, a new comprehensive composite load model is developed by Western
Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). However, this model is a complex
high-order nonlinear system with multi-time-scale property, which poses
challenges on stability analysis and computational burden in large-scale
simulations. In order to reduce the computational burden while preserving the
accuracy of the original model, this paper proposes a generic high-fidelity
order reduction approach and then apply it to WECC composite load model. First,
we develop a large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method using singular
perturbation theory. In this method, the fast dynamics are integrated into the
slow dynamics to preserve the transient characteristics of fast dynamics. Then,
we propose the necessary conditions for accurate order reduction and embed them
into the LSOR to improve and guarantee the accuracy of reduced-order model.
Finally, we develop the reduced-order WECC composite load model using the
proposed algorithm. Simulation results show the reduced-order large signal
model significantly alleviates the computational burden while maintaining
similar dynamic responses as the original composite load model.

effect in ensembles of different dimensionality, and predict existence of the
long-lived coherences in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional (where every
spin is coupled to all others) systems, which are of particular importance for
quantum sensing and quantum information processing. We explore the transition

behavior is drastically different, exhibiting dimensionality-dependent
singularity. Our study establishes the common physical origin of the long-lived
coherences in different dimensionalities, and suggests that this effect is a

environments cold enough for water and/or ammonia clouds. We have developed a
new equilibrium cloud and reflected light spectrum model, ExoREL, for widely
separated giant exoplanets. The model includes the dissolution of ammonia in
liquid water cloud droplets, an effect studied for the first time for
exoplanets. While preserving the causal relationship between temperature and
cloud condensation, ExoREL is simple and fast to enable efficient exploration
of parameter space. Using the model, we find that the mixing ratio of methane
and the cloud top pressure of a giant exoplanet can be uniquely determined from
a single observation of its reflected light spectrum at wavelengths less than 1
micron if it has a cloud deck deeper than ~0.3 bars. This measurement is
enabled by the weak and strong bands of methane and requires a signal-to-noise
ratio of 20. The cloud pressure once derived, provides information about the
internal heat flux of the planet. Importantly, we find that for a low,
Uranus-like internal heat flux, the planet can have a deep liquid water cloud,
which will sequester ammonia and prevent the formation of the ammonia cloud
that would otherwise be the uppermost cloud layer. This newly identified
phenomenon causes a strong sensitivity of the cloud top pressure on the
internal heat flux. Reflected light spectroscopy from future direct-imaging
missions therefore not only measure the atmospheric abundances but also
characterize the thermal evolution of giant exoplanets.

physical states can naturally represent object instances of different

contrast to dynamics learned in pixel space or latent space, where
generalization to visual differences are not guaranteed. Challenges in taking
the state-space approach are the estimation of the high-dimensional state of a

first introduced by Anderson and Higham (SIAM Multiscal Model. Simul. 10(1),
2012), is a highly efficient simulation technique that can be used to estimate
various statistical quantities for stochastic reaction networks (SRNs), in
particular for stochastic biological systems. Unfortunately, the robustness and
performance of the multilevel method can be affected by the high kurtosis, a
phenomenon observed at the deep levels of MLMC, which leads to inaccurate
estimates of the sample variance. In this work, we address cases where the
high-kurtosis phenomenon is due to \textit{catastrophic coupling
(characteristic of pure jump processes where coupled consecutive paths are
identical in most of the simulations, while differences only appear in a tiny
proportion) and introduce a pathwise-dependent importance sampling (IS)
technique that improves the robustness and efficiency of the multilevel method.
Our theoretical results, along with the conducted numerical experiments,
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the kurtosis of the
deep levels of MLMC, and also improves the strong convergence rate from
$\beta=1$ for the standard case (without IS), to $\beta=1+\delta$, where
$0<\delta<1$ is a user-selected parameter in our IS algorithm. Due to the
complexity theorem of MLMC, and given a pre-selected tolerance, $\text{TOL}$,
this results in an improvement of the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}\left(\text{TOL}^{-2} \log(\text{TOL})^2\right)$ in the standard
case to $\mathcal{O}\left(\text{TOL}^{-2}\right)$, which is the optimal
complexity of the MLMC estimator. We achieve all these improvements with a
negligible additional cost since our IS algorithm is only applied a few times
across each simulated path.

interpretability of GPs while capturing structure across outputs, which is
desirable, for example, in spatio-temporal modelling. The key problem with
MOGPs is their computational scaling $O(n^3 p^3)$, which is cubic in the number
of both inputs $n$ (e.g., time points or locations) and outputs $p$. For this
reason, a popular class of MOGPs assumes that the data live around a
low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing the complexity to $O(n^3 m^3)$.
However, this cost is still cubic in the dimensionality of the subspace $m$,
which is still prohibitively expensive for many applications. We propose the
use of a sufficient statistic of the data to accelerate inference and learning
in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method achieves linear scaling in $m$ in
practice, allowing these models to scale to large $m$ without sacrificing
significant expressivity or requiring approximation. This advance opens up a
wide range of real-world tasks and can be combined with existing GP
approximations in a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
method on various synthetic and real-world data sets.

the notion of margin of victory (MoV) for tournament solutions. MoV is a
robustness measure for individual alternatives: For winners, the MoV captures
the distance from dropping out of the winner set, and for non-winners, the
distance from entering the set. In each case, distance is measured in terms of
which pairwise comparisons would have to be reversed in order to achieve the
desired outcome. For common tournament solutions, including the top cycle, the

different industrial processes (e.g., smart building management, power

Despite being used widely in many critical infrastructures, PLCs use protocols
which make these control systems vulnerable to many common attacks, including
man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service attacks, and memory corruption
attacks (e.g., array, stack, and heap overflows, integer overflows, and pointer
corruption). In this paper, we propose PLC-PROV, a system for tracking the
inputs and outputs of the control system to detect violations in the safety and
security policies of the system. We consider a smart building as an example of
a PLC-based system and show how PLC-PROV can be applied to ensure that the

to return information. Yet, the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription computes the
boundary entropy expected from unitary CFT evolution. We demonstrate this in a
novel setting with an asymptotic bulk detector, eliminating an assumption about
the entanglement wedge of auxiliary systems.
  We consider three interpretations of this result. (i) At face value,
information is lost in the bulk but not in the CFT. This conflicts with the
AdS/CFT dictionary. (ii) No unique QFT state (pure or mixed) governs all
detector responses to the bulk Hawking radiation. This conflicts with the
existence of an S-matrix. (iii) Nonlocal couplings to the black hole interior
cause asymptotic detectors to respond as though the radiation was pure, even
though it is naively thermal. This invalidates the standard interpretation of
the semiclassical state, including its smoothness at the horizon.
  We conclude that unitary boundary evolution requires asymptotic bulk
detectors to become unambiguously pure at late times. We ask whether the RT
prescription can still reproduce the boundary entropy in this bulk scenario. We
find that this requires a substantial failure of semiclassical gravity in a
low-curvature region, such as a firewall that purifies the Hawking radiation.
  Finally, we allow that the dual to semiclassical gravity may be an ensemble
of unitary theories. This appears to relax the tensions we found: the ensemble
average of out-states would be mixed, but the ensemble average of final
entropies would vanish.

propose holographic teleportation protocols that can be readily executed in
table-top experiments. These protocols exhibit similar behavior to that seen in
the recent traversable wormhole constructions of [1,2]: information that is
scrambled into one half of an entangled system will, following a weak coupling
between the two halves, unscramble into the other half. We introduce the
concept of teleportation by size to capture how the physics of operator-size
growth naturally leads to information transmission. The transmission of a
signal through a semi-classical holographic wormhole corresponds to a rather
special property of the operator-size distribution we call size winding. For
more general systems (which may not have a clean emergent geometry), we argue
that imperfect size winding is a generalization of the traversable wormhole
phenomenon. In addition, a form of signalling continues to function at high
temperature and at large times for generic chaotic systems, even though it does
not correspond to a signal going through a geometrical wormhole, but rather to
an interference effect involving macroscopically different emergent geometries.
Finally, we outline implementations feasible with current technology in two
experimental platforms: Rydberg atom arrays and trapped ions.

running are not sufficiently restrictive. The situation can be different in the
early universe when the gravitational field was sufficiently strong to provide
an efficient creation of particles from the vacuum. We develop a framework for
systematically exploring this ossibility. It is supposed that the running
occurs in the epoch when the Dark Matter already decoupled and is expanding
adiabatically, while baryons are approximately massless and can be abundantly
created from vacuum due to the decay of vacuum energy. By using the handy model
of Reduced Relativistic Gas for describing the Dark Matter, we consider the
dynamics of both cosmic background and linear perturbations and evaluate the
impact of the vacuum decay on the matter power spectrum and to the first CMB

statistical learning tools on the streaming data, we first learn an effective
dynamical model to describe the current behavior of the system. Next, we use
the probabilistic predictions of our learned model to define in a principled
way an efficient anomaly detection tool. Finally, the last module of our
framework produces on-the-fly classification of the detected anomalies into
common occurrence classes using features that grid operators are familiar with.

in-depth studies of the multi-phase structure and energetics of galaxy-wide
outflows. In this work we present new, deep ($\sim$50 hr) NOEMA CO(1-0) line
observations of the molecular gas in the powerful outflow driven by the AGN in
the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS F08572+3915. We spatially resolve the
outflow, finding that its most likely configuration is a wide-angle bicone
aligned with the kinematic major axis of the rotation disk. The molecular gas
in the wind reaches velocities up to approximately $\pm$1200 km s$^{-1}$ and
transports nearly 20% of the molecular gas mass in the system. We detect a
second outflow component located $\sim$6 kpc north-west from the galaxy moving
away at $\sim$900 km s$^{-1}$, which could be the result of a previous episode
of AGN activity. The total mass and energetics of the outflow, which includes
contributions from the ionized, neutral, warm and cold molecular gas phases is
strongly dominated by the cold molecular gas. In fact, the molecular mass
outflow rate is higher than the star formation rate, even if we only consider
the gas in the outflow that is fast enough to escape the galaxy, which accounts
for about $\sim$40% of the total mass of the outflow. This results in an
outflow depletion time for the molecular gas in the central $\sim$1.5 kpc
region of only $\sim3$ Myr, a factor of $\sim2$ shorter than the depletion time
by star formation activity.

by providing additional pressure and heating to the thermal plasma. We carry
out a linear stability analysis of weakly collisional plasmas with cosmic rays
using Braginskii MHD for the thermal gas. We assume that the CRs stream at the
Alfv\'en speed, which in a weakly collisional plasma depends on the pressure
anisotropy ($\Delta p$) of the thermal plasma. We find that this $\Delta
p$-dependence introduces a phase shift between the CR-pressure and gas-density
fluctuations. This drives a fast-growing acoustic instability: CRs offset the
damping of acoustic waves by anisotropic viscosity and give rise to wave growth
when the ratio of CR pressure to gas pressure is $\gtrsim \alpha \beta^{-1/2}$,
where $\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, and $\alpha$,
typically $\lesssim 1$, depends on other dimensionless parameters. In
high-$\beta$ environments like the ICM, this condition is satisfied for small
CR pressures. We speculate that the instability studied here may contribute to
the scattering of high-energy CRs and to the excitation of sound waves in
galaxy-halo, group and cluster plasmas, including the long-wavelength X-ray
fluctuations in \textit{Chandra} observations of the Perseus cluster. It may
also be important in the vicinity of shocks in dilute plasmas (e.g., cluster
virial shocks or galactic wind termination shocks), where the CR pressure is
locally enhanced.

However, it remains unclear how this ""feedback"" process operates. We use
high-resolution optical data to study the kinematics of multi-phase filamentary
structures by measuring the velocity structure function (VSF) of the filaments
over a wide range of scales in the centers of three nearby galaxy clusters:
Perseus, Abell 2597 and Virgo. We find that the motions of the filaments are
turbulent in all three clusters studied. There is a clear correlation between
features of the VSFs and the sizes of bubbles inflated by SMBH driven jets. Our
study demonstrates that SMBHs are the main driver of turbulent gas motions in
the centers of galaxy clusters and suggests that this turbulence is an
important channel for coupling feedback to the environment. Our measured
amplitude of turbulence is in good agreement with Hitomi Doppler line
broadening measurement and X-ray surface brightness fluctuation analysis,
suggesting that the motion of the cold filaments is well-coupled to that of the
hot gas. The smallest scales we probe are comparable to the mean free path in

photometry by extincting each star particle's spectrum using the line-of-sight

generally agrees with observations at $z=6$, owing to a partial cancellation
between the high metallicities of the simulated galaxies and lower
dust-to-metal ratios. The simulated $z=8$ UVLF is low compared to observations,
likely owing to excessive dust extinction. Simba predicts UV continuum slopes
($\beta$) in agreement with the $z=6$ observations, with the best agreement
obtained using a Calzetti extinction law. Interestingly, the gas-phase
mass-metallicity relation in Simba is higher at $z\sim 6$ than at $z\sim 2$,
suggesting that rapid early enrichment (and dust growth) might be necessary to
match the observed $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is more sensitive to the dust
extinction law than the UVLF. By generating mock James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) images and analysing in a manner similar to observations, we show that
Simba's galaxy size-luminosity relation well reproduces the current $z=6$

similar rest-UV and rest-optical sizes of $z=6$ galaxies, owing to weak age
gradients and dust extinction in star-forming regions counteract each other to
weaken the color gradients within galaxies. These predictions will be testable

neutron star cores are uncertain, making it difficult at present to
unequivocally compute dark matter scattering in this region. On the other hand,
the physics of an outer layer of the neutron star, the crust, is more robustly
understood. We show that dark matter scattering solely with the low-density
crust still kinetically heats neutron stars to infrared temperatures detectable
by forthcoming telescopes. We find that for both spin-independent and
spin-dependent scattering on nucleons, the crust-only cross section sensitivity
is $10^{-43} - 10^{-41}$~cm$^2$ for dark matter masses of 100 MeV $-$ 1 PeV,
with the best sensitivity arising from dark matter scattering with a crust
constituent called nuclear pasta (including gnocchi, spaghetti, and lasagna
phases). For dark matter masses from 10 eV to 1 MeV, the sensitivity is
$10^{-39} - 10^{-34}$~cm$^2$, arising from exciting collective phonon modes in
a neutron superfluid in the inner crust. Furthermore, for any $s$-wave or
$p$-wave annihilating dark matter, we show that dark matter will efficiently
annihilate by thermalizing just with the neutron star crust, regardless of
whether the dark matter ever scatters with the neutron star core. This implies
efficient annihilation in neutron stars for any electroweakly interacting dark
matter with inelastic mass splittings of up to 200 MeV, including Higgsinos. We
conclude that neutron star crusts play a key role in dark matter scattering and
annihilation in neutron stars.

foundational, with quantum numbers that transcend the spin-statistics laws, and
applied, providing a cornerstone for decoherence-free quantum computation. The
development of platforms for realization and manipulation of these objects,
however, remains a challenge. Typically these entail the zero-temperature
ground-state of incompressible, gapped fluids. Here, we establish a strikingly
different approach: the development and probing of anyon physics in a gapless
fluid. The platform of choice is a chiral, multichannel, multi-impurity
realization of the Kondo effect. We discuss how, in the proper limit, anyons
appear at magnetic impurities, protected by an asymptotic decoupling from the
fluid and by the emerging Kondo length scale. We discuss possible experimental
realization schemes using integer quantum Hall edges. The gapless and charged
degrees of freedom coexistent with the anyons suggest the possibility of
extracting quantum information data by transport and simple correlation
functions. To show that this is the case, we generalize the fusion ansatz of
Cardy's boundary conformal field theory, now in the presence of multiple
localized perturbations. The generalized fusion ansatz captures the idea that
multiple impurities share quantum information non-locally, in a way formally
identical to anyonic zero modes. We display several examples supporting and
illustrating this generalization and the extraction of quantum information data
out of two-point correlation functions. With the recent advances in mesoscopic
realizations of multichannel Kondo devices, our results imply that exotic anyon
physics may be closer to reach than presently imagined.

focus mostly on the chemical content of relatively old clusters (age $\gtrsim$
1 Gyr). Interestingly, the less studied young counterpart populating the solar
surrounding has been found to be solar (at most), with a notable surprising
lack of young metal-rich objects. While there is wide consensus about the
moderately above-solar composition of the Hyades cluster, the metallicity of
Praesepe is still controversial. Recent studies suggest that these two clusters
share identical chemical composition and age, but this conclusion is disputed.
With the aim of reassessing the metallicity of Praesepe, and its difference (if
any) with the Hyades cluster, we present in this paper a spectroscopic
investigation of ten solar-type dwarf members. We exploited $GIARPS$ at the TNG
to acquire high-resolution, high-quality optical and near-IR spectra and
derived stellar parameters, metallicity ([Fe/H]), light elements, $\alpha$- and
iron-peak elements, by using a strictly differential (line-by-line) approach.
We also analysed in the very same way the solar spectrum and the Hyades solar
analogue HD 28099. Our findings suggest that Praesepe is more metal-rich than
the Hyades, at the level of $\Delta$[Fe/H]=+0.05$\pm$0.01 dex, with a mean
value of [Fe/H]=+0.21$\pm0.01$ dex. All the other elements scale with iron, as
expected. This result seems to reject the hypothesis of a common origin for
these two open clusters. Most importantly, Praesepe is currently the most
metal-rich, young open cluster living in the solar neighbourhood.

distantly separated regions in the CFT vacuum state have zero mutual

this order when they lie close enough to develop significant classical and
quantum correlations. Previously, the separation at which this phase transition
occurs for equal-size ball-shaped regions centered at antipodal points on the

recent explorations of general relativity at large-$d$, we compute the
separation at which the phase transition occurs analytically in the limit of
infinitely many spacetime dimensions, and find that distant regions cannot
develop large correlations without collectively occupying the entire volume of
the boundary theory. We interpret this result as illustrating the spatial
decoupling of holographic correlations in the large-$d$ limit, and provide
intuition for this phenomenon using results from quantum information

range of bulk spacetime dimensions from $4$ to $21$, where analytic results are
intractable but numerical results provide insight into the dimension-dependence
of holographic correlations. For bulk dimensions above $5$, our exact numerical
results are well approximated analytically by working to next-to-leading order

which reconnection of this kind can be quantified. We use high time-cadence 171
$\AA$ data from SDO/AIA focused on new/old active region pair 11147/11149, to
quantify reconnection. We identify new loops as brightenings within a strip of
pixels between the regions. This strategy is premised on the assumption that
the energy brightening a loop originates in magnetic reconnection. We catalog
301 loops observed in the 48-hour time period beginning with the emergence of
AR 11149. The rate at which these loops appear between the two ARs is used to
calculate the reconnection rate between them. We then fit these loops with
magnetic field, solving for each loop's field strength, geometry, and twist
(via its proxy, coronal $\alpha$). We find the rate of newly-brightened flux
overestimates the flux which could be undergoing reconnection. This excess can
be explained by our finding that the interconnecting region is not at its
lowest energy (constant-$\alpha$) state; the extrapolations exhibit
loop-to-loop variation in $\alpha$. This flux overestimate may result from the
slow emergence of AR 11149, allowing time for Taylor relaxation internal to the

single value which provides another mechanism for brightening loops after they

surveys (both ground- and space-based) will provide more opportunities to
derive science from these objects, but only if they can be analyzed on
realistic time-scales. Currently, these analyses are expensive. In this work,
we present a regression analysis with uncertainty estimates using deep learning
models to measure four parameters of strong gravitational lenses in simulated
Dark Energy Survey data. Using only $gri$-band images, we predict Einstein
Radius, lens velocity dispersion, lens redshift to within $10-15\%$ of truth
values and source redshift to $30\%$ of truth values, along with predictive
uncertainties. This work helps to take a step along the path of faster analyses
of strong lenses with deep learning frameworks.

secret neutrino forces, and point out a model prediction that appears to have
been overlooked: the generation of unique flavor-changing effects in
experiments featuring decay-at-rest (DAR) neutrino sources. These flavor
changes occur because the decay that drives neutrino and antineutrino
production, $\mu^{+}\rightarrow e^+ +\bar{\nu}_{\mu}+\nu_{e}$, is unique in
producing two neutrinos in the final state. Any non-flavor-universal force
between the emerging neutrinos would thus induce a new oscillation phase as
they escape from each-other's potential wells, an effect which is largely
absent in experiments that primarily rely on meson decay-in-flight and nuclear
decay. We calculate the magnitude of the associated observable and compare it
to the anomalous neutrino flavor transformation seen by the LSND experiment,
finding a wide but constrained allowed parameter space. We also evaluate
existing limits from other experiments, and the testability of this new effect
at the future DAR programs JSNS$^2$ and OscSNS.

constraint when modelling angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. In
addition to the more external regions of the solar radiative zone probed by
pressure modes, measurements of rotational splittings of gravity modes would
offer an invaluable constraint on the rotation of the solar core. Aims: We
study the constraints that a measurement of the core rotation rate of the Sun
could bring on magnetic angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones.
Results: We first show that models computed with angular momentum transport by
magnetic instabilities and a recent prescription for the braking of the stellar
surface by magnetized winds can reproduce the observations of surface
velocities of stars in open clusters. These solar models predict both a flat
rotation profile in the external part of the solar radiative zone probed by
pressure modes and an increase in the rotation rate in the solar core, where
the stabilizing effect of chemical gradients plays a key role. A rapid rotation
of the core of the Sun, as suggested by reported detections of gravity modes,
is thus found to be compatible with angular momentum transport by magnetic
instabilities. Moreover, we show that the efficiency of magnetic angular
momentum transport in regions of strong chemical gradients can be calibrated by
the solar core rotation rate independently from the unknown rotational history
of the Sun. In particular, we find that a recent revised prescription for the
transport of angular momentum by the Tayler instability can be easily
distinguished from the original Tayler-Spruit dynamo, with a faster rotating
solar core supporting the original prescription.

first observe that, due to the limited computational cost, the number of

Perhaps not. Recent studies show that in the area of Software Analytics,
conclusions over different data sets are usually inconsistent. In this article,
we empirically investigate whether conclusions in the area of defect prediction
truly exhibit stability throughout time or not. Our investigation applies a
time-aware evaluation approach where models are trained only on the past, and
evaluations are executed only on the future. Through this time-aware
evaluation, we show that depending on which time period we evaluate defect
predictors, their performance, in terms of F-Score, the area under the curve
(AUC), and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), varies and their results are
not consistent. The next release of a product, which is significantly different
from its prior release, may drastically change defect prediction performance.
Therefore, without knowing about the conclusion stability, empirical software
engineering researchers should limit their claims of performance within the
contexts of evaluation, because broad claims about defect prediction
performance might be contradicted by the next upcoming release of a product
under analysis.

of a target structure is oftentimes unclear due to image quality and biological
factors. As such, predicted segmentations from deep learning algorithms are
inherently ambiguous. Additionally, ""ground truth"" segmentations performed by
human annotators are in fact weak labels that further increase the uncertainty
of outputs of supervised models developed on these manual labels. To date, most
deep learning segmentation studies utilize predicted segmentations without
uncertainty quantification. In contrast, we explore the use of Monte Carlo
dropout U-Nets for the segmentation with additional quantification of
segmentation uncertainty. We assess the utility of three measures of
uncertainty (Coefficient of Variation, Mean Pairwise Dice, and Mean Voxelwise
Uncertainty) for the segmentation of a less ambiguous target structure (liver)
and a more ambiguous one (liver tumors). Furthermore, we assess how the utility
of these measures changes with different patch sizes and cost functions. Our
results suggest that models trained using larger patches and the weighted
categorical cross-entropy as cost function allow the extraction of more
meaningful uncertainty measures compared to smaller patches and soft dice loss.
Among the three uncertainty measures Mean Pairwise Dice shows the strongest
correlation with segmentation quality. Our study serves as a proof-of-concept
of how uncertainty measures can be used to assess the quality of a predicted
segmentation, potentially serving to flag low quality segmentations from a

constant term DNF was shown to be NP-hard by Khot and Saket (FOCS 2008). On the

while Khot and Saket (STOC 2008) showed that an intersection of two halfspaces
is hard to weakly learn using any function of constantly many halfspaces. The
question of whether a $2$-term DNF is efficiently learnable using $2$ or

  In this work we answer this question in the negative by showing the hardness
of weakly learning a $2$-term DNF as well as a noisy AND using any function of

  YES Case: There is a $2$-term DNF that classifies all the points of the
distribution, and an AND that classifies at least $1-\zeta$ fraction of the
points correctly.
  NO Case: Any boolean function depending on at most $\ell$ halfspaces
classifies at most $1/2 + \nu$ fraction of the points of the distribution
correctly.
  Our result generalizes and strengthens the previous best results mentioned

forecasts, changes to the forecast model induce a considerable reforecasting

model changes. In this framework, the model change is seen as a perturbation of
the original forecast model. The response theory allows us then to evaluate the
variation induced on the parameters involved in the statistical postprocessing,
provided that the magnitude of this perturbation is not too large. This
approach is studied in the context of simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, and
then on a more realistic, yet simple, quasi-geostrophic model. The analytical
results for the former case help to pose the problem, while the application to
the latter provide a proof-of-concept and assesses the potential performances
of response theory in a chaotic system. In both cases, the parameters of the
statistical postprocessing used - an Error-in-Variables Model Output Statistics
(EVMOS) - are appropriately corrected when facing a model change. The potential
application in an operational environment is also discussed.

the decoupled case where the prior is trained once and can be reused for many
different log-concave degradation models without retraining. Whereas previous
MAP-based approaches to this problem lead to highly non-convex optimization
algorithms, our approach computes the joint (space-latent) MAP that naturally
leads to alternate optimization algorithms and to the use of a stochastic
encoder to accelerate computations. The resulting technique is called JPMAP
because it performs Joint Posterior Maximization using an Autoencoding Prior.
We show theoretical and experimental evidence that the proposed objective
function is quite close to bi-convex. Indeed it satisfies a weak bi-convexity
property which is sufficient to guarantee that our optimization scheme
converges to a stationary point.
  Experimental results also show the higher quality of the solutions obtained

standard is to design a trial with an appropriate sample from that population.
Due to the high cost of such trials, usually the sample size collected is

this paper, we discuss how to leverage the information from external `big data'
(data with much larger sample size) to improve the estimation accuracy at the
risk of introducing small bias. We proposed a family of weighted estimators to
balance the bias increase and variance reduction when including the big data.
We connect our proposed estimator to the established penalized regression
estimators. We derive the optimal weights using both second order and higher
order asymptotic expansions. Using extensive simulation studies, we showed that
the improvement in terms of mean square error (MSE) for the regression
coefficient can be substantial even with finite sample sizes and our weighted
method outperformed the existing methods such as penalized regression and James
Stein's approach. Also we provide theoretical guarantee that the proposed

for substantial periods of time and undergo correlated motion, plays a central
role in cancer and embryogenesis. Recent imaging experiments have provided
time-dependent traces of individual cells, thus providing an unprecedented
picture of tumor spheroid growth. By using simulations of a minimal cell model,
we analyze the experimental data that map the movement of cells in fibrosarcoma
tumor spheroid embedded in a collagen matrix. Both simulations and experiments
show that cells in the core of the spheroid exhibit subdiffusive glassy
dynamics (mean square displacement, $\Delta(t) \approx t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha
< 1$), whereas cells in the periphery exhibit superdiffusive motion, $\Delta(t)
\approx t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha>1)$. The motion of most of the cells near the
periphery undergo highly persistent and correlated directional motion, thus
explaining the observed superdiffusive behavior. The $\alpha$ values for cells
in the core and periphery, extracted from simulations and experiments are in
near quantitative agreement with each other, which is surprising given that no
parameter in the model was used to fit the measurements. The qualitatively
different dynamics of cells in the core and periphery is captured by the fourth
order susceptibility, introduced to characterize metastable states in glass
forming systems. Analyses of the velocity autocorrelation of individual cells
show remarkable spatial heterogeneity with no two cells exhibiting similar
behavior. The prediction that $\alpha$ should depend on the location of the
cells in the tumor is amenable to experimental test. The highly heterogeneous
dynamics of cells in the tumor spheroid provides a plausible mechanism for the
origin of intratumor heterogeneity.

To simultaneously handle these two types of time-varying features, a two-step
approach is proposed: multiple change point locations are first identified
based on comparing the difference between the localized averages on sample
covariance matrices, and then graph supports are recovered based on a
kernelized time-varying constrained $L_1$-minimization for inverse matrix
estimation (CLIME) estimator on each segment. We derive the rates of
convergence for estimating the change points and precision matrices under mild
moment and dependence conditions. In particular, we show that this two-step

precision matrix function, under certain high-dimensional scaling limit. The

monads account for two aspects of the lambda calculus: on the one hand, in the
monadic viewpoint, the lambda calculus is an object equipped with a
well-behaved substitution; on the other hand, in the graphical viewpoint, it is
an oriented multigraph whose vertices are terms and whose edges witness the
reductions between two terms.
  We study presentations of reduction monads. To this end, we propose a notion
of 'reduction signature'. As usual, such a signature plays the role of a
virtual presentation, and specifies arities for generating
operations---possibly subject to equations---together with arities for
generating reduction rules. For each such signature, we define a category of
models; any model is, in particular, a reduction monad. If the initial object
of this category of models exists, we call it the 'reduction monad presented

  Our main result identifies a class of reduction signatures which specify a
reduction monad in the above sense. We show in the examples that our approach
covers several standard variants of the lambda calculus.

that provides critical information on the relationship of vascular structure
and dynamics in the context of underlying anatomy. A key challenge for image
processing with contrast enhanced CT is that phase discrepancies are latent in
different tissues due to contrast protocols, vascular dynamics, and metabolism
variance. Previous studies with deep learning frameworks have been proposed for
classifying contrast enhancement with networks inspired by computer vision.
Here, we revisit the challenge in the context of whole abdomen contrast
enhanced CTs. To capture and compensate for the complex contrast changes, we
propose a novel discriminator in the form of a multi-domain disentangled
representation learning network. The goal of this network is to learn an
intermediate representation that separates contrast enhancement from anatomy
and enables classification of images with varying contrast time. Briefly, our
unpaired contrast disentangling GAN(CD-GAN) Discriminator follows the ResNet
architecture to classify a CT scan from different enhancement phases. To
evaluate the approach, we trained the enhancement phase classifier on 21060
slices from two clinical cohorts of 230 subjects. Testing was performed on 9100
slices from 30 independent subjects who had been imaged with CT scans from all
contrast phases. Performance was quantified in terms of the multi-class
normalized confusion matrix. The proposed network significantly improved
correspondence over baseline UNet, ResNet50 and StarGAN performance of accuracy
scores 0.54. 0.55, 0.62 and 0.91, respectively. The proposed discriminator from
the disentangled network presents a promising technique that may allow deeper

and considers differences in the impostor and genuine distributions as well as
verification rates and ROC curves. We find that accuracy is lower for older

matcher on the same dataset shows the traditional result of higher accuracy for
older persons, although its overall accuracy is much lower than that of the
deep learning matchers. Comparing the impostor and genuine distributions, we
conclude that impostor scores have a larger effect than genuine scores in
causing lower accuracy for the older age group. We also investigate the effects
of training data across the age groups. Our results show that fine-tuning the
deep CNN models on additional images of older persons actually lowers accuracy
for the older age group. Also, we fine-tune and train from scratch two models

Locally resolved absorption depletion, observed through differential ground

distribution. By employing a closed two-level optical transition uncoupled from
the Rydberg state, the highly excited atoms are preserved during imaging. We
measure the excitation dynamics of the $\vert48S\rangle$ state of
$^{87}\text{Rb}$, observing a saturation of the two-dimensional Rydberg

prevents resonant excitation of close-by Rydberg atoms due to strong dipolar
interactions. By combining the superatom description, where atoms within a
blockade radius are represented as collective excitations, with a Monte Carlo
sampling, we can quantitatively model the observed excitation dynamics and
infer the full three-dimensional distribution of Rydberg atoms, that can serve
as a starting point for quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving

interesting consequences, including breaking the degeneracy between even and

loss of Galilean invariance for flows with velocity components in the poloidal

using the Cahn-Hilliard equation. We find a second-order phase transition in
the equilibrium location of the stripe as a function of its area $\Delta A$.
This phase transition leads to a complex dependence of the Laplace pressure on
$\Delta A$. We also derive the underdamped oscillatory dynamics as the stripes
approach equilibrium. Furthermore, relaxing the assumption of axial symmetry,
we derive the conditions under which the stripes become unstable. In all cases,

$4.03$. For complete graphs, we provide a new approximation factor of $3.17$,
improving over the best previous factor of $4.34$. We provide similar improved
approximation factors for the $k$-planar crossing number of complete graphs and
complete bipartite graphs, for any positive integer $k$. We also investigate
the relation between (ordinary) crossing number and biplanar crossing number of

kinetic systems do not hydrodynamize owing to the failure of the
hydrodynamization process which heavily relies on the classification of

their lifetime. These events are influenced by patient covariates such as
comorbidities, age group, gender etc. as well as external temporal effects
(e.g. flu season). While there exist seminal methods to model time series data,
it becomes increasingly challenging to extend these methods to medical event
time series data. Due to the complexity of the real data, in which each patient
visit is an event, we transform the data by using summary statistics to
characterize the events for a fixed set of time intervals, to facilitate
analysis and interpretability. We then train a generative adversarial network
to generate synthetic data. We demonstrate this approach by generating human
sleep patterns, from a publicly available dataset. We empirically evaluate the

to gain a deeper understanding of synthetic data quality.

properties predicted with the DOS model compare to the other two scattering
models, using three analytical electron dispersions (parabolic band in
3D/2D/1D, Kane band in 3D/2D/1D, and ring-shaped quartic band in 2D). Our
findings show that the scattering models can lead to significant differences,
and can disagree about whether certain band structures can provide benefits. A
constant relaxation-time is found to always be optimistic compared to a
constant mean-free-path, while the DOS scattering model shows no such clear
trend. Notably, the 1D parabolic band and 2D quartic band exhibit the highest
power factors with the DOS model, resulting from a rapid decrease in
density-of-states, and thus scattering - suggesting a possible strategy for
improved thermoelectrics based on engineering band structures with
sharp/discontinuous drops in density-of-states. The DOS scattering
approximation also suggests that searches for materials with a delta
function-like DOS (as a proxy to the transport distribution) or converged bands
may yield limited benefits, due to the increase in scattering. This work
highlights the importance of simple and accurate scattering models when
rigorous ab-initio scattering calculations are not feasible.

phenomena. The main goal of the evidential paradigm is to quantify the strength
of evidence in the data for a reference model relative to an alternative model.
This is done via an evidence function, such as $\Delta SIC$, an estimator of
the sample size scaled difference of divergences between the generating
mechanism and the competing models. To use evidence, either for decision making
or as a guide to the accumulation of knowledge, an understanding of the
uncertainty in the evidence is needed. This uncertainty is well characterized
by the standard statistical theory of estimation. Unfortunately, the standard
theory breaks down if the models are misspecified, as it is normally the case
in scientific studies. We develop non-parametric bootstrap methodologies for
estimating the sampling distribution of the evidence estimator under model
misspecification. This sampling distribution allows us to determine how secure
we are in our evidential statement. We characterize this uncertainty in the
strength of evidence with two different types of confidence intervals, which we
term ""global"" and ""local"". We discuss how evidence uncertainty can be used to
improve scientific inference and illustrate this with a reanalysis of the model

arrangements (i.e with smaller inter-pore distances), ii) with pores positioned
closer to the device edge/contact, and iii) with pores in a triangular

into existing porous geometries in a hierarchical fashion increases
rectification even further to over 60%. Importantly, for the structures we

from short phonon mean-free-paths are more beneficial for rectification than
spreading the asymmetry throughout the material along the heat direction in a

variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of
periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance
evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes
variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates
stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence
and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial
population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the
antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if
the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial
population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not
rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is
eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations.
Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if
they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the
latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that
completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that
the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs
than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of
different antimicrobial modes of action.

For this TLLM, it takes only one crack for the stress in its ""brittle layer"" to
fall below a certain value at small velocities. Coupled with the asymmetry of
the whole system, this results in a rough crack surface. 3) The ""brittle layer""
is large enough when the crack velocity reaches a certain value. Two cracks

component of nearby protoplanetary discs, including rings, gaps, spiral arms,
and lopsided concentrations. One interpretation of these substructures is the
existence of embedded planets. Not until recently, however, most of the
modelling effort to interpret these observations ignored the dust back reaction
to the gas. In this work, we conduct local-shearing-sheet simulations for an
isothermal, inviscid, non-self-gravitating, razor-thin dusty disc with a planet
on a fixed circular orbit. We systematically examine the parameter space
spanned by planet mass ($0.1M_\text{th} \le M_\text{p} \le 1M_\text{th}$, where
$M_\text{th}$ is the thermal mass), dimensionless stopping time ($10^{-3} \le
\tau_\text{s} \le 1$), and solid abundance ($0 < Z \le 1$). We find that when
the dust particles are tightly coupled to the gas ($\tau_\text{s} < 0.1$), the
spiral arms are less open and the gap driven by the planet becomes deeper with
increasing $Z$, consistent with a reduced speed of sound in the approximation
of a single dust-gas mixture. By contrast, when the dust particles are
marginally coupled ($0.1 \lesssim \tau_\text{s} \lesssim 1$), the spiral
structure is insensitive to $Z$ and the gap structure in the gas can become
significantly skewed and unidentifiable. When the latter occurs, the pressure
maximum radially outside of the planet is weakened or even extinguished, and
hence dust filtration by a low-mass ($M_\text{p} < M_\text{th}$) planet could
be reduced or eliminated. Finally, we find that the gap edges where the dust
particles are accumulated as well as the lopsided large-scale vortices driven
by a massive planet, if any, are unstable, and they are broken into numerous
small-scale dust-gas vortices.

However, there is some debate about how to encourage disentanglement with VAEs
and evidence indicates that existing implementations of VAEs do not achieve
disentanglement consistently. The evaluation of how well a VAE's latent space
has been disentangled is often evaluated against our subjective expectations of
which attributes should be disentangled for a given problem. Therefore, by
definition, we already have domain knowledge of what should be achieved and yet
we use unsupervised approaches to achieve it. We propose a weakly-supervised
approach that incorporates any available domain knowledge into the training
process to form a Gated-VAE. The process involves partitioning the
representational embedding and gating backpropagation. All partitions are
utilised on the forward pass but gradients are backpropagated through different
partitions according to selected image/target pairings. The approach can be
used to modify existing VAE models such as beta-VAE, InfoVAE and DIP-VAE-II.
Experiments demonstrate that using gated backpropagation, latent factors are
represented in their intended partition. The approach is applied to images of
faces for the purpose of disentangling head-pose from facial expression.
Quantitative metrics show that using Gated-VAE improves average
disentanglement, completeness and informativeness, as compared with un-gated
implementations. Qualitative assessment of latent traversals demonstrate its
disentanglement of head-pose from expression, even when only weak/noisy
supervision is available.

the Wasserstein distance between the standard normal distribution and the law

$(Y_n,\Lambda_n)$ are independent and that the difference between variance of
$X_n$ and $Y_n$ is smaller than the sum of variances of their perturbation

both labelled and unlabelled chemical structure data to improve predictive

two subsystems are identical, and 3) each subsystem is MIMO, but different

species has become the experimental measurement of choice -- when either the
materials are of limited volume, or so soft as to deform uncontrollably when
manipulated by traditional instruments. In a wide range of particle tracking
experiments, a ubiquitous finding is that the mean squared displacement (MSD)
of particle positions exhibits a power-law signature, the parameters of which
reveal valuable information about the viscous and elastic properties of various
biomaterials. However, MSD measurements are typically contaminated by complex
and interacting sources of instrumental noise. As these often affect the
high-frequency bandwidth to which MSD estimates are particularly sensitive,
inadequate error correction can lead to severe bias in power law estimation and
thereby, the inferred viscoelastic properties. In this article, we propose a
novel strategy to filter high-frequency noise from particle tracking
measurements. Our filters are shown theoretically to cover a broad spectrum of
high-frequency noises, and lead to a parametric estimator of MSD power-law
coefficients for which an efficient computational implementation is presented.
Based on numerous analyses of experimental and simulated data, results suggest
our methods perform very well compared to other denoising procedures.

showed an interesting chrysanthemum-like morphology assembled from numerous

cost at remote ends and the fronthaul rate in cloud radio access networks
(C-RAN). By harvesting renewable energy, remote radio units (RRUs) can save
grid power and be flexibly deployed. However, the randomness of energy arrival
poses a major design challenge. To maximize the throughput under the average
fronthaul rate constraint in C-RAN with renewable powered RRUs, we first study
the offline problem of selecting the optimal functional split modes and the
corresponding durations, jointly with the transmission power. We find that
between successive energy arrivals, at most two functional split modes should
be selected. Then the optimal online problem is formulated as an Markov
decision process (MDP). To deal with the curse of dimensionality of solving
MDP, we further analyze the special case with one instance of energy arrival
and two candidate functional split modes as inspired by the offline solution,
and then a heuristic online policy is proposed. Numerical results show that
with flexible functional split, the throughput can be significantly improved
compared with fixed functional split. Also, the proposed heuristic online
policy has similar performance with the optimal online one, as validated by
simulations.

real-time using a feed-forward network to learn the optimal combination of
style and content features from the respective images. The first aim of our

transfer formulation by combining the features of several style images. This
method successfully captures color information from the separate style images.
The other aim of our project was to improve the temporal style continuity from
frame to frame. Accordingly, we have experimented with the temporal stability
of the output images and discussed the various available techniques that could
be employed as alternatives.

multipole topological insulators (QMTIs) describe higher-order multipole
moments, lying in nested Wilson loops, which are inherently quantized by
lattice symmetries. Overlooked in the past, QMTIs reveal new types of gapped
boundaries, which themselves represent lower-dimensional topological phases and
host topologically protected zero-dimensional (0D) corner states. Inspired by
these pioneering theoretical predictions, tremendous efforts have been devoted
to the experimental observation of topological quantized quadrupole phase in a
variety of two dimensional (2D) metamaterials. However, due to stringent
requirements of anti-commuting reflection symmetries in crystals, it has been
challenging to achieve higher-order quantized multipole moments, such as
octupole moments, in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) structure. Here, we
overcome these challenges, and experimentally realize the acoustic analogue of
a quantized octupole topological insulator (QOTIs) using negatively coupled
resonators. We confirm by first-principle studies that our design possesses a
quantized octupole topological phase, and experimentally demonstrate
spectroscopic evidence of a topological hierarchy of states in our
metamaterial, observing 3rd order corner states, 2nd order hinge states and 1st
order surface states. Furthermore, we reveal topological phase transitions from
higher- to lower-order multipole moments in altered designs of acoustic TIs.

of patient records from large scale Electronic Health Records (EHR). While
simpler RNN models have been used for such problems, memory networks, which in
other domains were found to generalize well, are underutilized. Traditional
memory networks involve diffused and non-linear operations where influence of
past events on outputs are not readily quantifiable. We posit that this lack of
interpretability makes such networks not applicable for EHR analysis. While
networks with explicit memory have been proposed recently, the discontinuities
imposed by the discrete operations make such networks harder to train and
require more supervision. The problem is further exacerbated in the limited
data setting of EHR studies. In this paper, we propose a novel memory
architecture that is more interpretable than traditional memory networks while
being easier to train than explicit memory banks. Inspired by well-known models
of human cognition, we propose partitioning the external memory space into (a)
a primary explicit memory block to store exact replicas of recent events to
support interpretations, followed by (b) a secondary blurred memory block that
accumulates salient aspects of past events dropped from the explicit block as
higher level abstractions and allow training with less supervision by stabilize
the gradients. We apply the model for 3 learning problems on ICU records from
the MIMIC III database spanning millions of data points. Our model performs
comparably to the state-of the art while also, crucially, enabling ready

tension struts are required. On a de Sitter background, on the other hand, we
find processes describing the production of string/particle systems with no
negative energies involved. We also compute the probabilities of creating and
of breaking an infinite cosmic string in de Sitter space. We perform our
analysis of the system in de Sitter space employing a generalization of the
toroidal coordinate system to the three-sphere.

problem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into
the predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation
classes as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential
connection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this
connection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are
twofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression
style, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account
for this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with
entity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the
entity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it
can be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those
classes with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two
arguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction
(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that
dynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity
types and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can
simultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction
accuracy for long-tail classes. Through our experimental study, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it can achieve superior
performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

interaction model based on the use of the so-called Berggren basis, which
contains bound, resonant and scattering states, so that inter-nucleon
correlations are fully taken into account and the asymptotes of extended
many-body wave functions are precisely handled. However, large complex
symmetric matrices must be diagonalized in this framework, therefore the use of
very powerful parallel machines is needed therein. In order to fully take

partitioning scheme in the GSM framework will be described and illustrated with
numerical examples. It will then be shown that the introduction of this scheme

subsets (called blocks) of a point-set with $v$ points such that every two
blocks intersect each other in $\lambda$ points (and $\lambda < v$ is a fixed
number) and there are at least two block sizes. A design $\mathcal{D}$ is
called a symmetric design, if every point of $\mathcal{D}$ has the same
replication number (or equivalently, all the blocks have the same size) and
every two blocks intersect each other in $\lambda$ points. The only known
construction of a Ryser design is via block complementation of a symmetric
design. Such a Ryser design is called a Ryser design of Type-1. This is the
ground for the Ryser-Woodall conjecture: ""every Ryser design is of Type-1"".
This long standing conjecture has been shown to be valid in many situations.
  Let $\mathcal{D}$ denote a Ryser design of order $v$, index $\lambda$ and
replication numbers $r_1,r_2$. Let $e_i$ denote the number of points of
$\mathcal{D}$ with replication number $r_i$ (with $i = 1, 2$). Call a block $A$

An equivalence relation on the set of Ryser designs is established. Some
observations on the block complementation procedure of Ryser-Woodall are made.
It is shown that a Ryser design with two block sizes one of which is an average
block size is of Type-1. It is also shown that, under the assumption that large
and small blocks do not coexist in any Ryser design equivalent to a given Ryser
design, the given Ryser design must be of Type-1.

particular, a single perturbation known as the universal adversarial
perturbation (UAP) can foil most classification tasks conducted by DNNs. Thus,
different methods for generating UAPs are required to fully evaluate the
vulnerability of DNNs. A realistic evaluation would be with cases that consider
targeted attacks; wherein the generated UAP causes DNN to classify an input
into a specific class. However, the development of UAPs for targeted attacks
has largely fallen behind that of UAPs for non-targeted attacks. Therefore, we
propose a simple iterative method to generate UAPs for targeted attacks. Our
method combines the simple iterative method for generating non-targeted UAPs

but only moderately strong continuous thermal X-ray flux and mostly very
early-B spectral type. The X-ray flux has been suggested to originate from
matter accelerated via magnetic disk-star interaction, by a rapidly rotating
neutron star (NS) companion via the propeller effect, or by accretion onto a
white dwarf (WD) companion. In view of the growing number of identified
$\gamma$ Cas stars and the only imperfect matches between these suggestions and
the observations, alternative models should be pursued. Two of the three
best-observed $\gamma$ Cas stars, $\gamma$ Cas itself and $\pi$ Aqr, have a
low-mass companion with low optical flux; interferometry of BZ Cru is
inconclusive. Binary-evolution models are examined for their ability to produce
such systems. The OB+He-star stage of post-mass transfer binaries, which is
otherwise observationally unaccounted, can potentially reproduce many observed
properties of $\gamma$ Cas stars. The interaction of the fast wind of helium
stars with the disk and/or with the wind of Be stars may give rise to the
production of hard X-rays. While not modelling this process, it is shown that
the energy budget is favourable, and that the wind velocities may lead to hard
X-rays as observed in $\gamma$ Cas stars. Furthermore, their observed number
appears to be consistent with the evolutionary models. Within the Be+He-star
binary model, the Be stars in $\gamma$ Cas stars are conventional classical Be
stars. They are encompassed by O-star+Wolf-Rayet systems towards higher mass,
where no stable Be decretion disks exist, and by Be+sdO systems at lower mass
where the sdO winds may be too weak to cause the $\gamma$ Cas phenomenon. In
decreasing order of the helium-star mass, the descendants could be
Be+black-hole, Be+NS or Be+WD binaries.

closely related problem is automorphism detection, where an isomorphism between

and an automorphism is an isomorphism from a graph to itself. Applications of
graph isomorphism/automorphism include database indexing, network
simplification, network anonymization. By graph automorphism, we deal with
symmetric subgraph matching (SSM), which is to find all subgraphs that are
symmetric to a given subgraph in G. An application of SSM is to identify
multiple seed sets that have the same influence power as a seed set found by
influence maximization in a social network. To test two graphs for isomorphism,
canonical labeling has been studied to relabel a graph in such a way that
isomorphic graphs are identical after relabeling. Efficient canonical labeling
algorithms have been designed by individualization-refinement. They enumerate
all permutations using a search tree, and select the minimum as the canonical
labeling, which prunes candidates during enumeration. Despite high performance
in benchmark graphs, these algorithms face difficulties in handling massive
graphs. In this paper, we design a new efficient canonical labeling algorithm
DviCL. Different from previous algorithms, we take a divide-&-conquer approach
to partition G. By partitioning G, an AutoTree is constructed, which preserves
symmetric structures and the automorphism group of G. The canonical labeling
for a tree node can be obtained by the canonical labeling of its child nodes,
and the canonical labeling for the root is the one for G. Such AutoTree can
also be effectively used to answer the automorphism group, symmetric subgraphs.
We conducted extensive performance studies using 22 large graphs, and confirmed
that DviCL is much more efficient and robust than the state-of-the-art.

For coordination, we propose a locally asymptotically stable distributed
coverage controller for compact domains in the plane and homogeneous vehicles
modeled with second order dynamics with bounded input forces. This control
policy is based on artificial potentials designed to enforce desired
vehicle-domain and inter-vehicle separations, and can be applied to arbitrary
compact domains including non-convex ones. We prove, using Lyapunov theory,
that certain coverage configurations are locally asymptotically stable. For
safety, we utilize Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory to guarantee
pairwise collision avoidance. Rather than computing numerical solutions of the
associated HJ partial differential equation as is typically done, we derive an
analytical solution for our second-order vehicle model. This provides an exact,
global solution rather than an approximate, local one within some computational
domain. In addition to considerably reducing collision count, the collision
avoidance controller also reduces oscillatory behaviour of vehicles, helping
the system reach steady state faster. We demonstrate our approach in three
representative simulations involving a square domain, triangle domain, and a
non-convex moving domain.

the undetected sideband oscillations do not exceed 10 mmag. The absence of
sideband oscillations seems puzzling. We detected the orbital variability of
V1033 Cas with a period of 4.0243+/-0.0028 h and with a semi-amplitude of
55+/-4 mmag. The orbital variability semi-amplitude seems large and also
suggests that the system is noticeably inclined. Using our oscillation
ephemeris and the times of spin pulse maximum obtained in the past, we found
that the spin period is very stable. dP/dt is most probably less than -4 X
10^(-12). This contradicts the assumption that the white dwarf in V1033 Cas is
not spinning at equilibrium. Our spin period and our oscillation ephemeris can
be used for further investigations of the stability of the spin period in V1033
Cas.

many real-world interacting systems as generic agents, the nodes, connected by
pairwise edges. Yet, in many relevant cases, interactions are not pairwise but
involve larger sets of nodes, at a time. These systems are thus better
described in the framework of hypergraphs, whose hyperedges effectively account
for multi-body interactions. We hereby propose a new class of random walks
defined on such higher-order structures, and grounded on a microscopic physical
model where multi-body proximity is associated to highly probable exchanges
among agents belonging to the same hyperedge. We provide an analytical
characterisation of the process, deriving a general solution for the stationary
distribution of the walkers. The dynamics is ultimately driven by a generalised
random walk Laplace operator that reduces to the standard random walk Laplacian
when all the hyperedges have size 2 and are thus meant to describe pairwise
couplings. We illustrate our results on synthetic models for which we have a
full control of the high-order structures, and real-world networks where
higher-order interactions are at play. As a first application of the method, we
compare the behaviour of random walkers on hypergraphs to that of traditional
random walkers on the corresponding projected networks, drawing interesting
conclusions on node rankings in collaboration networks. As a second
application, we show how information derived from the random walk on
hypergraphs can be successfully used for classification tasks involving objects
with several features, each one represented by a hyperedge. Taken together, our
work contributes to unveiling the effect of higher-order interactions on
diffusive processes in higher-order networks, shading light on mechanisms at
the hearth of biased information spreading in complex networked systems.

lead to more and more analytics platforms and software systems being designed

the processing of continuous data streams from sensors, for example, IoT
devices or performance monitoring tools. In addition to analyzing pure sensor
data, analyses of data for groups of sensors often need to be performed as
well. Therefore, data streams of the individual sensors have to be continuously
aggregated to a data stream for a group. Motivated by a real-world application
scenario, we propose that such a stream aggregation approach has to allow for
aggregating sensors in hierarchical groups, support multiple such hierarchies
in parallel, provide reconfiguration at runtime, and preserve the scalability
and reliability qualities induced by applying stream processing techniques. We
propose a stream processing architecture fulfilling these requirements, which
can be integrated into existing big data architectures. We present a pilot
implementation of such an extended architecture and show how it is used in
industry. Furthermore, in experimental evaluations we show that our solution
scales linearly with the amount of sensors and provides adequate reliability in
the case of faults.

magnetic flux rope structures, which are inconspicuous because the observing

non-MC ICMEs should also be usually connected to the Sun on both ends. Then we
want to know whether the field lines of most non-MC ICMEs are still connected
to the sun at both ends or not. This study examined the counterstreaming
suprathermal electron (CSE) signatures of 266 ICMEs observed by the
\emph{Advanced Composition Explorer} (\emph{ACE}) spacecraft from 1998 to 2008
and compared the CSE signatures of MCs and non-MC ICMEs. Results show that only
10 of the 101 MC events ($9.9\%$ ) and 75 of the 171 non-MC events ($43.9\%$)
have no CSEs. Moreover, 21 of the non-MC ICMEs have high CSE percentages (more
than $70\%$) and show relatively stable magnetic field components with slight
rotations, which are in line with the expectations that spacecraft passes
through the flank of magnetic flux ropes. So the 21 events may be magnetic flux
ropes but the \emph{ACE} spacecraft passes through their flanks of magnetic
flux ropes. Considering that most other non-MC events have disordered magnetic
fields, we suggest that some non-MC ICMEs inherently have disordered magnetic
fields, namely have no magnetic flux rope structures.

provided for the presence of a second triple shock configuration along with a
shocklet between the reflected shock and the slipstream, which has no analogue

allows for the determination of the post-shock flow condition for a transient
propagating oblique shock. This model is applied to the numerical simulations

Accordingly, the formation of the triple point is initiated by the transient
motion of the reflected shock, which is induced by the convection of the vortex
ring. While the vortex ring embedded shock move essentially as a translating
strong oblique shock, the reflected shock is rotating towards its steady state
position. This results in a pressure discontinuity that must be resolved by the

future appearance, has received significant research attention in recent years.
Although great progress has been achieved with the success of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in synthesizing realistic images, most existing
GAN-based face aging methods have two main problems: 1) unnatural changes of
high-level semantic information (e.g. facial attributes) due to the
insufficient utilization of prior knowledge of input faces, and 2) distortions
of low-level image content including ghosting artifacts and modifications in
age-irrelevant regions. In this paper, we introduce A3GAN, an Attribute-Aware
Attentive face aging model to address the above issues. Facial attribute
vectors are regarded as the conditional information and embedded into both the
generator and discriminator, encouraging synthesized faces to be faithful to
attributes of corresponding inputs. To improve the visual fidelity of
generation results, we leverage the attention mechanism to restrict
modifications to age-related areas and preserve image details. Moreover, the
wavelet packet transform is employed to capture textural features at multiple
scales in the frequency space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in synthesizing photorealistic aged face images and
achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular face aging datasets.

  Virtualization (NFV)",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network softwarization is one of the major paradigm shifts in the next
generation of networks. It enables programmable and flexible management and
deployment of the network. Network function virtualization (NFV) is referred to
the deployment of software functions running on commodity servers instead of
traditional hardware-based middle-boxes. It is an example of network
softwarization. In NFV, a service is defined as a chain of software functions
named service chain function (SFC). The process of allocating the resources of
servers to the services, called service placement, is the most challenging
mission in NFV. Dynamic nature of the service arrivals and departures as well
as meeting the service level agreement make the service placement problem even
more challenging. In this paper, we propose a model for dynamic
reliability-aware service placement based on the simultaneous allocation of the
main and backup servers. Then, we formulate the dynamic reliability-aware
service placement as an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP), which
aims to minimize the placement cost and maximize the number of admitted
services. In the proposed MDP, the number of active services in the network is
considered to be the state of the system, and the state of the idle resources
is estimated based on it. Also, the number of possible admitted services is
considered as the action of the presented MDP. To evaluate each possible action
in the proposed MDP, we use a sub-optimal method based on the Viterbi algorithm
named Viterbi-based Reliable Static Service Placement (VRSSP) algorithm. We
determine the optimal policy based on value iteration method using an algorithm
named VRSSP-based Value Iteration (VVI) algorithm. Eventually, through the
extensive simulations, the superiority of the proposed model for dynamic
reliability-aware service placement compared to the static solutions is
inferred.

one dynamical regime to another. In the climate system, the atmospheric
boundary layer can experience sudden transitions between fully turbulent states
and quiescent, quasi-laminar states. Such rapid transitions are observed in
Polar regions or at night when the atmospheric boundary layer is stably
stratified, and they have important consequences in the strength of mixing with
the higher levels of the atmosphere. To analyze the stable boundary layer, many
approaches rely on the identification of regimes that are commonly denoted as
weakly and very stable regimes. Detecting transitions between the regimes is
crucial for modeling purposes. In this work a combination of methods from
dynamical systems and statistical modeling is applied to study these regime
transitions and to develop an early-warning signal that can be applied to
non-stationary field data. The presented metric aims at detecting nearing
transitions by statistically quantifying the deviation from the dynamics
expected when the system is close to a stable equilibrium. An idealized
stochastic model of near-surface inversions is used to evaluate the potential
of the metric as an indicator of regime transitions. In this stochastic system,
small-scale perturbations can be amplified due to the nonlinearity, resulting
in transitions between two possible equilibria of the temperature inversion.
The simulations show such noise-induced regime transitions, successfully
identified by the indicator. The indicator is further applied to time series
data from nocturnal and Polar meteorological measurements.

identify a rotational-symmetry protected TCI state in the transition-metal

TaAs$_2$ as an exemplar system, we show that its low-energy band structure
consists of two types of bulk nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) effects. Turning on the SOC opens a continuous bandgap in the energy
spectrum and drives the system into a $C_2T$-symmetry-protected TCI state. On
the (010) surface, we show the presence of rotational-symmetry-protected
nontrivial Dirac cone states within a local bulk energy gap of $\sim$ 300 meV.
Interestingly, the Dirac cones have tilted energy dispersion, realizing a
type-II Dirac fermion state in a topological crystalline insulator. Our results
thus indicate that the TaAs$_2$ materials family provides an ideal setting for
exploring the unique physics associated with type-II Dirac fermions in

However, by combining both theoretical arguments and 2D models, a recent study
has suggested that the vertical advection of potential temperature leads to an
adiabatic temperature profile in the deep atmosphere hotter than the profile
obtained with standard 1D models. Aims: In order to confirm the viability of
that scenario, we extend this investigation to three dimensional,
time-dependent, models. Methods: We use a 3D GCM, DYNAMICO to perform a series
of calculations designed to explore the formation and structure of the driving
atmospheric circulations, and detail how it responds to changes in both upper
and deep atmospheric forcing. Results: In agreement with the previous, 2D,
study, we find that a hot adiabat is the natural outcome of the long-term
evolution of the deep atmosphere. Integration times of order $1500$ years are
needed for that adiabat to emerge from an isothermal atmosphere, explaining why
it has not been found in previous hot Jupiter studies. Models initialised from
a hotter deep atmosphere tend to evolve faster toward the same final state. We
also find that the deep adiabat is stable against low-levels of deep heating
and cooling, as long as the Newtonian cooling time-scale is longer than $\sim
3000$ years at $200$ bar. Conclusions: We conclude that the steady-state
vertical advection of potential temperature by deep atmospheric circulations
constitutes a robust mechanism to explain hot Jupiter inflated radii. We
suggest that future studies of hot Jupiters are evolved for a longer time than
currently done, and, when possible, include models initialised with a hot deep
adiabat. We stress that this mechanism stems from the advection of entropy by
irradiation induced mass flows and does not require (finely tuned) dissipative
process, in contrast with most previously suggested scenarios.

severe bulk and surface charge recombination. This work describes that a
protonation-annealing treatment can effectively suppress both bulk and surface
charge recombination in hematite. Protons/electrons are electrochemically
incorporated into hematite under 0.2 VRHE followed by annealing at 120 oC. The
photocurrent density increases from ~0.9 mA cm-2 to 1.8 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE

stabilizing at round 2.4 mA cm-2. A cathodic shift of the onset potential of
photocurrent is also observed. H2O2 oxidation, impedance spectroscopy and
Mott-Schottky measurements show that the protonation suppresses bulk
recombination and enhances donor density, but introducing more surface
recombination. The annealing reduces surface recombination, while preserving
relatively high bulk charge separation efficiency. Different from previous
reports on the electrochemically reduced hematite, this work demonstrates that
the performance improvement should be ascribed to the proton incorporation
instead of the formation of Fe3O4 or metal Fe. This facile treatment by
protonation and annealing could be applied in other semiconductors to promote
the development of high performing photoelectrodes.

a system model while operating on the real environment. SiMBL is composed of
the following trainable components: a Lyapunov function, which determines a
safe set; a safe control policy; and a Bayesian RNN forward model. A min-max
control framework, based on alternate minimisation and backpropagation through
the forward model, is used for the offline computation of the controller and
the safe set. Safety is formally verified a-posteriori with a probabilistic
method that utilizes the Noise Contrastive Priors (NPC) idea to build a
Bayesian RNN forward model with an additive state uncertainty estimate which is
large outside the training data distribution. Iterative refinement of the model
and the safe set is achieved thanks to a novel loss that conditions the
uncertainty estimates of the new model to be close to the current one. The
learned safe set and model can also be used for safe exploration, i.e., to
collect data within the safe invariant set, for which a simple one-step MPC is
proposed. The single components are tested on the simulation of an inverted

adding more data can improve the model, the controller and the size of the safe

In other words, any two such strings are non-confusable in the sense that they
cannot produce the same string while evolving under tandem duplications of
length $ \leqslant\! 3 $. We demonstrate that this code is asymptotically
optimal in terms of rate, meaning that it represents the largest set of
non-confusable strings up to subexponential factors. This result settles the
zero-error capacity problem for the last remaining case of tandem-duplication
channels satisfying the ""root-uniqueness"" property.

photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated in cryogenic environments, especially liquid
argon (87 K) and liquid nitrogen (77 K). The goal is for one amplifier to read
out a total photosensitive surface of tens of cm$^2$ while retaining the
capability to resolve single photoelectron signals. Due to the large
capacitance of SiPMs, typically a few nF per cm$^2$, the main contributor to
noise is the series (voltage) component. A silicon-germanium heterojunction
bipolar transistor (HBT) was selected as the input device of the cryogenic
amplifier, followed by a fully differential operational amplifier, operated in
an unconventional feedback configuration. The input referred voltage noise of
the circuit at 77 K is just below 0.4 nV/$\surd$Hz white (above 100 kHz) and 1
nV/$\surd$Hz at 10 kHz. The value of the base spreading resistance of the HBT
at 77 K was determined from noise measurements at different bias currents.
Power consumption of the full circuit is about 2.5 mW. The design gives the
flexibility to optimally compensate the feedback loop for different values of
the input capacitance, and obtain a gain-bandwidth product in the GHz range.
The signal-to-noise ratio obtained in reading out SiPMs is discussed for the
case of a 300 kHz low pass filter and compared with the upper limit that would
derive from applying optimum filtering algorithms.

on the basis of ABIC is actually equivalent to estimating the relative
weighting factor between the variance of measurements and the prior variance
for geophysical inverse problems. We show that if the noise level of
measurements is unknown, ABIC tends to produce a substantially biased estimate
of the variance of measurements. In particular, since the prior mean is
generally unknown but arbitrarily treated as zero in geophysical inversion,
ABIC does not produce a reasonable estimate for the prior variance either.

using online closed-loop identification. The employed Gaussian process model
updates its training data only if the model uncertainty becomes too large. This
event-triggered online learning ensures high data efficiency and thereby
reduces the computational complexity, which is a major barrier for using
Gaussian processes under real-time constraints. We propose safe forgetting
strategies of data points to adhere to budget constraint and to further
increase data-efficiency. We show asymptotic stability for the tracking error

mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) has opened up new perspectives for
this family of sources, traditionally relying on CO2-laser pumping. A so far
open question concerning QCL-pumped THz molecular lasers (MLs) is related to
their spectral purity. Indeed, assessing their frequency/phase noise is crucial
for a number of applications potentially exploiting these sources as local
oscillators. Here this question is addressed by reporting the measurement of
the frequency noise power spectral density (PSD) of a THz ML pumped by a
10.3{\mu}m-wavelength QCL, and emitting 1mW at 1.1THz in continuous wave. This
is achieved by beating the ML frequency with the 1080th harmonic of the
repetition rate of a 1560nm frequency comb. We find a frequency noise PSD <
10Hz2/Hz (-95dBc/Hz) at 100kHz from the carrier. To demonstrate the effect of
the stability of the pump laser on the spectral purity of the THz emission we
also measure the frequency noise PSD of a CO2-laser-pumped 2.5THz ML, reaching
0.1Hz2/Hz (-105dBc/Hz) at 40kHz from the carrier, limited by the frequency
noise of the frequency comb harmonic. Finally, we show that it is possible to
actively phase-lock the QCL-pumped molecular laser to the frequency comb
repetition rate harmonic by controlling the QCL current, demonstrating a sub-Hz
linewidth.

weight-2 (or surface-like) motives via tensor operations. In the first part, we
study the Voevodsky motive of singular moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on
K3 and abelian surfaces as well as the Chow motive of their crepant
resolutions, when they exist. We show that these motives are in the tensor
subcategory generated by the motive of the surface, provided that a crepant
resolution exists. This extends a recent result of B\""ulles to the O'Grady-10
situation. In the non-commutative setting, similar results are proved for the
Chow motive of moduli spaces of stable objects of the K3 category of a cubic
fourfold. As a consequence, we provide abundant examples of hyper-K\""ahler
varieties of O'Grady-10 deformation type satisfying the standard conjectures.
In the second part, we study the Andr\'{e} motive of projective hyper-K\""ahler
varieties. We attach to any such variety its defect group, an algebraic group
which acts on the cohomology and measures the difference between the full
motive and its weight-2 part. When the second Betti number is not 3, we show
that the defect group is a natural complement of the Mumford--Tate group inside
the motivic Galois group, and that it is deformation invariant. We prove the
triviality of this group for all known examples of projective hyper-K\""ahler
varieties, so that in each case the full motive is controlled by its weight-2
part. As applications, we show that for any variety motivated by a product of
known hyper-K\""ahler varieties, all Hodge and Tate classes are motivated, the
motivated Mumford--Tate conjecture holds, and the Andr\'e motive is abelian.
This last point completes a recent work of Soldatenkov and provides a different
proof for some of his results.

freedom to locate both the experiment hall and the detectors, the future lepton
collider with an additional far detector may play a unique role in searching
for LLPs. In this study, we consider various locations and designs of far
detectors at future $e^- e^+$ colliders and investigate their potentials for
discovering LLPs in the physics scenarios including exotic Higgs decays, heavy

kinematical distinctions between the lepton and hadron colliders render the
optimal positions of far detectors lying at the direction perpendicular to the
collider beams at future $e^- e^+$ colliders, in contrast to the LHC where a
boost in the forward direction can be exploited. We also find that when
searching for LLPs, such new experiments with far detectors at future lepton
colliders may extend and complement the sensitivity reaches of the experiments
at the future lepton colliders with usual near detectors, and the present and
future experiments at the LHC. In particular, we find that, for the theory

modest improvement compared to the case with a near detector only at future

  The input to learning classification and regression models is a training
dataset defined by feature extraction queries over relational databases. The
mainstream approach to learning over relational data is to materialize the
training dataset, export it out of the database, and then learn over it using a
statistical package. This approach can be expensive as it requires the
materialization of the training dataset. An alternative approach is to cast the
machine learning problem as a database problem by transforming the
data-intensive component of the learning task into a batch of aggregates over
the feature extraction query and by computing this batch directly over the
input database.
  The tutorial highlights a variety of techniques developed by the database
theory and systems communities to improve the performance of the learning task.
They rely on structural properties of the relational data and of the feature
extraction query, including algebraic (semi-ring), combinatorial (hypertree
width), statistical (sampling), or geometric (distance) structure. They also
rely on factorized computation, code specialization, query compilation, and
parallelization.

continuum emission at a frequency of 87.6 GHz, achieving a spatial resolution
of 1300 au. Detecting 142 compact sources distributed over the whole observed
area, we then used machine learning algorithms to group the compact cores in
different clusters. A total of four main clusters were identified: NGC 6334-E,
NGC 6334-I, NGC 6334-I(N) and NGC 6334-I(NW). The typical separations between
cluster members (4000-12000 au) together with the core masses (0.2-100
$M_{\odot}$) are in agreement with turbulent fragmentation at scales of 0.1 pc.
We find that the CMFs (core mass functions) show an excess of massive cores
compared to the IMF. Typical uncertainties in temperature or unresolved
multiplicity may mimic the observed excess of massive cores. Evidence of mass
segregation in NGC 6334-I and NGC 6334-I(N), with the most massive cores
located closer to the center, was found. Correlations between the physical
properties of the clusters and their evolutionary stage were searched for, and
found to show a larger separation between cores in the more evolved clusters,
favouring the role of gas expulsion and stellar ejection over time. From these
results, we suggest that NGC 6334-I(N) was primordially segregated, while NGC
6334-I may have become mass-segregated over time due to dynamical effects.
Finally, the lack of massive cores in the most evolved cluster suggests that
the gas reservoir may be already exhausted, while the less evolved clusters
still have access to a larger gas mass reservoir. In general, the fragmentation
in NGC 6334 at large scales (about 1 pc) is governed by turbulent pressure,

based on the mysterious link between Fano varieties with cohomology of K3 type

evidence by establishing their existence for cubic fourfolds and K\""uchle
fourfolds of type c7. The main input in the cubic hypersurface case is the
Franchetta property for the square of the Fano variety of lines; this was
established in our earlier work in the fourfold case and is generalized here to

that varieties with ample canonical class and with cohomology of K3 type might
admit a multiplicative Chow-K\""unneth decomposition, by establishing this for
two families of Todorov surfaces.

the probability that $T$ falls outside this envelope in any of the $d$ points
is equal to $\alpha$. Global means that the probability is controlled
simultaneously for all the $d$ elements of the vectors. The global envelopes
can be employed for central regions of functional or multivariate data, for
graphical Monte Carlo and permutation tests where the test statistic is
multivariate or functional, and for global confidence and prediction bands.
Intrinsic graphical interpretation property is introduced for global envelopes.
The global envelopes included in the GET package have the property, which
particularly helps to interpret the test results, by having a graphical
interpretation that shows the reasons of rejection of the tested hypothesis.
Examples of different uses of global envelopes and their implementation in the
GET package are presented, including global envelopes for single and several

from the perspective of differential geometry, considering the dynamics of an
ideal fluid flow and magnetic field on a general three-dimensional manifold,
equipped with a metric and an induced volume form. The benefit of this level of
abstraction is that it clarifies basic aspects of fluid dynamics such as how
certain quantities are transported, how they transform under the action of
mappings (for example the flow map between Lagrangian labels and Eulerian
positions), how conservation laws arise, and the origin of certain
approximations that preserve the mathematical structure of classical mechanics.
First, the governing equations for ideal MHD are derived in a general setting
by means of an action principle, and making use of Lie derivatives. The way in
which these equations transform under a pull back, by the map taking the
position of a fluid parcel to a background location, is detailed. This is then
used to parameterise Alfv\'en waves using concepts of pseudomomentum and
pseudofield, in parallel with the development of Generalised Lagrangian Mean
theory in hydrodynamics. Finally non-ideal MHD is considered with a sketch of
the development of the Braginsky $\alpha\omega$-dynamo in a general setting.
Expressions for the $\alpha$-tensor are obtained, including a novel geometric
formulation in terms of connection coefficients, and related to formulae found

as novel alternatives to ionic liquids that are extensively used in synthesis
of innovative materials, metal processing, catalysis, etc. However, their usage
is limited, primarily because of the large viscosity and poor conductivity.
Therefore, an understanding of the molecular origin of these properties is
essential to improve their industrial applicability. Here, we present the
report of the nanoscopic diffusion mechanism of acetamide in a DES synthesized
with lithium perchlorate as studied using neutron scattering and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation techniques. Although, the acetamide based DES (ADES)
has remarkably lower freezing point compared to pure acetamide, the molecular
mobility is found to be enormously restricted in the former. MD simulation
indicates a diffusion model with two distinct processes, corresponding to, long
range jump diffusion and localised diffusion within a restricted volume. This
model is validated by analysis of neutron scattering data in both molten
acetamide and ADES. The long range diffusion process of acetamide is slower by
a factor of three in ADES in comparison with molten acetamide. MD simulation
reveals that the long range diffusion in ADES is restricted mainly due to the
formation of hydrogen bond mediated complexes between the ionic species of the
salt and acetamide molecules. Hence, the origin of higher viscosity observed in
ADES can be attributed to the complexation. The complex formation also explains
the inhibition of the crystallisation process while cooling and thereby results
in depression of the freezing point of ADES.

with a liquid is surrounded by a stable vapour layer, drastically reducing the

flow. To elucidate the physical mechanisms that control separation, here we
report a numerical study of the boundary-layer equations describing the
liquid-vapour flow around a solid sphere whose surface temperature is above the
Leidenfrost point. Our analysis reveals that the dynamics of the thin layer of
vaporised liquid controls the downstream evolution of the flow, which cannot be
properly described substituting the vapour layer by an effective slip length.
In particular, the dominant mechanism responsible for the separation of the
flow is the onset of vapour recirculation caused by the adverse pressure
gradient in the rearward half of the sphere, leading to an explosive growth of
the vapour-layer thickness due to the accumulation of vapour mass. Buoyancy
forces are shown to have an important effect on the onset of recirculation, and
thus on the separation angle. Our results compare favourably with previous

  https://git.io/JeovA",,,,"cs.CV cs.CG cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a novel deep method to reconstruct a point cloud of
an object from a single still image. Prior arts in the field struggle to
reconstruct an accurate and scalable 3D model due to either the inefficient and
expensive 3D representations, the dependency between the output and number of
model parameters or the lack of a suitable computing operation. We propose to
overcome these by deforming a random point cloud to the object shape through
two steps: feature blending and deformation. In the first step, the global and
point-specific shape features extracted from a 2D object image are blended with
the encoded feature of a randomly generated point cloud, and then this mixture
is sent to the deformation step to produce the final representative point set
of the object. In the deformation process, we introduce a new layer termed as
GraphX that considers the inter-relationship between points like common graph
convolutions but operates on unordered sets. Moreover, with a simple trick, the
proposed model can generate an arbitrary-sized point cloud, which is the first
deep method to do so. Extensive experiments verify that we outperform existing
models and halve the state-of-the-art distance score in single image 3D
reconstruction.

rates and strong thermal forcing have shown a significant discrepancy in total
heat transport between experiments on a confined cylindrical domain on the one
hand and simulations on a laterally unconfined periodic domain on the other.
This paper addresses this discrepancy using direct numerical simulations on a
cylindrical domain. An analysis of the flow field reveals a region of enhanced
convection near the wall, the sidewall circulation. The sidewall circulation
rotates slowly within the cylinder in anticyclonic direction. It has a
convoluted structure, illustrated by mean flow fields in horizontal
cross-sections of the flow where instantaneous snapshots are compensated for
the orientation of the sidewall circulation before averaging. Through separate
analysis of the sidewall region and the inner bulk flow, we find that for
higher values of the thermal forcing the heat transport in the inner part of
the cylindrical domain, outside the sidewall circulation region, coincides with
the heat transport on the unconfined periodic domain. Thus the sidewall
circulation accounts for the differences in heat transfer between the two
considered domains, while in the bulk the turbulent heat flux is the same as
that of a laterally unbounded periodic domain. Therefore, experiments, with
their inherent confinement, can still provide turbulence akin to the unbounded
domains of simulations, and at more extreme values of the governing parameters
for thermal forcing and rotation. We also provide experimental evidence for the
existence of the sidewall circulation that is in close agreement with the
simulation results.

radiation, are found inside HII regions. Understanding the nature and origin of
these structures through a kinematic study of the molecular gas is useful to
advance in our knowledge of the interplay between radiation and molecular gas.
Using ASTE we carried out molecular observations towards two cometary globules
(Sim129 and Sim130) in the HII region Sh2-236. We mapped two regions with the
12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 lines. Additionally, two single pointings of C2H
(N=4-3), HNC and HCN J=4-3 were observed. We combined our observations with
public infrared and optical data to analyse the distribution and kinematics of
the gas. We found kinematic signatures of infalling gas in the 12CO J=3-2 and
C2H J=4-3 spectra towards Sim129 . We detected HCO+, HCN, and HNC J=4-3 only
towards Sim130. The HCN/HNC integrated ratio of about 3 found in Sim130
suggests that the possible star formation activity within the globule has not
yet ionized the gas. The location of NVSS 052255+33315, which peaks towards the
brightest border of the globule, supports this scenario. The non-detection of
these molecules towards Sim129 could be due to the radiation arising from the
star formation activity inside this globule. The ubiquitous presence of the C2H
molecule towards both globules shows the action of nearby O-B stars irradiating
their external layers. Based on mid-infrared emission, we identified two new
structures: a region of diffuse emission (R1) located, in projection, in front
of the head of Sim129, and a pillar-like feature (P1) placed besides Sim130.
Based on 12CO J=3-2, we found molecular gas associated with Sim129, Sim130, R1
and P1 at radial velocities of -1.5, -11, +10, and +4 km/s, respectively.
Therefore, while Sim129 and P1 are located at the far side of the shell, Sim130
is placed at the near side, consistent with earlier results.

pose a problem of weak labels, since only a tiny fraction of the image is

highly similar to the non-disease class. The aim of this study is to evaluate
whether it is possible to detect basal cell carcinomas in histological sections

widths well below the Fermi wavelength of graphene charge carriers, is vital to
study and exploit these electronic systems for electron-optical applications.
The achievement of such junctions is, however, not trivial due to the presence
of a considerable out-of-plane electric field in lateral p-n junctions,
resulting in large widths. Metal-graphene interfaces represent a novel,
promising and easy to implement technique to engineer such sharp lateral p-n
junctions in graphene field-effect devices, in clear contrast to the much wider
(i.e. smooth) junctions achieved via conventional local gating. In this work,
we present a systematic and robust investigation of the electrostatic problem
of metal-induced lateral p-n junctions in gated graphene devices for
electron-optics applications, systems where the width of the created junctions
is not only determined by the metal used but also depends on external factors
such as device geometries, dielectric environment and different operational
parameters such as carrier density and temperature. Our calculations
demonstrate that sharp junctions can be achieved via metal-graphene interfaces
at room temperature in devices surrounded by dielectric media with low relative
permittivity. In addition, we show how specific details such as the separation
distance between metal and graphene and the permittivity of the gap in-between
plays a critical role when defining the p-n junction, not only defining its
width w but also the energy shift of graphene underneath the metal. These
results can be extended to any two-dimensional (2D) electronic system doped by
the presence of metal clusters and thus are relevant for understanding
interfaces between metals and other 2D materials.

image captured through a glass surface, which is an ill-posed, challenging but
practically important problem for photo enhancement. Inspired by iterative
structure reduction for hidden community detection in social networks, we
propose an Iterative Boost Convolutional LSTM Network (IBCLN) that enables
cascaded prediction for reflection removal. IBCLN is a cascaded network that
iteratively refines the estimates of transmission and reflection layers in a
manner that they can boost the prediction quality to each other, and
information across steps of the cascade is transferred using an LSTM. The
intuition is that the transmission is the strong, dominant structure while the
reflection is the weak, hidden structure. They are complementary to each other
in a single image and thus a better estimate and reduction on one side from the
original image leads to a more accurate estimate on the other side. To

projections on a Hilbert space H that preserve transition probabilities are
induced by either a unitary or an anti-unitary operator on H (which is uniquely
determined up to a phase). Since elements of P_1(H) define pure states on the
C*-algebra B(H) of all bounded operators on H (though typically not producing
all of them), this suggests possible generalizations to arbitrary C*-algebras.
This paper is a detailed study of this problem, based on earlier results by
R.V. Kadison (1965), F.W. Shultz (1982), K. Thomsen (1982), and others. Perhaps
surprisingly, the sharpest known version of Wigner's Theorem for C*-algebras
(which is a variation on a result from Shultz, with considerably simplified
proof) generalizes the equivalence between the hypotheses in the original
theorem and those in an analogous result on (anti) unitary implementability of
Jordan automorphisms of B(H), and does not yield (anti) unitary
implementability itself, far from it: abstract existence results that do give
such implementability seem arbitrary and practically useless. As such, it would
be fair to say that there is no Wigner Theorem for C*-algebras.

full-disk chromosphere observation, algorithms have been developed to
standardize the full-disk images. The algorithms include the determination of
the center of the image and size standardization, geometric correction and
intensity normalization. The solar limb of each image is determined from a
histogram analysis of its intensity distribution. The center and radius are
then calculated and the image is corrected for geometric distortions. Images
are re-scaled to have a fixed radius of 500 pixels and centered within the
1024$\times$1024 frame. Finally, large-scale variations in intensity, such as
limb-darkening, are removed using a median filter. This paper provides a
detailed description of these algorithms, and a summary of the properties of
these chromosheric full-disk observations to be used for further scientific

We aim to improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms behind
the slower than free-fall motion and the two-stage evolution (an initial phase
of acceleration followed by an almost constant velocity phase) detected in
coronal rain events.
  Methods. Using the Mancha3D code, we solve the 2D ideal MHD equations. We
represent the solar corona as an isothermal vertically stratified atmosphere
with a uniform vertical magnetic field and the plasma condensation as a density
enhancement described by a 2D Gaussian profile. We analyse the temporal
evolution of the descending plasma and study its dependence on parameters such
as density and magnetic field strength.
  Results. We confirm previous findings that the pressure gradient is the main
force that opposes the action of gravity and slows down the blob descent and
that larger densities require larger pressure gradients to reach the constant
speed phase. We find that the shape of a condensation with a horizontal
variation of density is distorted as it falls, due to the denser parts of the
blob falling faster than the lighter ones. This is explained by the fact that
the duration of the initial acceleration phase, and therefore the maximum
falling speed attained by the plasma, increases with the ratio of blob to
coronal density. We also find that the magnetic field plays a fundamental role
in the evolution of the descending condensations. A strong enough magnetic
field (greater than 10 G in our simulations) forces each plasma element to
follow the path given by a particular field line, which allows to describe the
evolution of each vertical slice of the blob in terms of 1D dynamics, without
influence of the adjacent slices. In addition, under the typical conditions of
the coronal rain events, the magnetic field prevents the development of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

by Rezk that characterizes those Segal spaces which are
$(\infty,1)$-categories. In this paper, first, we make rigorous an analogy
between univalence and completeness that has found various informal expressions
in the higher categorical research community to date, and second, study its

  The core aspect of this analogy can be understood as a translation between
internal and external notions, motivated by model categorical considerations of
Joyal and Tierney. As a result, we characterize the internal notion of
univalence in logical model categories by the external notion of completeness
defined as the right Quillen condition of suitably indexed Set-weighted limit
functors.
  Furthermore, we extend the analogy and show that univalent completion in the
sense of van den Berg and Moerdijk translates to Rezk-completion of associated
Segal objects as well. Motivated by these correspondences, we exhibit
univalence as a homotopical locality condition whenever univalent completion
exists.

competitive results on general text generation, they are extended for category

structures and learning strategies limit their performance and exacerbate the
training instability. This paper proposes a category-aware GAN (CatGAN) which
consists of an efficient category-aware model for category text generation and
a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm for training our model. The
category-aware model directly measures the gap between real samples and
generated samples on each category, then reducing this gap will guide the model
to generate high-quality category samples. The Gumbel-Softmax relaxation
further frees our model from complicated learning strategies for updating
CatGAN on discrete data. Moreover, only focusing on the sample quality normally
leads the mode collapse problem, thus a hierarchical evolutionary learning
algorithm is introduced to stabilize the training procedure and obtain the
trade-off between quality and diversity while training CatGAN. Experimental
results demonstrate that CatGAN outperforms most of the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

field, irrespective of the type of wind, has a stabilizing effect. This is also
true when there is no wind. In this case, we confirm the other works already
presented in the literature. However, our main objective is to investigate the
local thermal stability of the disk in the presence of the wind. In this case,
interestingly, the response of disk is directly related to the type of wind. In
other words, in some cases, the wind can stabilize the disk. On the other hand,
in some cases, it can destabilize the disk. We found that in some thin disk
models where the magnetic pressure cannot explain the stability of the disk by
including a typical contribution for magnetic pressure, the wind can provide a
viable explanation for the thermal stability.

  Model Reveals Regeneration as an Epiphenomenon of Development",,,,,"q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Development combines three basic processes asymmetric --- cell division,
signaling and gene regulation --- in a multitude of ways to create an
overwhelming diversity of multicellular life-forms. Here, we attempt to chart
this diversity using a generative model. We sample millions of biologically
feasible developmental schemes, allowing us to comment on the statistical
properties of cell-differentiation trajectories they produce. Our results
indicate that, in contrast to common views, cell-type lineage graphs are
unlikely to be tree-like. Instead, they are more likely to be directed acyclic
graphs, with multiple lineages converging on the same terminal cell-type.
Additionally, in line with the hypothesis that whole body regeneration is an
epiphenomenon of development, a majority of the `organism' generated by our
model can regenerate using pluripotent cells. The generative framework is
modular and flexible, and can be adapted to test additional hypotheses about
general features of development.

remarkable generation performance especially in image synthesis. Unfortunately,
they are also known for having an unstable training process and might loose
parts of the data distribution for heterogeneous input data. In this paper, we
propose a novel GAN extension for multi-modal distribution learning (MMGAN). In
our approach, we model the latent space as a Gaussian mixture model with a
number of clusters referring to the number of disconnected data manifolds in
the observation space, and include a clustering network, which relates each
data manifold to one Gaussian cluster. Thus, the training gets more stable.
Moreover, MMGAN allows for clustering real data according to the learned data
manifold in the latent space. By a series of benchmark experiments, we
illustrate that MMGAN outperforms competitive state-of-the-art models in terms
of clustering performance.

  Programs",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For most relevant computation, the energy and time needed for data movement
dominates that for performing arithmetic operations on all computing systems
today. Hence it is of critical importance to understand the minimal total data
movement achievable during the execution of an algorithm. The achieved total
data movement for different schedules of an algorithm can vary widely depending
on how efficiently the cache is used, e.g., untiled versus effectively tiled
matrix-matrix multiplication. A significant current challenge is that no
existing tool is able to meaningfully quantify the potential reduction to the
data movement of a computation that can be achieved by more effective use of
the cache through operation rescheduling. Asymptotic parametric expressions of
data movement lower bounds have previously been manually derived for a limited
number of algorithms, often without scaling constants. In this paper, we
present the first compile-time approach for deriving non-asymptotic parametric
expressions of data movement lower bounds for arbitrary affine computations.
The approach has been implemented in a fully automatic tool (IOLB) that can
generate these lower bounds for input affine programs.
  IOLB's use is demonstrated by exercising it on all the benchmarks of the
PolyBench suite. The advantages of IOLB are many: (1) IOLB enables us to derive
bounds for few dozens of algorithms for which these lower bounds have never
been derived. This reflects an increase of productivity by automation. (2)
Anyone is able to obtain these lower bounds through IOLB, no expertise is
required. (3) For some of the most well-studied algorithms, the lower bounds
obtained by \tool are higher than any previously reported manually derived
lower bounds.

network want to cooperatively minimize the sum of quadratic cost functions. We
show that the gradient tracking distributed algorithm for the investigated
program can be viewed as a sparse closed-loop linear system in which the
dynamic state-feedback controller includes consensus matrices and optimization
(stepsize) parameters. The closed-loop system turns out to be not completely
reachable and asymptotic stability can be shown restricted to a proper
invariant set. Convergence to the global minimum, in turn, can be obtained only
by means of a proper initialization. The proposed system interpretation of the
distributed algorithm provides also additional insights on other structural
properties and possible design choices that are discussed in the last part of
the paper as a starting point for future developments.

\int_0^{t_f} x^n(t)\, dt$, where $x(t)$ is a Brownian motion (with or without
drift) with diffusion constant $D$, starting at $x_0>0$, and $t_f$ is the
first-passage time to the origin. In the driftless case, we compute exactly,
for all $n>-2$, the probability density
$P_n(A|x_0)=\text{Prob}.(\mathcal{A}=A)$. This probability density has an
essential singular tail as $A\to 0$ and a power-law tail $\sim
A^{-(n+3)/(n+2)}$ as $A\to \infty$. The former is reproduced by the optimal
fluctuation method (OFM), which also predicts the optimal paths of the
conditioned process for small $A$. For the case with a drift toward the origin,
where no exact solution is known for general $n>-1$, the OFM predicts the
distribution tails. For $A\to 0$ it predicts the same essential singular tail
as in the driftless case. For $A\to \infty$ it predicts a stretched exponential
tail $-\ln P_n(A|x_0)\sim A^{1/(n+1)}$ for all $n>0$. In the limit of large
P\'eclet number $\text{Pe}= \mu x_0/(2D)\gg 1$, where $\mu$ is the drift
velocity, the OFM predicts a large-deviation scaling for all $A$: $-\ln
P_n(A|x_0)\simeq\text{Pe}\, \Phi_n\left(z= A/\bar{A}\right)$, where
$\bar{A}=x_0^{n+1}/{\mu(n+1)}$ is the mean value of $\mathcal{A}$. We compute
the rate function $\Phi_n(z)$ analytically for all $n>-1$. For $n>0$
$\Phi_n(z)$ is analytic for all $z$, but for $-1<n<0$ it is non-analytic at
$z=1$, implying a dynamical phase transition. The order of this transition is
$2$ for $-1/2<n<0$, while for $-1<n<-1/2$ the order of transition changes
continuously with $n$. Finally, we apply the OFM to the case of $\mu<0$ (drift
away from the origin). We show that, when the process is conditioned on
reaching the origin, the distribution of $\mathcal{A}$ coincides with the
distribution of $\mathcal{A}$ for $\mu>0$ with the same $|\mu|$.

the literature are then shown to be special instances. We implemented the
criteria to join the cycles generated by a number of simple feedback shift
registers (FSRs) of order $n$. These include the pure cycling register (PCR)
and the pure summing register (PSR). For the PCR, we define a transitive
relation on its cycles, based on their weights. We also extend the choices of
conjugate states by using shift operations. For the PSR, we define three
distinct transitive relations on its cycles, namely a run order, a necklace
order, and a mixed order. Using the new orders, we propose numerous classes of
successor rules. Each class efficiently generates a number, exponential in $n$,
of binary de Bruijn sequences. Producing the next bit in each such sequence
takes $O(n)$ memory and $O(n)$ time. We implemented computational routines to
confirm the claims.

  for Emulating Physical Systems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were initially proposed to generate
images by learning from a large number of samples. Recently, GANs have been
used to emulate complex physical systems such as turbulent flows. However, a
critical question must be answered before GANs can be considered trusted
emulators for physical systems: do GANs-generated samples conform to the
various physical constraints? These include both deterministic constraints
(e.g., conservation laws) and statistical constraints (e.g., energy spectrum of
turbulent flows). The latter have been studied in a companion paper (Wu et al.,
Enforcing statistical constraints in generative adversarial networks for
modeling chaotic dynamical systems. Journal of Computational Physics. 406,
109209, 2020). In the present work, we enforce deterministic yet imprecise
constraints on GANs by incorporating them into the loss function of the
generator. We evaluate the performance of physics-constrained GANs on two
representative tasks with geometrical constraints (generating points on
circles) and differential constraints (generating divergence-free flow velocity
fields), respectively. In both cases, the constrained GANs produced samples
that conform to the underlying constraints rather accurately, even though the
constraints are only enforced up to a specified interval. More importantly, the
imposed constraints significantly accelerate the convergence and improve the
robustness in the training, indicating that they serve as a physics-based
regularization. These improvements are noteworthy, as the convergence and
robustness are two well-known obstacles in the training of GANs.

training data is a fundamental challenge of extending digital assistants like
Alexa and Siri to a new language. A common approach that is adapted in digital
assistants when responding to a user query is to process the input in a
pipeline manner where the first task is to predict the domain, followed by the
inference of intent and slots. However, this cascaded approach instigates error
propagation and prevents information sharing among these tasks. Further, the
use of words as the atomic units of meaning as done in many studies might lead
to coverage problems for morphologically rich languages such as German and
French when data is limited. We address these issues by introducing a
character-level unified neural architecture for joint modeling of the domain,
intent, and slot classification. We compose word-embeddings from characters and
jointly optimize all classification tasks via multi-task learning. In our
results, we show that the proposed architecture is an optimal choice for
bootstrapping NLU systems in low-resource settings thus saving time, cost and
human effort.

extremal index, a number in the unit interval, is a key parameter in modelling
the clustering of extremes. While studying the extremal index, a local
dependence condition referred to as $D^{(d)}(u_n)$ condition, is often assumed.
In this paper, we develop a hypothesis test for $D^{(d)}(u_n)$ condition based
on asymptotic results. Further we construct an estimator of the extremal index
making use of the inference procedure on $D^{(d)}(u_n)$ condition and we prove
this estimator is asymptotically normal. The finite sample performances of the
hypothesis test and the estimation are examined in a simulation study, where we
consider models fulfilling $D^{(d)}(u_n)$ condition as well as models that
violate the condition. In a simple case study, our statistical procedure shows
that daily temperature in summer shares a common clustering structure of
extreme values based on the data observed in three weather stations in the

classical particles in one dimension at thermal equilibrium. The particles are
confined by an arbitrary external potential, $V_\text{ex} (x)$, and repel each
other via a class of pairwise interaction potentials $V_\text{int}(r)$ (where
$r$ is distance between a pair of particles) such that $ V_\text{int} \sim
|r|^{-k}$ when $r \to 0$. We consider the case where every particle is
interacting with $d$ (finite range parameter) number of particles to its left
and right. Due to the intricate interplay between external confinement,
pairwise repulsion and entropy, the density exhibits markedly distinct behavior
in three regimes $k>0$, $k \to 0$ and $k<0$. From this field theory, we compute
analytically the average density profile for large $N$ in these regimes. We
show that the contribution from interaction dominates the collective behaviour
for $k > 0$ and the entropy contribution dominates for $k<0$, and both
contributes equivalently in the $k\to 0$ limit (finite range log-gas). Given
the fact that these family of systems are of broad relevance, our analytical
findings are of paramount importance. These results are in excellent agreement
with brute-force Monte-Carlo simulations.

shows a broad range of values, the origin of which remains unknown. One key
question is whether these isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen predate the comet
formation stage or are posterior to it. Another central question is elucidating
the processes that can produce the observed variations in the 14N/15N isotopic
ratio. Disks that orbit pre-main-sequence stars provide unique opportunities
for observing the chemical content of analogs of the protosolar nebula and
therefore for building a comprehensive scenario for the origin of nitrogen in
the Solar System and in planet-forming disks. We present spectrally and
spatially resolved observations of the hyperfine structure of the 4-3
rotational transition of HCN and its main isotopologs H13CN and HC15N in the
disk orbiting the 8 Myr old TTauri star TW Hya. The spatially averaged
HCN/H13CN and HCN/HC15N abundance ratios are 86+/-4 and 223+/-21, respectively.
The latter value is significantly lower than the CN:C15N ratio 323+/-30 in this
disk and thus provides the first evidence that two isotopic reservoirs of
nitrogen are present in a disk at the stage of giant planet and comet
formation. Furthermore, we find clear evidence for an increase in the ratio of
HCN to HC15N with radius. The ratio in the outer disk is 339+/-28, in excellent
agreement with direct measurements in the local interstellar medium, and with
the bulk nitrogen isotopic ratio predicted from galactic evolution
calculations. In the comet formation region at r=20 au, the ratio is a factor
~3 lower, 121+/-11. This radial increase qualitatively agrees with the scenario
in which selective photodissociation of N 2 is the dominant fractionation
process. However, our isotopic ratios and kinetic temperature of the
HCN-emitting layers quantitatively disagree with models of nitrogen chemistry
in disks.

associated with a double-wave modulation and the low mass ratio. The inferred

Manual inspection of raw data - of representative samples, of outliers, of

in the data, b) generating new modeling hypotheses, and c) assigning or
refining human-provided labels. However, manual data inspection is problematic
for privacy sensitive datasets, such as those representing the behavior of

the increasingly important setting of federated learning, where raw examples

as metrics or model parameters. This paper demonstrates that generative models
- trained using federated methods and with formal differential privacy
guarantees - can be used effectively to debug many commonly occurring data

exhibit extremely energetic synchrotron emission. They also feature non-thermal
gamma-ray emission whose peak lies in the very high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV)
range, and in some sources exceeds 1TeV: this is the case of hard-TeV EHBLs
such as 1ES 0229+200. With the aim of increasing the EHBL population, ten
targets were observed with the MAGIC telescopes from 2010 to 2017, for a total
of 262 h of good quality data. The data were complemented by coordinated Swift
observations. The X-ray data analysis confirms that all the sources but two are
EHBLs. The sources show only a modest variability and a harder-when-brighter
behavior, typical for this class of objects. At VHE gamma rays, three new
sources were detected and a hint of signal was found for another new source. In
each case the intrinsic spectrum is compatible with the hypothesis of a
hard-TeV nature of these EHBLs. The broadband spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of all sources are built and modeled in the framework of a single-zone
purely leptonic model. The VHE gamma-ray detected sources were also interpreted
with a spine-layer and a proton synchrotron models. The three models provide a
good description of the SEDs. However, the resulting parameters differ
substantially in the three scenarios, in particular the magnetization
parameter. This work presents a first mini-catalog of VHE gamma-ray and
multi-wavelength observations of EHBLs.

domain of interest and a reservoir of non-interacting, ideal gas, particles. An
external potential, applied only in the interfacial region, balances the excess
chemical potential of the system. To ensure that the size of the reservoir is
infinite, we introduce a particle insertion/deletion algorithm to control the
density in the ideal gas region. We show that it is possible to study
non-equilibrium phenomena with this open-boundary molecular dynamics method. To
this aim, we consider a prototypical confined liquid under the influence of an
external constant density gradient. The resulting pressure-driven flow across
the atomistic system exhibits a velocity profile consistent with the
corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. In contrast to available
computational methods in which external forces drive the system far from
equilibrium, this approach conserves momentum and closely resembles
experimental conditions. The presented method can be used to study various
direct and indirect out-of-equilibrium conditions in complex molecular systems.

fields that are latent in the model describing some observable fields.
  For instance, an inverse problem of interest is inferring the Reynolds stress
field in the Navier--Stokes equations describing mean fluid velocity and
pressure.
  The physical nature of the latent fields means they have their own set of
physical constraints, including boundary conditions.
  The inherent ill-posedness of inverse problems, however, means that there
exist many possible latent fields that do not satisfy their physical
constraints while still resulting in a satisfactory agreement in the
observation space.
  These physical constraints must therefore be enforced through the problem
formulation.
  So far there has been no general approach to enforce boundary conditions on
latent fields in inverse problems in computational mechanics, with these
constraints often simply ignored.
  In this work we demonstrate how to enforce boundary conditions in Bayesian
inversion problems by choice of the statistical model for the latent fields.
  Specifically, this is done by modifying the covariance kernel to guarantee
that all realizations satisfy known values or derivatives at the boundary.
  As a test case the problem of inferring the eddy viscosity in the
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations is considered.
  The results show that enforcing these constraints results in similar
improvements in the output fields but with latent fields that behave as
expected at the boundaries.

recently and various, partially non-compatible, criteria have been proposed.
The fairness criteria can be enforced for a given classifier or, alternatively,
the data can be adapated to ensure that every classifier trained on the data

method based on quantile preservation in causal structural equation models. The
data adaptation is based on a presumed counterfactual model for the data. While
the counterfactual model itself cannot be verified experimentally, we show that
certain population notions of fairness are still guaranteed even if the

non-causal fairness notion (such as demographic parity, separation or

proteins. There are two common forms of pressure dependent potentials of mean
force (PMFs) derived from hydrophobic molecules available for the coarse
grained molecular simulations of protein folding and unfolding under
hydrostatic pressure. Although both PMF includes a desolvation barrier
separating the well of a direct contact and the well of a solvent mediated
contact, how these features vary with hydrostatic pressure is still debated.
There is a need of a systematic comparison of these two PMFs on a protein. We
investigated the two different pressure dependencies on the desolvation
potential in a structure based protein model using coarse grained molecular
simulations. We compared them to the known behavior a real protein based on
experimental evidence. We showed that the protein s folding transition curve on
the pressure temperature phase diagram depends on the relationship between the
potential well minima and pressure. For protein that reduces the total volume
under pressure, it is essential for the PMF to carry the feature that the
direct contact well is essential less stable than the water mediated contact
well at high pressure. We also comment on the practicality and importance of
structure based minimalist models for understanding the phenomenological

problems arise with the stability of fluctuations. These difficulties can be
overcome by an especially simple implementation of the no-boundary idea: namely
to take the Einstein-Hilbert action at face value while adding no boundary
term. This prescription simultaneously imposes an initial Neumann boundary
condition for the scale factor of the universe and, for a Bianchi IX spacetime,
Dirichlet conditions for the anisotropies. Another way to implement the
no-boundary wavefunction is to use Robin boundary conditions. A sub-class of
Robin conditions allows one to specify the Hubble rate on the boundary
hypersurface, and we highlight the surprising aspect that specifying the final
Hubble rate (rather than the final size of the universe) significantly alters
the off-shell structure of the path integral. The conclusion of our
investigations is that all current working examples of the no-boundary
wavefunction force one to abandon the notion of a sum over compact and regular
geometries, and point to the importance of an initial Euclidean momentum.

seasonality difficult. Our interest in this paper is to study the applicability
of the popular deep neural networks (DNN) as function approximators for
non-stationary TSF. We evaluate the following DNN models: Multi-layer
Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and RNN with Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM-RNN) and RNN with Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU-RNN). These DNN
methods have been evaluated over 10 popular Indian financial stocks data.
Further, the performance evaluation of these DNNs has been carried out in
multiple independent runs for two settings of forecasting: (1) single-step
forecasting, and (2) multi-step forecasting. These DNN methods show convincing
performance for single-step forecasting (one-day ahead forecast). For the
multi-step forecasting (multiple days ahead forecast), we have evaluated the
methods for different forecast periods. The performance of these methods
demonstrates that long forecast periods have an adverse effect on performance.

set $A(D)$ where $n=|V(D)|$, and each arc is an ordered pair of distinct
vertices. If $(v,u) \in A(D)$, then $u$ is considered an \emph{out-neighbor} of
$v$ in $D$. Initially, we designate each vertex to be either filled or empty.
Then, the following color change rule (CCR) is applied: if a filled vertex $v$
has exactly one empty out-neighbor $u$, then $u$ will be filled. The process
continues until the CCR does not allow any empty vertex to become filled. If
all vertices in $V(D)$ are eventually filled, then the initial set is called a
\emph{zero forcing set} (ZFS); if not, it is a \emph{failed zero forcing set}
(FZFS). We introduce the \emph{failed zero forcing number} $F(D)$ on a digraph,
which is the maximum cardinality of any FZFS. The \emph{zero forcing number},
$Z(D)$, is the minimum cardinality of any ZFS. We characterize digraphs that
have $F(D)<Z(D)$ and determine $F(D)$ for several classes of digraphs including
directed acyclic graphs, weak paths and cycles, and weakly connected line
digraphs such as de Bruijn and Kautz digraphs. We also characterize digraphs
with $F(D)=n-1$, $F(D)=n-2$, and $F(D)=0$, which leads to a characterization of
digraphs in which any vertex is a ZFS. Finally, we show that for any integer $n
\geq 3$ and any non-negative integer $k$ with $k <n$, there exists a weak cycle
$D$ with $F(D)=k$.

of its coefficients, and their complexity decreases at least proportionally to
the number of roots in a region of interest (ROI) on the complex plane, such as
a disc or a square, but we greatly strengthen the main ingredient of the
previous algorithms. Namely our new counting test essentially amounts to the
evaluation of a polynomial $p$ and its derivative $p'$, which is a major
benefit, e.g., for sparse polynomials $p$. Moreover with evaluation at about
$\log(d)$ points (versus the previous record of order $d$) we output correct
number of roots in a disc whose contour has no roots of $p$ nearby. Moreover we
greatly soften the latter requirement versus the known subdivision algorithms.
Our second and less significant contribution concerns subdivision algorithms
for polynomials with real coefficients. Our tests demonstrate the power of the

extinction states of different population types. We are interested in the
long-term behavior of the Markov chain away from extinction, under a small
noise scaling. Under this scaling, the trajectory of the Markov process over
any compact interval converges in distribution to the solution of an ordinary
differential equation (ODE) evolving in the positive orthant. We study the
asymptotic behavior of the quasi-stationary distributions (QSD) in this scaling
regime. Our main result shows that the limit points of the QSD are supported on
the union of interior attractors of the flow determined by the ODE. We also
give lower bounds on expected extinction times which scale exponentially with
the system size. Results of this type when the deterministic dynamical system
obtained under the scaling limit is given by a discrete time evolution equation
and the dynamics are essentially in a compact space (namely, the one step map
is a bounded function) have been studied by Faure and Schreiber (2014). Our
results extend these to a setting of an unbounded state space and continuous
time dynamics. The proofs rely on uniform large deviation results for small
noise stochastic dynamical systems and methods from the theory of dynamical
systems. In general QSD for Markov chains with absorbing states and unbounded
state spaces may not exist. We study one basic family of Binomial-Poisson
models in the positive orthant where one can use Lyapunov function methods to
establish existence of QSD and also to argue the tightness of the QSD of the

However, there is not yet an agreement on even the most basic quantities such

revisit Corbino disk magnetotransport studies to find those surface transport
parameters. We first show that subsurface cracks exist in the SmB$_6$ crystals,
arising both from surface preparation and during the crystal growth. We provide
evidence that these hidden subsurface cracks are additional conduction
channels, and the large disagreement between earlier surface SmB$_6$ studies
may originate from previous interpretations not taking this extra conduction
path into account. We provide an update of a more reliable magnetotransport
data than the previous one (Phys. Rev. B 92, 115110) and find that the
orders-of-magnitude large disagreements in carrier density and mobility come
from the surface preparation and the transport geometry rather than the
intrinsic sample quality. From this magnetotransport study, we find an updated
estimate of the carrier density and mobility of 2.71$\times$10$^{13}$
(1/cm$^2$) and 104.5 (cm$^{2}$/V$\cdot$sec), respectively. We compare our

computationally-intensive. To accommodate the ever-increasing computational
demands of scientific applications, high-performance computing (HPC) systems
have become larger and more complex, offering parallelism at multiple levels
(e.g., nodes, cores per node, threads per core). Scientific applications need
to exploit all the available multilevel hardware parallelism to harness the
available computational power. The performance of applications executing on
such HPC systems may adversely be affected by load imbalance at multiple
levels, caused by problem, algorithmic, and systemic characteristics.
Nevertheless, most existing load balancing methods do not simultaneously
address load imbalance at multiple levels. This work investigates the impact of
load imbalance on the performance of three scientific applications at the
thread and process levels. We jointly apply and evaluate selected dynamic loop
self-scheduling (DLS) techniques to both levels. Specifically, we employ the
extended LaPeSD OpenMP runtime library at the thread level and extend the
DLS4LB MPI-based dynamic load balancing library at the process level. This
approach is generic and applicable to any multiprocess-multithreaded
computationally-intensive application (programmed using MPI and OpenMP). We
conduct an exhaustive set of experiments to assess and compare six DLS
techniques at the thread level and eleven at the process level. The results
show that improved application performance, by up to 21%, can only be achieved
by jointly addressing load imbalance at the two levels. We offer insights into
the performance of the selected DLS techniques and discuss the interplay of
load balancing at the thread level and process level.

active proton target for use in nuclear spectroscopic studies with nuclear
reactions induced by an ion beam in inverse kinematics. The active target
system, named Stack Structure Solid organic Scintillator Active Target (S4AT),
consists of five layers of plastic scintillators, each with a 1-mm thickness.
To determine the reaction point in the thickness direction, we exploit the
difference in the energy losses due to the beam particle and the charged
reaction product(s) in the scintillator material. S4AT offers the prospect of a
relatively thick target while maintaining a good energy resolution. By
considering the relative energy loss between different layers, the energy loss
due to unreacted beam particles can be eliminated. Such procedure, made
possible by the multi-layer structure, is essential to eliminate the effect of
unreacted accompanying beam particles, thus enabling its operation at a
moderate beam intensity of up to a few Mcps. We evaluated the performance of
S4AT by measuring the elastic proton-proton scattering using a 70-MeV proton
beam at Cyclotron and Radioisotope Center (CYRIC), Tohoku University.

datasets and aggregate these models into a single, stronger model. A popular
instance of this form of parallelization is federated learning, where the nodes
periodically send their local models to a coordinator that aggregates them and
redistributes the aggregation back to continue training with it. The most
frequently used form of aggregation is averaging the model parameters, e.g.,
the weights of a neural network. However, due to the non-convexity of the loss
surface of neural networks, averaging can lead to detrimental effects and it
remains an open question under which conditions averaging is beneficial. In
this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of information theory:
We measure the mutual information between representation and inputs as well as
representation and labels in local models and compare it to the respective
information contained in the representation of the averaged model. Our
empirical results confirm previous observations about the practical usefulness
of averaging for neural networks, even if local dataset distributions vary
strongly. Furthermore, we obtain more insights about the impact of the
aggregation frequency on the information flow and thus on the success of
distributed learning. These insights will be helpful both in improving the
current synchronization process and in further understanding the effects of
model aggregation.

Because tumor DNA point mutation data is very sparse, only limited accuracy
(64.5% for 12 tumor classes) was previously demonstrated by methods that rely
on point mutations as features (1). Tumor classification accuracy can be
greatly improved (to over 90% for 33 classes) by relying on gene expression

clinical mutational profiling.
  Here we sought to develop an accurate deep transfer learning and fine-tuning

information for dimension reduction (DR) has gained a surge of interest.
However, it's not accessible for these DR methods to achieve satisfactory
performance when facing the features from multiple views. In multi-view
learning problems, one instance can be represented by multiple heterogeneous
features, which are highly related but sometimes look different from each
other. In addition, correlations between features from multiple views always
vary greatly, which challenges the capability of multi-view learning methods.
Consequently, constructing a multi-view learning framework with generalization
and scalability, which could take advantage of multi-view information as much
as possible, is extremely necessary but challenging. To implement the above
target, this paper proposes a novel multi-view learning framework based on
similarity consensus, which makes full use of correlations among multi-view
features while considering the scalability and robustness of the framework. It
aims to straightforwardly extend those existing DR methods into multi-view
learning domain by preserving the similarity between different views to capture
the low-dimensional embedding. Two schemes based on pairwise-consensus and
centroid-consensus are separately proposed to force multiple views to learn
from each other and then an iterative alternating strategy is developed to
obtain the optimal solution. The proposed method is evaluated on 5 benchmark
datasets and comprehensive experiments show that our proposed multi-view
framework can yield comparable and promising performance with previous
approaches proposed in recent literatures.

B2-disordred structure regardless of annealing temperature, which results in
much smaller anomalous Hall conductivity sigma_xy and transverse Peltier

performed calculation of sigma_xy with taking B2 disordering into account well
reproduces experimental result, thus it was concluded that Berry curvature
originating from Weyl points is largely reduced by B2 disordering. It was also
revealed Al substitution with Si shifts the position of Fermi level and
improves the L21-atomic ordering largely, leading to strong enhancement of
sigma_xy, which also agreed with our theoretical calculation. The highest
thermopower of ANE of 6.1uV, which is comparable to the recent reports for

holographic cosmological models that assume an associated entropy on the
horizon. In such models, a $\Lambda(t)$ model similar to a time-varying
$\Lambda(t)$ cosmology is favored because of the consistency of energy flows
across the horizon. Based on this consistency, a $\Lambda(t)$ model with a
power-law term proportional to $H^{\alpha}$ is formulated to systematically
examine the evolution of the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. Here, $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $\alpha$ is a free parameter whose value is a real number.
The present model always satisfies the second law of thermodynamics on the
horizon. In particular, the universe for $\alpha <2$ tends to approach
thermodynamic equilibrium-like states. Consequently, when $\alpha < 2$, the
maximization of the entropy should be satisfied as well, at least in the last
stage of the evolution of an expanding universe. A relaxation-like process
before the last stage is also examined from a thermodynamics viewpoint.

these systems offer the potential to solve problems which even the most
powerful classical computers cannot. The future of computing will look

with no particular attention to the phenomenon of the vision. Understandably
the perception of vision has always been thought to happen, naturally, as that
for any of the other four senses. However, the reality that underlies this
presumption is by no means obvious; vision perception is based on remote
sensing of the ecology, fundamentally different form that of the other senses,
which have tactile stimulation origin (contact with matter). While its reality,
as explicated here, explains why the above presumption is true, it also bears
heavily on the mirror neuron theory: the revelation of the nature of vision
makes mirror neurons unnecessary. The extensive cognitive neurosciences
investigation of primates and humans, over the past three decades, have
experimentally validated the theory of mirror neurons which had been put
forward early in the period (1980s and 1990s) based on the results of cognitive
research experiments on the macaque monkeys. Based on further experimental
works, phenomena such as learning, empathy, and some aspects of survival, are
ascribed to the operations of this class of additional neurons. Here I reason
that all the results of the efforts of the proponents of the theory can, not
only find explanation in the context of the new theory of vision but also
provide support for it. This new take of the phenomenon of vision is developed
based on the nature of the experimental methods that have succeeded in
developing some measure of vision for the blinds, and the inferences from the
very likely nature of the computational strategy of the brain. I present
evidence that the mental phenomena, which rendered the claim of the mirror
neurons, are in essence the results of subjects beings variably touched by
their ecology, through the coherent tactile operation of all senses.

best set of BLVs to initialize a (multiscale) coupled ocean-atmosphere

negative Lyapunov exponents. This unexpected result is related to the fact that
these sets display larger projections on the ocean variables than the others,
leading to an appropriate spread for the ocean, and at the same time a rapid
transfer of these errors toward the most unstable BLVs affecting predominantly
the atmosphere is experienced. The latter dynamics is a natural property of any
generic perturbation in nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems, allowing for a
reliable spread with the atmosphere too. Furthermore, this specific choice
becomes even more crucial when the goal is the forecasting of low-frequency
variability at annual and decadal time scales. The implications of these
results for operational ensemble forecasts in coupled ocean-atmosphere systems

phenomenon, has been the focus of the speculations on the unified frameworks
for fundamental interactions in nature. Compared to strong experimental
credence to the standard model of particle physics there is practically no
relation of these speculations with the world of real particles. In this paper
we present a new conceptual framework for particle physics in which nontrivial
geometry and topology of space and time have fundamental reality. To develop
this model we proceed with the analysis of the standard wave equations and make
them real using the transformation rule $i=\sqrt{-1} \rightarrow
C=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$. Topological significance is
attached to $i$ in terms of a point defect in 1D directed line. New
interpretation of Schroedinger wave equation and $Z_2$ vortex throw light on
the nature of spin. A new meaning is also obtained on U(1) gauge symmetry and
charge. Novel properties of C-matrix and known applications are presented.
Topological origin of spin is inferred from the interpretation of Pauli algebra
that they signify 2D directed area in phase space as topological obstruction.
Electron magnetic moment decomposition in QED serves the basis for the
proposition: spin origin of charge (SOC). A dynamical logarithmic spiral
geometric structure comprising of 2+1D braids, 3 vortices with associated three
2-spinors is envisaged based on SOC. It is termed as meta-electron;
meta-neutrino has 2-vortex structure. These are the only building blocks of all
particles having the knotted vortex structures in our model. Coupling strengths
of the three fundamental interactions are related with the magnitudes of the
spin angular momentum of constituent spinors of the meta-electron.

alternate terms such as synonyms and other related words, since the same
concepts are often described differently in the literature. Patent terminology
is often domain specific. By curating technology-specific corpora and training
word embedding models based on these corpora, we are able to automatically
identify the most relevant expansions of a given word or phrase. We compare the
performance of several automated query expansion techniques against expert
specified expansions. Furthermore, we explore a novel mechanism to extract
related terms not just based on one input term but several terms in conjunction
by computing their centroid and identifying the nearest neighbors to this
centroid. Highly skilled patent examiners are often the best and most reliable
source of identifying related terms. By designing a user interface that allows
examiners to interact with the word embedding suggestions, we are able to use
these interactions to power crowdsourced modes of related terms. Learning from
users allows us to overcome several challenges such as identifying words that
are bleeding edge and have not been published in the corpus yet. This paper
studies the effectiveness of word embedding and crowdsourced models across 11

two competing scales; the uniform magnetic field and the incommensurate scale
of the cells of the tiling. Due to these competing scales the periodicity of
the Hofstadter butterfly is destroyed. We observe the presence of topological
edge states on the boundary of the system via the Bott index that exhibit two

internal edge-like states with non-zero Bott index, which exhibit two way
transport along this internal edge. The presence of these internal edge states

because exact diagonalization on a few tens of sites is not expected to be
enough to accurately capture the physics of the quasicrystalline system, and in
