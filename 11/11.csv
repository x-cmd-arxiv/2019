those events in terms of some kind of observational coordinates. We construct
such observational coordinates in some simple cases with the localized

(SISs), which considers missing measurements in the sensors of sub-systems. An
SIS is established by many similar sub-systems that directly interact or

actual projects, sensors of sub-systems in a sensor network may break down

promises new paradigm in information processing. However, the detailed
understanding of this effect is still limited, regarding its underlying
transport processes. Herein, it is suggested that the filtering mechanism can
be greately elucidated by the concept of metal-induced gap states (MIGS),
appearing in the electrode-terminated $MX_{2}$ materials {\it i.e.} the
referential filter setup. In particular, the gap states are predicted here to
mediate valley- and spin-resolved charge transport near the ideal
electrode/$MX_{2}$ interface, and therefore to initiate filtering. It is also
argued that the role of MIGS increases when the channel length is diminished,
as they begin to govern the overall valley-spin transport in the tunneling
regime. In what follows, the presented study yields fundamental scaling trends
for the valley-spin selectivity with respect to the intrinsic physics of the
filter materials. As a result, it facilitates insight into the analyzed effects
and provide design guidelines toward efficient valley-spin filter devices, that
base on the discussed materials or other hexagonal monolayers with a broken

is symmetric monoidal closed and compact closed and thus is a model of linear
$\lambda$-calculus and classical, as well as intuitionistic linear logic. This

has recently been studied by the researchers, is length of hospital stay (LOS)
defined as how long each patient is hospitalized. Detecting and controlling the
factors affecting this index can help to reduce healthcare costs and also to
improve healthcare service efficiency. The effects of three major factors, say,
the season during which the patient is hospitalized, the patients age and
his/her gender on LOS pertaining to 82718 patients receiving healthcare service
from the hospitals under contract to insurance organization in Tehran, have
been analyzed, using unbalanced factorial design. The test results imply that
the whole model is significant (P-value=0<0.01), the separate effects of all
three factors on LOS are significant (P-value=0<0.01) and the only significant
interaction at alpha=0.01 is the one between gender and age group
(P-value=0<0.01). moreover, no two age groups have the significant equal means
and age groups 1-10 and 26-40 years possess the minimum and maximum means of
LOS, respectively. LOS means in winter and autumn are equal, being the maximum.
Due to the significance of these effects, allocating specified budget and
resources with regard to these factors will help hospitals and healthcare
centers enhance their efficiency and remain within their budget.

methods based on machine learning have been developed to improve accuracy and
efficiency. However, the accuracy of those methods relies on a sufficient
amount of high-quality training data, which itself can be expensive to obtain
due to the requirement of domain knowledge and subject matter expertise. This
paper is to resolve this dilemma by answering two questions: (1) provided with
a limited number of reliable labels, can we use them to generate more synthetic
labels; (2) Can we use those synthetic labels to improve the detectability?
Among all the existing generative models, the generative adversarial network
(GAN) shows its supreme capability in generating high-quality synthetic samples
in multiple domains. We designed our model based on GAN. In particular, we
studied several different network structures. By comparing the generated
results, our GAN-based generative model yields the highest quality. We further
combine the dataset with synthetic samples generated by our generative model

significantly improved than the one trained without augmenting the training

autoregressive decoders often suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon
where the model learns to ignore the latent variables, causing the sequence VAE
to degenerate into a language model. In this paper, we argue that posterior
collapse is in part caused by the lack of dispersion in encoder features. We
provide empirical evidence to verify this hypothesis, and propose a

review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent works on multimodal deep
learning from three perspectives: learning multimodal representations, fusing
multimodal signals at various levels, and multimodal applications. Regarding
multimodal representation learning, we review the key concepts of embedding,
which unify multimodal signals into a single vector space and thereby enable
cross-modality signal processing. We also review the properties of many types
of embeddings that are constructed and learned for general downstream tasks.
Regarding multimodal fusion, this review focuses on special architectures for
the integration of representations of unimodal signals for a particular task.
Regarding applications, selected areas of a broad interest in the current

strongly violated as the thermal Hall signal increases monotonically with
decreasing doping in the pseudogap phase when the Hall response of the system
is seen to be strongly suppressed. In particular, the thermal Hall signal is
the strongest in the parent compounds, which are antiferromagnetic insulators.
People believe that such an observation may challenge our understanding of the
parent compounds as a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the
square lattice, since it is forbidden by a well known no-go ""theorem"" for
quantum magnets with an edge-sharing lattice. Here we show that the observed
thermal Hall signal can be naturally understood as the orbital magnetic
response of the quantum Heisenberg model on square lattice. We show that the
thermal Hall signal is in fact a measure of the spin chirality fluctuation in
the system. The universal observation of the giant negative thermal Hall signal
in and only in the pseudogap phase implies that the antiferromagnetic
correlation between local spins is at the root of the pseudogap phenomena. It
also implies that the pseudogap phenomena in the cuprates is always accompanied
by strong spin chirality fluctuation, which is suppressed only when the local
spin fluctuation at low energy is totally replaced by itinerant quasiparticle
behavior at sufficiently large doping.

quantized invariants describing the bulk quadrupole order. Here we identify the
analog of quadrupole order in Maxwell's equations for a photonic crystal (PhC)
and identify quadrupole topological photonic crystals formed through a band
inversion process. Unlike prior studies relying on threaded flux, our
quadrupole moment is quantized purely by crystalline symmetries, which we
confirm using three independent methods: analysis of symmetry eigenvalues,
numerical calculations of the nested Wannier bands, and the expectation value
of the quadrupole operator. Furthermore, through the bulk-edge correspondence
of Wannier bands, we reveal the boundary manifestations of nontrivial
quadrupole phases as quantized polarizations at edges and bound states at
corners. Finally, we relate the nontrivial corner states to the emergent
phenomena of quantized fractional corner charges and a filling anomaly as first
predicted in electronic systems. Our work paves the way to further explore
higher-order topological phases in nanophotonic systems and our method of
inducing quadrupole phase transitions is also applicable to other wave systems,

These instruments are often selected from a combination of prior knowledge from

studies and highlights the bias resulting from not accounting for the

unwinding transition in chiral nematic liquid crystals. A mechanism of the
transition is determined by a MEP passing through a first order saddle point on
the free energy surface. The energy difference between the saddle point and the
initial state gives the energy barrier of the transition. Two starting
approximations for the paths are used to find the MEPs representing different
transition scenarios: (a) the director slippage approximation with in-plane
helical structures; and (b) the anchoring breaking approximation that involves
the structures with profound out-of-plane director deviations. It is shown
that, at sufficiently low voltages, the unwinding transition is solely governed
by the director slippage mechanism with the planar saddle point structures.
When the applied voltage exceeds its critical value below the threshold of the
Freedericksz transition, the additional scenario through the anchoring breaking
transitions is found to come into play. For these transitions, the saddle point

effectively achieved by formulating finite dimensional constrained programs
which depend on system configuration, as well as the adopted learning
parameterization. The interest here is in cases where system models are
unavailable, prompting methods that probe the wireless system with candidate
policies, and then use observed performance to determine better policies. This
generic procedure is difficult because of the need to cull accurate gradient
estimates out of these limited system queries. This paper constructs and
exploits smoothed surrogates of constrained ergodic resource allocation
problems, the gradients of the former being representable exactly as averages
of finite differences that can be obtained through limited system probing.
Leveraging this unique property, we develop a new model-free primal-dual
algorithm for learning optimal ergodic resource allocations, while we
rigorously analyze the relationships between original policy search problems
and their surrogates, in both primal and dual domains. First, we show that both
primal and dual domain surrogates are uniformly consistent approximations of
their corresponding original finite dimensional counterparts. Upon further
assuming the use of near-universal policy parameterizations, we also develop
explicit bounds on the gap between optimal values of initial, infinite
dimensional resource allocation problems, and dual values of their
parameterized smoothed surrogates. In fact, we show that this duality gap
decreases at a linear rate relative to smoothing and universality parameters.
Thus, it can be made arbitrarily small at will, also justifying our proposed

SDP. On the other hand, this equivalence makes it possible to describe a
version of the {\it Triangle Algorithm} for SDP feasibility based on solving
CHR. Specifically, the Triangle Algorithm either computes an approximation to
the least-norm feasible solution of SDP, or using its {\it distance duality},
provides a separation when no solution within a prescribed norm exists. The
worst-case complexity of each iteration is computing the largest eigenvalue of
a symmetric matrix arising in that iteration. Alternate complexity bounds on
the total number of iterations can be derived. The Triangle Algorithm thus
provides an alternative to the existing interior-point algorithms for SDP
feasibility and SDP optimization. In particular, based on a preliminary
computational result, we can efficiently solve SDP relaxation of {\it binary

solving SDP relaxation of MAX-CUT. We also show in the case of testing the

difficulty in geometric complexity theory (GCT): While the GCT program is set
up to separate certain orbit closures, many beautiful mathematical properties
are only known for the group orbits, in particular close relations with
symmetry groups and invariant spaces, while the orbit closures seem much more
difficult to understand. However, in order to prove lower bounds in algebraic
complexity theory, considering group orbits is not enough.
  In this paper we tighten the relationship between the orbit of the power sum
polynomial and its closure, so that we can separate this orbit closure from the
orbit closure of the product of variables by just considering the symmetry
groups of both polynomials and their representation theoretic decomposition
coefficients. In a natural way our construction yields a multiplicity
obstruction that is neither an occurrence obstruction, nor a so-called
vanishing ideal occurrence obstruction. All multiplicity obstructions so far
have been of one of these two types.
  Our paper is the first implementation of the ambitious approach that was
originally suggested in the first papers on geometric complexity theory by
Mulmuley and Sohoni (SIAM J Comput 2001, 2008): Before our paper, all existence
proofs of obstructions only took into account the symmetry group of one of the
two polynomials (or tensors) that were to be separated. In our paper the
multiplicity obstruction is obtained by comparing the representation theoretic
decomposition coefficients of both symmetry groups.
  Our proof uses a semi-explicit description of the coordinate ring of the
orbit closure of the power sum polynomial in terms of Young tableaux, which
enables its comparison to the coordinate ring of the orbit.

studies in which tens to hundreds of thousands of models are compared to data

five Multilayer Perceptron's (MLP) trained on model albedo spectra of
extrasolar giant planets to estimate a planet's atmospheric metallicity,
gravity, effective temperature, and cloud properties given simulated observed
spectra. The stand-alone C++ code we have developed can train new MLP's on new
training sets, within minutes to hours, depending upon the dimensions of input
spectra and desired output. After the MLP is trained, it can classify new input
spectra within a second, potentially helping speed observation and mission
design planning. Four of the MLP's were tuned to work with various levels of
spectral noise. The fifth MLP was developed for cases where the user is
uncertain about the noise level. The MLP's were trained using a grid of model
spectra that varied in metallicity, gravity, temperature, and cloud properties.
We tested the MLP on noisy models and observed spectra of both Jupiter and
Saturn. The root mean squared error when applied to noisy models were on the
order of the model grid intervals. The results show that a trained MLP is a
robust means for reliable in-situ estimations, providing an elegant artificial

Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift), the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI),

modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in four epochs prior to

scenario, where the gamma-rays are produced in the blazar zone via external
inverse Compton scattering of accelerated electrons, and high-energy neutrinos
are produced via the photomeson production process of co-accelerated protons.
The multi-epoch SEDs can be satisfactorily explained with the same jet
parameters and variable external photon density and electron luminosity. Using
the maximal neutrino flux derived for each epoch, we put an upper limit of

advertise on only the videos that don't hurt the feelings, community or harmony

inappropriate content on YouTube and leverage it to perform a first of its
kind, large scale, quantitative characterization that reveals some of the risks
of YouTube ads consumption on inappropriate videos. Customization of the

corporations and companies to push ads on the platform without worrying about

delay (MED) of the channel to accommodate such algorithms in current standards.
The robustness of these algorithms can only be improved against these
conditions by adopting additional extensions in a new backward incompatible
standard. Such extensions would deteriorate the performance of high mobility
vehicular communication systems in particular. In this paper, we present a
low-complexity Hann RW-OFDM scheme that provides resistance against ACI without
requiring any intersymbol interference (ISI)-free redundancies. While this
scheme is backward compatible with current and legacy standards and requires no
changes to the conventionally transmitted signals, it also paves the way
towards future spectrotemporally localized and efficient schemes suitable for
higher mobility vehicular communications. A Hann window effectively rejects
unstructured ACI at the expense of structured and limited intercarrier
interference (ICI) across data carriers. A simple maximum ratio combining
successive interference cancellation (MRC-SIC) receiver is therefore proposed
to resolve this induced ICI and receive symbols transmitted by standard
transmitters currently in use. The computational complexity of the proposed
scheme is comparable to that of contemporary RW-OFDM algorithms, while ACI
rejection and bit-error rate performance is superior in both long and short
delay spreads. Channel estimation using Hann RW-OFDM symbols is also discussed.

towards finding efficient exploration strategies add auxiliary objectives to
promote exploration by the pre-update policy, however, this makes the
adaptation using a few gradient steps difficult as the pre-update (exploration)
and post-update (exploitation) policies are often quite different. Instead, we
propose to explicitly model a separate exploration policy for the task
distribution. Having two different policies gives more flexibility in training
the exploration policy and also makes adaptation to any specific task easier.

bar, especially in the two-armed spiral models where there is a wide region of

small boosts in star formation and enhances spiral features, which occur at

a full-duplex nonreciprocal-beam-steering transmissive phase-gradient
metasurface. Such a metasurface is realized by exploiting the unique properties
of the frequency-phase transition in coupled time-modulated twin meta-atoms.
The metasurface may be placed on top of a source antenna to transform the
radiation pattern of the source antenna, and introduce different radiation
patterns for the transmit and receive states. In contrast to the recently
proposed applications of time modulation, here the incident and transmitted
waves share the same frequency. The metasurface is endowed with directive,
diverse and asymmetric transmission and reception radiation beams, and tunable
beam shapes. Furthermore, these beams can be steered by simply changing the
modulation phase. The proposed coupled meta-atoms inherently suppress undesired
time harmonics, leading to a high conversion efficiency which is of paramount
importance for practical applications such as point to point full-duplex
communications.

with adaptive error bounds at each timestep of the simulation. Our approach
optimizes for compression speed and makes sure that errors due to lossy

that people mutually accept; obeying these norms is an essential signal that

For robots to be socially compatible with humans, it is crucial for robots to
obey these social norms. In prior work, we demonstrated a Socially-Aware
Navigation (SAN) planner, based on Pareto Concavity Elimination Transformation
(PaCcET), in a hallway scenario, optimizing two objectives so that the robot
does not invade the personal space of people. This paper extends our PaCcET
based SAN planner to multiple scenarios with more than two objectives. We
modified the Robot Operating System's (ROS) navigation stack to include PaCcET
in the local planning task. We show that our approach can accommodate multiple
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. Using the proposed approach, we
achieved successful HRI in multiple scenarios like hallway interactions, an art

method on a simulated PR2 robot in a 2D simulator (Stage) and a pioneer-3DX

investigation of the mechanical properties of ultrathin SnO, as well as the
electronic implications of tensile strain ($\epsilon$) under both uniaxial and
biaxial conditions. Bulk-to-monolayer transition is found to significantly

interlayer Sn-Sn bonds in preserving structural integrity. Unprecedentedly,
few-layer SnO exhibits superplasticity under uniaxial deformation conditions,
with a critical strain to failure of up to 74% in the monolayer. Such
superplastic behavior is ascribed to the formation of a tri-coordinated
intermediate (referred to here as h-SnO) beyond $\epsilon$ = 14%, which
resembles a partially-recovered orthorhombic phase with relatively large work

the scaling exponents are smaller than those for moderate-Prandtl number fluids

the cell, probability density functions (PDFs) of temperature profiles show
stretched exponential peak and the Gaussian tail; in the sidewall region, PDFs

proposed to have originated from a single degenerate progenitor. The radio
morphology of this SNR is asymmetrical with two bright regions towards the
north-west and south-west of the central location as defined by radio emission.
  N 103B identified features include: a radio spectral index of -0.75+-0.01
(consistent with other young type Ia SNRs in the Galaxy); a bulk SNR expansion
rate as in X-rays; morphology and polarised electrical field vector
measurements where we note radial polarisation peak towards the north-west of
the remnant at both 5500 and 9000 MHz. The spectrum is concave-up and the most
likely reason is the non-linear diffusive shock acceleration effects or
presence of two different populations of ultra-relativistic electrons.
  We also note unpolarized clumps near the south-west region which is in
agreement with this above scenario. We derive a typical magnetic field strength
for N 103B, of 16.4 microG for an average rotation measurement of 200 rad m^-2.
However, we estimate the equipartition field to be of the order of ~235 microG
with an estimated minimum energy of Emin=6.3*10^48 erg. The close (~0.5 degree)
proximity of N 103B to the LMC mid-plane indicates that an early encounter with
dense interstellar medium may have set an important constrain on SNR evolution.
  Finally, we compare features of N 103B, to six other young type Ia SNRs in
the LMC and Galaxy, with a range of proposed degeneracy scenarios to highlight
potential differences due to a different models. We suggest that the single
degenerate scenario might point to morphologically asymmetric type Ia supernova
explosions.

shortcomings of prior work and increase the total quantity of manipulation data
collected through human supervision by an order of magnitude without
sacrificing the quality of the data and (2) to collect data on challenging

the majority of existing link prediction models employ simple but intuitive

applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. However, these properties also
restrict the ability to learn more expressive and robust features. Therefore,
diverging from most of the prior works which focus on designing new objective
functions, we propose, DeCom, a simple but effective mechanism to boost the
performance of existing link predictors such as DistMult, ComplEx, etc, through
extracting more expressive features while preventing overfitting by adding just
a few extra parameters. Specifically, embeddings of entities and relationships
are first decompressed to a more expressive and robust space by decompressing
functions, then knowledge graph embedding models are trained in this new
feature space. Experimental results on several benchmark knowledge graphs and
advanced link prediction systems demonstrate the generalization and
effectiveness of our method. Especially, RESCAL + DeCom achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the FB15k-237 benchmark across all evaluation

increasing the embedding size significantly increase the number of parameters

Factor analysis is commonly used in integrative analysis of multimodal data,
and is particularly useful to overcome the curse of high dimensionality and
high correlations. However, there is little work on statistical inference for
factor analysis based supervised modeling of multimodal data. In this article,
we consider an integrative linear regression model that is built upon the
latent factors extracted from multimodal data. We address three important
questions: how to infer the significance of one data modality given the other
modalities in the model; how to infer the significance of a combination of
variables from one modality or across different modalities; and how to quantify
the contribution, measured by the goodness-of-fit, of one data modality given
the others. When answering each question, we explicitly characterize both the
benefit and the extra cost of factor analysis. Those questions, to our
knowledge, have not yet been addressed despite wide use of factor analysis in
integrative multimodal analysis, and our proposal bridges an important gap. We
study the empirical performance of our methods through simulations, and further

broad-line region from the observed optical luminosity of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) is a necessary task to study fundamental parameters of distant
AGNs such as mass of the central supermassive black hole. The most popular
method of the BLR size estimation is the reverberation mapping based on
measuring the time delay between the continuum flux and the flux in the
emission lines. In our work, we apply the method of photometric reverberation
mapping in medium-band filters, adapted for observations at the Zeiss-1000
telescope of the SAO RAS, for the study of AGN with broad lines in the range of
redshifts $0.1 < z < 0.8$. This paper describes the technique of observations
and data processing, provides a sample of objects and demonstrates the
stability of the used method. As a preliminary result for 2MASX
J08535955+7700543 at $z=0.1$ we have obtained time delay estimates of $\tau
(ICCF)=32.2^{\pm10.6}$ days and $\tau(JAVELIN)=39.5_{-15.8}^{+23.0}$ days that
are consistent with each other and also within the accuracy of the existing

conducted with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Radiative transfer
analysis of multiline data indicates warm ($T_\mathrm{k}\sim40\mathrm{-}80$ K)
and dense ($n_\mathrm{H_2}\sim10^{3\mathrm{-}4}$ cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas with
high column density of atomic carbon ($N_\mathrm{CI}\sim3\times10^{18}$
cm$^{-2}$) in the circumnuclear disk (central 100 pc). The C I/H$_2$ abundance
in the central 1 kpc is $\sim3-7\times10^{-5}$, consistent with the values in
luminous infrared galaxies. The intensity ratios of [C I]/CO(1-0) and [C
I]/CO(3-2), respectively, decrease and increase with radius in the central 1

be explained by excitation and optical depth effects, since the effective
critical density of CO (2-1) is comparable to that of [C I]. The distribution
of [C I] is similar to that of $^{13}$CO (2-1), and the ratios of [C I] to

CO-equivalent tracer of molecular gas mass, although caution is needed when
applied in resolved starburst nuclei (e.g., circumnuclear disk), where the [C
I]/CO(1-0) luminosity ratio is enhanced due to high excitation and atomic
carbon abundance. The [C I]/CO(1-0) intensity ratio toward the base of the

to enable blockchain interoperability and support emerging cross-domain
applications, notably stablecoins. Given the data-intensive feeds in real life
(e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain,
namely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by
the constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work
focuses on designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for cost effectiveness
in Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research
which has so far focused on static data placement.
  This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically
replicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's
data replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and
making online decisions w.r.t. data replication. A series of online algorithms
are proposed that achieve the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB
runs the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower
Gas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred
between the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously
achieve low Gas costs with changing workloads.
  We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and
supported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from
the Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we
systematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10% ~ 74%,
with comparison to the baselines of static data-placement.

underwater when the water is murky and the quality of the recorded images is
low. That is because most SLAM algorithms are feature-based techniques and
often it is impossible to extract the matched features from blurry underwater
images. To get more useful features, image processing techniques can be used to
dehaze the images before they are used in a navigation/localization algorithm.
There are many well-developed methods for image restoration, but the degree of
enhancement and the resource cost of the methods are different. In this paper,
we propose a new visual SLAM, specifically-designed for the underwater
environment, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the
quality of underwater images with underwater image quality evaluation metrics.
This procedure increases the efficiency of SLAM and gets a better navigation

using different images with various levels of turbidity in the water.

therefore, study the muon capture reaction of $ ^{100} \rm{Mo} $ by a
theoretical approach. We used the proton-neutron QRPA to calculate the muon
capture rate. The muon wave function is calculated with considering the
electronic distribution of the atom and the nuclear charge distribution. The
particle evaporation process from the daughter nucleus is calculated by a
statistical model. From the model calculation, about $ 38 \, \% $ of $ {}^{100}
\rm{Mo} $ is converted to $ {}^{99} \rm{Mo} $ through the muon capture
reaction, which is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data. It is
revealed that negative parity states, especially $ 1^- $ state, play an
important role in $ {}^{100} \rm{Mo} \left( \mu^-, n \right) {}^{99} \rm{Nb} $.
The feasibility of $ {}^{99} \rm{Mo} $ production by the muon capture reaction

intuitionistic logics do not scale up to the standard libraries of modern
languages, which span hundreds or thousands of components. Recent graph
reachability based methods proposed for languages like Java do scale, but only
apply to components over monomorphic data and functions: polymorphic data and
functions infinitely explode the size of the graph that must be searched,
rendering synthesis intractable. We introduce type-guided abstraction
refinement (TYGAR), a new approach for scalable type-directed synthesis over
polymorphic datatypes and components. Our key insight is that we can overcome
the explosion by building a graph over abstract types which represent a
potentially unbounded set of concrete types. We show how to use graph
reachability to search for candidate terms over abstract types, and introduce a
new algorithm that uses proofs of untypeability of ill-typed candidates to
iteratively refine the abstraction until a well-typed result is found.

to preserve the seismic texture information while reconstructing the missing
traces. Aside from minimizing the reconstruction error, SUIT enhances the
texture consistency between the recovery and the original completely seismic
data, by designing a pre-trained U-Net to extract the texture information. The
experiments show that our method outperforms the classic state-of-art methods
in terms of robustness.

an original smooth curve and an infinitesimally discretized curve. To solve
this paradox, we have investigated a non-hypersingular expression for the
integral kernel (called the stress Green's function) which describes the stress
field caused by the displacement discontinuity. We first develop a compact
alternative expression of the non-hypersingular stress Green's function for
general two- and three-dimensional infinite homogeneous elastic media. We next
compute the stress Green's functions on a curved fault and revisit the paradox.
We find that previously obtained non-hypersingular stress Green's functions are
incorrect for curved faults, and that smooth and infinitesimally segmented
faults are equivalent. Their compatibility bridges the gap between analytical
methods featuring curved faults and numerical methods using subdivided flat

crucial but challenging task in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), as
it has to deal with the issue that the joint action space increases
exponentially with the number of agents in such scenarios. This paper proposes
an approach, named SMIX(${\lambda}$), to address the issue using an efficient
off-policy centralized training method within a flexible learner search space.
As importance sampling for such off-policy training is both computationally
costly and numerically unstable, we proposed to use the ${\lambda}$-return as a
proxy to compute the TD error. With this new loss function objective, we adopt
a modified QMIX network structure as the base to train our model. By further
connecting it with the ${Q(\lambda)}$ approach from an unified expectation
correction viewpoint, we show that the proposed SMIX(${\lambda}$) is equivalent
to ${Q(\lambda)}$ and hence shares its convergence properties, while without
being suffered from the aforementioned curse of dimensionality problem inherent
in MARL. Experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmark
demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms several state-of-the-art
MARL methods by a large margin, but also can be used as a general tool to
improve the overall performance of other CTDE-type algorithms by enhancing
their CVFs.

unique in identifying optically-faint (i$\sim$20) IR-bright galaxies, which
could be missed in previous surveys. A self-consistent spectrum-SED
decomposition method, which constrains stellar population properties in SED
modeling based on spectral fitting results, has been employed for 149 ULIRGs
whose optical continua are dominated by host galaxies. They are massive
galaxies ($M_{\rm star}\sim10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$), associated with
intense star formation activities (SFR $\sim$ 200-2000 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).
The sample covers a range of AGN bolometric luminosity of $10^{10}$-$10^{13}$
L$_{\odot}$, and the outflow velocity measured from [OIII] 5007A line shows a
correlation with AGN luminosity. Eight galaxies show extremely fast outflows
with velocity up to 1500-2000 km s$^{-1}$. However, the co-existence of
vigorous starbursts and strong outflows suggests the star formation has not
been quenched during the ULIRG phase. By deriving stellar mass and mass
fraction of young stellar population, we find no significant discrepancies
between stellar properties of ULIRGs with weak and powerful AGNs. The results
are not consistent with the merger-induced evolutionary scenario, which
predicts that SF-dominated ULIRGs show smaller stellar mass and younger stellar
populations compared to AGN-dominated ULIRGs.

coarse-grained numerical value that can hardly capture users' fine-grained
preferences toward different latent aspects of items from a representation

Relation Embedding with Dual Attentions) to address this challenge. REDA is
essentially a deep learning based recommendation method that employs an item
relation embedding scheme through a neural network structure for inter-item
relations representation. A relational user embedding is then proposed by
aggregating the relation embeddings between all purchased items of a user,
which not only better characterizes user preferences but also alleviates the
data sparsity problem. Moreover, to capture valid meta-knowledge that reflects
users' desired latent aspects and meanwhile suppress their explosive growth
towards overfitting, we further propose a dual attentions mechanism, including
a memory attention and a weight attention. A relation-wise optimization method
is finally developed for model inference by constructing a personalized ranking
loss for item relations. Extensive experiments are implemented on real-world

velocities from stellar activity are dominated by magnetic active regions that
move in and out of sight as the star rotates, producing signals with timescales
related to the stellar rotation period. Methods to characterize radial velocity
periodograms assume that peaks from magnetic active regions will typically
occur at the stellar rotation period or a related harmonic. However, with
surface features unevenly spaced and evolving over time, signals from magnetic
activity are not perfectly periodic, and the effectiveness of characterizing
them with sine curves is unconfirmed. With a series of simulations, we perform
the first test of common assumptions about signals from magnetic active regions
in radial velocity periodograms. We simulate radial velocities with
quasi-periodic signals that account for evolution and migration of magnetic
surface features. As test cases, we apply our analysis to two exoplanet hosts,
Kepler-20 and K2-131. Simulating observing schedules and uncertainties of real
radial velocity surveys, we find that magnetic active regions commonly produce
maximum periodogram peaks at spurious periods unrelated to the stellar rotation
period: 81% and 72% of peaks, respectively for K2-131 and Kepler-20. These
unexpected peaks can potentially lead to inaccuracies in derived planet masses.
We also find that these spurious peaks can sometimes survive multiple seasons
of observation, imitating signals typically attributed to exoplanet companions.

Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for large geospatial observations, a variety of
approximation methods have been proposed in the literature, which usually
require tuning certain inputs. For example, the recently developed Tile
Low-Rank approximation (TLR) method involves many tuning parameters, including
numerical accuracy. To properly choose the tuning parameters, it is crucial to
adopt a meaningful criterion for the assessment of the prediction efficiency
with different inputs, which the most commonly-used Mean Square Prediction
Error (MSPE) criterion and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence criterion cannot
fully describe. In this paper, we present three other criteria, the Mean Loss
of Efficiency (MLOE), Mean Misspecification of the Mean Square Error (MMOM),
and Root mean square MOM (RMOM), and show numerically that, in comparison with
the common MSPE criterion and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence criterion, our
criteria are more informative, and thus more adequate to assess the loss of the
prediction efficiency by using the approximated or misspecified covariance
models. Hence, our suggested criteria are more useful for the determination of
tuning parameters for sophisticated approximation methods of spatial model
fitting. To illustrate this, we investigate the trade-off between the execution
time, estimation accuracy, and prediction efficiency for the TLR method with
extensive simulation studies and suggest proper settings of the TLR tuning
parameters. We then apply the TLR method to a large spatial dataset of soil
moisture in the area of the Mississippi River basin, and compare the TLR with
the Gaussian predictive process and the composite likelihood method, showing
that our suggested criteria can successfully be used to choose the tuning

mean-field type leader-follower Stackelberg differential game with an adapted
open-loop information structure. The objective functionals of the leader and
the follower include conditional expectations of state and control (mean field)
variables, and the cost parameters could be general nonexponential discounting
depending on the initial time. As stated in the existing literature, these two
general settings of the objective functionals induce time inconsistency in the
optimal solutions. Given an arbitrary control of the leader, we first obtain
the follower's (time-consistent) equilibrium control and its state feedback
representation in terms of the nonsymmetric coupled Riccati differential
equations (RDEs) and the backward stochastic differential equation (SDE). This
provides the rational behavior of the follower, characterized by the
forward-backward SDE (FBSDE). We then obtain the leader's explicit
(time-consistent) equilibrium control and its state feedback representation in
terms of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs under the FBSDE constraint induced by
the follower. With the solvability of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs, the
equilibrium controls of the leader and the follower constitute the
time-consistent Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, the numerical examples are
provided to check the solvability of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs.

The length of the tensor equals to the number of words in the sentence or

images and outputs a scalar. By iterating this process continuously for each
$n$-gram along with the sentence or article with multiple kernels, we obtain a
2-dimensional feature map. A subsequent 1-dimensional max-over-time pooling is
applied to this feature map, and three fully-connected layers are used for

to data, and may be interpreted as ""physics for data"". The first half of this
review introduces sparse modeling for physicists. It is assumed that readers
have physics background but no expertise in data science. The second half
reviews applications. Matsubara Green's function, which plays a central role in
descriptions of correlated systems, has been found to be sparse, meaning that
it contains little information. This leads to (i) a new method for solving the
ill-conditioned inverse problem for analytical continuation, and (ii) a highly
compact representation of Matsubara Green's function, which enables efficient

object inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), has been widely
argued to be a low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) source. EMRIs providing
accurate measurements of black hole mass and spin, are one of the primary
interests for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, it is usually
believed that there are no electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to EMRIs. Here we
show a new formation channel of EMRIs with tidal disruption flares as EM
counterparts. In this scenario, flares can be produced from the tidal stripping
of the helium (He) envelope of a massive star by an SMBH. The left compact core
of the massive star will evolve into an EMRI. We find that, under certain
initial eccentricity and semimajor axis, the GW frequency of the inspiral can
enter LISA band within 10 $\sim$ 20 years, which makes the tidal disruption
flare an EM precursor to EMRI. Although the event rate is just $2\times

localization accuracy of LISA and help to find the host galaxy of EMRI, but
also serve as a new GW standard siren for cosmology.

of our approach for answer sentence selection, which is a well-known inference
task in Question Answering. We built a large scale dataset to enable the
transfer step, exploiting the Natural Questions dataset. Our approach
establishes the state of the art on two well-known benchmarks, WikiQA and
TREC-QA, achieving MAP scores of 92% and 94.3%, respectively, which largely
outperform the previous highest scores of 83.4% and 87.5%, obtained in very

models reducing the effort required for selecting optimal hyper-parameters.
Additionally, we show that the transfer step of TANDA makes the adaptation step
more robust to noise. This enables a more effective use of noisy datasets for
fine-tuning. Finally, we also confirm the positive impact of TANDA in an
industrial setting, using domain specific datasets subject to different types

an external cost to a system by requiring computational effort to perform
actions. However, since its inception, a central challenge was to tune this
cost. Initial designs for deterring spam email and DoS attacks applied overhead
equally to honest participants and attackers. Requiring too little effort did
not deter attacks, whereas too much encumbered honest participation. This might
be the reason it was never widely adopted.
  Nakamoto overcame this trade-off in Bitcoin by distinguishing desired from
malicious behavior and introducing internal rewards for the former. This
solution gained popularity in securing cryptocurrencies and using the virtual
internally-minted tokens for rewards. However, in existing blockchain protocols
the internal rewards fund (almost) the same value of external expenses. Thus,
as the token value soars, so does the PoW expenditure. Bitcoin PoW, for
example, already expends as much electricity as Colombia or Switzerland. This
amount of resource-guzzling is unsustainable and hinders even wider adoption of
these systems.
  In this work we present Hybrid Expenditure Blockchain (HEB), a novel PoW
mechanism. HEB is a generalization of Nakamoto's protocol that enables tuning
the external expenditure by introducing a complementary internal-expenditure
mechanism. Thus, for the first time, HEB decouples external expenditure from
the reward value.
  We show a practical parameter choice by which HEB requires significantly less
external consumption compare to Nakamoto's protocol, its resilience against
rational attackers is similar, and it retains the decentralized and
permissionless nature of the system. Taking the Bitcoin ecosystem as an
example, HEB cuts the electricity consumption by half.

  Recognition by Neural Searching","Accepted by AAAI2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Human action recognition from skeleton data, fueled by the Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN), has attracted lots of attention, due to its
powerful capability of modeling non-Euclidean structure data. However, many
existing GCN methods provide a pre-defined graph and fix it through the entire
network, which can loss implicit joint correlations. Besides, the mainstream
spectral GCN is approximated by one-order hop, thus higher-order connections
are not well involved. Therefore, huge efforts are required to explore a better
GCN architecture. To address these problems, we turn to Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) and propose the first automatically designed GCN for
skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we enrich the search space by
providing multiple dynamic graph modules after fully exploring the
spatial-temporal correlations between nodes. Besides, we introduce multiple-hop
modules and expect to break the limitation of representational capacity caused
by one-order approximation. Moreover, a sampling- and memory-efficient
evolution strategy is proposed to search an optimal architecture for this task.
The resulted architecture proves the effectiveness of the higher-order
approximation and the dynamic graph modeling mechanism with temporal
interactions, which is barely discussed before. To evaluate the performance of
the searched model, we conduct extensive experiments on two very large scaled
datasets and the results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art results.

complexity of the transmitter to classical multiple-input multiple-output
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, due to
the introduction of IM, the complexity of the detector at receiver is greatly
increased. Furthermore, the detector also requires the channel state
information at receiver, which leads to high system overhead. To tackle these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce deep learning (DL) in designing a
non-iterative detector. Specifically, based on the structural sparsity of the
transmitted signal in IM aided MIMO-OFDM systems, we first formulate the
detection process as a sparse reconstruction problem. Then, a DL based detector
called IMNet, which combines two subnets with the traditional least square
method, is designed to recover the transmitted signal. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt that designs the DL based detector for IM
aided systems. Finally, to verify the adaptability and robustness of IMNet,
simulations are carried out with consideration of correlated MIMO channels. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IMNet outperforms existing
algorithms in terms of bit error rate and computational complexity under
various scenarios.

Restricting attention to null separated events, we find an expression for the
Ricci (bi)scalar in this zero-point-length metric; this is done for when
geometric circumstances are such that the collection of all null geodesics
emerging from a point $P$ has all the information needed to fix the value of
scalar curvature at $P$. Taking then the coincidence and further $L_0 \to 0$
limits, we find that this expression does not reduce to the Ricci scalar $R$ of
the ordinary metric but to $(D-1) R_{ab} l^a l^b$ in $D$-dimensional spacetime
($D \ge 4$), where $R_{ab}$ and $l^a$ are the ordinary Ricci tensor and tangent
vector to the null geodesics. This adds nicely to the existing results for time

that the quantity $R_{ab} l^a l^b$, ubiquitous in horizon thermodynamics,
embodies something which remains as a relic/remnant/memory of a quantum

lower mantle phases with depth-dependent composition. Here we determine the
radiative conductivity (krad) of a realistic lower mantle (pyrolite) in situ
using an ultra-bright light probe and fast time-resolved spectroscopic
techniques in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. We find that the mantle opacity
increases critically upon heating to ~3000 K at 40-135 GPa, resulting in an
unexpectedly low radiative conductivity decreasing with depth from ~0.8 W/m/K
at 1000 km to ~0.35 W/m/K at the CMB, the latter being ~30 times smaller than
the estimated lattice thermal conductivity at such conditions. Thus, radiative
heat transport is blocked due to an increased optical absorption in the hot
lower mantle resulting in a moderate CMB heat flow of ~8.5 TW, at odds with
present estimates based on the mantle and core dynamics. This moderate rate of
core cooling implies an inner core age of about 1 Gy and is compatible with
both thermally- and compositionally-driven ancient geodynamo.

This is because current solutions assume that users perceive the quality of

videos. This means the bandwidth demand must be proportional to the size of the
user's field of view. However, we found several qualitydetermining factors
unique to 360{\deg}videos, which can help reduce the bandwidth demand. They
include the moving speed of a user's viewpoint (center of the user's field of
view), the recent change of video luminance, and the difference in
depth-of-fields of visual objects around the viewpoint. This paper presents
Pano, a 360{\deg} video streaming system that leverages the 360{\deg}
video-specific factors. We make three contributions. (1) We build a new quality
model for 360{\deg} videos that captures the impact of the 360{\deg}

order to strike a balance between the perceived quality and video encoding
efficiency. (3) Pano proposes a new qualityadaptation logic that maximizes
360{\deg} video user-perceived quality and is readily deployable. Our
evaluation (based on user study and trace analysis) shows that compared with
state-of-the-art techniques, Pano can save 41-46% bandwidth without any drop in
the perceived quality, or it can raise the perceived quality (user rating) by
25%-142% without using more bandwidth.

`similarities' between the action categories in publicly available large-scale

guided weak supervision is proposed, where every class in the target data is
matched to a class in the source data using the principle of posterior
likelihood maximization. Subsequently, classifier on the target data is
re-trained by augmenting samples from the matched source classes, along with a
new loss encouraging inter-class separability. The proposed method is evaluated
on two skill assessment autism datasets, SSBD and a real world Autism dataset

either bare or grafted with polystyrene chains immersed in a melt of free
polystyrene chains, whereas the grafted and the free polystyrene chains are
either monodisperse or bidisperse. The two-body PMF shows that a bidisperse
distribution of free polymer chains increases the strength of attraction
between a pair of ungrafted NPs. If the NPs are grafted by polymer chains, the
effective interaction crucially depends on bidispersity and grafting density of
the polymer chains: for low grafting densities, the bidispersity of both free
and grafted chains increases the repulsion between the NPs, whereas for high
grafting densities we observe two different effects. An increase of
bidispersity in free chains causes the rise of the repulsion between the NPs,
while an increase of bidispersity in grafted chains promotes the rise of
attraction. Additionally, a proper treatment of multi-body interactions
improves the simpler two-body PMF calculations, in both unimodal and bimodal
cases. We found that, by properly tuning the bidispersity of both free and

can be confirmed by experimental observations. As a result, the hybrid

  Gradient Descent for Optimal Tracking Control","Preprint of the manuscript under review at CDC+LCSS (2020)",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) was proposed in literature to obviate
the requirement of drift dynamics in adaptive dynamic programming framework.
Most of the online IRL schemes in literature require two sets of neural network
(NNs), known as actor-critic NN and an initial stabilizing controller.
Recently, for RL-based robust tracking this requirement of initial stabilizing
controller and dual-approximator structure could be obviated by using a
modified gradient descent-based update law containing a stabilizing term with
critic-only structure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no
study on leveraging such stabilizing term in IRL algorithm framework to solve
optimal trajectory tracking problems for continuous time nonlinear systems with
actuator constraints. To this end a novel update law leveraging the stabilizing
term along with variable gain gradient descent in IRL framework is presented in
this paper. With these modifications, the IRL tracking controller can be
implemented using only critic NN, while no initial stabilizing controller is
required. Another salient feature of the presented update law is its variable
learning rate, which scales the pace of learning based on instantaneous
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman error and rate of variation of Lyapunov function along
the system trajectories. The augmented system states and NN weight errors are
shown to possess uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) stability under the
presented update law and achieve a tighter residual set. This update law is
validated on a full 6-DoF nonlinear model of UAV for attitude control.

been proposed for optimal tracking problem of continuous time nonlinear systems

uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) stability, in which normally higher learning
rates are avoided in order to restrict oscillations in state error to smaller

neural network weights. This paper addresses that problem by proposing a novel
tuning law containing a variable gain gradient descent for critic neural
network that can adjust the learning rate based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman

descent tuning law could improve the convergence time of critic neural network
weights. Simultaneously, it also results in tighter residual set, on which
trajectories of augmented system converge to, leading to smaller oscillations
in state error. A tighter bound for UUB stability of the proposed update
mechanism is proved. Numerical studies are then presented to validate the
robust Reinforcement Learning control scheme in controlling a continuous time

various in-equivalent criteria put forth to address it. The concept of

``temporal self-similarity'', the property of a system dynamics whereby the
propagator between two intermediate states is independent of the initial time

In this paper we study the determinants of hospital cooperation and its

administrative data. We explore the impact on patient transfers between
hospitals (cooperation/network) of a set of demand-supply factors, as well as
distance-based centrality measures. We then use this framework to assess how
such cooperation is related to the overall quality for the hospital of origin
and of destination of the patient transfer. The over-dispersed Poisson mixed
model that we propose, inspired by the literature on social relations models,
is suitably defined to handle network data, which are rarely used in health
economics. The results show that distance plays an important role in hospital
cooperation, though there are other factors that matter such as geographical
centrality. Another empirical finding is the existence of a positive
relationship between hospital cooperation and the overall quality of the
connected hospitals. The absence of a source of information on the quality of
hospitals accessible to all providers, such as in the form of star ratings, may
prevent some hospitals to engage and cooperate with other hospitals of
potentially higher quality. This may result in a lower degree of cooperation

deformations. This article tests a method of template matching that is more
tolerant to such changes in appearance and that can, therefore, more accurately
identify image patches. In traditional template matching the comparison between
a template and the image is independent of the other templates. In contrast,
the method advocated here takes into account the evidence provided by the image
for the template at each location and the full range of alternative
explanations represented by the same template at other locations and by other
templates. Specifically, the proposed method of template matching is performed
using a form of probabilistic inference known as ""explaining away"". The
algorithm used to implement explaining away has previously been used to
simulate several neurobiological mechanisms, and been applied to image contour
detection and pattern recognition tasks. Here it is applied for the first time
to image patch matching, and is shown to produce superior results in comparison
to the current state-of-the-art methods.

methods, namely, (i) exploit covariates to improve the quality of communities,
and more importantly, (ii) explain the discovered communities by identifying
the relative importance of different covariates in them. Recent methods have
almost exclusively focused on the first point above. However, the quantitative
improvements offered by them are often due to complex black-box models like
deep neural networks at the expense of explainability. Approaches that focus on
the second point are either domain-specific or have poor performance in
practice. This paper proposes explainable, domain-independent statistical
models for networks with node covariates that additionally offer good
quantitative performance. Our models combine the strengths of Stochastic Block
Models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines to provide interpretable insights
about the communities. They support both pure and mixed community memberships.
Besides providing explainability, our approach's main strength is that it does
not explicitly assume a causal direction between community memberships and node
covariates, making it applicable in diverse domains. We derive efficient
inference procedures for our models, which can, in some cases, run in linear
time in the number of nodes and edges. Experiments on several synthetic and
real-world networks demonstrate that our models achieve close to
state-of-the-art performance on community detection and link prediction tasks
while also providing explanations for the discovered communities.

the periodic set of such plates (Smith-Purcell radiation). The oblique
incidence of the particle (both in the case of the single plate and in the case

and gamma-ray burst observations, we shall be able to examine populations of
binary neutron star mergers rather than a case-by-case basis. We present an
analysis that considers gravitational wave triggered binary neutron star events
both with and without short gamma-ray burst counterparts assuming that events
without a counterpart were observed off-axis. This allows for Bayes factors to
be calculated to compare different jet structure models. We perform model
comparison between a Gaussian and power-law apparent jet structure on simulated
data to demonstrate that the correct model can be distinguished with a log
Bayes factor of $>5$ after less than 100 events. Constraints on the apparent
structure jet model parameters are also made. After 25(100) events the angular
width of the core of a power-law jet structure can be constrained within a
$90\%$ credible interval of width $ \sim9.1(4.4)^{\circ} $, and the outer
beaming angle to be within $\sim19.9(8.5)^{\circ}$. Similarly we show the width
of a Gaussian jet structure to be constrained to $\sim2.8(1.6)^{\circ}$.

more frequently than bit-flip errors. When transmitting across these asymmetric

the channel. However, analyzing the performance of stabilizer codes on these

address this, at least for short codes, we demonstrate that the decoding error

a recent result to show that there are a number of $[[5\leq n\leq12,1\leq

and we use it as the basis for a hill climbing algorithm, which we show to be
effective at optimizing codes for asymmetric channels. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that simple modifications can be made to our hill climbing

spatio-temporal queries. Our structure, dubbed GraCT, stores the absolute
positions of all the objects at regular time intervals (snapshots) using a
$k^2$-tree, which is a space- and time-efficient version of a region quadtree.
Positions between snapshots are represented as logs of relative movements and
compressed using Re-Pair, a grammar-based compressor. The nonterminals of this
grammar are enhanced with MBR information to enable fast queries.
  The GraCT structure of a dataset occupies less than the raw data compressed
with a powerful traditional compressor such as p7zip. Further, instead of
requiring full decompression to access the data like a traditional compressor,
GraCT supports direct access to object trajectories or to their position at
specific time instants, as well as spatial range and nearest-neighbor queries
on time instants and/or time intervals.
  Compared to traditional methods for storing and indexing spatio-temporal
data, GraCT requires two orders of magnitude less space, and is competitive in
query times. In particular, thanks to its compressed representation, the GraCT
structure may reside in main memory in situations where any classical
uncompressed index must resort to disk, thereby being one or two orders of
magnitude faster.

model for various tasks in recent years. In this paper, we study how to improve
model accuracy of GBDT while preserving the strong guarantee of differential
privacy. Sensitivity and privacy budget are two key design aspects for the
effectiveness of differential private models. Existing solutions for GBDT with
differential privacy suffer from the significant accuracy loss due to too loose
sensitivity bounds and ineffective privacy budget allocations (especially
across different trees in the GBDT model). Loose sensitivity bounds lead to
more noise to obtain a fixed privacy level. Ineffective privacy budget
allocations worsen the accuracy loss especially when the number of trees is
large. Therefore, we propose a new GBDT training algorithm that achieves
tighter sensitivity bounds and more effective noise allocations. Specifically,
by investigating the property of gradient and the contribution of each tree in
GBDTs, we propose to adaptively control the gradients of training data for each
iteration and leaf node clipping in order to tighten the sensitivity bounds.
Furthermore, we design a novel boosting framework to allocate the privacy
budget between trees so that the accuracy loss can be further reduced. Our
experiments show that our approach can achieve much better model accuracy than
other baselines.

Horizon-AGN, we measure the relative alignments between the major axes of

focus on constraining the time evolution of the alignment of the main
progenitors of massive $z=0$ elliptical galaxies, the main weak lensing

stellar mass above $10^{10.4}$ M$_\odot$, transitions from having no alignment
with the tidal field at $z=3$, to a significant alignment by $z=1$. From

equations, transfer function descriptions, lumped systems, measurement data,
etc., the first step is to discretise them into finite-dimensional LDSs using,
e.g., the finite element method, autoregressive techniques, and interpolation.
The finite-dimensional component systems may satisfy various types of energy
(in)equalities due to passivity that require translation into a common form
such as the scattering passive representation. Only then can the component
systems be coupled in a desired feedback configuration by computing pairwise
Redheffer star products of LDSs.
  Unfortunately, a straightforward approach may fail due to ill-posedness of
feedback loops between component systems. Adversities are particularly likely
if some component systems have no energy dissipation at all, and this may
happen even if the fully coupled system could be described by a
finite-dimensional LDS. An approach is proposed for obtaining the coupled
system that is based on passivity preserving regularisation. Two practical
examples are given to illuminate the challenges and the proposed methods to
overcome them: the Butterworth low-pass filter and the termination of an

economic activities, the spot electricity price evolves as an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and therefore it has a mean-reverting behavior. The
current level of the company's installed power has a permanent impact on the

maximizing the total expected profits from selling electricity in the market,
net of the total expected proportional costs of installation. This problem is
modeled as a two-dimensional degenerate singular stochastic control problem in
which the installation strategy is identified as the company's control

adopts an estimated speech signal by an unsupervised speech source separation
with a statistical model. As a statistical model of microphone input signal, we
adopts a time-varying spatial covariance matrix (SCM) model which includes
reverberation and background noise submodels so as to achieve robustness
against reverberation and background noise. The DNN infers intermediate
variables which are needed for constructing the time-varying SCM. Speech source
separation is performed in a probabilistic manner so as to avoid overfitting to
separation error. Since there are multiple intermediate variables, a loss
function which evaluates a single intermediate variable is not applicable.
Instead, the proposed method adopts a loss function which evaluates the output
probabilistic signal directly based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD).
Gradient of the loss function can be back-propagated into the DNN through all
the intermediate variables. Experimental results under reverberant conditions
show that the proposed method can train the DNN efficiently even when the
number of training utterances is small, i.e., 1K.

regressing pose parameters, we tackle this challenging task with a
keypoint-based approach. Specifically, we propose a deep Hough voting network
to detect 3D keypoints of objects and then estimate the 6D pose parameters
within a least-squares fitting manner. Our method is a natural extension of
2D-keypoint approaches that successfully work on RGB based 6DoF estimation. It
allows us to fully utilize the geometric constraint of rigid objects with the
extra depth information and is easy for a network to learn and optimize.
Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
3D-keypoint detection in the 6D pose estimation task. Experimental results also
show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins on
several benchmarks. Code and video are available at

Finally, a siamese based matching system takes the retrieved cloth image and
matches it with the clothes in the dataset, giving us the top k matches. We
take a pre-trained inception-ResNet v1 module as a siamese network (trained

usually based on optimization or greedy approaches. These methods either
provide higher complexity or have sub-optimum performance. Moreover, the
performance of these methods mostly relies on the quality of the channel data.
In this work, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to improve the
performance and provide less computation time as compared to conventional
techniques. In fact, we design a convolutional neural network for MIMO
(CNN-MIMO) that accepts as input an imperfect channel matrix and gives the
analog precoder and combiners at the output. The procedure includes two main
stages. First, we develop an exhaustive search algorithm to select the analog
precoder and combiners from a predefined codebook maximizing the achievable
sum-rate. Then, the selected precoder and combiners are used as output labels
in the training stage of CNN-MIMO where the input-output pairs are obtained. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed method through numerous and extensive
simulations and show that the proposed DL framework outperforms conventional
techniques. Overall, CNN-MIMO provides a robust hybrid precoding scheme in the
presence of imperfections regarding the channel matrix. On top of this, the
proposed approach exhibits less computation time with comparison to the
optimization and codebook based approaches.

to employ a quasi-probability function to represent quantum states and
non-classical signatures. The Wigner function is a special quasi-probability
function because it allows to describe a quantum system in the phase space very
similar to the classical one. In this work we consider some informational
aspects of two-mode continuous variables systems. In particular we illustrate
how the mutual information may be useful to transfer the non-Gaussianity
property between two states. Moreover, the coherence of a Gaussian state is
studied when the system is coupled to a thermal reservoir but also with an

state-of-art Exponential-Generalized Gamma distribution (EGG) which was
recently proposed to model the underwater optical turbulence. Closed-form
expressions of outage probability, average error rate and ergodic capacity are
derived assuming heterodyne detection technique (HD). Also, asymptotic outage
expression is obtained for more performance insights. Results show that high

and stochastic repetitiveness in the temporal dimension, indicating that
different frames of DT possess a high similarity correlation that is critical
prior knowledge. However, existing methods cannot effectively learn a promising
synthesis model for high-dimensional DT from a small number of training data.
In this paper, we propose a novel DT synthesis method, which makes full use of
similarity prior knowledge to address this issue. Our method bases on the
proposed kernel similarity embedding, which not only can mitigate the
high-dimensionality and small sample issues, but also has the advantage of
modeling nonlinear feature relationship. Specifically, we first raise two
hypotheses that are essential for DT model to generate new frames using
similarity correlation. Then, we integrate kernel learning and extreme learning
machine into a unified synthesis model to learn kernel similarity embedding for
representing DT. Extensive experiments on DT videos collected from the internet
and two benchmark datasets, i.e., Gatech Graphcut Textures and Dyntex,
demonstrate that the learned kernel similarity embedding can effectively
exhibit the discriminative representation for DT. Accordingly, our method is
capable of preserving the long-term temporal continuity of the synthesized DT
sequences with excellent sustainability and generalization. Meanwhile, it
effectively generates realistic DT videos with fast speed and low computation,

abundance ratio (X) towards nearby molecular clouds. These works give
observational support to the C18O selective photodissociation due to the
interaction between the FUV radiation and the molecular gas. It is necessary to
increase the sample of molecular clouds located at different distances and
affected in different ways by nearby or embedded HII regions and OB
associations to study the selective photodissociation. Using 12CO, 13CO, and
C18O J=1-0 data obtained from the FOREST Survey, we analyze the filamentary
infrared dark cloud IRDC34.43+0.24 located at the distance of about 3.9 kpc.
This IRDC is related to several HII regions and YSOs. Assuming LTE we obtain:
0.8x10^16<N(13CO)<4x10^17cm^-2, 0.6x10^15<N(C18O)<4.4x10^16cm^-2, and 3<X<30
across the whole IRDC. Larger values of X were found towards portions of the
cloud related to the HII regions associated with the N61 and N62 bubbles and
with the photodissociation regions (PDRs), precisely the regions in which FUV
photons are strongly interacting with the molecular gas. Our result represents
an observational support to the C18O selectively photodissociation phenomenon
occurring in a quite distant filamentary IRDC. Additionally, based on IR data
from the Hi-GAL survey, the FUV radiation field was estimated in Habing units,
and the dust temperature and N(H2) distribution was studied. Using the average
of N(H2), values in close agreement with the canonical abundance ratios
[H2]/[13CO] and [H2]/[C18O] were derived. However, the obtained ranges in the
abundance ratios show that if an accurate analysis of the molecular gas is
required, the use of the canonical values may introduce some bias. Thus, it is
important to consider how the gas is irradiated by the far ultraviolet photons
across the molecular cloud. The analysis of X is a good tool to perform that.

maps an integer $m$ and a binary string $x$ to an $m$-bit code $p$, and if $m$

call a pair $(m,x)$ $\textit{achievable}$ for $({\cal C},{\cal D})$ if this
reconstruction is successful. We introduce the notion of an optimal compressor
${\cal C}_\text{opt}$, by the following universality property: For any
compressor-decompressor pair $({\cal C}, {\cal D})$, there exists a
decompressor ${\cal D}'$ such that if $(m,x)$ is achievable for $({\cal

{\cal D}')$, where $\Delta$ is some small value called the overhead. We show
that there exists an optimal compressor that has only polylogarithmic overhead
and works in probabilistic polynomial time. Differently said, for any pair
$({\cal C}, {\cal D})$, no matter how slow ${\cal C}$ is, or even if ${\cal C}$
is non-computable, ${\cal C}_{\text{opt}}$ is a fixed compressor that in
polynomial time produces codes almost as short as those of ${\cal C}$. The cost
is that the corresponding decompressor is slower.
  We also show that each such optimal compressor can be used for distributed
compression, in which case it can achieve optimal compression rates, as given
in the Slepian-Wolf theorem, and even for the Kolmogorov complexity variant of
this theorem. Moreover, the overhead is logarithmic in the number of sources,
and unlike previous implementations of Slepian-Wolf coding, meaningful
compression can still be achieved if the number of sources is much larger than
the length of the compressed strings.

thick disc, thin disc and bulge, similarly to what happens for the
$\alpha$-elements. We can nicely reproduce the three sequences by assuming
different timescales of formation and star formation efficiencies for the three
different components, with the thin disc forming on a longer timescale of
formation with respect to the thick disc and bulge. On the other hand, in the
[X/Fe] vs [Fe/H] diagrams for Zr, La and Ce, the three populations are mixed

predictions for the different Galactic components, but the observed behaviour
can be also reproduced by assuming different star formation histories in the

is an important and challenging problem that has received much attention in the
past decade. A key ingredient for successful recommendations is an effective
similarity metric between two objects, and models that leverage the current
context to constrain the recommendations. This work proposes a model for random
object generation that introduces two key novel elements: (i) a similarity
metric based on the distance between objects in a given object sequence, that
is also used to measure similarity between meta-data associated with the
objects, such as artists and genres; (ii) a hierarchical graph model with
different graphs each associated with a different meta-data. A biased random
walk in each graph that are coupled and synchronized dictate the random
generation of objects, leveraging the current context to constrain randomness.
The proposed model is fully parameterized from sequences of objects, requiring
no external parameters or tuning. The model is applied to a large music dataset
with over 1 million playlists generating a hierarchy with three layers (genre,
artist, track). Results indicate its superiority in generating actual full
playlists against two baseline models.

Translation (MT) models. However, collecting large amounts of parallel data for
ST task is more difficult compared to the ASR and MT tasks. Previous studies
have proposed the use of transfer learning approaches to overcome the above
difficulty. These approaches benefit from weakly supervised training data, such
as ASR speech-to-transcript or MT text-to-text translation pairs. However, the
parameters in these models are updated independently of each task, which may
lead to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we adopt a meta-learning algorithm
to train a modality agnostic multi-task model that transfers knowledge from
source tasks=ASR+MT to target task=ST where ST task severely lacks data. In the
meta-learning phase, the parameters of the model are exposed to vast amounts of
speech transcripts (e.g., English ASR) and text translations (e.g.,
English-German MT). During this phase, parameters are updated in such a way to
understand speech, text representations, the relation between them, as well as
act as a good initialization point for the target ST task. We evaluate the
proposed meta-learning approach for ST tasks on English-German (En-De) and
English-French (En-Fr) language pairs from the Multilingual Speech Translation

non-orthogonal multiple access (N-NOMA) technique for the uplink coordinated
multi-point transmission (CoMP). In the considered scenario, multiple base
stations collaborate with each other to serve a single user, referred to as the
CoMP user, which is the same as for conventional CoMP. However, unlike
conventional CoMP, each base station in N-NOMA opportunistically serves an
extra user, referred to as the NOMA user, while serving the CoMP user at the
same bandwidth. The CoMP user is typically located far from the base stations,
whereas users close to the base stations are scheduled as NOMA users. Hence,
the channel conditions of the two kind of users are very distinctive, which
facilitates the implementation of NOMA. Compared to the conventional orthogonal
multiple access based CoMP scheme, where multiple base stations serve a single
CoMP user only, the proposed N-NOMA scheme can support larger connectivity by
serving the extra NOMA users, and improve the spectral efficiency by avoiding
the CoMP user solely occupying the spectrum. A stochastic geometry approach is
applied to model the considered N-NOMA scenario as a Poisson cluster process,
based on which closed-form analytical expressions for outage probabilities and
ergodic rates are obtained. Numerical results are presented to show the
accuracy of the analytical results and also demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed N-NOMA scheme.

one-dimensional maps the existence of 3-cycles implies chaos. It is shown that
these n-cycles collide with the switching boundary in a border-collision

phenomenon is observed. PSR B0031-07 is unique as it is the only source in this
group which has multiple stable drift modes. For both drift modes visible at
our observing frequency centered at 1369 MHz, the modulation of polarization
modes is synchronous with the drifting subpulses. In one of the drift modes, a
discontinuity in the modulation pattern of polarization properties occurs
halfway through the pulse, coinciding with a slight change in the slope of the
intensity drift band. In contrast to what has been suggested for this pulsar in
the past, this, plus other differences in the polarization of the modulated
emission observed for the two drift modes, suggests that a drift mode change is
more than a change in the underlying carousel radius and that magnetospheric
propagation effects play an important role. The ellipticity evolves
asymmetrically in time during the modulation cycle, which in the framework of a
carousel model implies that the polarized sub-beams are asymmetric with respect
to the sense of circulation, something which is not observed for other pulsars.
Birefringence in the magnetosphere, resulting in the orthogonal polarization
modes to spatially separate, is not enough to explain these results. It is
argued that more complex magnetospheric processes, which possibly allow
conversion between orthogonal polarization modes, play a role.

  The second part is devoted to the construction of the Cheeger energy,

activities has raised concerns about the fairness, equity and ethics of
automated decisions. Predictive models are often developed using biased
datasets and thus retain or even exacerbate biases in their decisions and
recommendations. Removing the sensitive covariates, such as gender or race, is
insufficient to remedy this issue since the biases may be retained due to other
related covariates. We present a regularization approach to this problem that
trades off predictive accuracy of the learned models (with respect to biased
labels) for the fairness in terms of statistical parity, i.e. independence of
the decisions from the sensitive covariates. In particular, we consider a
general framework of regularized empirical risk minimization over reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces and impose an additional regularizer of dependence
between predictors and sensitive covariates using kernel-based measures of
dependence, namely the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and its
normalized version. This approach leads to a closed-form solution in the case
of squared loss, i.e. ridge regression. Moreover, we show that the dependence
regularizer has an interpretation as modifying the corresponding Gaussian
process (GP) prior. As a consequence, a GP model with a prior that encourages
fairness to sensitive variables can be derived, allowing principled
hyperparameter selection and studying of the relative relevance of covariates
under fairness constraints. Experimental results in synthetic examples and in
real problems of income and crime prediction illustrate the potential of the
approach to improve fairness of automated decisions.

molecules spanned by the R vibrational and $\theta$ rotational coordinates. Our
showcase example is the widely studied lithium-fluoride (LiF) molecule for
which the two lowest $\Sigma$ states are nonadiabatically coupled at an avoided
crossing (AC), furthermore a low-lying pure repulsive $\Pi$ state is
energetically close. Optical pumping of the system in the ground state thus
results in two dissociation channels: one indirect route via the AC in the
ground $\Sigma$ state and one direct path in the $\Pi$ state. We show that
applying THz control pulses with specific time delays relative to the pumping,
can significantly alter the population dynamics, as well as, the kinetic energy
and angular distribution of the photofragments.

room-temperature transport properties are controlled by quantum interference
(QI), is an essential step in the scale-up QI effects from single molecules to
parallel arrays of molecules. Recently, the effect of destructive QI (DQI) on
the electrical conductance of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been
investigated. Here, through a combined experimental and theoretical
investigation, we demonstrate chemical control of different forms of
constructive QI (CQI) in cross-plane transport through SAMs and assess its
influence on cross-plane thermoelectricity in SAMs. It is known that the
electrical conductance of single molecules can be controlled in a deterministic
manner, by chemically varying their connectivity to external electrodes. Here,
by employing synthetic methodologies to vary the connectivity of terminal
anchor groups around aromatic anthracene cores, and by forming SAMs of the
resulting molecules, we clearly demonstrate that this signature of CQI can be
translated into SAM-on-gold molecular films. We show that the conductance of
vertical molecular junctions formed from anthracene-based molecules with two
different connectivities differ by a factor of approximately 16, in agreement
with theoretical predictions for their conductance ratio based on constructive
QI effects within the core. We also demonstrate that for molecules with thiol
anchor groups, the Seebeck coefficient of such films is connectivity dependent
and with an appropriate choice of connectivity can be boosted by ~50%. This
demonstration of QI and its influence on thermoelectricity in SAMs represents a
critical step towards functional ultra-thin-film devices for future
thermoelectric and molecular-scale electronics applications.

we allow for disorder that breaks time-reversal symmetry. For small Bogoliubov
quasi-particle weight, relevant for systems with strongly incoherent normal

machine-learning applications has led to a significant contribution to the
field of gait analysis, e.g., in increasing the classification performance. In
order to ensure the generalizability of the machine-learning models, different
data preprocessing steps are usually carried out to process the measured raw
data before the classifications. In the past, various methods have been used
for each of these preprocessing steps. However, there are hardly any standard
procedures or rather systematic comparisons of these different methods and
their impact on the classification performance. Therefore, the aim of this
analysis is to compare different combinations of commonly applied data
preprocessing steps and test their effects on the classification performance of
gait patterns. A publicly available dataset on intra-individual changes of gait
patterns was used for this analysis. Forty-two healthy participants performed 6
sessions of 15 gait trials for 1 day. For each trial, two force plates recorded
the 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The data was preprocessed with the
following steps: GRF filtering, time derivative, time normalization, data
reduction, weight normalization and data scaling. Subsequently, combinations of
all methods from each preprocessing step were analyzed by comparing their
prediction performance in a six-session classification using Support Vector
Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Convolutional
Neural Networks. In conclusion, the present results provide first
domain-specific recommendations for commonly applied data preprocessing methods
and might help to build more comparable and more robust classification models

transient absorption features in H-$\alpha$. By using different methods of
extrapolating this field from the surface measurements, we determine locations

absorption features produced with a potential field extrapolation match well
this those observed, while those from a non-potential field do not. In systems
where the rotation and magnetic axes are well aligned, up to $50\%$ of the

the degree of orientation, and $d\ge2$ is the dimension. Building on
similarities with the one-constant Ericksen energy, we propose a
structure-preserving finite element method for the computation of equilibrium
configurations. We prove stability and consistency of the method without
regularization, and $\Gamma$-convergence of the discrete energies towards the
continuous one as the mesh size goes to zero. We design an alternating
direction gradient flow algorithm for the solution of the discrete problems,
and we show that such a scheme decreases the energy monotonically. Finally, we
illustrate the method's capabilities by presenting some numerical simulations
in two and three dimensions including non-orientable line fields.

functional analysis, as much as possible. Thus I concentrate on discrete and
semi-discrete cases, and always assume compactness for the underlying spaces.
However, some fundamental knowledge of measure theory and convexity is
unavoidable. In order to make it as self-contained as possible I included an
appendix with some basic definitions and results. I believe that any graduate
student in mathematics, as well as advanced undergraduate students, can read
and understand this book. Some chapters (in particular in Parts II\&III ) can
also be interesting for experts. Starting with the the most fundamental, fully
discrete problem I attempted to place optimal transport as a particular case of
the celebrated stable marriage problem. From there we proceed to the partition
problem, which can be formulated as a transport from a continuous space to a
discrete one. Applications to information theory and game theory (cooperative
and non-cooperative) are introduced as well.
  Finally, the general case of transport between two compact measure spaces is
introduced as a coupling between two semi-discrete transports.

unconditional uniqueness, and proving it often requires some additional work.
In the last decade, unconditional uniqueness has been shown for some canonical

be regarded as a variant of the (Poincar\'e-Dulac) normal form reduction. In
this article, we aim to provide an abstract framework for establishing
unconditional uniqueness as well as existence of certain weak solutions via
infinite iteration of the normal form reduction. In particular, in an abstract

repeatedly to generate all multilinear estimates of arbitrarily high degrees

applying it to various equations, including the cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger

the cubic derivative NLS, and the Zakharov system, for which new results on

high-dimensional functions from meshfree samples, i.e., sampling points and
corresponding target values. A crucial ingredient for this to be successful is
the distribution of the sampling points. Since the computation of an optimal
selection of sampling points may be an infeasible task, one promising option is
to use greedy methods.
  Although these methods may be very effective, depending on the specific
greedy criterion the chosen points might quickly lead to instabilities in the
computation. To circumvent this problem, we introduce and investigate a new
class of \textit{stabilized} greedy kernel algorithms, which can be used to
create a scale of new selection strategies.
  We analyze these algorithms, and in particular we prove convergence results
and quantify in a precise way the distribution of the selected points. These
results allow to prove, in the case of certain Sobolev kernels, that the
algorithms have optimal stability and optimal convergence rates, including for
functions outside the native space of the kernel. The results also apply to the
case of the usual $P$-greedy algorithm, significantly improving
state-of-the-art results available in the literature. Illustrative experiments

backhaul link, which hinders the wireless access capacity improvement. To
overcome the backhaul spectrum occupation problem and improve the network
throughput in the existing mABHetNets, we introduce the cache at base stations
(BSs). In detail, by caching popular files at small base stations
(SBSs),mABHetNets can offload the backhaul link traffic and transfer the
redundant backhaul spectrum to the access link to increase the network
throughout. However, introducing cache in SBSs will also incur additional power
consumption and reduce the transmission power, which can lower the network
throughput.In this paper, we investigate spectrum partition between the access
link and the backhaul link as well as cache allocation to improve the network
throughput in mABHetNets. With the stochastic geometry tool, we develop an
analytical framework to characterize cache-enabled mABHetNets and obtain the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distributions in line-of-sight

be too large to be unambiguously observed in an experiment. In this sense, 2D
is a marginal dimension between one-dimension, where all states are strongly

localisation and delocalisation exists as the energy is increased. Here we
report the results of an experiment measuring the 2D transport of ultracold

essentially a quantum system. Thus, a quantum system must be described relative
to a quantum reference frame (QRF). Further requirements on QRF include using
only relational observables and not assuming the existence of external
reference frame. To address these requirements, two approaches are proposed in
the literature. The first one is an operational approach (F. Giacomini, et al,
Nat. Comm. 10:494, 2019) which focuses on the quantization of transformation
between QRFs. The second approach attempts to derive the quantum transformation
between QRFs from first principles (A. Vanrietvelde, et al, \textit{Quantum}
4:225, 2020). Such first principle approach describes physical systems as
symmetry induced constrained Hamiltonian systems. The Dirac quantization of
such systems before removing redundancy is interpreted as perspective-neutral
description. Then, a systematic redundancy reduction procedure is introduced to
derive description from perspective of a QRF. The first principle approach
recovers some of the results from the operational approach, but not yet include
an important part of a quantum theory - the measurement theory. This paper is
intended to bridge the gap. We show that the von Neumann quantum measurement
theory can be embedded into the perspective-neutral framework. This allows us
to successfully recover the results found in the operational approach, with the
advantage that the transformation operator can be derived from the first
principle. In addition, the formulation presented here reveals several
interesting conceptual insights. For instance, the projection operation in
measurement needs to be performed after redundancy reduction. These results
represent one step forward in understanding how quantum measurement should be
formulated when the reference frame is also a quantum system.

sequential learning problems with arbitrary sequence lengths, since for a range
of values of this hyperparameter the gradient neither vanishes nor explodes.
Additionally, we provide a heuristic for the optimal choice of the

by V. V. Kozlov is considered in the context of rigid body dynamics. Universal
requirements for dry friction tensor formulated by V. V. Kozlov are
complemented by a condition taking into account the contact nature of dry
friction and applied to several models. For the famous Painleve problem a
generalized Coulomb-Amontons' force without singularities, yet such that the
dissipation takes place only at the point of contact, is found. By the example
of the motion of a rigid ball on a plane with a single point of contact, it is
shown that these principles are consistent with the well-known equations,
studied by G.-G. Coriolis. Further, a ball simultaneously touching two
perpendicular planes at two points of contact is considered. The corresponding
equations of motion are derived and analyzed. An exact particular solution that
describes a technique used in practice in billiards is obtained. It is shown
that unlike the single contact case, the Lagrange multipliers can depend on
friction coefficients. With this in mind, a generalization of the conditions on

emerged as critical challenges in harnessing complex and diverse architectures
today to obtain high performance and energy efficiency. While there is abundant
research, and thus significant improvements, at different levels of the stack
that address these very challenges, in this thesis, we observe that we are
fundamentally limited by the interfaces and abstractions between the
application and the underlying system/hardware--specifically, the
hardware-software interface. The existing narrow interfaces pose two critical
challenges. First, significant effort and expertise are required to write
high-performance code to harness the full potential of today's diverse and
sophisticated hardware. Second, as a hardware/system designer, architecting
faster and more efficient systems is challenging as the vast majority of the
program's semantic content gets lost in translation with today's
hardware-software interface. Moving towards the future, these challenges in
programmability and efficiency will be even more intractable as we architect
increasingly heterogeneous and sophisticated systems.
  This thesis makes the case for rich low-overhead cross-layer abstractions as
a highly effective means to address the above challenges. These abstractions
are designed to communicate higher-level program information from the
application to the underlying system and hardware in a highly efficient manner,
requiring only minor additions to the existing interfaces. In doing so, they
enable a rich space of hardware-software cooperative mechanisms to optimize for
performance. We propose 4 different approaches to designing richer abstractions
between the application, system software, and hardware architecture in
different contexts to significantly improve programmability, portability, and
performance in CPUs and GPUs.

selection strategies of the users can be investigated dynamically. Unlike the
conventional studies on the long-run model, we incorporate the memory effect
and consider the fact that the decision-making of the users is affected by
their memory, i.e., their past service experience. Namely, the users select the
network based on not only their instantaneous achievable service experience but
also their past service experience within their memory. Specifically, we model
and study the interaction among the users in the framework of fractional
evolutionary game based on the classical evolutionary game theory and the
concept of the power-law memory. We analytically prove that the equilibrium of
the fractional evolutionary game exists, is unique and uniformly stable. We
also numerically demonstrate the stability of the fractional evolutionary
equilibrium. Extensive numerical results have been conducted to evaluate the
performance of the fractional evolutionary game. The numerical results have
revealed some insightful findings. For example, the user in the fractional
evolutionary game with positive memory effect can achieve a higher cumulative
utility compared with the user in the fractional evolutionary game with
negative memory effect. Moreover, the fractional evolutionary game with

believe that theRussian government interfered with the election of 2016 by
controlling malicioussocial media accounts on twitter, such as trolls and bots
accounts. Both of them willbroadcast fake news, derail the conversations about
election, and mislead people.Therefore, this paper will focus on analysing some
of the twitter dataset about theelection of 2016 by using NLP methods and
looking for some interesting patterns ofwhether the Russian government
interfered with the election or not. We apply topicmodel on the given twitter
dataset to extract some interesting topics and analysethe meaning, then we
implement supervised topic model to retrieve the relationshipbetween topics to
category which is left troll or right troll, and analyse the
pattern.Additionally, we will do sentiment analysis to analyse the attitude of
the tweet. Afterextracting typical tweets from interesting topic, sentiment
analysis offers the ability toknow whether the tweet supports this topic or
not. Based on comprehensive analysisand evaluation, we find interesting
patterns of the dataset as well as some meaningfultopics.

based on a laser-driven cold-field emission source. We first describe the
instrument before reporting on numerical simulations of the laser-driven
electron emission. These simulations predict the temporal and spectral
properties of the femtosecond electron pulses generated in our ultrafast
electron source. We then discuss the effects that contribute to the spatial,
temporal and spectral broadening of these electron pulses during their
propagation from the electron source to the sample and finally to the detectors
of the electron microscope. The spectro-temporal properties are then
characterized in an electron/photon cross-correlation experiment based on the
detection of electron energy gains. We finally illustrate the potential of this
instrument for ultrafast electron holography and ultrafast electron
diffraction.

microstructures with mechanical and chemical properties tailored to their
intended use. One common technique is stereolithography, which has recently
been augmented in response to modern demands to support smaller features,
larger build areas, and/or faster speeds. However, a limitation is that such
systems typically utilize a single-aperture imaging configuration, which
restricts their ability to produce microstructures at large volumes due to the
tradeoff between the image resolution and image field area. In this paper, we
demonstrate three versatile imaging functions based on the coupling a planar
lens array, namely, parallel image transfer, kaleidoscopic superposition, and
integral reconstruction, the combination of which is termed integral
lithography. In this approach, the individual microlenses in the planar lens
array maintain a high numerical aperture and are employed in the creation of
digital light patterns that can expand the printable area by the number of
microlenses (103-104). The proposed lens array-based integral imaging system
provides the concurrent ability to scale-up and scale-down incoming image
fields, thereby enabling the scalable stereolithographic fabrication of
three-dimensional features that surpass the resolution-to-area scaling limit.
The proposed system opens up new possibilities for producing periodic
microarchitectures spanning four orders of magnitude from micrometers to
centimeters that can be applied to biological scaffolds, metastructures,
chemical reactors, and functional surfaces.

Duarte","How do we drive deep eutectic systems towards an industrial reality?",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep eutectic systems (DES) have received considerable attention in the past
5 years of research. Up to 2013 little had been explored over these systems
both in which concerns fundamentals and applications. The definition of a deep
eutectic system is still controversial and in this manuscript we highlight the
different definitions proposed in the literature and discuss what, in our
opinion, should be pursued in order to have an agreement in the scientific
community studying this field. From the definition of DES to its applications
also interesting changes have been observed in the topics published. From
electrochemistry to newer applications, such as cryopreservation, the field is
evolving as new outcomes on DES properties are unraveled. We herein present and
discuss new trends on DES research and present some perspectives on what we
consider to be the most promising applications of DES at industrial scale.
