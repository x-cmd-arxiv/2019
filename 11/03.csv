(including Einstein's equations without a cosmological constant) to equations
that possess solutions exhibiting characteristics of immediate relevance to
current observational astronomy. Our approach is formulated as a classical
Einstein-vector-scalar-Maxwell-fluid field theory on a spacetime with
three-sphere spatial sections. Analytic cosmological solutions are found using
local charts familiar from standard LFRW cosmological models. These solutions
can be used to describe different types of evolution for the metric scale
factor, the Hubble, jerk and de-acceleration functions, the scalar spacetime
curvature and the Kretschmann invariant. The cosmological sector of the theory
accommodates a particular single big-bang scenario followed by an eternal
exponential acceleration of the scale factor. Such a solution does not require
an externally prescribed fluid equation of state and leads to a number of new
predictions including a current value of the ""jerk"" parameter, ""Hopfian-like""
source-free Maxwell field configurations with magnetic helicity and
distributional ""bi-polar"" solutions exhibiting a new charge conjugation
symmetry. An approximate scheme for field perturbations about this particular
cosmology is explored and its consequences for a thermalisation process and a
thermal history are derived, leading to a prediction of the time interval
between the big-bang and the decoupling era. Finally it is shown that field
couplings exist where both vector and scalar localised linearised perturbations
exhibit dispersive wave-packet behaviours. The scalar perturbation may also
give rise to Yukawa solutions associated with a massive Klein-Gordon particle.
It is argued that the vector and scalar fields may offer candidates for
""dark-energy"" and ""dark-matter"" respectively.

often deployed in hostile environments. The q-composite key predistribution
scheme has been recognized as a suitable approach to secure WSNs. Although the
q-composite scheme has received much attention in the literature, there is
still a lack of rigorous analysis for secure WSNs operating under the
q-composite scheme in consideration of the unreliability of links. One main
difficulty lies in analyzing the network topology whose links are not
independent. Wireless links can be unreliable in practice due to the presence
of physical barriers between sensors or because of harsh environmental
conditions severely impairing communications. In this paper, we resolve the
difficult challenge and investigate k-connectivity in secure WSNs operating
under the q-composite scheme with unreliable communication links modeled as
independent on/off channels, where k-connectivity ensures connectivity despite
the failure of any (k - 1) sensors or links, and connectivity means that any
two sensors can find a path in between for secure communication. Specifically,
we derive the asymptotically exact probability and a zero-one law for
k-connectivity. We further use the theoretical results to provide design
guidelines for secure WSNs. Experimental results also confirm the validity of
our analytical findings.

latex particles rearranged into regular hexagonal lattices upon freezing of the
surfactant adsorption layer. (2) Spontaneous particle desorption from the drop
surface was observed at a certain temperature - this phenomenon is rather
remarkable, as the solid particles are known to irreversibly adsorb on fluid

growing outwards from the drop surface, thus creating a shape resembling the
Gorgon head from Greek mythology. We provide mechanistic explanations of all

enhance the imperceptibility and the robustness. The imperceptibility
requirement is achieved by using magnitudes of DFT coefficients while the
robustness improvement is ensured by applying DCT to the DFT coefficients

  Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)",,"10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292647",,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differential privacy is a rigorous privacy standard that has been applied to
a range of data analysis tasks. To broaden the application scenarios of
differential privacy when data records have dependencies, the notion of
Bayesian differential privacy has been recently proposed. However, it is
unknown whether Bayesian differential privacy preserves three nice properties
of differential privacy: sequential composability, parallel composability, and
post-processing. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this
question; i.e., Bayesian differential privacy still have these properties. The
idea behind sequential composability is that if we have $m$ algorithms $Y_1,
Y_2, \ldots, Y_m$, where $Y_{\ell}$ is independently $\epsilon_{\ell}$-Bayesian
differential private for ${\ell}=1,2,\ldots,m$, then by feeding the result of
$Y_1$ into $Y_2$, the result of $Y_2$ into $Y_3$, and so on, we will finally
have an $\sum_{\ell=1}^m \epsilon_{\ell}$-Bayesian differential private
algorithm. For parallel composability, we consider the situation where a
database is partitioned into $m$ disjoint subsets. The $\ell$-th subset is
input to a Bayesian differential private algorithm $Y_{\ell}$, for
${\ell}=1,2,\ldots,m$. Then the parallel composition of $Y_1$, $Y_2$, $\ldots$,
$Y_m$ will be $\max_{\ell=1}^m \epsilon_{\ell}$-Bayesian differential private.
The post-processing property means that a data analyst, without additional
knowledge about the private database, cannot compute a function of the output
of a Bayesian differential private algorithm and reduce its privacy guarantee.

training set and the holdout (i.e., testing) set. For instance, the training
set is used to learn a predictor, and then the holdout set is used for
estimating the accuracy of the predictor on the true distribution. However,
often in practice, the holdout dataset is reused and the estimates tested on
the holdout dataset are chosen adaptively based on the results of prior
estimates, leading to that the predictor may become dependent of the holdout
set. Hence, overfitting may occur, and the learned models may not generalize
well to the unseen datasets. Prior studies have established connections between
the stability of a learning algorithm and its ability to generalize, but the
traditional generalization is not robust to adaptive composition. Recently,
Dwork et al. in NIPS, STOC, and Science 2015 show that the holdout dataset from
i.i.d. data samples can be reused in adaptive statistical learning, if the
estimates are perturbed and coordinated using techniques developed for
differential privacy, which is a widely used notion to quantify privacy. Yet,
the results of Dwork et al. are applicable to only the case of i.i.d. samples.
In contrast, correlations between data samples exist because of various
behavioral, social, and genetic relationships between users. Our results in
adaptive statistical learning generalize the results of Dwork et al. for i.i.d.
data samples to arbitrarily correlated data. Specifically, we show that the
holdout dataset from correlated samples can be reused in adaptive statistical
learning, if the estimates are perturbed and coordinated using techniques
developed for Bayesian differential privacy, which is a privacy notion recently
introduced by Yang et al. in SIGMOD 2015 to broaden the application scenarios

highly effective deep models for 3D shape generation, directly from 2D images.
This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is still
limited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which is
invaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key
factor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit
representations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of
shape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based
representations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle
varying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex
shapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address
the fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference
without the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains
nontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit
surfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision;
and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local
smoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to
be a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose
a novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field
supervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces,
which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D
shape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both

change of scale in the special case of a scale free dynamical system that can
be described in terms of a Lagrangian, that itself scales inversely with time.
Crucially, this means symmetries under change of scale can exist in dynamical
systems under certain constraints. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a
generalised scale invariant Lagrangian - in the form of a power series
expansion - that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian
furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models (i.e., state space models

mapped DLA of the hardware accelerator. We argue that existing hardware Trojan
attacks highlighted in literature have no qualitative means how definite they
are of the triggering of the Trojan. Also, most inserted Trojans show a obvious
spike in the number of hardware resources utilized on the accelerator at the
time of triggering the Trojan or when the payload is active. In this paper, we
introduce a hardware Trojan attack called Input Interception Attack (IIA). In
this attack, we make use of the statistical properties of layer-by-layer output
to ensure that asides from being stealthy. Our IIA is able to trigger with some
measure of definiteness. Moreover, this IIA attack is tested on DLA used to
classify MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets. The attacked design utilizes
approximately up to 2% more LUTs respectively compared to the un-compromised
designs. Finally, this paper discusses potential defensive mechanisms that
could be used to combat such hardware Trojans based attack in hardware
accelerators for DLA.

measurements for the mean magnetic field strength of CI Tau is B of ~2.2 kG.
This value is typical compared with measurements for other young T Tauri stars
and provides an important contribution to the existing sample given it is the
only known developed planetary system hosted by a young classical T Tauri star.
Moreover, we potentially identify an interesting and suggestive trend when
plotting the effective temperature and the mean magnetic field strength of T

network terminology, we consider quadratic performance metrics defined by the
L2-norm of position and velocity based response functions given impulsive
inputs to each vehicle. We exploit the spectral properties of weighted graph
Laplacians and output performance matrices to derive a novel method of
computing the closed-form solutions for this general class of performance
metrics, which include H2-norm based quantities as special cases. We then
explore the effect of the interplay between network properties (e.g. edge
directionality and connectivity) and the control strategy on the overall
network performance. More precisely, for systems whose interconnection is
described by graphs with normal Laplacian L, we characterize the role of
directionality by comparing their performance with that of their undirected
counterparts, represented by the Hermitian part of L. We show that, for
single-integrator networks, directed and undirected graphs perform identically.
However, for double-integrator networks, graph directionality -- expressed by
the eigenvalues of L with nonzero imaginary part -- can significantly degrade
performance. Interestingly in many cases, well-designed feedback can also
exploit directionality to mitigate degradation or even improve the performance
to exceed that of the undirected case. Finally we focus on a system coherence
metric -- aggregate deviation from the state average -- to investigate the
relationship between performance and degree of connectivity, leading to
somewhat surprising findings. For example increasing the number of neighbors on
a \omega-nearest neighbor directed graph does not necessarily improve
performance. Similarly, we demonstrate equivalence in performance between
all-to-one and all-to-all communication graphs.

$ax+b$-semigroups of algebraic integers in which the multiplicative part is
restricted to a congruence monoid, as in recent work of Bruce generalizing
earlier work of Cuntz, Deninger, and Laca. Here we realize the extremal
low-temperature KMS states as generalized Gibbs states by constructing concrete
representations induced from extremal traces of certain group C*-algebras. We
use these representations to compute the Murray--von Neumann type of extremal
KMS states and we determine explicit partition functions for the type I factor
states. The collection of partition functions that arise this way is an
invariant under $\mathbb{R}$-equivariant isomorphism of C*-dynamical systems,
which produces further invariants through the analysis of the topological
structure of the KMS state space. As an application we characterize several
features of the underlying number field and congruence monoid in terms of these
invariants. In most cases our systems have infinitely many type I factor KMS
states and at least one type II factor KMS state at the same inverse
temperature and there are infinitely many partition functions. In order to deal
with this multiplicity, we establish, in the context of general C*-dynamical
systems, a precise way to associate partition functions to extremal KMS states
that are of type I, and we then show that for our systems these partition
functions depend only on connected components in the KMS simplex. The
discussion of partition functions of general C*-dynamical systems may be of
interest by itself and is likely to have applications in other contexts, so we
include it in a self-contained initial section that is partly expository and is
independent of the number-theoretic background and of the technical results
about congruence monoids.

formula on a lattice, together with heuristic arguments, we discuss the
derivation of theoretical bounds for the discrepancy function of periodic

experiments that are required in order to generate the optimal distributions of

association problem, which plays a key role in the tracking-by-detection
paradigm of multi-object tracking. The global data association problem was
extensively studied under the minimum-cost flow framework, which is
theoretically attractive as being flexible and globally solvable. However, the
high computational burden has been a long-standing obstacle to its wide
adoption in practice. While enjoying the same theoretical advantages and
maintaining the same optimal solution as the minimum-cost flow framework, our
new framework has a better theoretical complexity bound and leads to orders of
practical efficiency improvement. This new framework is motivated by the
observation that minimum-cost flow only partially models the data association
problem and must be accompanied by an additional and time-consuming searching
scheme to determine the optimal object number. By employing a minimum-cost
circulation framework, we eliminate the searching step and naturally integrate
the number of objects into the optimization problem. By exploring the special
property of the associated graph, that is, an overwhelming majority of the
vertices are with unit capacity, we designed an implementation of the framework
and proved it has the best theoretical complexity so far for the global data
association problem. We evaluated our method with 40 experiments on five MOT
benchmark datasets. Our method was always the most efficient and averagely 53
to 1,192 times faster than the three state-of-the-art methods. When our method
served as a sub-module for global data association methods using higher-order
constraints, similar efficiency improvement was attained. We further
illustrated through several case studies how the improved computational
efficiency enables more sophisticated tracking models and yields better
tracking accuracy.

crystallisation, appropriate order parameters which emphasise 6-fold symmetry
are a natural choice, but for vitrification the choice of order parameter is
less clear cut. Previous work has highlighted the importance of icosahedral
local structure as the glass transition is approached. However, counting
icosahedra or related motifs is not a continuous order parameter in the same
way as, for example, the bond-orientational order parameters $Q_{6}$ and $W_6$.
In this work we investigate the suitability of using pentagonal bipyramid

structures, as a finer order parameter to investigate the glass transition. We
explore various structural and dynamic properties and show that this new
approach produces many of the same findings as simple icosahedral membership,

the transport plans between quantum states are in natural correspondence with
quantum channels, such that the transport can be interpreted as a physical
operation on the system. Our main result is the proof of a modified triangle
inequality for our transport distance. We also prove that the distance between
a quantum state and itself is intimately connected with the Wigner-Yanase
metric on the manifold of quantum states. We then specialize to quantum
Gaussian systems, which provide the mathematical model for the electromagnetic
radiation in the quantum regime. We prove that the noiseless quantum Gaussian
attenuators and amplifiers are the optimal transport plans between thermal
quantum Gaussian states, and that our distance recovers the classical
Wasserstein distance in the semiclassical limit.

Unfortunately, those assumptions are commonly violated in practice. In this
work, we tackle such problem by focusing on domain generalization: a
formalization where the data generating process at test time may yield samples
from never-before-seen domains (distributions). Our work relies on the
following lemma: by minimizing a notion of discrepancy between all pairs from a
set of given domains, we also minimize the discrepancy between any pairs of
mixtures of domains. Using this result, we derive a generalization bound for
our setting. We then show that low risk over unseen domains can be achieved by
representing the data in a space where (i) the training distributions are
indistinguishable, and (ii) relevant information for the task at hand is
preserved. Minimizing the terms in our bound yields an adversarial formulation
which estimates and minimizes pairwise discrepancies. We validate our proposed
strategy on standard domain generalization benchmarks, outperforming a number
of recently introduced methods. Notably, we tackle a real-world application
where the underlying data corresponds to multi-channel electroencephalography
time series from different subjects, each considered as a distinct domain.

the nonlinear Hall effect in the two-dimensional (2D) 1$H$-MX$_2$ (M=Nb, Ta;

these 2D monolayer metals have the desired piezotronics property: without

yielded the finding that classification accuracy of CNTK on CIFAR-10 is within
6-7% of that of that of the corresponding CNN architecture (best figure being
around 78%) which is interesting performance for a fixed kernel. Here we show
how to significantly enhance the performance of these kernels using two ideas.
(1) Modifying the kernel using a new operation called Local Average Pooling
(LAP) which preserves efficient computability of the kernel and inherits the
spirit of standard data augmentation using pixel shifts. Earlier papers were
unable to incorporate naive data augmentation because of the quadratic training
cost of kernel regression. This idea is inspired by Global Average Pooling
(GAP), which we show for CNN-GP and CNTK is equivalent to full translation data
augmentation. (2) Representing the input image using a pre-processing technique
proposed by Coates et al. (2011), which uses a single convolutional layer
composed of random image patches. On CIFAR-10, the resulting kernel, CNN-GP
with LAP and horizontal flip data augmentation, achieves 89% accuracy, matching
the performance of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Note that this is the
best such result we know of for a classifier that is not a trained neural

CaCuO2, RNiO2 (R = Nd, La) has itinerant electrons in the rare-earth spacer

substantially stronger than previously thought. The dominant hybridization
comes from an interstitial-s orbital rather than rare-earth-d orbitals, due to
a large inter-cell hopping. Because of the hybridization, Ni local moment is
screened by itinerant electrons and the critical U_Ni for long-range magnetic
ordering is increased. Our work shows that the electronic structure of RNiO2 is
distinct from CaCuO2, implying that the observed superconductivity in

Fireball networks have been developed globally in a unified effort to increase
this number by using multiple observatories to record, triangulate, and
dynamically analyse ablating meteoroids as they enter our atmosphere. The
accuracy of the chosen meteoroid triangulation method directly influences the
accuracy of the determined orbit and the likelihood of possible meteorite
recovery.
  There are three leading techniques for meteoroid triangulation discussed in
the literature: the Method of Planes, the Straight Line Least Squares method,
and the Multi-Parameter Fit method. Here we describe an alternative method to
meteoroid triangulation, called the Dynamic Trajectory Fit. This approach uses
the meteoroid's 3D dynamic equations of motion to fit a realistic trajectory
directly to multi-sensor line-of-sight observations. This method has the
ability to resolve fragmentation events, fit systematic observatory timing
offsets, and determine mass estimates of the meteoroid along its observable
trajectory.
  Through a comprehensive Monte-Carlo analysis of over 100,000 trajectory
simulations, we find this new method to more accurately estimate meteoroid
trajectories of slow entry events ($<$25\,km/s) and events observed from low
convergence angles ($<$10$^{\circ}$) compared to existing meteoroid
triangulation techniques. Additionally, we triangulate an observed fireball

  Regularization","Under review",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As well known, the huge memory and compute costs of both artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) greatly hinder their
deployment on edge devices with high efficiency. Model compression has been
proposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via
parameter and operation reduction. Whereas, this technique is mainly practiced
in ANNs rather than SNNs. It is interesting to answer how much an SNN model can
be compressed without compromising its functionality, where two challenges
should be addressed: i) the accuracy of SNNs is usually sensitive to model
compression, which requires an accurate compression methodology; ii) the
computation of SNNs is event-driven rather than static, which produces an extra
compression dimension on dynamic spikes. To this end, we realize a
comprehensive SNN compression through three steps. First, we formulate the
connection pruning and weight quantization as a constrained optimization
problem. Second, we combine spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem with
minimum accuracy loss. Third, we further propose activity regularization to
reduce the spike events for fewer active operations. These methods can be
applied in either a single way for moderate compression or a joint way for
aggressive compression. We define several quantitative metrics to evaluation
the compression performance for SNNs. Our methodology is validated in pattern
recognition tasks over MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, where
extensive comparisons, analyses, and insights are provided. To our best
knowledge, this is the first work that studies SNN compression in a
comprehensive manner by exploiting all compressible components and achieves
better results.

perm-selective ion transportation because ions do not migrate in areas where
the structures are located. However, the structure can promote the
transportation if the membrane is confined to a microscopical scale. In such
scale where the area to volume ratio is significantly large, the primary
driving mechanisms of the ion transportation are transited from
electro-convective instability (EOI) to surface conduction (SC) and
electroosmotic flow (EOF). Here we provide rigorous evidence on how SC and EOF
around the dielectric microstructures can accelerate the ion transportation by
multi-physics simulations and experimental visualizations. The microstructures
further polarize the ion distribution by SC and EOF so that ion carriers can
travel to the membrane more efficiently. Furthermore, we verified, for the
first time, that the arrangements of microstructures have a critical impact on
the ion transportation. While convective flows are isolated in crystal pillar
configuration, the flows show elongated pattern and create an additional path
for ion current in the aligned pillar configuration. Therefore, the fundamental

relaxometry based on a two-magnon Raman-like process, enabling detection of FMR
at frequencies higher than the NV frequency. For high microwave drive powers,
we observe an unexpected field-shift of the NV response relative to a
simultaneous microwave absorption signal from a low damping ferrite film. We
show that the field-shifted NV response is due to a second order Suhl

magnons which relax the NV spin, even when the uniform mode FMR frequency
exceeds that of the NV spin resonance frequency, hence ruling out the
possibility that the NV is relaxed by a single NV-resonant magnon. We argue
that at high frequencies the NV response is due to a two-magnon relaxation
process in which the difference frequency of two magnons matches the NV
frequency, and at low frequencies we evaluate the lineshape of the one-magnon
NV relaxometry response using spinwave instability theory.

Proof-of-Execution consensus protocol (PoE) that alleviates these challenges.
At the core of PoE are out-of-order processing and speculative execution, which
allow PoE to execute transactions before consensus is reached among the

substantial energy use in buildings, whereas a large group of occupants are
still not actually feeling comfortable staying inside. This poses the issue of
developing energy-efficient HVAC control, i.e., reduce energy use (cost) while
simultaneously enhancing human comfort. This paper pursues the objective and
studies the stochastic optimal HVAC control subject to uncertain thermal demand
(i.e., the weather and occupancy etc). Particularly, we involve the elaborate
predicted mean vote (PMV) thermal comfort model in the optimization. The
problem is computationally challenging due to the non-linear and non-analytical
constraints imposed by the system dynamics and PMV model. We make the following
contributions to address it. First, we formulate the problem as a Markov
decision process (MDP) which is a desirable modeling technique capable of
handling the complexities. Second, we propose a gradient-based learning (GB-L)
method for progressively learning a stochastic control policy off-line and
store it for on-line execution. Third, we prove the learning method converge to
the optimal policies theoretically, and its performance (i.e., energy cost,
thermal comfort and on-line computation) for HVAC control via simulations. The
comparisons with the existing model predictive control based relaxation (MPC-R)
method which is assumed with accurate future information and supposed to
provide the near-optimal bounds, show that though there exists some performance
loss in energy cost reduction (i.e., 6.5%), the proposed method can enable

  The ability of a recommendation algorithm for generating effective

explore the relationship between the consistency of users' ratings behavior and
the degree of calibrated recommendations they receive. We conduct our analysis

experimental results on a movie dataset and several recommendation algorithms
show that there is a positive correlation between the consistency of users'
ratings behavior and the degree of calibration in their recommendations,
meaning that user groups with higher inconsistency in their ratings receive
less calibrated recommendations.

prepared by a diazonium coupling were used as a platform to covalently graft
PMMA chains to the surface of graphene through an amidation between the NH2
groups and PMMA chains, PMMA NH GNPs. A degree of PMMA grafting of 3.8 wt, one
chain per 40 carbon atoms, was found to both improve the dispersion of the GNPs
in a PMMA matrix and give strong graphene-polymer interfaces compared to
as-provided GNPs. Thus, 2 wt of PMMA NH GNPs in PMMA was found to increase the
elastic modulus, strength and strain at break of PMMA, whereas the
incorporation of unmodified GNPs showed poor levels of reinforcement at all
loadings. Furthermore, Tg and Td of PMMA were increased by 15 C and 29 C,
respectively, by adding 5 wt of PMMA NH GNPs, whereas incorporating unmodified
GNPs led to smaller increases. This work offers the possibility of controlling

the network edge, as well as the rising concerns about the data privacy, a new
distributed training framework called federated learning (FL) has emerged. In
each iteration of FL (called round), the edge devices update local models based
on their own data and contribute to the global training by uploading the model
updates via wireless channels. Due to the limited spectrum resources, only a
portion of the devices can be scheduled in each round. While most of the
existing work on scheduling focuses on the convergence of FL w.r.t. rounds, the
convergence performance under a total training time budget is not yet explored.
In this paper, a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling problem is
formulated to capture the long-term convergence performance of FL, and is
solved by being decoupled into two sub-problems. For the bandwidth allocation
sub-problem, the derived optimal solution suggests to allocate more bandwidth
to the devices with worse channel conditions or weaker computation
capabilities. For the device scheduling sub-problem, by revealing the trade-off
between the number of rounds required to attain a certain model accuracy and
the latency per round, a greedy policy is inspired, that continuously selects
the device that consumes the least time in model updating until achieving a
good trade-off between the learning efficiency and latency per round. The
experiments show that the proposed policy outperforms other state-of-the-art
scheduling policies, with the best achievable model accuracy under training
time budgets.

evolving structures specialised for interacting with their environment. In the
vast majority of cases, locomotor behaviours such as flying, crawling, and
running, are orchestrated by nervous systems. Surprisingly, microorganisms can
enact analogous movement gaits for swimming using multiple, fast-moving
cellular protrusions called cilia and flagella. Here, I demonstrate
intermittency, reversible rhythmogenesis, and gait mechanosensitivity in algal
flagella, to reveal the active nature of locomotor patterning. In addition to
maintaining free-swimming gaits, I show that the algal flagellar apparatus
functions as a central pattern generator which encodes the beating of each
flagellum in a network in a distinguishable manner. The latter provides a novel
symmetry-breaking mechanism for cell reorientation. These findings imply that
the capacity to generate and coordinate complex locomotor patterns does not
require neural circuitry but rather the minimal ingredients are present in

different phenomena, they lead to the same voltage dependence of the
photocurrent, making them difficult to distinguish. In this work, a method is
introduced how the build-up of space charge due to imbalanced transport can be

in children. However, it is very difficult to detect this disorder in them,
since the breathing motion of children tends to change when they reach an age
of 6. This, thus makes it very difficult to monitor their respiratory state
easily. In this paper, we present a cheap non-contact alternative to the
current methods that are available. This is using a stereo camera, that
captures a video of the patient breathing at a frame rate of 30Hz. For further
processing, the captured video has to be rectified and converted into a point
cloud. The obtained point clouds need to be aligned in order to have the output
with respect to a common plane. They are then converted into a surface mesh.
The depth is further estimated by subtracting every point cloud from the
reference point cloud (the first frame). The output data, however, when plotted
with respect to real time produces a very noisy plot. This is filtered by
determining the signal frequency by taking the Fast Fourier Transform of the
breathing signal. The system was tested under 4 different breathing conditions:
deep, shallow and normal breathing and while coughing. On its success, it was
tested with mixed breathing (combination of normal and shallow breathing) and
was lastly compared with the output of the expensive 3dMD system. The
comparison showed that using the stereo camera, we can reach to similar
sensitivity for respiratory motion observation. The experimental results show
that, the proposed method provides a major step towards development of low-cost
home-based observation systems for asthma patients and care-givers.

  Journal Plus",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using complex analysis, we have investigated classical quasi-one-dimensional
atom-atom scattering under 2D harmonic confinement with two different
interaction potential (Yukawa and Lennard-Jones) and found that the
Confinement-Induced Resonance (CIR) that occurs in the quantum system seems to
have a classical analogy. We observed CIR in our classical results in the sense
that a clear minimum appeared in the transmission coefficient for the different
interaction potentials. We also investigated the change in the value and
position of this minimum by varying the characteristic parameters of the system
including the angular momentum $L_z$ along the longitudinal axis. In the
quantum case, it has already been shown that for the zero range Huang
potential, CIR occurs only for $L_z = 0$. Our results indicate that classical
CIR can also occur for $L_z \ne 0$ using finite range potentials. We have
endeavoured to provide extensive physical arguments to explain the observed
results and to support the proposed analogy between the classical and quantum
regimes where applicable.

of the core tasks in online advertising systems. With the rise of deep
learning, CTR prediction models with deep networks remarkably enhance model
capacities. In deep CTR models, exploiting users' historical data is essential
for learning users' behaviors and interests. As existing CTR prediction works
neglect the importance of the temporal signals when embed users' historical
clicking records, we propose a time-aware attention model which explicitly uses
absolute temporal signals for expressing the users' periodic behaviors and
relative temporal signals for expressing the temporal relation between items.
Besides, we propose a regularized adversarial sampling strategy for negative
sampling which eases the classification imbalance of CTR data and can make use
of the strong guidance provided by the observed negative CTR samples. The
adversarial sampling strategy significantly improves the training efficiency,
and can be co-trained with the time-aware attention model seamlessly.
Experiments are conducted on real-world CTR datasets from both in-station and

with the ability to discard low confidence decisions generated by a prediction
model. That is, just like human experts, LWR allows machine models to abstain
from generating a prediction when reliability of the prediction is expected to
be low. Several frameworks for this learning with rejection have been proposed
in the literature. However, most of them work for classification problems only
and regression with rejection has not been studied in much detail. In this
work, we present a neural framework for LWR based on a generalized meta-loss
function that involves simultaneous training of two neural network models: a
predictor model for generating predictions and a rejecter model for deciding
whether the prediction should be accepted or rejected. The proposed framework
can be used for classification as well as regression and other related machine
learning tasks. We have demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of the
method on synthetically generated data as well as benchmark datasets from UCI
machine learning repository for both classification and regression problems.
Despite being simpler in implementation, the proposed scheme for learning with
rejection has shown to perform at par or better than previously proposed
methods. Furthermore, we have applied the method to the problem of hurricane
intensity prediction from satellite imagery. Significant improvement in
performance as compared to conventional supervised methods shows the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in real-world regression problems.

temperature of the SU(3) Yang-Mills(YM) theory on the lattice from a viewpoint
of the dual superconductor picture based on the novel reformulation of the YM
theory. In particular, we compare the conventional Abelian dual superconductor
picture with the non-Abelian dual superconductor picture proposed in our
previous works as the mechanism of quark confinement in the SU(3) YM theory.
For the SU(3) YM theory, the reformulation allows two possible options called
maximal and minimal. The maximal option corresponds to the manifestly
gauge-invariant extension of the Abelian projection scheme, while the minimal
option is really new to give the non-Abelian dual superconductor picture.
Keeping these differences in mind, we present the numerical evidences that the
confinement/deconfinement phase transition is caused by
appearance/disappearance of the dual Meissner effects. First, we measure the
Polyakov loop average at various temperatures to determine the critical
temperature separating the low-temperature confined phase and the
high-temperature deconfined phase. Second, we measure the static
quark-antiquark potential. Third, we measure the chromoelectric and
chromomagnetic flux created by a pair of quark and antiquark at temperatures
below and above the critical temperature. We observe no more squeezing of the
chromoelectric flux tube above the critical temperature. Finally, we measure
the associated magnetic--monopole current induced around the chromo-flux tube
and observe that the confinement/deconfinement phase transition is associated
with the appearance/disappearance of the induced magnetic--monopole current,
respectively. We confirm that these results are also obtained by the restricted
field alone in both options, indicating the restricted field dominance in quark
confinement at finite temperature.

block and many micro blocks to effectively improve the transaction processing
capacity. Bitcoin-NG has a special incentive mechanism (i.e. splitting
transaction fees to the current and the next leader) to maintain its security.
However, this design of the incentive mechanism ignores the joint effect of
transaction fees, mint coins and mining duration lengths on the expected mining
reward. In this paper, we identify the advanced mining attack that deliberately
ignores micro blocks to enlarge the mining duration length to increase the
likelihood of winning the mining race. We first show that an advanced mining
attacker can maximize its expected reward by optimizing its mining duration
length. We then formulate a game-theoretical model in which multiple mining
players perform advanced mining to compete with each other. We analyze the Nash
equilibrium for the mining game. Our analytical and simulation results indicate
that all mining players in the mining game converge to having advanced mining
at the equilibrium and have no incentives for deviating from the equilibrium;
the transaction processing capability of the Bitcoin-NG network at the
equilibrium is decreased by advanced mining. Therefore, we conclude that the
Bitcoin-NG blockchain protocol is vulnerable to advanced mining attack. We
discuss how to reduce the negative impact of advanced mining for Bitcoin-NG.

triggering the ejections. The observed bipole emerged within the main following

quality of experience (QoE) for real-time video streaming in wireless networks.
In real-time video streaming, one major challenge is to tackle the natural
tension between the two most critical QoE metrics: playback latency and video
interruption. To study this trade-off, we first propose an analytical model
that precisely captures all aspects of the playback process of a real-time
video stream, including playback latency, video interruptions, and packet
dropping. Built on this model, we show that the playback process of a real-time
video can be approximated by a two-sided reflected Brownian motion. Through
such Brownian approximation, we are able to study the fundamental limits of the
two QoE metrics and characterize a necessary and sufficient condition for a set
of QoE performance requirements to be feasible. We propose a scheduling policy
that satisfies any feasible set of QoE performance requirements and then obtain
simple rules on the trade-off between playback latency and the video interrupt
rates, in both heavy-traffic and under-loaded regimes. Finally, simulation
results verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation and show that the
proposed policy outperforms other popular baseline policies.

hologram patterns which transform the incoming laser beam into desired shapes
in a conjugate optical plane. The existing repertoire of approaches to solve
this inverse problem is built on iterative phase-retrieval algorithms, which do
not take optical aberrations and deviations from theoretical models into
account. Here, we adopt a physics-free, data-driven, and probabilistic approach
to the problem. Using deep conditional generative models such as
Generative-Adversarial Networks (cGAN) or Variational Autoencoder (cVAE), we
approximate conditional distributions of holograms for a given target laser
intensity pattern. In order to reduce the cardinality of the problem, we train
our models on a proxy mapping relating an 8x8-matrix of complex-valued
spatial-frequency coefficients to the ensuing 100x100-shaped intensity
distribution recorded on a camera. We discuss the degree of 'ill-posedness'
that remains in this reduced problem and compare different generative model
architectures in terms of their ability to find holograms that reconstruct
given intensity patterns. Finally, we challenge our models to generalise to
synthetic target intensities, where the existence of matching holograms cannot
be guaranteed. We devise a forward-interpolating training scheme aimed at
providing models the ability to interpolate in laser intensity space, rather
than hologram space and show that this indeed enhances model performance on

special properties, such as high transmission efficiency in bend waveguides,
and their generation related to the topological phase. Previous works on
interface states in PCs were mainly based on the square lattice, the honeycomb
lattice or the triangular lattice, but with different materials, shapes, or
sizes of rods resulting in the complicated structure. In this paper, an
interface is constructed by two 2D PCs with different rectangular lattices, but
the same materials, shapes, and sizes of dielectric rods, which generates
interface states. The interface states are analyzed with respect to Zak phases
and surface impedances. The retainability of the interface states in
rectangular lattice PCs is investigated by studying the relationship between
the length-width ratio of the rectangular lattice and the Zak phase. It is
found that, when the interface states are generated by changing the
length-width ratio of the rectangular lattice, the retainability of the
interface states is related to the positions of the photonic bandgaps or the
Zak phases of the bands. A more detailed examination indicates that these
conclusions are applicable to the rectangular lattice PCs with other materials,
shapes, and sizes of dielectric rods. These results can lead to new ways to
generate interface states easily, with only one kind of dielectric rod. In
addition, these outcomes may contribute to the understanding of the
relationship between the geometry and the interface state.

By comparing the results with that of the homogeneous chain, we find that when
the quench crosses the Ising transition, the small disorder will cause a new
critical point. As the disorder increases, more critical points of the DQPTs
will occur, constituting a critical region. In the quench across the
anisotropic transition, the disorder will cause a critical region near the
critical point, and the width of the critical region increases by the
disordered strength. In the case of quench passing through two critical lines,
the small disorder leads to the system to have three additional critical
points. When the quench is in the ferromagnetic phase, the large disorder
causes the two critical points of the homogeneous case to become a critical
region. And for the quench in the paramagnetic phase, the DQPTs will disappear
for large disorder.

  We study the decision version of this problem (i.e.~deciding whether the

focus is on answering the following high-level question: when is it possible to
efficiently test whether the unknown target vector $w$ is sparse versus
far-from-sparse using a number of samples which is completely independent of
the dimension $n$? We consider the natural setting in which $x$ is drawn from a

we give a general algorithm which solves the above-described testing problem

dimension $n$, as long as $\mathcal{D}$ is not a Gaussian. In fact, our
algorithm is fully noise tolerant, in the sense that for an arbitrary $w$, it
approximately computes the distance of $w$ to the closest $k$-sparse vector. To
complement this algorithmic result, we show that weakening any of our condition
makes it information-theoretically impossible for any algorithm to solve the

variance. However, the estimator can be unstable in practice as it depends
directly on the raw MCMC output. A measure of accuracy of the batch means
estimator itself, ideally in the form of a confidence interval, is therefore
desirable. The asymptotic variance of the batch means estimator is known;
however, without any knowledge of asymptotic distribution, asymptotic variances
are in general insufficient to describe variability. In this article we prove a

nuclear measurements. We pay special attention on the discussion of prospects
to extract new physics at prominent rare event measurements looking for
neutrino-nucleus scattering, such as the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering (CE$\nu$NS) that may involve lepton flavor violation (LFV) in
neutral-currents (NC). For the latter processes several appreciably sensitive
experiments are currently pursued or have been planed to operate in the near
future, like the COHERENT, CONUS, CONNIE, MINER, TEXONO, RED100, vGEN,
Ricochet, NUCLEUS etc. We provide a thorough discussion on phenomenological and
theoretical studies, in particular those referring to the nuclear physics
aspects in order to provide accurate predictions for the relevant experiments.
Motivated by the recent discovery of CE$\nu$NS at the COHERENT experiment and
the active experimental efforts for a new measurement at reactor-based
experiments, we summarize the current status of the constraints as well as the
future sensitivities on nuclear and electroweak physics parameters,
non-standard interactions, electromagnetic neutrino properties, sterile
neutrinos and simplified scenarios with novel vector $Z^\prime$ or scalar
$\phi$ mediators. Indirect and direct connections of \cevns with astrophysics,
direct Dark Matter detection and charge lepton flavor violating processes are
also discussed.

the spatial dependence of the wave phase velocity which changes in the
perpendicular-to-interfaces direction when crossing the interfaces and thus
having different constant values in different layers of the threelayer. The MST

The obtained space-time propagator exactly solves the considered wave equation
for any initial value and allows for following in time the processes of

Reduction (RAR). According to RAR, humor can be expressed in a simple formula:
-d(A)/dt. RAR has strong correspondences with False Alarm Theory, Benign
Violation Theory, and Cognitive Debugging Theory, all of which represent either
special cases or partial descriptions at alternative levels of analysis. Some
evidence for RAR includes physiological similarities between hyperventilation
and laughter and the fact that smiles often indicate negative affect in
non-human primates (e.g. fear grimaces where teeth are exposed as a kind of
inhibited threat display). In accordance with Benign Violation Theory, if humor
reliably indicates both a) anxiety induction, b) anxiety reduction, and c) the
time-course over which anxiety is reduced, then the intersection of these
conditions productively constrains inference spaces over latent mental states
with respect to the values and capacities of the persons experiencing humor. In
this way, humor is a powerful cypher for understanding persons in both
individual and social contexts, with far-reaching implications. Finally, if
humor can be expressed in such a simple formula with clear ties to
phenomenology, and yet this discovery regarding such an essential part of the
human experience has remained undiscovered for this long, then this is an
extremely surprising state of affairs worthy of further investigation. Towards
this end, I propose an analogy can be found with consciousness studies, where
in addition to the ""Hard problem"" of trying to explain humor, we would do well
to consider a ""Meta-Problem"" of why humor seems so difficult to explain, and
why relatively simple explanations may have eluded us for this long. (Please
note: RAR was conceived in 2008, and last majorly updated in 2012.)

This study aimed to derive a kinetic equation for particle dispersion in

expanded as a series in terms of the cumulants of particle paths in the phase
space, by introducing a local path density operator to identify the
distribution of particle paths. The expansion enables us to directly obtain a

derived in this study has following features that: (1) it has its coefficients

for building an efficient and livable city. Nonetheless, this is challenging
due to the expanding urban population and the complicated spatial distribution
of residents. In this paper, to reveal urban dynamics, we propose a novel
system UrbanRhythm to reveal the urban dynamics hidden in human mobility data.
UrbanRhythm addresses three questions: 1) What mobility feature should be used
to present residents' high-dimensional activities in the city? 2) What are
basic components of urban dynamics? 3) What are the long-term periodicity and
short-term regularity of urban dynamics? In UrbanRhythm, we extract staying,
leaving, arriving three attributes of mobility and use a image processing
method Saak transform to calculate the mobility distribution feature. For the
second question, several city states are identified by hierarchy clustering as
the basic components of urban dynamics, such as sleeping states and working
states. We further characterize the urban dynamics as the transform of city
states along time axis. For the third question, we directly observe the
long-term periodicity of urban dynamics from visualization. Then for the
short-term regularity, we design a novel motif analysis method to discovery
motifs as well as their hierarchy relationships. We evaluate our proposed
system on two real-life datesets and validate the results according to App
usage records. This study sheds light on urban dynamics hidden in human
mobility and can further pave the way for more complicated mobility behavior

community because of its ability to sample high-dimensional distributions much
more efficiently than other Metropolis-based methods. Despite this, HMC often
performs sub-optimally on distributions with high correlations or marginal
variances on multiple scales because the resulting stiffness forces the
leapfrog integrator in HMC to take an unreasonably small stepsize. We provide
intuition as well as a formal analysis showing how these multiscale
distributions limit the stepsize of leapfrog and we show how the implicit
midpoint method can be used, together with Newton-Krylov iteration, to
circumvent this limitation and achieve major efficiency gains. Furthermore, we
offer practical guidelines for when to choose between implicit midpoint and
leapfrog and what stepsize to use for each method, depending on the
distribution being sampled. Unlike previous modifications to HMC, our method is
generally applicable to highly non-Gaussian distributions exhibiting multiple
scales. We illustrate how our method can provide a dramatic speedup over
leapfrog in the context of the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) applied to several
examples.

rewards often requires an enormous number of samples. In such cases, using a
set of expert trajectories could help to learn faster. However, Imitation
Learning (IL) via supervised pre-training with these trajectories may not
perform as well and generally requires additional finetuning with
expert-in-the-loop. In this paper, we propose an approach which uses the expert
trajectories and learns to decompose the complex main task into smaller
sub-goals. We learn a function which partitions the state-space into sub-goals,
which can then be used to design an extrinsic reward function. We follow a
strategy where the agent first learns from the trajectories using IL and then
switches to Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the identified sub-goals, to
alleviate the errors in the IL step. To deal with states which are
under-represented by the trajectory set, we also learn a function to modulate
the sub-goal predictions. We show that our method is able to solve complex
goal-oriented tasks, which other RL, IL or their combinations in literature are
not able to solve.

With the progress of
automation in this arena, it needs to be diagnosed for better performance and
less failures. There are several options for doing that but we have seen from
the past research that using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) as the diagnosis
framework would be the most promising option due to its diverse benefits.
Several challenges such as effect of noise, lower speed, selective node
replacement, complexity of logistics, and limited battery lifetime arise while
using WSN as the framework. Limited battery lifetime has become one of the most
significant issues to focus on to get rid of it. This article provides a model
for replenishing the battery charge of the sensor nodes of wireless sensor
network. We will use the model for sensor battery recharging in an efficient
way so that no nodes become out of service after a while. We will be using
mobile charger for this purpose. So, there may be some scope for improving the
recharge interval for the mobile charger as well. This will be satisfied using
optimum path calculation for each time the charger travels to the nodes. Our
main objectives are to maximize the nodes battery utilization, distribute power
effectively from the energy harvester, and minimize the distance between power
source and cluster head. The simulation results show that the proposed approach
successfully maximizes the utilization of the nodes battery while minimizes the
waiting time for the sensor nodes to get recharged from the energy harvester.

  supply-demand gap based on imaging time series and residual learning","Accepted at CloudCom 2019 Conference",,,,"cs.NI cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile crowdsourcing has become easier thanks to the widespread of
smartphones capable of seamlessly collecting and pushing the desired data to
cloud services. However, the success of mobile crowdsourcing relies on
balancing the supply and demand by first accurately forecasting spatially and
temporally the supply-demand gap, and then providing efficient incentives to
encourage participant movements to maintain the desired balance. In this paper,
we propose Deep-Gap, a deep learning approach based on residual learning to
predict the gap between mobile crowdsourced service supply and demand at a
given time and space. The prediction can drive the incentive model to achieve a
geographically balanced service coverage in order to avoid the case where some
areas are over-supplied while other areas are under-supplied. This allows
anticipating the supply-demand gap and redirecting crowdsourced service
providers towards target areas. Deep-Gap relies on historical supply-demand
time series data as well as available external data such as weather conditions
and day type (e.g., weekday, weekend, holiday). First, we roll and encode the
time series of supply-demand as images using the Gramian Angular Summation
Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) and the Recurrence Plot
(REC). These images are then used to train deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) to extract the low and high-level features and forecast the crowdsourced
services gap. We conduct comprehensive comparative study by establishing two
supply-demand gap forecasting scenarios: with and without external data.
Compared to state-of-art approaches, Deep-Gap achieves the lowest forecasting
errors in both scenarios.

fluctuations. Unlike what their name suggests, rare events are fairly
ubiquitous in nature, as the occurrence of many structural transformations in
biology and material sciences is predicated upon crossing large free energy
barriers. Probing the kinetics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of
possible barrier crossings in a system is critical to predicting and
controlling its structural and functional properties. Due to their activated
nature, however, rare events are exceptionally difficult to study using
conventional experimental and computational techniques. In recent decades, a
wide variety of specialized computational techniques-- known as advanced
sampling techniques-- have been developed to systematically capture improbable
fluctuations relevant to rare events. In this perspective, we focus on a
technique called forward flux sampling (Allen~\emph{et al.,}~\emph{J. Chem.
Phys.}, {\bf 124}: 024102, 2006), and overview its recent methodological
variants and extensions. We also provide a detailed overview of its application
