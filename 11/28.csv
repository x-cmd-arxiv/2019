single-peaked with the largest Doppler shifts at higher altitudes. We use 1D
non-LTE vertical slab models (i.e. models which consider departures from Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium) in single-slab and multi-slab configurations to
interpret the observations and to investigate how a superposition of spicules
along the line of sight (LOS) affects the synthetic Mg II line profiles. The
used multi-slab models are either static, i.e. without any LOS velocities, or
assume randomly assigned LOS velocities of individual slabs, representing the
spicule dynamics. We conducted such single-slab and multi-slab modeling for a
broad set of model input parameters and showed the dependence of the Mg II line
profiles on these parameters. We demonstrated that the observed line widths of
the h and k line profiles are strongly affected by the presence of multiple
spicules along the LOS. We later showed that the profiles obtained at higher
altitudes can be reproduced by single-slab models representing individual
spicules. We found that the multi-slab model with a random distribution of the
LOS velocities ranging from -25 to 25 km s$^{-1}$ can well reproduce the width

the chain but with the blocks maintaining their identity, namely rigidly
rotating. This new spiral state is stabilized without any apparent frustration,
the common avenue to generate spiral arrangements in multiferroics. By
examining the behaviour of the electronic degrees of freedom, parity breaking
quasiparticles are revealed. Finally, a simple phenomenological model that

this standard to augment existing healthcare data systems with a standard FHIR
interface. While this is an important goal, little attention has been paid to
developing mechanisms that convert EHR data structured using proprietary schema
to the FHIR standard, in order to be served by such an interface. In this
paper, a formal process is proposed that both identifies a set of FHIR
resources that best capture the elements of an EHR, and transitions the
contents of that EHR to FHIR, with a view to supporting the operation of SoF
containers, and the wider interoperability of health records with the FHIR
standard. This process relies on a number of techniques that enable us to
understand when two terms are equivalent, in particular a set of similarity
metrics, which are combined along with a series of parameters in order to
enable the approach to be tuned to the different EHR standards encountered.
Thus, when realised in software, the translation process is semi-autonomous,
requiring only the specification of these parameters before performing an
arbitrary number of future conversions. The approach is demonstrated by
utilising it as part of the CONSULT project, a wider decision support system

resources, reproduction and dispersal. These shape their biodiversity and how
the system responds to change. Current approaches to modelling ecosystems,
especially plants, focus on either describing fine-scale processes for
individual species or broad-scale patterns for limited groups of plant
functional types.
  Digitisation of herbarium and other plant records has unlocked a wealth of
information that can be used to drive models of plant communities and make
predictions for their future under different scenarios of climate change. The
advent of increased computational capacity and fast, high level programming
languages allows for simulation of such landscapes at unprecedented scales.
  Here, we demonstrate a tool for Ecosystem Simulation through Integrated
Species Trait-Environment Modelling (EcoSISTEM), which models plant species
across multiple ecosystem sizes, from patches and small islands to regions and
entire continents. These simulated ecosystems support the ability to generate
many different types of habitat, as well as reproducing different disturbance
scenarios such as climate change, habitat loss and invasion. EcoSISTEM also
reproduces examples of real-world species distributions by integrating plant
occurrence records and global climate reconstructions to simulate plant species
throughout the continent of Africa for the past century.
  EcoSISTEM allows us to flexibly explore the dynamics of tens of thousands of
species interacting across a continent. The code parallelises efficiently
across multiple nodes on high performance computing platforms, and has been
scaled up to run on over 1000 cores. It allows us to study the impact of
changes to climate, resources and habitat and investigate real-life mechanisms
surrounding climate change and biodiversity loss.

(TMDs), are an exciting class of materials with weak interlayer bonding which
enables one to create van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH). Recent work has
shown that control of the twist angle between layers can have a dramatic effect
on vdWH properties. For TMD vdWH, twist angle has been treated solely through
the use of rigid-lattice moir\'e patterns. No atomic reconstruction, i.e. any
rearrangement of atoms within the individual layers, has been reported
experimentally to date. Here we demonstrate that vdWH of MoSe2/WSe2 and
MoS2/WS2 at twist angles less than 1{\deg} undergo significant atomic level
reconstruction leading to discrete commensurate domains divided by narrow
domain walls, rather than a smoothly varying rigid-lattice moir\'e pattern as
has been assumed in prior work. Using conductive atomic force microscopy
(CAFM), we show that the stacking orientation of the two TMD crystals has a
profound impact on the atomic reconstruction, consistent with recent
theoretical work on graphene/graphene and MoS2/MoS2 structures and experimental
work on graphene bilayers and hBN/graphene vdWH. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) provides additional evidence of atomic reconstruction in
MoSe2/WSe2 structures and demonstrates the transition between a rigid-lattice
moir\'e pattern for large angles and atomic reconstruction for small angles. We
use density functional theory to calculate the band structures of the
commensurate reconstructed domains and find that the modulation of the relative
electronic band edges is consistent with the CAFM results and photoluminescence
spectra from reconstructed vdWH. The presence of atomic reconstruction in TMD
heterostructures and the observed impact on nanometer-scale electronic
properties provides fundamental insight into the behavior of this important
class of heterostructures.

that distinguish chromosomal sequences from their homologous pairs, may reveal
an individual's susceptibility to hereditary and complex diseases and affect
how our bodies respond to therapeutic drugs. Reconstructing haplotypes of an
individual from short sequencing reads is an NP-hard problem that becomes even
more challenging in the case of polyploids. While increasing lengths of
sequencing reads and insert sizes {\color{black} helps improve accuracy of
reconstruction}, it also exacerbates computational complexity of the haplotype
assembly task. This has motivated the pursuit of algorithmic frameworks capable
of accurate yet efficient assembly of haplotypes from high-throughput
sequencing data.
  Results: We propose a novel graphical representation of sequencing reads and
pose the haplotype assembly problem as an instance of community detection on a
spatial random graph. To this end, we construct a graph where each read is a
node with an unknown community label associating the read with the haplotype it
samples. Haplotype reconstruction can then be thought of as a two-step
procedure: first, one recovers the community labels on the nodes (i.e., the
reads), and then uses the estimated labels to assemble the haplotypes. Based on
this observation, we propose ComHapDet - a novel assembly algorithm for diploid
and ployploid haplotypes which allows both bialleleic and multi-allelic
variants.
  Conclusions: Performance of the proposed algorithm is benchmarked on
simulated as well as experimental data obtained by sequencing Chromosome $5$ of
tetraploid biallelic \emph{Solanum-Tuberosum} (Potato). The results demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed method and that it compares favorably with the
existing techniques.

There is no long-range magnetic order down to 0.4 K at zero field. The

anisotropy. A maximum is found in $M(T)$ around \emph{T}$\sim$1.5 K when
magnetic field $H$ is applied in the $ab$ plane, indicating the short-range
interaction. The low-temperature isothermal magnetization $M(H)$ shows a
one-third plateau of the estimated saturation moment, that is characteristic of
a two-dimensional frustrated triangular lattice. Heat capacity shows
field-induced long-range magnetic order for both $H||c$ and $H||ab$ directions.
The broad peak in heat capacity and highly damped INS magnetic excitation at
$T$=2 K suggests strong spin fluctuations. The dispersive in-plane INS,
centered at the (1/3 1/3 0) point, and the absence of dispersion along $c$
direction suggests 120$^{\circ}$ non-collinear 2D-like spin correlations. All

latent sources and their dimensions that can change across epochs due to an
induced shock to the cortical system. Our method compares the spread of
spectral information in several multivariate stationary processes with
different dimensions. A frequency specific spectral ratio (FS-ratio) statistic
is proposed and its asymptotic properties are derived. The FS-ratio is blind to
the dimension of the stationary process and captures the proportion of spectral
information in various (user-specified) frequency bands. We apply our method to
study differences in complexity and structure of the LFP before and after

is increased. Such rate-performance is important from a practical perspective
and is usually characterised via galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements.
However, such measurements are very slow, limiting the number of rate
experiments which are practical in a given project. This is a particular
problem during mechanistic studies where many rate measurements are needed.
Here, building on work by Heubner at al., we demonstrate chronoamperometry (CA)
as a relatively fast method for measuring capacity-rate curves with hundreds of
data points down to C-rates below 0.01C. While Heubner et al. reported
equations to convert current transients to capacity vs. C-rate curves, we
modify these equations to give capacity as a function of charge/discharge rate,
R. We show that such expressions can be combined with a basic model to obtain
simple equations which can fit data for both capacity vs. C-rate and capacity
vs. R. We demonstrate that these equations can accurately fit experimental data
within normal experimental ranges of rate. However, we also observe that, at
high rates, the curves obtained from CA deviate from the normal behaviour
showing a new, previously unobserved, decay feature. We associate this feature
with the very early part of the current transient where electronic motion
dominates the current. Using a simple model, we show that the dependence of the
high-rate time constant on electrode thickness can be linked to electrode
conductivity.

indicate high renewables penetration even in the absence of decarbonization
policies. In the transition to zero carbon system, CCS plays a minor role due
to its carbon capture efficiency. ESS investments contribute to lower system
costs by replacing more expensive flexibility resources. However, longer ESS
durations have lower marginal value per added kWh ESS. Interannual variability
of VRE substantially changes the system's configuration and energy cost.
Decision-making based on single-year data substantially increases the systems'
operational costs in other years. In contrast, optimizing over multiple years

value, we explore model implications of its viable explanation by a long-lived
light SM-singlet scalar ($S$) emission, i.e. $K_L \to \pi^0 S$, with $S$
decaying outside the KOTO detector. We derive constraints on the parameter
space of such a light scalar in the context of three simple models: (i) a real
singlet scalar extension of the SM; (ii) a $B-L$ extension where neutrino
masses arise via type-I seesaw mechanism from $B-L$ breaking; and (iii) a
TeV-scale left-right symmetric model. The flavor-changing couplings needed to
explain the KOTO excess in models (i) and (ii) originate from tree-level mixing
of the scalar with SM Higgs field ($h$), and in model (iii), from the mixing of
$S$ and $h$ with the neutral component of the heavy bidoublet Higgs field.
After taking into account the stringent constraints from high-precision
searches for flavor-changing charged and neutral kaon decays at NA62, E949,
KOTO and CHARM experiments, as well as the astrophysical and cosmological
constraints on a light scalar, such as those from supernova energy loss, big
bang nucleosynthesis and relativistic degrees of freedom, we find that the
light scalar interpretation of the KOTO excess is allowed in all these models.
Parts of the parameter range can be tested in future NA62 and DUNE experiments.

alignment mechanism on a popular generic model of a tight-binding diatomic
molecule. We consider the case of rotational wavepacket formation when a
molecule is initially in the ground rotational state. The rotational wavepacket
emerging from the TNCR interaction consists of states with higher rotational
quantum numbers, in comparison with the anisotropic-polarizability case, and
the after-pulse alignment oscillations are out-of-phase with those resulting
from the traditional interaction. The TNCR interaction mode is expected to play
a major role when a strong laser field actually causes extensive nonresonant
excitation and/or ionization of a molecule.

problem is to map an arbitrary matrix to a memristor crossbar array (MCA) while
maximizing the resulting computational accuracy. The state-of-the-art mapping
technique is based on a heuristic that only guarantees to produce the correct
output for two input vectors. In this paper, a technique that aims to produce
the correct output for every input vector is proposed, which involves
specifying the memristor conductance values and a scaling factor realized by
the peripheral circuitry. The key insight of the paper is that the conductance
matrix realized by an MCA is only required to be proportional to the target
matrix. The selection of the scaling factor between the two regulates the
utilization of the programmable memristor conductance range and the
representability of the target matrix. Consequently, the scaling factor is set
to balance precision and value range errors. Moreover, a technique of
converting conductance values into state variables and vice versa is proposed
to handle memristors with non-ideal device characteristics. Compared with the
state-of-the-art technique, the proposed mapping results in 4X-9X smaller
errors. The improvements translate into that the classification accuracy of a

Inspired by the homogeneous quantum walk on a line, we develop a formalism by
which the classical ultrametric random walk as well as the quantum walk can be
treated in parallel by using a ""coined"" walk with internal degrees of freedom.
For the random walk, this amounts to a $2^{{\rm nd}}$-order Markov process with
a \emph{stochastic} coin, better known as an (anti-)persistent walk. When this
coin varies spatially in the hierarchical manner of ""ultradiffusion,"" it
reproduces the well-known results of that model. The exact analysis employed
for obtaining the walk dimension $d_{w}$, based on the real-space
renormalization group (RG), proceeds virtually identical for the corresponding
quantum walk with a $unitary$ coin. However, while the classical walk remains
robustly diffusive ($d_{w}=\frac{1}{2}$) for a wide range of barrier heights,
unitarity provides for a quantum walk dimension $d_{w}$ that varies
continuously, for even the smallest amount of heterogeneity, from ballistic
spreading ($d_{w}=1$) in the homogeneous limit to confinement ($d_{w}=\infty$)
for diverging barriers. Yet for any $d_{w}<\infty$ the quantum ultra-walk never
appears to localize.

circular detached binary system (LB-1) with a high metallicity 8Msun B star
companion. Current consensus on the formation of BHs from high metallicity
stars limits the black hole mass to be below 20Msun. Using simple evolutionary
model, we show that the formation of a 70Msun BH in high metallicity
environment is possible if stellar wind mass loss rates are reduced by factor
of 5. As observations indicate, a fraction of massive stars have surface
magnetic fields which may quench the wind mass-loss, independently of stellar
mass and metallicity. We also computed detailed stellar evolution models and we
confirm such a scenario. A non-rotating 85Msun model at Z=0.014 with decreased
winds ends up as a 71Msun star prior core-collapse with a 32Msun helium core
and a 28Msun CO core. Such star avoids pair-instability pulsation supernova
mass loss and may form a 70Msun BH in the direct collapse. Stars that can form
such BHs expand to significant size with radius of R>600Rsun, exceeding the
size of LB-1 orbit. Therefore, we can explain the formation of BHs upto 70Msun
at high metallicity and this result is independent from LB-1. However, if LB-1

states and an infinite-time evolution operator between the far past and far
future. This evolution is not unitary, although we find that it acts unitarily
on a subspace up to non-perturbative corrections. These corrections come from
processes which involve changes in the spatial topology, including the
nucleation of baby universes. There is significant evidence that this 1+1
dimensional model is dual to a 0+0 dimensional matrix integral in the
double-scaled limit. So the bulk quantum mechanics, including the Hilbert space

that this emergence is a robust consequence of the level repulsion of
eigenvalues along with the double scaling limit, and so is rather universal in
random matrix theory.

exist on galactic scales. These correlations can essentially be encompassed by
a simple scaling relation between observed and baryonic accelerations,
historically known as the Mass Discrepancy Acceleration Relation (MDAR). The
existence of such a relation has prompted many theories that attempt to explain
the correlations by invoking additional fundamental forces on baryons. The
standard lore has been that a theory that reduces to the MDAR on galaxy scales
but behaves like cold dark matter (CDM) on larger scales provides an excellent
fit to data, since CDM is desirable on scales of clusters and above. However,
this statement should be revised in light of recent results showing that a
fundamental force that reproduces the MDAR is challenged by local Milky Way
dynamics and rotation curve data between 5-18 kpc. In this study, we test this
claim on the example of Superfluid Dark Matter. We find that a standard CDM
model is preferred over a static superfluid profile assuming a steady-state
Galactic disk and discuss the robustness of this conclusion to disequilibrium
effects. This preference is due to the fact that the superfluid model
over-predicts vertical accelerations, even while reproducing galactic rotation
curves. Our results establish an important criterion that any dark matter model

clusters are in very good agreement with observations and show negligible
redshift evolution at fixed halo mass for $M_{500} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{14}
M_{\odot}$ at $z \lesssim 1$, in line with recent findings from
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)-selected cluster samples. Importantly, the simulations
predict significant redshift evolution in these quantities in the low mass
($M_{500} \sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) regime, which will be testable with upcoming
SZ surveys such as SPT-3G. While the stellar masses of FABLE BCGs are in
reasonable agreement with observations, the total stellar mass in satellite
galaxies is lower than observed and the total mass in ICL is somewhat higher.
This may be caused by enhanced tidal stripping of satellite galaxies due to
their large sizes. BCGs are characterised by moderate stellar mass growth at $z
< 1$ coincident with a late-time development of the ICL. The level of BCG mass
growth is in good agreement with recent observations, however, we caution that
the inferred growth depends sensitively on the mass definition. We further show
that in-situ star formation contributes more than half the mass of a BCG over
its lifetime, the bulk of which is gained at $z > 1$ where star formation rates
are highest. The stellar mass profiles of the BCG+ICL component are similar to
observed profiles out to $\sim 100$ kpc at $z \approx 0$ and follow a close to
power law shape out to several hundred kpc. We further demonstrate that the
inferred size growth of BCGs can be severely biased by the choice of parametric
model and the outer radius of the fit.

the essential features of the Hamiltonian which stabilise a localised phase.
Any many-body Hamiltonian has a canonical representation as a disordered
tight-binding model on the Fock-space graph. The underlying physics is however
fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on
high-dimensional graphs because the Fock-space graph possesses non-trivial
correlations. These correlations are shown to lie at the heart of whether or
not a stable many-body localised phase can be sustained in the thermodynamic
limit, and a theory is presented for the conditions the correlations must
satisfy for a localised phase to be stable. Our analysis is rooted in a
probabilistic, self-consistent mean-field theory for the local Fock-space
propagator and its associated self-energy; in which the Fock-space
correlations, together with the extensive nature of the connectivity of
Fock-space nodes, are key ingredients. The origins of many-body localisation in
typical local Hamiltonians where the correlations are strong, as well as its
absence in uncorrelated random energy-like models, emerge as predictions from
the same overarching theory. To test these, we consider three specific
microscopic models, first establishing in each case the nature of the
associated Fock-space correlations. Numerical exact diagonalisation is then
used to corroborate the theoretical predictions for the occurrence or otherwise
of a stable many-body localised phase; with mutual agreement found in each
case.

class of communication scenarios characterised by encoding operations that
commute with a unique resource destroying map and leave free states invariant.
Our motivating example is given by encoding information into coherences of a
quantum system with respect to a fixed basis (with unitaries diagonal in that
basis as encodings and the decoherence channel as a resource destroying map),
but the generality of the framework allows us to explore applications ranging
from super-dense coding to thermodynamics. For any state, we find that the
number of messages that can be encoded into it using such operations in a
one-shot scenario is upper-bounded in terms of the information spectrum
relative entropy between the given state and its version with erased resources.
Furthermore, if the resource destroying map is the twirling channel over some
unitary group, we find matching one-shot lower-bounds as well. In the
asymptotic setting where we encode into many copies of the resource state, our
bounds yield an operational interpretation of resource monotones such as the
relative entropy of coherence and its corresponding relative entropy variance.

cosmological observables, focusing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
temperature anisotropy power spectrum and the matter power spectrum.
Surprisingly, we find that even huge dark energy-baryon cross-sections
$\sigma_{xb} \sim {\cal O}({\rm b})$, which are generically excluded by
non-cosmological probes such as collider searches or precision gravity tests,
only leave an insignificant imprint on the observables considered. In the case
of the CMB temperature power spectrum, the only imprint consists in a
sub-percent enhancement or depletion of power (depending whether or not the
dark energy equation of state lies above or below $-1$) at very low multipoles,
which is thus swamped by cosmic variance. These effects are explained in terms
of differences in how gravitational potentials decay in the presence of a dark
energy-baryon scattering, which ultimately lead to an increase or decrease in
the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe power. Even smaller related effects are
imprinted on the matter power spectrum. The imprints on the CMB are not
expected to be degenerate with the effects due to altering the dark energy
sound speed. We conclude that, while strongly appealing, the prospects for a
direct detection of dark energy through cosmology do not seem feasible when
considering realistic dark energy-baryon cross-sections. As a caveat, our

using data from the KMOS Galaxy Evolution Survey (KGES). We quantify the
morphology of the galaxies using $HST$ CANDELS imaging parametrically and
non-parametrically. We combine the H$\alpha$ dynamics from KMOS with the
high-resolution imaging to derive the relation between stellar mass (M$_{*}$)
and stellar specific angular momentum (j$_{*}$). We show that high-redshift
star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 follow a power-law trend in specific stellar
angular momentum with stellar mass similar to that of local late-type galaxies
of the form j$_*$$\propto$M$_*^{0.53 \pm 0.10}$. The highest specific angular
momentum galaxies are mostly disc-like, although generally, both peculiar
morphologies and disc-like systems are found across the sequence of specific
angular momentum at a fixed stellar mass. We explore the scatter within the
j$_{*}$-M$_{*}$ plane and its correlation with both the integrated dynamical
properties of a galaxy (e.g. velocity dispersion, Toomre Q$_{\rm g}$, H$\alpha$
star formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and its parameterised
rest-frame UV/optical morphology (e.g. S\'ersic index, bulge to total ratio,
Clumpiness, Asymmetry and Concentration). We establish that the position in the
j$_{*}$-M$_{*}$ plane is strongly correlated with the star-formation surface
density and the Clumpiness of the stellar light distribution. Galaxies with
peculiar rest-frame UV/optical morphologies have comparable specific angular
momentum to disc-dominated galaxies of the same stellar mass, but are clumpier
and have higher star-formation rate surface densities. We propose that the
peculiar morphologies in high--redshift systems are driven by higher star
formation rate surface densities and higher gas fractions leading to a more
clumpy inter-stellar medium.

  Navigation","Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU)",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task in which an agent
needs to follow a language-specified path to reach a target destination. The
goal gets even harder as the actions available to the agent get simpler and
move towards low-level, atomic interactions with the environment. This setting
takes the name of low-level VLN. In this paper, we strive for the creation of
an agent able to tackle three key issues: multi-modality, long-term
dependencies, and adaptability towards different locomotive settings. To that
end, we devise ""Perceive, Transform, and Act"" (PTA): a fully-attentive VLN
architecture that leaves the recurrent approach behind and the first
Transformer-like architecture incorporating three different modalities -
natural language, images, and low-level actions for the agent control. In
particular, we adopt an early fusion strategy to merge lingual and visual
information efficiently in our encoder. We then propose to refine the decoding
phase with a late fusion extension between the agent's history of actions and
the perceptual modalities. We experimentally validate our model on two
datasets: PTA achieves promising results in low-level VLN on R2R and achieves
good performance in the recently proposed R4R benchmark. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/aimagelab/perceive-transform-and-act.

measure dynamical masses for binary systems at a range of temperatures. In this
paper, we present orbits of three young K+M binary systems in Taurus (Hubble~4,
FF~Tau, and HP~Tau/G3) with VLBI parallaxes. We obtained precision astrometry
with Keck-II/NIRC2, optical photometry with HST/WFC3, and low-resolution
optical spectra with WIFeS on the ANU 2.3 m telescope. We fit orbital solutions
and dynamical masses with uncertainties of 1-5% for the three binary systems.
The spectrum, photometry, and mass for Hubble~4 are inconsistent with a binary
system, suggesting that it may be a triple system where the primary component
consists of two stars. For HP~Tau/G3 and FF~Tau, model masses derived from SED
determined component temperatures and luminosities agree with the dynamical
masses, with a small offset towards larger model masses. We find model ages for
the primary components of these systems of $\sim$3 Myr, but find that the
secondaries appear younger by a factor of two. These estimates also disagree
with the age of the physically associated G-type star HP~Tau/G2, which is older
($\sim$5 Myr) according to the same models. This discrepancy is equivalent to a
luminosity under-prediction of 0.1-0.2 dex, or a temperature over-prediction of
100-300 K, for K/M-type stars at a given model age. We interpret this as
further evidence for a systematic error in pre-main sequence evolutionary
tracks for convective stars. Our results reinforce that the ages of young
populations determined from the locus of M-type members on the HR-diagram may
require upward revision.

the von Neumann entropy of a state grows linearly in time $t$ under a global
quench, all $n$th R\'enyi entropies with $n > 1$ grow with a diffusive scaling
$\sqrt{t}$. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce an amplitude $A(t)$,
which is the overlap of the time-evolution operator $U(t)$ of the entire system
with the tensor product of the two evolution operators of the subsystems of a
spatial bipartition. As long as $|A(t)| \ge e^{-\sqrt{Dt}}$, which we argue
holds true for generic diffusive non-integrable systems, all $n$th R\'enyi
entropies with $n >1$ (annealed-averaged over initial product states) are
bounded from above by $\sqrt{t}$. We prove the following inequality for the

in a local spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ random circuit with a $\text{U}(1)$ conservation
law by mapping to the survival probability of a symmetric exclusion process.

tip, 2) folded fiber, 3) looped fiber and 4) and fibers wound around a
cylinder. We employ a custom field emission microscope to quantify I-V
characteristics in combination with laterally-resolved field-dependent electron
emission area. Additionally we look at the very early emission stages, first
when a CNT fiber is turned on for the first time which is then followed by
multiple ramp-up/down. Upon the first turn on, all fibers demonstrated limited
and discrete emission area. During ramping runs, all CNT fibers underwent
multiple (minor and/or major) breakdowns which improved emission properties in
that turn-on field decreased, field enhancement factor and emission area both
increased. It is proposed that breakdowns are responsible for removing
initially undesirable emission sites caused by stray fibers higher than
average. This initial breakdown process gives way to a larger emission area
that is created when the CNT fiber sub components unfold and align with the
electric field. Our results form the basis for careful evaluation of CNT fiber
cathodes for dc or low frequency pulsed power systems in which large uniform
area emission is required, or for narrow beam high frequency applications in

(ALPs) -- their potential couplings to sterile neutrinos -- are presented. We
found that mono-photon searches have the potential to constrain ALP couplings
to sterile neutrinos when a new heavy scalar boosts the ALP decay yields.
Working within an effective field theory (EFT) approach, we scan the parameters
space to establish the reach of the 13 TeV LHC to probe such couplings. We
found regions of the parameters space evading several experimental constraints
that can be probed at the LHC. Moreover, a complementary role between the LHC
and various experiments that search for axions and ALPs can be anticipated for
models where ALPs interact with sterile neutrinos. We also present the UV
realization of a model having an axion-like particle, a heavy scalar and
sterile neutrinos whose parameters are spanned by our EFT approach. The
proposed model contains a type of seesaw mechanism for generating masses for
the active neutrinos along with sterile neutrinos involving the high energy
scale of the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry associated to the ALP.
Some benchmark points of this model can be discovered at the 13 TeV LHC with
300 fb$^{-1}$.

test if and how the incidence and velocity of ionized outflow is related to AGN
physical parameters: black hole mass, gas column density, Eddington Ratio,
[OIII], X-ray, and bolometric luminosities. We find a higher occurrence of
ionized outflows in type 1.9 (55%) and type 1 AGN (46%) with respect to type 2

red velocity offsets with respect to the [OIII] narrow component, they are
almost exclusively blueshifted in type 1 and type 1.9 AGN. We observe a
significant dependence between the outflow occurrence and accretion rate, which
becomes relevant at high Eddington ratios (> -1.7). We interpret such behaviour
in the framework of covering factor-Eddington ratio dependence. We don't find

an increase with bolometric luminosity can be only identified when including

  imaging systems through non-uniform and curved time-lens array",,,"10.1364/OE.382439",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observing and studying the evolution of rare non-repetitive natural phenomena
such as optical rogue waves or dynamic chemical processes in living cells is a
crucial necessity for developing science and technologies relating to them. One
indispensable technique for investigating these fast evolutions is temporal
imaging systems. However, just as conventional spatial imaging systems are
incapable of capturing depth information of a three-dimensional scene, typical
temporal imaging systems also lack this ability to retrieve depth information;
different dispersions in a complex pulse. Therefore, enabling temporal imaging
systems to provide these information with great detail would add a new facet to
the analysis of ultrafast pulses. In this paper, after discussing how spatial
three-dimensional integral imaging could be generalized to the time domain, two
distinct methods have been proposed in order to compensate for its shortcomings
such as relatively low depth resolution and limited depth-of-field. The first
method utilizes a curved time-lens array instead of a flat one, which leads to
an improved viewing zone and depth resolution, simultaneously. The second one
which widens the depth-of-field is based on the non-uniformity of focal lengths
of time-lenses in the time-lens array. It has been shown that compared with
conventional setup for temporal integral imaging, depth resolution, i.e.
dispersion resolvability, and depth-of-field, i.e. the range of resolvable
dispersions, have been improved by a factor of 2.5 and 1.87, respectively.

Sitter space. These black holes have a classical analytic extension through the
inner horizon to additional asymptotic regions. If this extension survives in
the quantum theory, it requires particular analytic properties in a dual CFT,
which give a prescription for calculating correlation functions for operators
placed on any asymptotic boundary of the maximally extended spacetime. We show
that for charged black holes in three or greater dimensions, and rotating black
holes in four or greater dimensions, these analytic properties are inconsistent
in the dual CFT, implying the absence of an analytic extension for quantum
fields past the inner horizon. Thus, we find that strong cosmic censorship
holds for all AdS black holes except rotating BTZ. To further study the latter
case, we insert classical perturbations near the boundary at late times,
producing shockwaves traveling along the inner horizon. We holographically
compute CFT correlators in this background that probe a high energy scattering
process near the inner horizon and argue that the shockwave does not
destabilize the inner horizon violently enough to prevent signaling between
different asymptotic regions of the Penrose diagram. This provides evidence
that the rotating BTZ black hole does violate the strong cosmic censorship
conjecture.

heterogeneous networks, where the nodes may have different energy efficiency

to its nonconvex sum-of-ratios form. Unlike previous work, this paper presents
a systematic approach to WSEE maximization under not only power constraints,
but also data rate constraints, using a general SINR expression. In particular,
the original problem is transformed into an equivalent form, and then a
sequential convex optimization (SCO) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is
theoretically guaranteed to converge for any initial feasible point, and, under
suitable constraint qualifications, achieves a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
solution. Furthermore, we provide remarkable extensions to the proposed
methodology, including systems with multiple resource blocks as well as a more
general power consumption model which is not necessarily a convex function of
the transmit powers. Finally, numerical analysis reveals that the proposed
algorithm exhibits fast convergence, low complexity, and robustness
(insensitivity to initial points).

and dynamical evolution models of the Milky Way disk. In this paper, we analyze
a high-resolution N-body simulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy to study the
role that the slowing down of a stellar bar has is generating migration from
the inner to the outer disk. Stellar particles are trapped by the main
resonances (corotation and Outer Lindblad resonance) which then propagate
outwards across the disk due to the bar slowing down. Once the bar strength
reaches its maximal amplitude, some of the stars, delivered to the outer disk,
escape the resonances and some of them settle on nearly circular orbits. The
number of the escaped stars gradually increases also due to the decrease of the
bar strength when the boxy/peanut bulge forms. We show that this mechanism is
not limited only to stars on nearly circular orbits: also stars initially on
more eccentric orbits can be transferred outwards (out to the OLR location) and
can end up on nearly circular orbits. Therefore, the propagation of the bar
resonances outwards can induce the circularization of the orbits of some of the
migrating stars. The mechanism investigated in this paper can explain the
presence of metal-rich stars at the solar vicinity and more generally in the
outer galactic disk. Our dynamical model predicts that up to 3% of stars in
between of corotation and the OLR can be formed in the innermost region of the
Milky Way. The epoch of the Milky Way bar formation can be potentially
constrained by analyzing the age distribution of the most metal-rich stars at
the solar vicinity.

decomposition to account for multiple feature variables. Our most significant
contributions are with hierarchical topic modeling. We design distinct methods

to exhibit distinct magnetic properties depending on the layer thickness and
stacking order. Bulk CrI3 is ferromagnetic (FM) with a Curie temperature of 61
K and a rhombohedral layer stacking, while few-layer CrI3 has a layered
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with a lower ordering temperature of 45 K and a
monoclinic stacking. In this work, we use cryogenic magnetic force microscopy
to investigate CrI3 flakes in the intermediate thickness range (25 - 200 nm)
and find that the two types of magnetic orders hence the stacking orders can
coexist in the same flake, with a layer of ~13 nm at each surface being in the
layered AFM phase similar to few-layer CrI3 and the rest in the bulk FM phase.
The switching of the bulk moment proceeds through a remnant state with nearly
compensated magnetic moment along the c-axis, indicating formation of c-axis
domains allowed by a weak interlayer coupling strength in the rhombohedral

In this paper, several criteria are introduced to analyze the influence of the

which initial guesses need to be improved in case of convergence failure. In
particular, indicators based on first and second derivatives of the residual

key ingredients in theories of dust growth and planet formation. However,
direct measurement of this quantity is complicated, and often depends on the
fitting of complex models to the data. In this paper we demonstrate a method to
directly measure the midplane gas temperature from an optically thick molecular
line, if the disk is moderately inclined. The only model assumption that enters
is that the line is very optically thick, also in the midplane region where we
wish to measure the temperature. Freeze-out of the molecule onto dust grains
could thwart this. However, in regions that are expected to be warm enough to
avoid freeze-out, this method should work. We apply the method to the CO 2-1
line channel maps of the disk around HD 163296. We find that the midplane
temperature between 100 and 400 au drops only mildly from 25 K down to 18 K.
While we see no direct evidence of the midplane being optically thin due to
strong CO depletion by freeze-out, we cannot rule it out either. The fact that
the inferred temperatures are close to the expected CO freeze-out temperature
could be an indication of this. Incidently, for the disk around HD 163296 we
also find dynamic evidence for a rather abrupt outer edge of the disk,
suggestive of outside-in photoevaporation or truncation by an unseen companion.

combines the best of traditional statistical models and neural networks. We
focus on time-series with long-range dependencies, needed for monitoring fine
granularity data (e.g. minutes, seconds, milliseconds), prevalent in
operational use-cases.
  Traditional models, such as auto-regression fitted with least squares
(Classic-AR) can model time-series with a concise and interpretable model. When
dealing with long-range dependencies, Classic-AR models can become intractably
slow to fit for large data. Recently, sequence-to-sequence models, such as
Recurrent Neural Networks, which were originally intended for natural language
processing, have become popular for time-series. However, they can be overly
complex for typical time-series data and lack interpretability.
  A scalable and interpretable model is needed to bridge the statistical and
deep learning-based approaches. As a first step towards this goal, we propose
modelling AR-process dynamics using a feed-forward neural network approach,
termed AR-Net. We show that AR-Net is as interpretable as Classic-AR but also
scales to long-range dependencies.
  Our results lead to three major conclusions: First, AR-Net learns identical
AR-coefficients as Classic-AR, thus being equally interpretable. Second, the
computational complexity with respect to the order of the AR process, is linear
for AR-Net as compared to a quadratic for Classic-AR. This makes it possible to
model long-range dependencies within fine granularity data. Third, by
introducing regularization, AR-Net automatically selects and learns sparse
AR-coefficients. This eliminates the need to know the exact order of the
AR-process and allows to learn sparse weights for a model with long-range
dependencies.

the system needs to remain close to thermal equilibrium along the protocol.
Here, we show that smoothly modifying the system-bath interaction can
significantly speed up such transformations. In particular, we construct
protocols where the overall dissipation $W_{\rm diss}$ decays with the total
time $\tau_{\rm tot}$ of the protocol as $W_{\rm diss} \propto \tau_{\rm
tot}^{-2\alpha-1}$, where each value $\alpha > 0$ can be obtained by a suitable
modification of the interaction, whereas $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a standard
isothermal process where the system-bath interaction remains constant.
Considering heat engines based on such speed-ups, we show that the
corresponding efficiency at maximum power interpolates between the
Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency for $\alpha =0$ and the Carnot efficiency for $\alpha

performance of refrigerators. We confirm our analytical results with two
numerical examples where $\alpha = 1/2$, namely the time-dependent
Caldeira-Leggett and resonant-level models, with strong system-environment

WS2, which exhibits a large exciton oscillator strength and binding energy, the

provide a framework for performing localized, high accuracy WF calculations on
a system, while not incurring the full computational cost of the WF calculation
on the full system. In order to effectively partition a system into localized
WF and DFT subsystems, we utilize the Huzinaga level-shift projection operator
within an absolutely localized basis. In this work, we study the ability of the
absolutely localized Huzinaga level-shift projection operator method to study
complex WF and DFT partitions, including partitions between multiple covalent
bonds, a double bond, and transition metal-ligand bonds. We find that our
methodology can accurately describe all of these complex partitions.
Additionally, we study the robustness of this method with respect to the WF
method, specifically where the embedded systems were described using a
multiconfigurational WF method. We found that the method is systematically
improvable with respect to both the number of atoms in the WF region and the
size of the basis set used, with energy errors less than 1 kcal/mol.
Additionally, we calculated the adsorption energy of H$_2$ to a model of an
iron metal organic framework (Fe-MOF-74) to within 1 kcal/mol compared to
CASPT2 calculations performed on the full model while incurring only a small
fraction of the full computational cost. This work demonstrates that the
absolutely localized Huzinaga level-shift projection operator method is
applicable to very complex systems with difficult electronic structures.

value of the integrand, since those problems are extremely high-dimensional
integrations, for example, risk measurement of credit portfolio. This leads to
the situation that the required qubit number is too large in the naive
implementation where a quantum register is allocated per random number. In this
paper, we point out that we can reduce qubits keeping quantum speed up if we
perform calculation similar to classical one, that is, estimate the average of
integrand values sampled by a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) implemented
on a quantum circuit. We present not only the overview of the idea but also
concrete implementation of PRNG and application to credit risk measurement.
Actually, reduction of qubits is a trade-off against increase of circuit depth.
Therefore full reduction might be impractical, but such a trade-off between
speed and memory space will be important in adjustment of calculation setting
considering machine specs, if large-scale Monte Carlo simulation by quantum
computer is in operation in the future.

The framework allows the robot to follow a person to the desired location using
a Person Re-identification model. When composing is activated, the robot
attempts to adjust its position to form the view that can best match the given

predicted dynamically using an off-the-shelf photo evaluation model by the

flexibly replaced based on needs. We show our framework on a variety of
examples. In particular, we tested it in three indoor scenes and used it to
take 20 photos of each scene: ten for the pre-defined template, ten for the
dynamically generated ones. The average number of adjustment was $11.20$ for

that chimera states of non-locally coupled Kuramoto--Sakaguchi oscillators in

$\alpha \in (0, \pi/2)$; after a transient time, all the oscillators are phase
synchronized, with the transient time increasing exponentially with the number
of oscillators. In this work, we consider a small array of six non-locally

these circumstances, we observe a chimera state spontaneously formed by the
partition of oscillators into two independently synchronizable clusters of both
stable and unstable synchronous states. We provide numerical evidence
supporting that the instantaneous frequencies of the oscillators of the chimera
state are periodic functions of time with a common period, and as a result, the
chimera state is stable but not long-lived transient. We also measure the basin
stability of the chimera state and show that it can be observed for random

volumetric Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) measurements. Volumetric PTV is
a state-of-the-art non-invasive flow measurement technique, which measures the
velocity field by recording successive snapshots of the tracer particle motion
using a multi-camera set-up. The measurement chain involves reconstructing the
three-dimensional particle positions by a triangulation process using the
calibrated camera mapping functions. The non-linear combination of the
elemental error sources during the iterative self-calibration correction and
particle reconstruction steps increases the complexity of the task. Here, we
first estimate the uncertainty in the particle image location, which we model
as a combination of the particle position estimation uncertainty and the
reprojection error uncertainty. The latter is obtained by a gaussian fit to the
histogram of disparity estimates within a sub-volume. Next, we determine the
uncertainty in the camera calibration coefficients. As a final step the
previous two uncertainties are combined using an uncertainty propagation
through the volumetric reconstruction process. The uncertainty in the velocity
vector is directly obtained as a function of the reconstructed particle
position uncertainty. The framework is tested with synthetic vortex ring
images. The results show good agreement between the predicted and the expected
RMS uncertainty values. The prediction is consistent for seeding densities
tested in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 particles per pixel. Finally, the
methodology is also successfully validated for an experimental test case of
laminar pipe flow velocity profile measurement where the predicted uncertainty
is within 17% of the RMS error value.

the human hand, we introduce two geometric constraints directly into the 3D

the numbers of electrons and orbitals. The problem can be mitigated by
observing that a vast number of configurations have little weights in the wave
function and do not contribute to the correlation energy. The real questions
are then (a) how to identify important configurations in the early stage of the
calculation and (b) how to account for the residual contributions of those
unimportant configurations. It is generally true that if a high-quality yet
compact variational space can be determined for describing the static
correlation, a low-order treatment of the residual dynamic correlation would be
sufficient. While this is common to all selected CI schemes, the `iCI with

Full spin symmetry is maintained. (2) Although the selection is performed on

important oCFGs/CSFs is performed iteratively until convergence. (4) At each

essential for understanding complex human actions, are not fully exploited. To

learning algorithms. Their state and action spaces are combinatorially large,
their reward function is sparse, and they are partially observable: the agent
is informed of the consequences of its actions through textual feedback. In
this paper we emphasize this latter point and consider the design of a deep
reinforcement learning agent that can play from feedback alone. Our design
recognizes and takes advantage of the structural characteristics of text-based
games. We first propose a contextualisation mechanism, based on accumulated
reward, which simplifies the learning problem and mitigates partial
observability. We then study different methods that rely on the notion that
most actions are ineffectual in any given situation, following Zahavy et al.'s
idea of an admissible action. We evaluate these techniques in a series of
text-based games of increasing difficulty based on the TextWorld framework, as
well as the iconic game Zork. Empirically, we find that these techniques
improve the performance of a baseline deep reinforcement learning agent applied
to text-based games.

  Semantic and Time Aspect",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the research interest of person re-identification (ReID) has
gradually turned to video-based methods, which acquire a person representation
by aggregating frame features of an entire video. However, existing video-based
ReID methods do not consider the semantic difference brought by the outputs of
different network stages, which potentially compromises the information
richness of the person features. Furthermore, traditional methods ignore
important relationship among frames, which causes information redundancy in
fusion along the time axis. To address these issues, we propose a novel general
temporal fusion framework to aggregate frame features on both semantic aspect
and time aspect. As for the semantic aspect, a multi-stage fusion network is
explored to fuse richer frame features at multiple semantic levels, which can
effectively reduce the information loss caused by the traditional single-stage
fusion. While, for the time axis, the existing intra-frame attention method is
improved by adding a novel inter-frame attention module, which effectively
reduces the information redundancy in temporal fusion by taking the
relationship among frames into consideration. The experimental results show
that our approach can effectively improve the video-based re-identification
accuracy, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

science and engineering, from supernovae and fusion to scramjets and
nano-fabrication. Classical Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is induced by a
steady shock and impulsive acceleration, whereas in realistic environments the
acceleration is usually variable. We focus on RMI induced by acceleration with
power-law time-dependence and apply group theory to solve the long-standing
problem. For early-time dynamics, we find the dependence of the growth-rate on
the initial conditions and show that it is independent of the acceleration
parameters. For late-time dynamics, we find a continuous family of regular
asymptotic solutions, including their curvature, velocity, Fourier amplitudes,
and interfacial shear, and we study their stability. For each solution, the
interface dynamics is directly linked to the interfacial shear, the
non-equilibrium velocity field has intense fluid motion near the interface and
effectively no motion in the bulk. The quasi-invariance of the fastest stable
solution suggests that nonlinear coherent dynamics in RMI is characterized by
two macroscopic length-scales -- the wavelength and the amplitude, in agreement
with observations. The properties of a number of special solutions are
outlined, these being respectively, the Atwood, Taylor, convergence,
minimum-shear, and critical bubbles, among others. We also elaborate new theory

classically studied in Combinatorics and Algebra alike. They play a central
role in the study of Symmetric functions, in Representation theory [Sta99], in
Schubert calculus [LM10] as well as in Enumerative combinatorics [Gas96, Sta84,
Sta99]. In recent years, they have also shown up in various incarnations in
Computer Science, e.g, Quantum computation [HRTS00, OW15] and Geometric
complexity theory [IP17].
  However, unlike some other families of symmetric polynomials like the
Elementary Symmetric polynomials, the Power Symmetric polynomials and the
Complete Homogeneous Symmetric polynomials, the computational complexity of
syntactically computing Schur polynomials has not been studied much. In
particular, it is not known whether Schur polynomials can be computed
efficiently by algebraic formulas. In this work, we address this question, and
show that unless \emph{every} polynomial with a small algebraic branching
program (ABP) has a small algebraic formula, there are Schur polynomials that
cannot be computed by algebraic formula of polynomial size. In other words,
unless the algebraic complexity class $\mathrm{VBP}$ is equal to the complexity
class $\mathrm{VF}$, there exist Schur polynomials which do not have polynomial
size algebraic formulas.
  As a consequence of our proof, we also show that computing the determinant of
certain \emph{generalized} Vandermonde matrices is essentially as hard as
computing the general symbolic determinant. To the best of our knowledge, these
are one of the first hardness results of this kind for families of polynomials
which are not \emph{multilinear}. A key ingredient of our proof is the study of
composition of \emph{well behaved} algebraically independent polynomials with a
homogeneous polynomial, and might be of independent interest.

UV-selected star-forming galaxies at redshift 4 and above and study the effect
of the dust attenuation on these measurements.
  Methods. The ultra-violet spectrum of high redshift galaxies is a combination
of their intrinsic emission and the effect of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM)
absorption along their line of sight. Using data coming from the unprecedented
deep spectroscopy from the VANDELS ESO public survey carried out with the VIMOS
instrument we compute both the dust extinction and the mean transmission of the
IGM as well as its scatter from a set of 281 galaxies at z>3.87. Because of a
degeneracy between the dust content of the galaxy and the IGM, we first
estimate the stellar dust extinction parameter E(B-V) and study the result as a
function of the dust prescription. Using these measurements as constraint for
the spectral fit we estimate the IGM transmission Tr(Lyalpha). Both photometric
and spectroscopic SED fitting are done using the SPectroscopy And photometRy
fiTting tool for Astronomical aNalysis (SPARTAN) that is able to fit the
spectral continuum of the galaxies as well as photometric data.
  Results. Using the classical Calzetti's attenuation law we find that E(B-V)
goes from 0.11 at z=3.99 to 0.08 at z=5.15. These results are in very good
agreement with previous measurements from the literature. We estimate the IGM
transmission and find that the transmission is decreasing with increasing
redshift from Tr(Lyalpha)=0.53 at z=3.99 to 0.28 at z=5.15. We also find a
large standard deviation around the average transmission that is more than 0.1
at every redshift. Our results are in very good agreement with both previous
measurements from AGN studies and with theoretical models.

which combines a low-mode spectral decomposition of the quark propagator and
stochastic estimators for remaining high modes, to evaluate the HAL QCD
potentials for the first time. Using this method, we investigate the $I= 1,2$
$\pi \pi$ scatterings at $m_{\pi} \approx 870$ MeV. In the $I=2$ study, we
study how statistical fluctuations of the HAL QCD potentials are increased due
to stochastic estimators in the hybrid method, compared with the conventional
one without them. We find that we can reduce statistical fluctuations by
dilutions of stochastic noises in order to obtain sufficiently precise results,
which turn out to be consistent with conventional results without all-to-all
propagators. In the $I=1$ $\pi \pi$ case, which contains quark annihilation
processes, we find that statistical fluctuations are further enhanced due to
noise contaminations in annihilation processes. We, however, confirm that we
can also reduce such statistical fluctuations to obtain the potential with a
reasonable precision as long as we further increase a degree of dilutions at a
price of large numerical costs and take an appropriate scheme for the
potential.

show that our methods are comparable to and outperform the Krylov subspace

generating multiple independent candidate ideas followed by selection and
refinement of the most promising. Honing theory, which grew out of the quantum
approach to describing how concepts interact, posits that what appears to be
discrete, separate ideas are actually different projections of the same
underlying mental representation, which can be described as a superposition
state, and which may take different outward forms when reflected upon from
different perspectives. As creative thought proceeds, this representation loses
potentiality to be viewed from different perspectives and manifest as different
outcomes. Honing theory yields different predictions from conventional theories
about the mental representation of an idea midway through the creative process.
These predictions were pitted against one another in two studies: one
closed-ended and one open-ended. In the first study, participants were
interrupted midway through solving an analogy problem and wrote down what they
were thinking in terms of a solution. In the second, participants were
instructed to create a painting that expressed their true essence and describe
how they conceived of the painting. For both studies, na\""ive judges
categorized these responses as supportive of either the conventional view or
the honing theory view. The results of both studies were significantly more
consistent with the predictions of honing theory. Some implications for
creative cognition, and cognition in general, are discussed.

high-quality products can be promoted on an online shop or highly reputed

classical ranking algorithms share a common drawback: they tend to rank older

clients to collaboratively train a joint model. It allows clients to train
models locally, and leverages the parameter server to generate a global model
by aggregating the locally submitted gradient updates at each round. Although
the incentive model for federated learning has not been fully developed, it is
supposed that participants are able to get rewards or the privilege to use the
final global model, as a compensation for taking efforts to train the model.
Therefore, a client who does not have any local data has the incentive to
construct local gradient updates in order to deceive for rewards. In this
paper, we are the first to propose the notion of free rider attacks, to explore
possible ways that an attacker may construct gradient updates, without any
local training data. Furthermore, we explore possible defenses that could
detect the proposed attacks, and propose a new high dimensional detection
method called STD-DAGMM, which particularly works well for anomaly detection of
model parameters. We extend the attacks and defenses to consider more free
riders as well as differential privacy, which sheds light on and calls for

a central role in several application domains including those in the social
sciences, epidemiology, medicine and biology. In these domains, the size of the
population under study is often very large, however, the number of observations
available per individual in the population is very small (\emph{sparse
observations}) which makes the problem challenging. Consider the setting with
$N$ independent individuals, each with unknown parameters $(p_i, q_i)$ drawn
from some unknown distribution on $[0, 1]^2$. We observe $X_i \sim
\text{Bin}(t, p_i)$ before an event and $Y_i \sim \text{Bin}(t, q_i)$ after the
event. Provided these paired observations, $\{(X_i, Y_i) \}_{i=1}^N$, our goal
is to accurately estimate the \emph{distribution of the change in parameters},
$\delta_i := q_i - p_i$, over the population and properties of interest like
the \emph{$\ell_1$-magnitude of the change} with sparse observations ($t\ll
N$). We provide \emph{information theoretic lower bounds} on the error in
estimating the distribution of change and the $\ell_1$-magnitude of change.
Furthermore, we show that the following two step procedure achieves the optimal
error bounds: first, estimate the full joint distribution of the paired
parameters using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and then estimate the
distribution of change and the $\ell_1$-magnitude of change using the joint
MLE. Notably, and perhaps surprisingly, these error bounds are of the same
order as the minimax optimal error bounds for learning the \emph{full} joint
distribution itself (in Wasserstein-1 distance); in other words, estimating the
magnitude of the change of parameters over the population is, in a minimax
sense, as difficult as estimating the full joint distribution itself.

efficiency than model-free methods. However, due to the inevitable errors of
learned models, model-based methods struggle to achieve the same asymptotic
performance as model-free methods.
  In this paper, We propose a Policy Optimization method with Model-Based
Uncertainty (POMBU)---a novel model-based approach---that can effectively
improve the asymptotic performance using the uncertainty in Q-values. We derive
an upper bound of the uncertainty, based on which we can approximate the
uncertainty accurately and efficiently for model-based methods. We further
propose an uncertainty-aware policy optimization algorithm that optimizes the
policy conservatively to encourage performance improvement with high
probability. This can significantly alleviate the overfitting of policy to
inaccurate models.
  Experiments show POMBU can outperform existing state-of-the-art policy
optimization algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate the excellent robustness of
POMBU compared to previous model-based approaches.

However, the development of the mixtures had not exhibited significant progress

machine learning to optimize the composition ratio of ternary
Li3PO4-Li3BO3-Li2SO4 mixture for its Li-ion conductivity. According to our
results, the optimum composition of the ternary mixture system is 25:14:61

x 10E-4 S/cm at 300 {\deg}C. Our X-ray structure analysis indicates that Li-ion
conductivity in the mixing systems is enhanced by virtue of the coexistence of
two or more phases. Although the mechanism enhancing Li-ion conductivity is not

its wing extension, to constrain the inner radius of the disk and thereby the
separation of a putative BBH. The hypothesis of a current BBH is effectively
ruled out on the grounds that its merger time must be a small fraction of the
current age of the B star. The hypothesis of a previous BBH that merged to
create the current dark mass is also effectively ruled out by the low orbital

different cavity regimes of VPC, i.e., open cavity (OC) and two-branch cavity
(TBC), under various range of free stream velocity (U) and ventilation rates
(Q). Our experiments reveal similar flow patterns for both OC and TBC,
including forward flow region near the air-water interface, reverse flow
region, near-cavitator vortex, and internal flow circulation vortex. However,
OC internal flow exhibits highly unsteady internal flow features, while TBC
internal flow shows laminar-like flow patterns with a Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability developed at the interface between forward and reverse flow regions
within the cavity. Internal flow patterns and the unsteadiness of OC resemble
those of turbulent flow separation past a backward-facing step (BFS flow),
suggesting a strong coupling of internal flow and turbulent external
recirculation region for OC. Likewise, internal flow patterns of TBC resemble
those of laminar BFS flow, with the presence of unsteadiness due to the strong
velocity gradient across the forward-reverse flow interface. The variation of
the internal flow upon changing U or Q is further employed to explain the
cavity regime transition and the corresponding change of cavity geometry. Our
study suggests that ventilation control can potentially stabilize the cavity in
the TBC regime by delaying its internal flow regime transition from
laminar-like to highly unsteady.

is the large ego-motion in the videos. To deal with shadows, we build up an
autonomous driving shadow dataset and design a deep neural network to detect
shadows automatically. To deal with large ego-motion, we take advantage of the
multi-source data, in particular the 3D data, in autonomous driving. More
specifically, the geometric relationship between frames is incorporated into an
inpainting deep neural network to produce high-quality structurally consistent
video output. Experiments show that our method outperforms other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) object removal algorithms, reducing the RMSE by over
$19\%$.

R-Scrum and SafeScrum are two concrete suggestions for how to develop
safety-critical systems using agile methods. However, for large-scale
environments, existing frameworks like SAFe or LeSS do not support the
development of safety-critical systems out of the box. We, therefore, aim to
understand which challenges exist when developing safety-critical systems
within large-scale agile industrial settings, in particular in the automotive
domain. Based on an analysis of R-Scrum and SafeScrum, we conducted a focus
group with three experts from industry to collect challenges in their daily
work. We found challenges in the areas of living traceability, continuous
compliance, and organisational flexibility. Among others, organisations
struggle with defining a suitable traceability strategy, performing incremental
safety analysis, and with integrating safety practices into their scaled way of
working. Our results indicate a need to provide practical approaches to
integrate safety work into large-scale agile development and point towards
possible solutions, e.g., modular safety cases.

Specifically, the switching cost has significant impact on the dynamic regret

various mode-locking methods can benefit many important applications including
communication, materials processing, astronomical observation, etc. For
decades, mode-locking based on dissipative four-wave-mixing (DFWM) has been
fundamental in producing pulses with repetition rates on the order of gigahertz
(GHz), where multiwavelength comb filters and long nonlinear components are
elemental. Recently, this method has been improved using filter-driven DFWM,
which exploits both the filtering and nonlinear features of silica microring
resonators. However, the fabrication complexity and coupling loss between
waveguides and fibers are problematics. In this study, we demonstrate a tens to
hundreds of gigahertz stable pulsed all-fiber laser based on the hybrid
plasmonic microfiber knot resonator device. Unlike previously reported pulse
generation mechanisms, the operation utilizes the
nonlinear-polarization-rotation (NPR) effect introduced by the
polarization-dependent feature of the device to increase intracavity power for
boosting DFWM mode-locking, which we term NPR -stimulated DFWM. The
easily-fabricated versatile device acts as a polarizer, comb filter, and
nonlinear component simultaneously, thereby introducing a novel application of
microfiber resonator devices in ultrafast and nonlinear photonics. We believe
that our work underpins a significant improvement in achieving practical
low-cost ultrafast light sources.

improved $C^{1,\mu}$ estimate and identify the building blocks of the
regularity theory, dubbed `Navier polynomials'. In the case when some structure
is assumed on the oscillations of the boundary, for instance periodicity, these
estimates can be seen as local error estimates. Although we handle the
regularity of the nonlinear stationary Navier-Stokes equations, our results do
not require any smallness assumption on the solutions.

  Demonstration",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research on automotive driving developed an efficient end-to-end
learning mode that directly maps visual input to control commands. However, it
models distinct driving variations in a single network, which increases
learning complexity and is less adaptive for modular integration. In this
paper, we re-investigate human's driving style and propose to learn an
intermediate driving intention region to relax difficulties in end-to-end
approach. The intention region follows both road structure in image and
direction towards goal in public route planner, which addresses visual
variations only and figures out where to go without conventional precise
localization. Then the learned visual intention is projected on vehicle local
coordinate and fused with reliable obstacle perception to render a navigation
score map widely used for motion planning. The core of the proposed system is a
weakly-supervised cGAN-LSTM model trained to learn driving intention from human
demonstration. The adversarial loss learns from limited demonstration data with
one local planned route and enables reasoning of multi-modal behavior with
diverse routes while testing. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with
real-world datasets. Results show the proposed paradigm can produce more
consistent motion commands with human demonstration, and indicates better
reliability and robustness to environment change.

degree distributions follow the classical power-law, at least asymptotically.
Yet, closer observation shows that the classical power-law distribution is
often inadequate to meet the data characteristics due to the existence of a
clearly identifiable non-linearity in the entire degree distribution in the
log-log scale. The present paper proposes a new variant of the popular
heavy-tailed Lomax distribution which we named as the Modified Lomax (MLM)
distribution that can efficiently capture the crucial aspect of heavy-tailed
behavior of the entire degree distribution of real-world complex networks. The
proposed MLM model, derived from a hierarchical family of Lomax distributions,
can efficiently fit the entire degree distribution of real-world networks
without removing lower degree nodes as opposed to the classical power-law based
fitting. The MLM distribution belongs to the maximum domain of attraction of
the Frechet distribution and is right tail equivalent to Pareto distribution.
Various statistical properties including characteristics of the maximum
likelihood estimates and asymptotic distributions have also been derived for
the proposed MLM model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed MLM model is
demonstrated through rigorous experiments over fifty real-world complex
networks from diverse applied domains.

community, solar flare prediction has become a topic of increased interest.
Although machine learning models have advanced with each successive
publication, the input data has remained largely fixed on magnetic features.
Despite this increased model complexity, results seem to indicate that
photospheric magnetic field data alone may not be a wholly sufficient source of
data for flare prediction. For the first time we have extended the study of
flare prediction to spectral data. In this work, we use Deep Neural Networks to
monitor the changes of several features derived from the strong resonant Mg II
h\&k lines observed by IRIS. The features in descending order of predictive
capability are: The triplet emission at 2798.77 $\text{\AA}$, line core
intensity, total continuum emission between the h\&k line cores, the k/h ratio,
line-width, followed by several other line features such as asymmetry and line
center. Regions that are about to flare generate spectra which are
distinguishable from non-flaring active region spectra. Our algorithm can
correctly identify pre-flare spectra approximately 35 minutes before the start
of the flare, with an AUC of 86 \% and an accuracy, precision and recall of 80
\%. The accuracy and AUC monotonically increases to 90 \% and 97 \%
respectively as we move closer in time to the start of the flare. Our study
indicates that spectral data alone can lead to good predictive models and
should be considered as an additional source of information alongside
photospheric magnetograms.

intervention effects in longitudinal non-randomised studies. A common issue
when analysing data from observational studies is the presence of incomplete
confounder data, which might lead to bias in the intervention effect estimates
if they are not handled properly in the statistical analysis. However, there is
currently no recommendation on how to address missing data on covariates in
MSMs under a variety of missingness mechanisms encountered in practice. We
reviewed existing methods to handling missing data in MSMs and performed a
simulation study to compare the performance of complete case (CC) analysis, the
last observation carried forward (LOCF), the missingness pattern approach
(MPA), multiple imputation (MI) and inverse-probability-of-missingness
weighting (IPMW). We considered three mechanisms for non-monotone missing data
which are common in observational studies using electronic health record data.
Whereas CC analysis lead to biased estimates of the intervention effect in
almost all scenarios, the performance of the other approaches varied across
scenarios. The LOCF approach led to unbiased estimates only under a specific
non-random mechanism in which confounder values were missing when their values
remained unchanged since the previous measurement. In this scenario, MI, the
MPA and IPMW were biased. MI and IPMW led to the estimation of unbiased effects
when data were missing at random, given the covariates or the treatment but
only MI was unbiased when the outcome was a predictor of missingness.
Furthermore, IPMW generally lead to very large standard errors. Lastly,
regardless of the missingness mechanism, the MPA led to unbiased estimates only
when the failure to record a confounder at a given time-point modified the
subsequent relationships between the partially observed covariate and the
outcome.

linewidth. Different from visible emission of intralayer excitons for both MoS2
and WSe2, our interlayer exciton laser works in the infrared range, which is
fully compatible with the well-established technologies in silicon photonics.
Thanks to the long lifetime of interlayer excitons, the requirement of the
cavity quality factor is relaxed by orders of magnitude. The demonstration of
room temperature interlayer exciton laser might open new perspectives for the
development of coherent light source with tailored optical properties on
silicon photonics platform.

excitation fields (D,H) should be dispensed with, on the grounds that they (a)
cannot be measured, and (b) act solely as gauge potentials for the charge and
current. In the resulting theory, it is only the links between the fields (E,B)
and the charge and current (\rho,J) that matter; and so we introduce
appropriate linear operator equations that combine the Gauss and Maxwell-Ampere
equations with the constitutive relations, eliminating (D,H). The result is
that we can admit more types of electromagnetic media -- notably, the new
relations can allow coupling in the bulk to a homogeneous axionic material; in
contrast to standard EM where any homogeneous axion-like field is completely
decoupled in the bulk, and only accessible at boundaries. We also consider a
wider context, including the role of topology, extended non-axionic
constitutive parameters, and treatment of Ohmic currents. A range of examples
including an axonic response material is presented, including static
electromagnetic scenarios, a possible metamaterial implementation, and how the
transformation optics paradigm would be modified. Notably, these examples
include one where topological considerations make it impossible to model using

investigated. 1-D TCad simulations are used to calculate $E_W$. For $\Phi_{\rm

higher $\Phi_{\rm eq}$ the time constant $\tau$ is much longer than the typical
electronics readout time and $E_W = 1/d$ ($d$ = sensor thickness). It is
demonstrated that the increase of the resistivity of the Si bulk with
irradiation is responsible for the increase of $\tau$. The admittance Y of
irradiated pad sensors has been measured for frequencies between f = 100 Hz and
1 MHz and voltages between 1 and 1000 V at -20$^\circ$C and -30$^\circ$C. For f
< 1 kHz the parallel capacitance C$_p$ shows a f dependence. A model with a
position-dependent resistivity is able to describe the data. It is concluded:
1. The weighting field of a highly irradiated sensor is the same as the
weighting field of a fully depleted sensor before irradiation. 2. Models with a
position-dependent resistivity describe the frequency dependence of C$_p$ for
irradiated sensors.

loop quantum cosmology, are encoded in the choice of so-called polymerisation

at curvature scales near the Planck curvature, severely restrict the possible
choices. An alternative point of view on the choice of polymerisation scheme is
to choose adapted variables so that the scheme is the simplest possible one,
known as $\mu_0$-scheme in loop quantum cosmology. There, physically viable
models with $\mu_0$-scheme polymerise the Hubble rate $b$ that is directly
related to the Ricci scalar and the matter energy density on-shell.
Consequently, the onset of quantum effects depends precisely on those
parameters. In this letter, we construct similar variables for black to white
hole transitions modelled using the description of the Schwarzschild interior
as a Kantowski-Sachs cosmology. The resulting model uses the $\mu_0$-scheme and
features sensible physics for a broad range of initial conditions (= choices of
black and white hole masses) and favours symmetric transitions upon invoking
additional qualitative arguments. The resulting Hamiltonian is very simple and
at most quadratic in its arguments, allowing for a straight forward

NoSQL databases, and increasingly also machine learning. JSON Schema is a
language for declaring the structure of valid JSON data. There are validators
that can decide whether a JSON document is valid with respect to a schema.
Unfortunately, like all instance-based testing, these validators can only show
the presence and never the absence of a bug. This paper presents a
complementary technique: JSON subschema checking, which can be used for static
type checking with JSON Schema. Deciding whether one schema is a subschema of
another is non-trivial because of the richness of the JSON Schema specification
language. Given a pair of schemas, our approach first canonicalizes and
simplifies both schemas, then decides the subschema question on the canonical
forms, dispatching simpler subschema queries to type-specific checkers. We
apply an implementation of our subschema checking algorithm to 8,548 pairs of
real-world JSON schemas from different domains, demonstrating that it can
decide the subschema question for most schema pairs and is always correct for
schema pairs that it can decide. We hope that our work will bring more static
guarantees to hard-to-debug domains, such as cloud computing and artificial

formation and propagation of vortex rings. We study this effect in aqueous
solution of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAMH) at different concentrations.
Addition of PAMH imparts shear-rate dependent viscosity and elasticity to the
solvent. With increasing concentration of PAMH both the zero-shear-rate
viscosity ($\eta_0$) and the infinite-shear-rate viscosity ($\eta_{\infty}$)
increase. The relaxation time also increases with the increase in
concentration. We generate vortex rings using a piston-cylinder mechanism in a
glass tank and measure vortex ring properties such as ring position, ring
circulation, enstrophy, kinetic energy and peak vorticity using particle image
velocimetry (PIV). Experiments are conducted by (1) matching impulse, and (2)
matching Reynolds number. We show that, at constant impulse, vortex ring
properties in PAMH solution deviate from that in Newtonian water. As the
concentration of the PAMH solution increases, so too does the deviation from
water. We further perform experiments in water by matching the limiting
Reynolds numbers of the PAMH solution corresponding to both $\eta_0$ and
$\eta_{\infty}$. We find that while the circulation of PAMH solutions lies
between the circulation curves of the two extreme Reynolds number matched water
experiments for an extended period of time, the enstrophy and peak vorticity do
not. We attribute this behavior to the modification of vorticity distribution
within the core of vortex rings in PAMH solutions. We also study the effect of
polymer solutions on the formation number. We find that the formation number
remains the same even in polymer solutions. We also demonstrate, using planar
laser induced fluorescence (PLIF), the phenomenon of ring reversal.

to a better matching of the thermal expansion coefficient of the substrate and
Gr. We investigate the quality of multilayer Gr grown on Mo and the relation

spatial homogeneity of these parameters. With atomic force microscopy (AFM)

demonstrate that as a result of this unique and favorable morphology, the Gr
studied here has low friction, high wear resistance, and excellent homogeneity

study MMSE-optimal neural encoding of a multivariate stimulus by uniform

atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the deep atmosphere. These waves are
effectively described by Grimshaw's dissipative modulation equations which
provide the basis for finding stationary solutions such as mountain lee waves
and testing their stability in an analytic fashion. Assuming energetically
consistent boundary and far-field conditions, that is no energy flux through
the surface, free-slip boundary, and finite total energy, general wave
solutions are derived and illustrated in terms of realistic background fields.
These assumptions also imply that the wave-Reynolds number must become less
than unity above a certain height. The modulational stability of admissible,
both non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic, waves is examined. It turns out that,
when accounting for the self-induced mean flow, the wave-Froude number has a
resonance condition. If it becomes $1/\sqrt{2}$, then the wave destabilizes due
to perturbations from the essential spectrum of the linearized modulation

Here we analyze turbulence
of weakly interacting waves using the tools of information theory. It offers a
unique perspective for comparing thermal equilibrium and turbulence: the mutual
information between modes is shown to be stationary and small in equilibrium
but grows linearly with time in weak turbulence. We trace this growth to the
concentration of probability on the resonance surfaces, which can go all the
way to a singular measure. The surprising conclusion is that no matter how
small is the nonlinearity and how close to Gaussian is the statistics of any
single amplitude, a stationary phase-space measure is far from Gaussian, as
manifested by a large relative entropy. Though it might be upsetting to
practitioners of weak turbulence approach, this is a rare piece of good news
for turbulence modeling: the resolved scales carry significant information
about the unresolved scales. The mutual information between large and small
scales is the information capacity of turbulent cascade, setting the limit on
the representation of subgrid scales in turbulence modeling.

selecting the variable ordering to use when performing a cylindrical algebraic

  In our prior work we explored the different ML models that could be used, and
how to identify suitable features of the input polynomials. In the present
paper we both repeat our prior experiments on problems which have more
variables (and thus exponentially more possible orderings), and examine the
metric which our ML classifiers targets. The natural metric is computational
runtime, with classifiers trained to pick the ordering which minimises this.
However, this leads to the situation were models do not distinguish between any
of the non-optimal orderings, whose runtimes may still vary dramatically. In
this paper we investigate a modification to the cross-validation algorithms of
the classifiers so that they do distinguish these cases, leading to improved

Computational AeroAcoustics simulations are often optimized for low dispersion

order to accurately simulate waves with the least computational cost. Here, the
performance of optimized Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes for linear
time-invariant problems with non-constant-amplitude oscillations is considered.
This is in part motivated by the recent suggestion that optimized spatial
derivatives perform poorly for growing and decaying waves, as their
optimization implicitly assumes real wavenumbers. To our knowledge, this is the
first time the time-stepping of non-constant-amplitude oscillations has been
considered. It is found that current optimized Runge-Kutta schemes perform
poorly in comparison with their maximal order equivalents for
non-constant-amplitude oscillations. Moreover, significantly more accurate
results can be achieved for the same computation cost by replacing a two-step
scheme such as LDDRK56 with a single step higher-order scheme with a longer
time step. Attempts are made at finding optimized schemes that perform well for
non-constant-amplitude oscillations, and three such examples are provided.
However, the traditional maximal order Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes are
still found to be preferable for general problems with broadband excitation.

translation invariance into the model architecture, which relieves the model
from the need to learn them. To enable the model to focus on learning the
content of objects other than their locations, we propose to conduct patch
ranking of the feature maps before feeding them into the next layer. When patch
ranking is combined with convolution and pooling operations, we obtain
consistent representations despite the location of meaningful objects in input.

an elusive problem for more than 60 years now. Due to the lack of theoretical
foundations, most of the studies that considered how the evolution of
transportation networks impacts the population growth are based on regression
analysis in order to identify relevant variables. The recent availability of
large amounts of data allows us to envision the construction of new approaches
for understanding this coupling between transport and population growth. Here,
we use a detailed dataset for about 36000 municipalities in France from 1968
until now. In the case of large urban areas such as Paris, we show that growth
rate statistical variations decay in time and display a trend towards
homogeneization where local aspects are less relevant. We also show that growth
rate differences due to accessibility are very small and can mostly be observed
for cities that experienced very large accessibility variations. This suggests
that the relevant variable for explaining growth rate variations is not the
accessibility but its temporal variation. We propose a model that integrates
the stochastic internal variation of the municipalitie's population and an
inter-urban migration term that we show to be proportional to the accessibility
variation and has a limited time duration. This model provides a simple
theoretical framework that allows to go beyond econometric studies and sheds a

HD 209458 b as a fiducial study. We improve upon previous works by using a
double-gray atmosphere model and interior structure from MESA as the background
state, and then solve for the thermal bulge in response to the semidiurnal
component of stellar insolation. The atmosphere model is based on the radiative
transfer with Eddington's two-stream approximation. Two opacity cases are
considered: the first introduces a greenhouse effect and the second exhibits a
strong temperature inversion. We find that for the predominant thermal bulges
excited by g-modes of lower orders, our results are qualitatively similar to
the adiabatic results from Arras and Socrates (2010). It arises because the
perturbed heating due to self-absorption of thermal emissions can be
significant (i.e., greenhouse effect) against Newtonian damping, thereby
leading to almost undamped thermal bulges. We also find that the contribution
to the thermal bulge from the evanescent waves in the convective zone is not
negligible, implying that the thermal bulge is not merely confined in the
atmosphere and radiative envelope. Assuming the torque balance between the
thermal and gravitational bulges, we estimate the tidal quality factor of the
planet for gravitational tides to match the observed radius. The limitations of
our model are also briefly discussed.

facial recognition applications, especially due to the success of the Internet
of Things (IoT) paradigm. However, although handcrafted and deep
learning-inspired facial features reached a significant level of compactness
and expressive power, the facial recognition performance still suffers from
intra-class variations such as ageing, facial expressions, lighting changes,
and pose. These variations cannot be captured in a single acquisition and
require multiple acquisitions of long duration, which are expensive and need a
high level of collaboration from the users. Among others, self-update
algorithms have been proposed in order to mitigate these problems.
Self-updating aims to add novel templates to the users' gallery among the
inputs submitted during system operations. Consequently, computational
complexity and storage space tend to be among the critical requirements of
these algorithms. The present paper deals with the above problems by a novel
template-based self-update algorithm, able to keep over time the expressive
power of a limited set of templates stored in the system database. The
rationale behind the proposed approach is in the working hypothesis that a
dominating mode characterises the features' distribution given the client.
Therefore, the key point is to select the best templates around that mode. We
propose two methods, which are tested on systems based on handcrafted features
and deep-learning-inspired autoencoders at the state-of-the-art. Three
benchmark data sets are used. Experimental results confirm that, by effective
and compact feature sets which can support our working hypothesis, the proposed
classification-selection approaches overcome the problem of manual updating

(namely, allowing for a number of patterns scaling only linearly with N, while
P>2) such a system is able to perform pattern recognition far below the
standard signal-to-noise threshold. In particular, a network with P=4 is able
to retrieve information whose intensity is O(1) even in the presence of a noise
O(\sqrt{N}) in the large N limit. This striking skill stems from a redundancy
representation of patterns -- which is afforded given the (relatively) low-load
information storage -- and it contributes to explain the impressive abilities
in pattern recognition exhibited by new-generation neural networks. The whole
theory is developed rigorously, at the replica symmetric level of
approximation, and corroborated by signal-to-noise analysis and Monte Carlo
simulations.

mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. Corresponding
design methods require efficient means of representation and manipulation of

successfully employed as a powerful alternative to straightforward means such
as truth tables. This motivated extensive research on whether decision diagrams
provide similar potential in the quantum domain -- resulting in new types of
decision diagrams capable of substantially reducing the complexity of
representing quantum states and functionality. From an implementation
perspective, many concepts and techniques from the classical domain can be
re-used in order to implement decision diagrams packages for the quantum realm.
However, new problems -- namely how to efficiently handle complex numbers --
arise. In this work, we propose a solution to overcome these problems.
Experimental evaluations confirm that this yields improvements of orders of
magnitude in the runtime needed to create and to utilize these decision
diagrams. The resulting implementation is publicly available as a quantum DD

transaction isolation. Today transaction isolation is attained by locking the
entire state database during simulation of transactions and database updates.
This lock is one of the major performance bottlenecks as observed by previous
work.
  This work presents a new lock-free approach for providing transaction
isolation. It harnesses the already existing versioning of key-value pairs in
the database, used primarily for a read-write conflict detection during the
validation phase, to create a version-based snapshot isolation. We further

the current implementation by 8.1x and that it is comparable to the optimal

The low-field measurements confirm the absence of any spin freezing or
long-range magnetic order down to 50~mK, which suggests a quantum spin liquid
ground (QSL) state with gapless excitations. The instability of the QSL state
is observed upon applying magnetic fields. For the $H\bot c$ direction, a
field-induced magnetic phase transition is observed above 2~T from the $C_{\rm
p}(T)$ data, agreeing with a clear $\frac{M_s}{3}$ plateau of $M(H)$, which is
associated with an up-up-down (uud) spin arrangement. For the $H\|c$ direction,
a field-induced transition could be evidenced at a much higher field range (9 -
21~T). The $^{23}$Na NMR measurements provide microscopic evidence for
field-induced ordering for both directions. A reentrant behavior of $T_{\rm
N}$, originating from the thermal and quantum spin fluctuations, is observed
for both directions. The anisotropic exchange interactions $J_{\perp}\simeq$
4.7~K and $J_z\simeq$2.33~K are extracted from the modified bond-dependent XXZ
model for the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet. The
absence of magnetic long-range order at zero fields is assigned to the effect
of strong bond-frustration, arising from the complex spin-orbit entangled $4f$
ground state. Finally, we derive the highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram,
which is discussed in comparison with the existing theoretical models for

symmetric monoidal structure---we prove that the geometrically pure exact
category $(\mathcal{V},\mathscr{E}_\otimes)$ has enough relative injectives; in
fact, every object has a geometrically pure injective envelope. We also show
that for some regular cardinal $\lambda$, the tensor embedding yields an exact
equivalence between $(\mathcal{V},\mathscr{E}_\otimes)$ and the category of
$\lambda$-cocontinuous $\mathcal{V}$-functors from $\mbox{Pres}(\mathcal{V})$

explain, the developed theory applies e.g.~to the category $\mathsf{Ch}(R)$ of
chain complexes of modules over a commutative ring $R$ and to the category

noise by smoothing or filtering. However, it is often important to delineate a
third intermediate category, that we call high frequency (HF) features: this is
the case in our motivating example, which consists in experimental measurements
of the time-dynamics of depolymerising protein fibrils average size. One may
intuitively visualise HF features as the presence of fast, possibly
nonstationary and transient oscillations, distinct from a slowly-varying trend
envelope. The aim of this article is to propose an empirical definition of HF
features and construct estimators and statistical tests for their presence
accordingly, when the data consists of a noisy nonstationary 1-dimensional
signal. We propose a parametric characterization in the Fourier domain of the
HF features by defining a maximal amplitude and distance to low frequencies of
significant energy. We introduce a data-driven procedure to estimate these
parameters, and compute a p-value proxy based on a statistical test for the
presence of HF features. The test is first conducted on simulated signals where
the ratio amplitude of the HF features to the level of the noise is controlled.
The test detects HF features even when the level of noise is five times larger
than the amplitude of the oscillations. In a second part, the test is conducted
on experimental data from Prion disease experiments and it confirms the
presence of HF features in these signals with significant confidence.

Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective

n-th derivative of observational data. This is achieved by performing two
polynomial approximations at each interstitial point. The polynomials are
coupled by constraining their coefficients to ensure continuity of the model up
to the (n-1)-th derivative; while yielding an estimate for the discontinuity of
the n-th derivative. The coefficients of the polynomials correspond directly to
the derivatives of the approximations at the interstitial points through the
prudent selection of a common coordinate system. The approximation residual and
extrapolation errors are investigated as measures for detecting discontinuity.
This is necessary since discrete observations of continuous systems are
discontinuous at every point. It is proven, using matrix algebra, that positive
extrema in the combined approximation-extrapolation error correspond exactly to
extrema in the difference of the Taylor coefficients. This provides a relative
measure for the severity of the discontinuity in the observational data. The
matrix algebraic derivations are provided for all aspects of the methods
presented here; this includes a solution for the covariance propagation through
the computation. The performance of the method is verified with a Monte Carlo
simulation using synthetic piecewise polynomial data with known
discontinuities. It is also demonstrated that the discontinuities are suitable
as knots for B-spline modelling of data. For completeness, the results of
applying the method to sensor data acquired during the monitoring of heavy

$\Omega$ a subset of 3-space, and $1_\Omega$ its characteristic function) have
been used in quantum mechanics as models of a detector. They represent the
effect of a ""soft"" detector that takes a while to notice a particle in the
detector volume $\Omega$. In order to model a ""hard"" detector (i.e., one that
registers a particle as soon as it enters $\Omega$), one may think of taking
the limit $v\to\infty$ of increasing detector strength $v$. However, as pointed
out by Allcock, in this limit the particle never enters $\Omega$; its wave
function gets reflected at the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of $\Omega$ in the
same way as by a Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$. This
phenomenon, a cousin of the ""quantum Zeno effect,"" might suggest that a hard
detector is mathematically impossible. Nevertheless, a mathematical description
of a hard detector has recently been put forward in the form of the ""absorbing
boundary rule"" involving an absorbing boundary condition on the detecting
surface $\partial \Omega$. We show here that in a suitable (non-obvious) limit,
the imaginary potential $V$ yields a non-trivial distribution of detection time
and place in agreement with the absorbing boundary rule. That is, a hard
detector can be obtained as a limit, but it is a different limit than Allcock
considered.

the doped holes are coupled to the Ni localized holes in the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$

to a Hund-Heisenberg model. Using the reduced model, we show the non-Fermi

the spin fluctuations of the localized holes. In the superconducting phase, the
short-range spin fluctuations mediate the carriers into Cooper pairs and
establish $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity. We further predict that the
doped holes ferromagnetically coupled with the local magnetic moments remain
itinerant even at very low temperature, and thus the pseudogap hardly emerges

faithful modeling, it is essential to include previously overlooked phase jumps
occurring when trajectories pass through focal points. Such phase jumps are
known as Gouy's phase anomaly in optics or as Maslov phases in semiclassical
theory. Most importantly, because of Coulomb focusing in three dimensions, one
out of two trajectories in photoelectron holography goes through a focal point
as it crosses the symmetry axis in momentum space. In addition, there exist
observable Maslov phases already in two dimensions. Clustering algorithms
enable us to implement a semiclassical model with the correct preexponential

The imaginary part of the frequency describes the growth rate of waves due to
instability. The growth rate of waves is studied by solving numerically the
dispersion relation. Results: The critical wavenumber at which waves become
unstable, present for a parallel magnetic field, disappears, due to the
inclination of the magnetic field and instead waves are shown to be unstable
for all wavenumbers. Theoretical results are applied to diagnose the structure
of the magnetic field in prominence threads. When applying our theoretical
results to observed waves in prominence plumes, we obtain a wide range of field

previous works use pre-computed optical flows, which encode the temporal

non-occluded optical flow provides accurate pixel-level temporal

Moreover, our framework is able to utilize both labeled and unlabeled frames in

$\beta\!<\!4$ are only seen in small glassy samples quenched from

the size of the disordered core of soft quasilocalized vibrations --- while
larger glassy samples made with the same protocol feature the universal

theory, makes no particular assumptions on the band gap, and predicts several
amendments to the previous classification frameworks. In particular, we show

the quantification of schematic variables in the predicative setting and we
present a typed $\lambda$-calculus featuring the quantifier $\lambda^\infty$
accompanied by other practically useful constructions like explicit
substitutions and expected type annotations. The calculus stands just on two
notions, i.e., bound rt-reduction and parametric validity, and has the
expressive power of $\lambda\rightarrow$. Thus, while not aiming at being a
logical framework by itself, it does enjoy many desired invariants of logical
frameworks including confluence of reduction, strong normalization,
preservation of type by reduction, decidability, correctness of types and
uniqueness of types up to conversion. This calculus belongs to the
$\lambda\delta$ family of formal systems, which borrow some features from the
pure type systems and some from the languages of the Automath tradition, but
stand outside both families. In particular, the calculus includes and evolves
two earlier systems of this family. Moreover, a machine-checked specification
of its theory is available.

accretion of molecules. For dust dynamically coupled to the gas, the growth
rate scales with the square of the Mach number, which means that the growth
timescale can easily be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The
limiting timescale is therefore rather the rate of molecular cloud formation,
which means that dust production in the ISM can rapidly reach the levels needed
to explain the dust masses observed at high redshifts. Thus, turbulence may be
the solution to the replenishment problem in models of dust evolution in
high-redshift galaxies and explain the dust masses seen at $z = 7 - 8$. A
simple analytic galactic dust-evolution model is presented, where grain growth
nicely compensates for the expected higher rate of dust destruction by
supernova shocks. This model is simpler, relies on fewer assumptions and seems
to yields a better fit to data derived from observations, compared to previous

method which characterises the co-relations of morphology between brain regions
over a group of subjects. To our knowledge, little has been investigated in
terms of the comparability of results between different data sets or the
reliability of results over the same subjects in different rescan sessions,
image resolutions, or FreeSurfer versions.
  In terms of comparability, our results show substantial differences in the
structural covariance matrix between data sets of age- and sex-matched healthy
human adults. These differences persist after site correction, they are
exacerbated by low sample sizes, and they are most pronounced when using
average cortical thickness as a morphological measure. Down-stream graph
theoretic analyses further show statistically significant differences.
  In terms of reliability, substantial differences were also found when
comparing repeated scan sessions of the same subjects, and image resolutions
and FreeSurfer versions of the same image. We could further estimate the
relative measurement error and showed that it is largest when using thickness.
With simulated data, we argue that cortical thickness is least reliable because
of larger relative measurement errors.
  Practically, we make the following recommendations (1) pooling subjects
across sites into one group should be avoided, particularly if sites differ in
image resolutions, demographics, or preprocessing; (2) surface area and volume
should be preferred as morphological measures over cortical thickness; (3) a
large number of subjects should be used to estimate structural covariance; (4)
measurement error should be assessed where repeated measurements are available;
(5) if combining sites is critical, univariate site-correction is insufficient,
but error covariance should be explicitly measured and modelled.

coordinated malware infected IoT units are maliciously employed to
synchronously turn on or off high-wattage appliances, affecting the grid's
primary control management. Our model could be extended to larger (smart)
grids, Active Buildings as well as similar infrastructures. Our approach models
Coordinated Load-Changing Attacks (CLCA) also referred as GridLock or BlackIoT,
against a theoretical power grid, containing various types of power plants. It
employs Continuous-Time Markov Chains where elements such as Power Plants and
Botnets are modelled under normal or attack situations to evaluate the effect
of CLCA in power reliant infrastructures. We showcase our modelling approach in
the scenario of a power supplier (e.g. power plant) being targeted by a botnet.
We demonstrate how our modelling approach can quantify the impact of a botnet
attack and be abstracted for any CPS system involving power load management in
a smart grid. Our results show that by prioritising the type of power-plants,
the impact of the attack may change: in particular, we find the most impacting
attack times and show how different strategies impact their success. We also
find the best power generator to use depending on the current demand and

additional noise effects in post-processing. We then combine PDI with angular
differential imaging (ADI) as a final layer of post-processing to further
improve the contrast limits of our data at these separations. For good
observing conditions we achieve polarimetric contrast limits of 15.0-16.3 mag

We also employed beta-VAE to weight the variational regularisation term in the

vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities
for optimizing the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled networks is studied. In the
studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and
illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the
interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the
UAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target
area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an
optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association,
and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication
requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the
machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the
long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future
illumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution,
the original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two
sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm.
Then, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and
user association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using
real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the
proposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction in total transmit power
compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the
illumination distribution and user association.

Its Bayesian structure quantifies uncertainty in pathway structure and allows
interpretable predictions of behaviours, such as which symptom a patient will

ovarian cancer progression and the evolution of multidrug resistance in
tuberculosis, demonstrating its power to reveal previously undetected dynamic

multidimensional and multivariate data sonification are identified and
experimentally validated. Background: Psychoacoustic investigations have shown
that orthogonal acoustical parameters may interfere perceptually. The
literature hardly offers any solutions to this problem, and previous auditory
display approaches have failed to implement auditory dimensions that are
perceived orthogonally by a user. In this study we demonstrate how a location
in three-dimensional space can be sonified unambiguously by the implementation
of perceptually orthogonal psychoacoustic attributes in monophonic playback.
Method: Perceptually orthogonal auditory attributes are identified from
literature research and experience in music and psychoacoustic research. We
carried out an experiment with 21 participants who identified sonified
locations in two-dimensional space. Results: With just 5 minutes of explanation
and exploration, naive users can interpret our multidimensional sonification
with high accuracy. Conclusion: We identified a set of perceptually orthogonal
auditory dimensions suitable for three-dimensional data sonification.
Application: Three-dimensional data sonification promises blind navigation,

healthcare, the EHRs data analysis has attracted much attention of both
researchers and practitioners. There are three main challenges in modeling
longitudinal and heterogeneous EHRs data: heterogeneity, irregular temporality
and interpretability. A series of deep learning methods have made remarkable
progress in resolving these challenges. Nevertheless, most of existing
attention models rely on capturing the 1-order temporal dependencies or 2-order
multimodal relationships among feature elements. In this paper, we propose a
time-guided high-order attention (TGHOA) model. The proposed method has three
major advantages. (1) It can model longitudinal heterogeneous EHRs data via
capturing the 3-order correlations of different modalities and the irregular
temporal impact of historical events. (2) It can be used to identify the
potential concerns of medical features to explain the reasoning process of the
healthcare model. (3) It can be easily expanded into cases with more modalities
and flexibly applied in different prediction tasks. We evaluate the proposed
method in two tasks of mortality prediction and disease ranking on two real

Detailed math questions consist of text and math equations which require a

the Markov assumption that governs most single-agent RL methods and is one of
the key challenges in multi-agent RL. To tackle this, we propose to train
multiple policies for each agent and postpone the selection of the best policy
at execution time. Specifically, we model the environment non-stationarity with
a finite set of scenarios and train policies fitting each scenario. In addition
to multiple policies, each agent also learns a policy predictor to determine
which policy is the best with its local information. By doing so, each agent is
able to adapt its policy when the environment changes and consequentially the
other agents alter their policies during execution. We empirically evaluated

in a Euclidean space, in this paper we propose a new method to solve elliptic
partial differential equations (PDEs) supplemented with boundary conditions.
Notice that the construction of triangulations on unknown manifolds can be both
difficult and expensive, both in terms of computational and data requirements,
our goal is to solve these problems without such constructions. Instead, we
rely only on using the sample points to define quadrature formulas on the
unknown manifold. Our main tool is the diffusion maps algorithm. We re-analyze
this well-known method in a weak (variational) sense. The latter reduces the
smoothness requirements on the underlying functions which is crucial to
approximating weak solutions to PDEs. As a by-product, we also provide a
rigorous justification of the well-known relationship between diffusion maps
and the Neumann eigenvalue problems. We then use a recently developed method of
estimating the distance to boundary function (notice that the boundary location
is assumed to be unknown and must be estimated from data) in order to correct
the boundary error term in the diffusion maps construction. Finally, using this
estimated distance, we illustrate how to impose Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed
boundary conditions for some common PDEs based on the Laplacian. Several
numerical examples confirm our theoretical findings.

  arXiv:1911.12682",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results
on many visual recognition tasks. However, current CNN models still exhibit a
poor ability to be invariant to spatial transformations of images. Intuitively,
with sufficient layers and parameters, hierarchical combinations of convolution
(matrix multiplication and non-linear activation) and pooling operations should
be able to learn a robust mapping from transformed input images to
transform-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose randomly
transforming (rotation, scale, and translation) feature maps of CNNs during the
training stage. This prevents complex dependencies of specific rotation, scale,
and translation levels of training images in CNN models. Rather, each
convolutional kernel learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for
producing the transform-invariant answer given the combinatorially large
variety of transform levels of its input feature maps. In this way, we do not
require any extra training supervision or modification to the optimization
process and training images. We show that random transformation provides
significant improvements of CNNs on many benchmark tasks, including small-scale
image recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval. The code

widely used due to the pervasiveness of voice control on smart devices.
However, the task of ""in-the-wild"" speaker verification is still challenging,
considering the speech samples may contain lots of identity-unrelated
information, e.g., background noise, reverberation, emotion, etc. Previous
works focus on optimizing the model to improve verification accuracy, without
taking into account the elimination of the impact from the identity-unrelated
information. To solve the above problem, we propose SEEF-ALDR, a novel Speaker
Embedding Enhancement Framework via Adversarial Learning based Disentangled
Representation, to reinforce the performance of existing models on speaker
verification. The key idea is to retrieve as much speaker identity information
as possible from the original speech, thus minimizing the impact of
identity-unrelated information on the speaker verification task by using
adversarial learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can significantly improve the performance of speaker verification by
20.3% and 23.8% on average over 13 tested baselines on dataset Voxceleb1 and 8
tested baselines on dataset Voxceleb2 respectively, without adjusting the
structure or hyper-parameters of them. Furthermore, the ablation study was
conducted to evaluate the contribution of each module in SEEF-ALDR. Finally,
porting an existing model into the proposed framework is straightforward and
cost-efficient, with very little effort from the model owners due to the
modular design of the framework.

execution of activities so that products and services are provided. The use of
models to analyse the underlying processes is a well-known practice. However,
due to the complexity and continuous evolution of their processes,
organizations need an effective way of analysing the relation between processes
and models. Conformance checking techniques asses the suitability of a process
model in representing an underlying process, observed through a collection of
real executions. One important metric in conformance checking is to asses the
precision of the model with respect to the observed executions, i.e.,
characterize the ability of the model to produce behavior unrelated to the one
observed. In this paper we present the notion of anti-alignment as a concept to
help unveiling runs in the model that may deviate significantly from the
observed behavior. Using anti-alignments, a new metric for precision is
proposed. In contrast to existing metrics, anti-alignment based precision
metrics satisfy most of the required axioms highlighted in a recent
publication. Moreover, a complexity analysis of the problem of computing
anti-alignments is provided, which sheds light into the practicability of using
anti-alignment to estimate precision. Experiments are provided that witness the

  Cryptoeconomic Systems '20",,,,"q-fin.GN cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to
have a digital asset (""token"") serve as security collateral in crypto networks.
However, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive threat model that encompasses
both Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks that
arise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil
resistance mechanism. In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes
malicious coordination among validators easier to execute than in Proof of Work
systems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain lending smart
contracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield
provided by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided
from staking, stakers will tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them
out, thus reducing network security. In this paper, we provide a simple
stochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk
preferences react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular
configuration of this model, we provide a formal proof of a phase transition
between equilibria in which tokens are predominantly staked and those in which
they are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial
behavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that
sample transitions under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that
rational, non-adversarial actors can dramatically reduce PoS network security
if block rewards are not calibrated appropriately above the expected yields of
on-chain lending.

atmospheric arc discharge is reported for the first time. The vertical
electrode configuration consisted of a compound anode (hollow graphite anode
filled with MoS2 powder) and a solid graphite cathode placed just above of the
compound anode. Arc processes were operated in pulsed mode to preferentially
evaporate the powder component from the anode and to minimize Carbon ablation.
Pulsed anodic arc discharges were conducted at 2 Hz and 10% duty cycle in 300
Torr of Helium with a peak current of 250-300 A and peak voltage of 35 V. A
probe made of Tungsten wire was placed in the vicinity of the arc column to
collect the evaporated material. The measured thickness profile was correlated
to the particle flux distribution and it was fitted by a simple model of plasma
expansion. During pulse phase, electron density was estimated around 5E22 m-3
or higher, and ion current density was of the order of 10 A/mm2. Morphology,
structure and composition of the samples were characterized by Raman
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The
study shows that pulsed arc discharge of the compound anode leads to moderate C
deposition combined with MoS2 deposition in the form of fragmented nanocrystals
and few atomic monolayers of MoS2. Such synthesis technique is promising to
produce new 2D nanomaterials with tailored structure and functionality thanks
to the flexibility of pulsed power.
