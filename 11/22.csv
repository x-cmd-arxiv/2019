the image size of bright objects due to electrostatic repulsion of collected
charges. Correcting this effect in the LSST camera is required in order to meet
the science goals of the project, especially galaxy shape measurements for weak
lensing. The current plan for BF image correction in the LSST is to use the
deconvolution method described in Coulton, et.al. [1]. In this work, we study
the linearity of the BF effect and effectiveness of the Coulton correction,
using both simulation tools and measurements made on prototype LSST CCDs from
both CCD vendors. We conclude that the proposed image correction method may be
adequate to meet the LSST science goals, although more work is needed on the
algorithms used to generate the image correction kernel from sensor
measurements.

This trend inverts at higher values of $M_\star$, when prolate galaxies show

pronounced at high stellar mass. We argue that the secondary dependence of
metallicity on stellar kinematics is another manifestation of the observed
anti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate at a given stellar

star-formation histories of galaxies and stellar feedback. At high masses,

this task is the novel categories are prone to dominated by color, texture,
shape of the object or background context (namely specificity), which are
distinct for the given few training samples but not common for the
corresponding categories (see Figure 1). Fortunately, we find that transferring
information of the correlated based categories can help learn the novel
concepts and thus avoid the novel concept being dominated by the specificity.
Besides, incorporating semantic correlations among different categories can
effectively regularize this information transfer. In this work, we represent
the semantic correlations in the form of structured knowledge graph and
integrate this graph into deep neural networks to promote few-shot learning by
a novel Knowledge Graph Transfer Network (KGTN). Specifically, by initializing
each node with the classifier weight of the corresponding category, a
propagation mechanism is learned to adaptively propagate node message through
the graph to explore node interaction and transfer classifier information of
the base categories to those of the novel ones. Extensive experiments on the

scenario, it is not enough to generate a simple trajectory from an initial

the Tethys vehicle by combining a predictive ocean model and its kinematic

hotter of which may originate from the inner accretion disc, and the cooler
from an optically thick outflow. We find correlated variability between hard
(2-10 keV) and soft (0.3-2 keV) bands on kilosecond timescales, and find a soft
lag of ~150 seconds. The covariance spectrum suggests that emission
contributing to the lags is largely associated with the hotter of the two
thermal-like components, likely originating from the inner accretion flow. This

mechanism will be. In an ideal scenario (i.e., 100% accuracy) the system can
detect zero-day malware without being concerned about mistakenly tagging benign
files as malware or enabling disruptive malicious code running as
none-malicious ones. This paper investigates different machine learning
algorithms to find out how well they can detect zero-day malware. Through the
examination of 34 machine/deep learning classifiers, we found that the random
forest classifier offered the best accuracy. The paper poses several research
questions regarding the performance of machine and deep learning algorithms
when detecting zero-day malware with zero rates for false positive and false
negative.

novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented,

significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB

  Data Sampling & Image Reconstruction",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The optimization of MRI data sampling and image reconstruction methods has
been a priority for the MRI community since the very early days of the field.
Designing an ""optimal"" method requires the definition of an optimality metric
(i.e., a quantitative evaluation of the ""goodness"" of different competing
approaches that allows an objective comparison between them). However, a key
challenge is that there are many different possible ways of quantitatively
evaluating the ""goodness"" of a data sampling scheme or a reconstruction result,
and there are no acquisition or reconstruction methods that are known to be
universally optimal with respect to all of these possible metrics
simultaneously. Thus, optimization of MRI methods requires a subjective choice
about what aspects of quality matter most in the context of a given MRI
experiment, and subsequently the subjective choice of an optimality metric that
hopefully does a reasonable job of quantifying those aspects of quality. Once
these choices are made, the optimization problem becomes well-defined, and it
remains to choose an algorithm that can identify data sampling or image
reconstruction methods that are optimal with respect to the chosen metric. All
of these choices are generally nontrivial.
  In this presentation, we will discuss optimal sampling and reconstruction
designs from multiple different perspectives, including ideas from information
and estimation theory and various practical perspectives.

and neutrinos, we present a detailed study of the effect of massive neutrinos
on the 1-D and 3-D flux power spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$)
forest. The presence of massive neutrinos in cosmology induces a scale- and
time-dependent suppression of structure formation that is strongest on small
scales. Measuring this suppression is a key method for inferring neutrino
masses from cosmological data, and is one of the main goals of ongoing and
future surveys like eBOSS, DES, LSST, Euclid or DESI. The clustering in the
Ly$\alpha$ forest traces the quasi-linear power at late times and on small
scales. In combination with observations of the cosmic microwave background,
the forest therefore provides some of the tightest constraints on the sum of
the neutrino masses. However there is a well-known degeneracy between $\Sigma
m_{\nu}$ and the amplitude of perturbations in the linear matter power
spectrum. We study the corresponding degeneracy in the 1-D flux power spectrum
of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, and for the first time also study this degeneracy in
the 3-D flux power spectrum. We show that the non-linear effects of massive
neutrinos on the Ly$\alpha$ forest, beyond the effect of linear power amplitude
suppression, are negligible, and this degeneracy persists in the Ly$\alpha$
forest observables to a high precision. We discuss the implications of this
degeneracy for choosing parametrisations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest for
cosmological analysis.

reflection and scattering at sharp edges, defects, and disorders. Recently,
mechanical topological insulators have sought to overcome this challenge by
supporting back-scattering resistant wave transmission. In this Letter, we
propose and experimentally demonstrate the first \emph{reconfigurable
electroacoustic} topological insulator exhibiting an analog to the quantum
valley Hall effect (QVHE). Using programmable switches, this phononic structure
allows for rapid reconfiguration of domain walls and thus the ability to
control back-scattering resistant wave propagation along dynamic interfaces for
phonons lying in static and finite-frequency regimes. Accordingly, a
graphene-like Polyactic Acid (PLA) layer serves as the host medium, equipped
with periodically arranged and bonded piezoelectric patches, resulting in two
Dirac cones at the $K-$points. The PZT patches are then connected to negative
capacitance external circuits to break inversion symmetry and create nontrivial
topologically-protected bandgaps. As such, topologically protected interface
waves are demonstrated numerically and validated experimentally for different
predefined trajectories over a broad frequency range.

feature and support the presence of warps or misalignments between disk
regions. These warps are possibly due to an inclined (sub-)stellar companion
embedded in the disk. We study the morphology of the protoplanetary disk around
the Herbig Ae star HD 139614 based on the first scattered light observations of
this disk, which we model with the radiative transfer code MCMax3D. We obtained
J- and H-band observations in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE that
show strong azimuthal asymmetries. In the outer disk, beyond ~30 au, a broad
shadow spans a range of ~240{\deg} in position angle, in the East. A bright
ring at ~16 au also shows an azimuthally asymmetric brightness, with the
faintest side roughly coincidental with the brightest region of the outer disk.
Additionally, two arcs are detected at ~34 au and ~50 au. We created a simple
4-zone approximation to a warped disk model of HD 139614 in order to
qualitatively reproduce these features. The location and misalignment of the
disk components were constrained from the shape and location of the shadows
they cast. We find that the shadow on the outer disk covers a range of position
angle too wide to be explained by a single inner misaligned component. Our
model requires a minimum of two separate misaligned zones -- or a continuously
warped region -- to cast this broad shadow on the outer disk. A small
misalignment of ~4{\deg} between adjacent components can reproduce most of the
observed shadow features. Multiple misaligned disk zones, potentially mimicing
a warp, can explain the observed broad shadows in the HD 139614 disk. A
planetary mass companion in the disk, located on an inclined orbit, could be
responsible for such a feature and for the dust depleted gap responsible for a
dip in the SED.

hidden-charm decay modes of these $P_c$ states, $P_c\to J/\psi p(\eta_cp)$,

II, after considering the coupled channel effect between different flavor
configurations $\Sigma^{(*)}_c\bar D^{(*)}$, we calculate these partial decay
widths again. The decay patterns in these two scenarios can help us to explore
the molecular assignment and the inner flavor configurations for the $P_c$

comparable to the $J/\psi p$ decay widths in both of these two scenarios.

important idea of generalized cumulants, extending to stochastic operators this
concept, implicitly introduced by Laplace in 1810. Kubo's idea has been applied
in several branches of physics, where the result of the average process is a
Lioville operator or an effective time evolution operator for the density
matrix of spin systems or the reduced density matrix for boson-fermions etc.
Despite this success, the theoretical developments in these Kubo works pose
problems that were highlighted many years ago by Fox and van Kampen and never
solved. These weaknesses and errors, in particular concerning the factorization
property of exponentials of cumulants and the explicit expressions that give
generalized cumulants in terms of generalized moments and vice-versa, caused
some perplexity (and confusion) about the possible application of this
procedure, limiting its use, in practice. In the present paper, we give a sound
ground to the approach to cumulant operators, working in a general framework
that shows the potentiality of the old Kubo's idea, today not yet fully
exploited. It results that for the same moment operators, different definitions
of generalized cumulants can be adopted. A general Kubo-Meeron closed-form
formula giving cumulant operators in terms of moment operators cannot be
obtained, but the reverse one, cumulants in terms of operators, is given and,
noticeably, formally it {\em does not} depend on the specific nature of the
moments, but just on the definition of the generalized cumulants.

continuum emission. Clear and unusual spectral variability is observed, but
this is markedly suppressed above $\sim$10-15 keV, qualitatively similar to the
ULX Holmberg IX X-1. We model the multi-epoch data with two-component accretion
disc models designed to approximate super-Eddington accretion, allowing for
both a black hole and a neutron star accretor. With regards to the hotter disc
component, the data trace out two distinct tracks in the luminosity-temperature
plane, with larger emitting radii and lower temperatures seen at higher
observed fluxes. Despite this apparent anti-correlation, each of these tracks
individually shows a positive luminosity-temperature relation. Both are broadly
consistent with $L\propto{T}^{4}$, as expected for blackbody emission with a
constant area, and also with $L\propto{T}^{2}$, as may be expected for an
advection-dominated disc around a black hole. We consider a variety of
possibilities for this unusual behaviour. Scenarios in which the innermost flow
is suddenly blocked from view by outer regions of the super-Eddington disc/wind
can explain the luminosity-temperature behaviour, but are difficult to
reconcile with the lack of strong variability at higher energies, assuming this
emission arises from the most compact regions. Instead, we may be seeing
evidence for further radial stratification of the accretion flow than is
included in the simple models considered, with a combination of winds and
advection resulting in the suppressed high-energy variability.

which is inspired by the well-known $3n+1$ conjecture of Lothar Collatz. A
$p$-adic system is a piecewise function on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ which has branches
for all residue classes modulo $p$ and whose dynamics can be used to define
digit expansions of $p$-adic integers which respect congruency modulo powers of
$p$ and admit a distinctive ""block structure"". $p$-adic systems generalize
several notions related to $p$-adic integers such as permutation polynomials
and put them under a common framework, allowing for results and techniques
formulated in one setting to be transferred to another. The general framework
established by $p$-adic systems also provides more natural versions of the
original Collatz conjecture and first results could be achieved in the context.
A detailed formal introduction to $p$-adic systems and their different
interpretations is given. Several classes of $p$-adic systems defined by
different types of functions such as polynomial functions or rational functions
are characterized and a group structure on the set of all $p$-adic systems is
established, which altogether provides a variety of concrete examples of
$p$-adic systems. Furthermore, $p$-adic systems are used to generalize Hensel's
Lemma on polynomials to general functions on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, analyze the
original Collatz conjecture in the context of other ""linear-polynomial $p$-adic
systems"", and to study the relation between ""polynomial $p$-adic systems"" and
permutation polynomials with the aid of ""trees of cycles"" which encode the
cycle structure of certain permutations of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. To outline a
potential roadmap for future investigations of $p$-adic systems in many
different directions, several open questions and problems in relation to

with a derived equivalence between $X$ and $A$. This ring $A$ is constructed as
an endomorphism ring of a decomposable module, and hence admits an idempotent
$e$. Donovan and Wemyss define the contraction algebra $A_\mathrm{con}$ to be
the quotient of $A$ by $e$; it is a finite-dimensional noncommutative algebra
that is conjectured to completely recover the geometry of the base of the flop.
They show that $A_\mathrm{con}$ represents the noncommutative deformation
theory of the flopping curves, and also controls the Bridgeland-Chen flop-flop
autoequivalence of the derived category of $X$.
  In this thesis, I construct and prove properties of a new invariant, the
derived contraction algebra $A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$, which I define to be
Braun-Chuang-Lazarev's derived quotient of $A$ by $e$. A priori,
$A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$ - which is a dga, rather than just an algebra -
is a finer invariant than the classical contraction algebra. I prove (using
recent results of Hua and Keller) a derived version of the Donovan-Wemyss
conjecture, a suitable phrasing of which is true in all dimensions. I prove
that the derived quotient admits an interpretation in terms of derived
deformation theory. I prove that $A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$ controls a
generalised flop-flop autoequivalence. These results both recover and extend
Donovan-Wemyss's. I give concrete applications and computations in the case of
partial resolutions of Kleinian singularities, where the classical contraction
algebra becomes inadequate.

the angles at which the curves meet. One of the key problems in analyzing
motion of networks by curvature law is the choice of a tangential velocity that
allows for motion of the triple junction, does not lead to mesh degeneration,
and is amenable to an error analysis. Our approach consists in considering a
perturbation of a classical smooth formulation. The problem we propose admits a
natural variational formulation that can be discretized with finite elements.
The perturbation can be made arbitrarily small when a regularization parameter

be explored to obtain other information such as the individual's gender, the
influence of drug use, the use of contact lenses, spoofing, among others. This
work presents a survey of the databases created for ocular recognition,
detailing their protocols and how their images were acquired. We also describe
and discuss the most popular ocular recognition competitions (contests),
highlighting the submitted algorithms that achieved the best results using only
iris trait and also fusing iris and periocular region information. Finally, we
describe some relevant works applying deep learning techniques to ocular
recognition and point out new challenges and future directions. Considering
that there are a large number of ocular databases, and each one is usually
designed for a specific problem, we believe this survey can provide a broad
overview of the challenges in ocular biometrics.

generating useful visualizations from a complex dataset is far from an easy
task. Besides understanding the functionality provided by existing
visualization libraries, generating the desired visualization also requires
reshaping and aggregating the underlying data as well as composing different
visual elements to achieve the intended visual narrative. This paper aims to
simplify visualization tasks by automatically synthesizing the required program
from simple visual sketches provided by the user. Specifically, given an input
data set and a visual sketch that demonstrates how to visualize a very small
subset of this data, our technique automatically generates a program that can
be used to visualize the entire data set.
  Automating visualization poses several challenges. First, because many
visualization tasks require data wrangling in addition to generating plots, we
need to decompose the end-to-end synthesis task into two separate sub-problems.
Second, because the intermediate specification that results from the
decomposition is necessarily imprecise, this makes the data wrangling task
particularly challenging in our context. In this paper, we address these
problems by developing a new compositional visualization-by-example technique
that (a) decomposes the end-to-end task into two different synthesis problems
over different DSLs and (b) leverages bi-directional program analysis to deal
with the complexity that arises from having an imprecise intermediate
specification.
  We implemented our visualization-by-example algorithm and evaluate it on 83
visualization tasks collected from on-line forums and tutorials. Viser can
solve 84% of these benchmarks within a 600 second time limit, and, for those
tasks that can be solved, the desired visualization is among the top-5
generated by Viser in 70% of the cases.

magnetic field of $2-7\times10^{13}$ G, rotating near equilibrium. Analysis of

due to disc precession, and that material is accreted onto the neutron star at
a constant rate throughout it. Moreover, by attributing this modulation to the

  using only pointer-width CAS",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When designing concurrent algorithms, Load-Link/Store-Conditional (LL/SC) is
often the ideal primitive to have because unlike Compare and Swap (CAS), LL/SC
is immune to the ABA problem. However, the full semantics of LL/SC are not
supported by any modern machine, so there has been a significant amount of work
on simulations of LL/SC using Compare and Swap (CAS), a synchronization
primitive that enjoys widespread hardware support. All of the algorithms so far
that are constant time either use unbounded sequence numbers (and thus base
objects of unbounded size), or require $\Omega(MP)$ space for $M$ LL/SC object
(where $P$ is the number of processes). We present a constant time
implementation of $M$ LL/SC objects using $\Theta(M+kP^2)$ space, where $k$ is
the maximum number of overlapping LL/SC operations per process (usually a
constant), and requiring only pointer-sized CAS objects. Our implementation can
also be used to implement $L$-word $LL/SC$ objects in $\Theta(L)$ time (for
both $LL$ and $SC$) and $\Theta((M+kP^2)L)$ space. To achieve these bounds, we
begin by implementing a new primitive called Single-Writer Copy which takes a
pointer to a word sized memory location and atomically copies its contents into
another object. The restriction is that only one process is allowed to
write/copy into the destination object at a time. We believe this primitive
will be very useful in designing other concurrent algorithms as well.

lattice systems with local interactions. We derive rigorous bounds on the
operator norm growth and then proceed to establish an analog of the
Lieb-Robinson bound for the spatial growth. In contrast to the Minkowski case
when ballistic spreading of operators is universal, in the Euclidean case
spatial growth is system-dependent and indicates if the system is integrable or
chaotic. In the integrable case, the Euclidean spatial growth is at most
polynomial. In the chaotic case, it is the fastest possible: exponential in 1D,
while in higher dimensions and on Bethe lattices local operators can reach
spatial infinity in finite Euclidean time. We use bounds on the Euclidean
growth to establish constraints on individual matrix elements and operator
power spectrum. We show that one-dimensional systems are special with the power
spectrum always being superexponentially suppressed at large frequencies.
Finally, we relate the bound on the Euclidean growth to the bound on the growth
of Lanczos coefficients. To that end, we develop a path integral formalism for
the weighted Dyck paths and evaluate it using saddle point approximation. Using
a conjectural connection between the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the
Lyapunov exponent controlling the growth of OTOCs, we propose an improved bound
on chaos valid at all temperatures.

exceptionally large radii for their masses and thus correspondingly low
densities ($\lesssim0.3\rm\,g\,cm^{-3}$). Here we consider whether they could
have large inferred radii because they are in fact ringed. This would naturally
explain why super-puffs have thus far only shown featureless transit spectra.
We find that this hypothesis can work in some cases but not all. The close
proximity of the super-puffs to their parent stars necessitates rings with a
rocky rather than icy composition. This limits the radius of the rings, and
makes it challenging to explain the large size of Kepler 51b, 51c, 51d, and 79d
unless the rings are composed of porous material. Furthermore, the short tidal
locking timescales for Kepler 18d, 223d, and 223e mean that these planets may
be spinning too slowly, resulting in a small oblateness and rings that are
warped by their parent star. Kepler 87c and 177c have the best chance of being
explained by rings. Using transit simulations, we show that testing this
hypothesis requires photometry with a precision of somewhere between ~10 ppm
and ~50 ppm, which roughly scales with the ratio of the planet and star's
radii. We conclude with a note about the recently discovered super-puff HIP

The matched, spatially resolved nature of these data sets allows us to derive
the $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$-${\rm A_V}$ relation on global, radial, and kpc (spaxel)
scales. We determine ${\rm A_V}$ from the Balmer decrement
(H$\alpha$/H$\beta$). We find that the best fit for this relation is
$\Sigma_{\rm gas} ({\rm M_\odot pc^{-2}})\sim~26~\times~ {\rm A_V}({\rm mag})$,
and that it does not depend on the spatial scale used for the fit. However, the
scatter in the fits increases as we probe smaller spatial scales, reflecting
the complex relative spatial distributions of stars, gas, and dust. We
investigate the $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$/ ${\rm A_V}$ ratio on radial and spaxel
scales as a function of ${\rm EW(H\alpha)}$. We find that at larger values of
${\rm EW(H\alpha)}$ (i.e., actively star-forming regions) this ratio tend to
converge to the value expected for dust-star mixed geometries ($\sim$ 30
$\mathrm{M_{\odot} \,pc^{-2}\,mag^{-1}}$). On radial scales, we do not find a
significant relation between the $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$/${\rm A_V}$ ratio and the
ionized gas metallicity. We contrast our estimates of $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ using
${\rm A_V}$ with compilations in the literature of the gas fraction on global

radial star-formation law and the $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$-$\Sigma_*$ relation. These
tests show that optical extinction is a reliable proxy for estimating
$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ in the absence of direct sub/millimeter observations of the
cold gas.

observational bounds on the black hole mass function in galaxy nuclei. We are

Galactic magnetic field on the LB scale to three-dimensional (3D) maps of the
local interstellar medium (ISM). First, we extracted the geometry of the LB
shell, its inner surface, in particular from 3D dust extinction maps of the
local ISM. We expanded the shell inner surface in spherical harmonics, up to a
variable maximum multipole degree, which enabled us to control the level of
complexity for the modeled surface. Next, we applied an analytical model for
the ordered magnetic field in the shell to the modeled shell surface. This
magnetic field model was successfully fitted to the \textit{Planck} 353~GHz
dust polarized emission maps over the Galactic polar caps. For each polar cap,
the direction of the mean magnetic field derived from dust polarization
(together with the prior that the field points toward longitude $90^\circ \pm
90^\circ$) is found to be consistent with the Faraday spectra of the nearby
diffuse synchrotron emission. Our work presents a new approach to modeling the
local structure of the Galactic magnetic field. We expect our methodology and
our results to be useful both in modeling the local ISM as traced by its
different components and in modeling the dust polarized emission, which is a
long-awaited input for studies of the polarized foregrounds for cosmic
microwave background.

compact jets. There is evidence for an increase in the size of the jets with
cluster-centric radius, which may be attributed to the decreased ICM pressure
confinement with increasing radius. Besides this correlation, there are no
other significant correlations between the properties of the radio-AGN

richness and location within the cluster). The fact that there are more AGN in

two alternative dynamics prescribed by quantum mechanics: the unitary evolution
of the wave function and the state-update rule (or ""collapse"") at the instant a

constitutes the paradoxical scenario in which different observers (one of whom
is observed by the other) describe one and the same interaction differently,
one --the Friend-- via state-update and the other --Wigner-- unitarily. This
can lead to Wigner and his friend assigning different probabilities to the
outcome of the same subsequent measurement. In this paper, we apply the
Page-Wootters mechanism (PWM) as a timeless description of Wigner's friend-like
scenarios. We show that the standard rules to assign two-time conditional
probabilities within the PWM need to be modified to deal with the Wigner's
friend gedankenexperiment. We identify three main definitions of such modified
rules to assign two-time conditional probabilities, all of which reduce to
standard quantum theory for non-Wigner's friend scenarios. However, when
applied to the Wigner's friend setup each rule assigns different conditional
probabilities, potentially resolving the probability-assignment paradox in a
different manner. Moreover, one rule imposes strict limits on when a joint
probability distribution for the measurement outcomes of Wigner and his Friend
is well-defined, which single out those cases where Wigner's measurement does
not disturb the Friend's memory and such a probability has an operational
meaning in terms of collectible statistics. Interestingly, the same limits
guarantee that said measurement outcomes fulfill the consistency condition of
the consistent histories framework.

that we can reconstruct the background in the signal region independently of
Monte Carlo. We propose to use this information to tune the Monte Carlo in the

bi-objective optimization problem of constrained matrix approximation in the
Chebyshev sense in logarithmic scale. The problem is to approximate the
pairwise comparison matrices for each criterion simultaneously by a common
consistent matrix of unit rank, which determines the vector of ratings. We
represent and solve the optimization problem in the framework of tropical
(idempotent) algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of
idempotent semirings and semifields. The solution involves the introduction of
two parameters that represent the minimum values of approximation error for
each matrix and thereby describe the Pareto frontier for the bi-objective
problem. The optimization problem then reduces to a parametrized vector
inequality. The necessary and sufficient conditions for solutions of the
inequality serve to derive the Pareto frontier for the problem. All solutions
of the inequality, which correspond to the Pareto frontier, are taken as a
complete Pareto-optimal solution to the problem. We apply these results to the
decision problem of interest and present illustrative examples.

correlated states of light arise from the extreme nonlinearity granted by
quantum emitters that are strongly coupled to a photonic mode. However, in
these approaches, unavoidable dissipation, like photon loss, blurs nonlinear
quantum effects. Here, we generate strongly correlated photon states using only
weak coupling and taking advantage of dissipation. We launch light through an
ensemble of non-interacting waveguide-coupled atoms, which induce correlations
between simultaneously arriving photons through collectively enhanced nonlinear
interactions. These correlated photons then experience less dissipation than
the uncorrelated ones. Depending on the number of atoms, we experimentally
observe strong photon bunching or anti-bunching of the transmitted light. This
realization of a collectively enhanced nonlinearity may turn out
transformational for quantum information science and opens new avenues for
generating nonclassical light, covering frequencies from the microwave to the

establish, through nonlinear interactions, stable synchronization. This
self-organization underlies light sources that enable many modern scientific
applications, such as ultrafast and high-field optics and frequency combs.
Despite this, mode-locking has almost exclusively referred to self-organization
of light in a single dimension - time. Here we present a theoretical approach,
attractor dissection, for understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatiotemporal
mode-locking (STML). The key idea is to find, for each distinct type of 3D
pulse, a specific, minimal reduced model, and thus to identify the important
intracavity effects responsible for its formation and stability. An intuition
for the results follows from the 'minimum loss principle,' the idea that a
laser strives to find the configuration of intracavity light that minimizes
loss (maximizes gain extraction). Through this approach, we identify and
explain several distinct forms of STML. These novel phases of coherent laser
light have no analogues in 1D and are supported by experimental measurements of
the three-dimensional field, revealing STML states comprising more than $10^7$
cavity modes. Our results should facilitate the discovery and understanding of
new higher-dimensional forms of coherent light which, in turn, may enable new
applications.

to deal with the solvability of the problem of initial conditions for finite

monomial PDE system as a generating family of a multiplicative set of
monomials. He introduced an algorithmic method on multiplicative sets to
compute compatibility conditions, and to study the problem of the existence and
the unicity of a solution to a linear PDE system with given initial conditions.
The compatibility conditions are formulated using a refinement of the division
operation on monomials defined with respect to a partition of the set of
variables into multiplicative and non-multiplicative variables. M. Janet was a
pioneer in the development of these algorithmic methods, and the completion
procedure that he introduced on polynomials was the first one in a long and
rich series of works on completion methods which appeared independently
throughout the 20th century in various algebraic contexts.

cluster using ~200 days of photometric monitoring with the Next Generation
Transit Survey (NGTS). These stars span F5-M3 spectral types (1.2 $\gtrsim M
\gtrsim$ 0.3 M$_{\odot}$) and increase the number of known rotation periods in
Blanco 1 by a factor of four. We determine rotation periods using three
methods: Gaussian process (GP) regression, generalised autocorrelation (G-ACF)
and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodograms, and find that GPs and G-ACF are more
applicable to evolving spot modulation patterns. Between mid-F and mid-K
spectral types, single stars follow a well-defined rotation sequence from ~2 to
10 days, whereas stars in photometric multiple systems typically rotate faster.
This may suggest that the presence of a moderate-to-high mass ratio companion
inhibits angular momentum loss mechanisms during the early pre-main sequence,
and this signature has not been erased at ~100 Myr. The majority of mid-F to
mid-K stars display evolving modulation patterns, whereas most M stars show
stable modulation signals. This morphological change coincides with the shift
from a well-defined rotation sequence (mid-F to mid-K stars) to a broad
rotation period distribution (late-K and M stars). Finally, we compare our
rotation results for Blanco 1 to the similarly-aged Pleiades: the single star
populations in both clusters possess consistent rotation period distributions,
which suggests that the angular momentum evolution of stars follows a
well-defined pathway that is, at least for mid-F to mid-K stars, strongly
imprinted by ~100 Myr.

Yet bias in the form of inappropriate subjectivity - introducing attitudes via
framing, presupposing truth, and casting doubt - remains ubiquitous. This kind
of bias erodes our collective trust and fuels social conflict. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel testbed for natural language generation:
automatically bringing inappropriately subjective text into a neutral point of
view (""neutralizing"" biased text). We also offer the first parallel corpus of
biased language. The corpus contains 180,000 sentence pairs and originates from
Wikipedia edits that removed various framings, presuppositions, and attitudes
from biased sentences. Last, we propose two strong encoder-decoder baselines
for the task. A straightforward yet opaque CONCURRENT system uses a BERT
encoder to identify subjective words as part of the generation process. An
interpretable and controllable MODULAR algorithm separates these steps, using
(1) a BERT-based classifier to identify problematic words and (2) a novel join
embedding through which the classifier can edit the hidden states of the
encoder. Large-scale human evaluation across four domains (encyclopedias, news
headlines, books, and political speeches) suggests that these algorithms are a
first step towards the automatic identification and reduction of bias.

loops when the heating is quasi-constant and highly-stratified. Under such
heating conditions, coronal loops undergo cycles of evaporation and
condensation. The recent observations of ubiquitous long-period intensity
pulsations in coronal loops and their relationship with coronal rain have
demonstrated that understanding the characteristics of TNE cycles is an
essential step in constraining the circulation of mass and energy in the
corona. We report unique observations with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) that link the captured thermal
properties across the extreme spatiotemporal scales covered by TNE processes.
Within the same coronal loop bundle, we captured 6 hr period coronal intensity
pulsations in SDO/AIA and coronal rain observed off-limb in the chromospheric
Halpha and Ca II K spectral lines with SST/CRISP and SST/CHROMIS. We combined a
multi-thermal analysis of the cycles with AIA and an extensive spectral
characterisation of the rain clumps with the SST. We find clear evidence of
evaporation-condensation cycles in the corona which are linked with periodic
coronal rain showers. The high-resolution spectroscopic instruments at the SST
reveal the fine-structured rain strands and allow us to probe the cooling phase
of one of the cycles down to chromospheric temperatures. These observations
reinforce the link between long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain.
They also demonstrate the capability of TNE to shape the dynamics of active
regions on the large scales as well as on the smallest scales currently

to reuse functionality. Native code is directly executed from apps through the
Java Native Interface or the Android Native Development Kit. Android developers
add precompiled native libraries to their projects, enabling their use.
Unfortunately, developers often struggle or simply neglect to update these
libraries in a timely manner. This results in the continuous use of outdated
native libraries with unpatched security vulnerabilities years after patches
became available.
  To further understand such phenomena, we study the security updates in native
libraries in the most popular 200 free apps on Google Play from Sept. 2013 to
May 2020. A core difficulty we face in this study is the identification of
libraries and their versions. Developers often rename or modify libraries,
making their identification challenging. We create an approach called LibRARIAN
(LibRAry veRsion IdentificAtioN) that accurately identifies native libraries
and their versions as found in Android apps based on our novel similarity

based on their metadata and identifying strings in read-only sections.
  We discovered 53/200 popular apps (26.5%) with vulnerable versions with known
CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020, with 14 of those apps remaining
vulnerable. We find that app developers took, on average, 528.71 days to apply
security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54.59
days - a 10 times slower rate of update.

significant kick velocities inside DM halos. In collaboration with DM
self-interaction, the excess kinetic energy of the produced DM particles is
distributed to the others, which self-heats the DM particles as a whole. The DM
self-heating is efficient towards the halo center, and the heat injection is
used to enhance the formation of a uniform density core inside halos. The
effect of DM self-heating is expected to be more significant in smaller halos
for two reasons: 1) the exothermic cross section times the relative velocity,
$\left\langle\sigma_{\rm exo}v_{\rm rel}\right\rangle$, is constant; 2) and the
ratio of the injected heat to the velocity dispersion squared gets larger
towards smaller halos. For the first time, we quantitatively investigate the
core formation from DM self-heating for halos in a wide mass range
($10^{9}$-$10^{15}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) using the gravothermal fluid formalism.
Notably, we demonstrate that the core formation is sharply escalating towards
smaller halos by taking the self-heating DM (i.e., DM that semi-annihilates and
self-interacts) as an example. We show that the sharp escalation of core
formation may cause a tension in simultaneously explaining the observed central
mass deficit of Milky Way satellites, and field dwarf/low surface brightness
spiral galaxies. While the details of the self-heating effect may differ among
models, we expect that the sharp halo-mass dependence of the core formation is
a general feature of exothermic DM.

mass and concentration are tightly related in a way that depends on cosmology

independent of the local environment for haloes less massive than those of
typical galaxies. Haloes over the mass range of 10^3 to 10^11 solar masses

learning solution to learn a novel representation of event data, which retains
the sparsity of the data as well as encode the temporal information readily
available from these sensors. Since there is no existing dataset for anomaly
detection in event domain, we also provide an anomaly detection event dataset
with an exhaustive set of anomalies. Careful analysis reveals that the proposed
method results in huge reduction in computational complexity as compared to
previous state-of-the-art conventional anomaly detection networks.

forces behind research into new deep learning architectures and building
blocks. Some recent examples include: the squeeze-and-excitation module,
depthwise separable convolutions in Xception, and the inverted bottleneck in
MobileNet v2. Notably, in all of these cases, the resulting building blocks
enabled not only higher efficiency, but also higher accuracy, and found wide
adoption in the field. In this work, we further expand the arsenal of efficient
building blocks for neural network architectures; but instead of combining
standard primitives (such as convolution), we advocate for the replacement of
these dense primitives with their sparse counterparts. While the idea of using
sparsity to decrease the parameter count is not new, the conventional wisdom is
that this reduction in theoretical FLOPs does not translate into real-world
efficiency gains. We aim to correct this misconception by introducing a family
of efficient sparse kernels for ARM and WebAssembly, which we open-source for
the benefit of the community as part of the XNNPACK library. Equipped with our
efficient implementation of sparse primitives, we show that sparse versions of
MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2 and EfficientNet architectures substantially
outperform strong dense baselines on the efficiency-accuracy curve. On
Snapdragon 835 our sparse networks outperform their dense equivalents by
$1.3-2.4\times$ -- equivalent to approximately one entire generation of
MobileNet-family improvement. We hope that our findings will facilitate wider
adoption of sparsity as a tool for creating efficient and accurate deep

the host star, where a higher overall metallicity of the host star provides
more building blocks for planets. However, most planet formation simulations
only link the stellar iron abundance [Fe/H] to planet formation and [Fe/H] in
itself is used as a proxy to scale all elements. But large surveys of stellar
abundances show that this is not true. We use here stellar abundances from the
GALAH surveys to determine the average detailed abundances of Fe, Si, Mg, O,
and C for a broad range of [Fe/H] spanning from -0.4 to +0.4. Using an
equilibrium chemical model that features the most important rock forming
molecules as well as volatile contributions of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO,
we calculate the chemical composition of solid planetary building blocks. Solid
building blocks that are formed entirely interior to the water ice line
(T>150K) only show an increase in Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ and a decrease in MgSiO$_3$ for
increasing host star metallicity, related to the increase of Mg/Si for higher
[Fe/H]. Solid planetary building blocks forming exterior to the water ice line
(T<150K) show dramatic changes in their composition. The water ice content
decreases from around $\sim$50\% at [Fe/H]=-0.4 to $\sim$6\% at [Fe/H]=0.4 in
our chemical model. This is mainly caused by the increasing C/O ratio with
increasing [Fe/H], which binds most of the oxygen in gaseous CO and CO$_2$,
resulting in a small water ice fraction. Planet formation simulations coupled
with the chemical model confirm these results by showing that the water ice
content of super-Earths decreases with increasing host star metallicity due to
the increased C/O ratio. This decrease of the water ice fraction has important
consequences for planet formation, planetary composition and the eventual
habitability of planetary systems formed around these high metallicity stars.

$Y(2175)$ are calculated using the QCD two-point sum rules by taking into
account various quark, gluon and mixed condensates up to dimension 15. Partial
widths of its strong decays to $\phi f_{0}(980)$, $ \phi \eta$, and $\phi

$Y\phi f_{0}(980)$, $Y\phi \eta$, and $Y\phi \eta^{\prime}$, and calculate the
corresponding strong couplings by means of the QCD light-cone sum rule method.
The coupling $G_{Y\phi f}$ of the vertex $Y\phi f_{0}(980)$ is found using the
full version of this method, and by treating the scalar meson $f_{0}(980)$ as a
diquark-antidiquark tetraquark state. The couplings $g_{Y\phi \eta }$ and
$g_{Y\phi \eta^{\prime}}$, however, are calculated by applying the soft-meson
approximation to the light-cone sum rule method. Prediction for the mass of the
resonance $m_{Y} =\left( 2173\pm 85\right)~\mathrm{MeV}$ is in excellent
agreement with the data of the BaBar Collaboration \cite{Aubert:2006bu}, and
within errors of calculations is compatible with the result reported by BESIII

conducted to understand the needs of communities as they collect, organize, and
analyze data to make decisions about their priorities. The result of this

development of interventions and are used to assess the impact of
interventions. Our key findings indicate ambiguities and disagreement among MSP
decision-makers regarding causal relationships between actions and outcomes,
and the relevant data needed for making decisions. MSP decision-makers
expressed a desire for easy-to-use tools that facilitate the collection,
organization, synthesis, and analysis of data, to enable decision-making in a
timely manner. Findings inform conceptual modeling and ontological analysis to
capture the domain knowledge and specify relationships between actions and
outcomes. This modeling and analysis provide the foundation for an ontology,
encoded using OWL 2 Web Ontology Language. The ontology is developed to provide
semantic support for the MSP process, defining objectives, strategies, actions,
indicators, and data sources. In the future, software interacting with the
ontology can facilitate interactive browsing by decision-makers in the MSP in
the form of concepts, instances, relationships, and axioms. Our ontology also
facilitates the integration and interpretation of community data and can help
in managing semantic interoperability between different knowledge sources.

lung cancer, raising survival expectations beyond those that were historically

for the adjustment of mixture parametric models of two populations for survival
analysis in the presence of long survivors. A methodology is proposed in
several five steps: first, it is proposed to use the multimodality test to
decide the number of subpopulations to be considered in the model, second to
adjust simple parametric survival models and mixture distribution models, to
estimate the parameters and to select the best model fitted the data, finally,
to test the hypotheses to compare the effectiveness of immunotherapies in the
context of randomized clinical trials. The methodology is illustrated with data
from a clinical trial that evaluates the effectiveness of the therapeutic
vaccine CIMAvaxEGF vs the best supportive care for the treatment of advanced
lung cancer. The mixture survival model allows estimating the presence of a
subpopulation of long survivors that is 44% for vaccinated patients. The
differences between the treated and control group were significant in both
subpopulations (population of short-term survival: p = 0.001, the population of
long-term survival: p = 0.0002). For cancer therapies, where a proportion of
patients achieves long-term control of the disease, the heterogeneity of the
population must be taken into account. Mixture parametric models may be more
suitable to detect the effectiveness of immunotherapies compared to standard
models.

transformation which is coherent among different neutrino momentum modes. Such
collective oscillations can produce partial swaps of the energy spectra of
different neutrino species as the neutrinos stream away from the proto-neutron
star. However, it has been demonstrated that the spatial symmetries (such as
the spherical symmetry in the bulb model) can be broken spontaneously by
collective neutrino oscillations in multi-dimensional models. Using a
stationary, 2D neutrino ring model we demonstrate that there exist two limiting
scenarios where collective oscillations may occur. In one limit, the collective
flavor transformation begins at a radius with relatively high neutrino
densities and develops small-scale flavor structures. The loss of the spatial
correlation in the neutrino flavor field results in similar (average) energy
spectra for the anti-neutrinos of almost all energies and the neutrinos of
relatively high energies. In the other limit, the flavor transformation starts
at a radius where the neutrino densities are smaller (e.g., due to the
suppression of the high matter density near the proto-neutron star). Although
the spatial symmetry is broken initially, it is restored as the neutrino
densities decrease, and the neutrinos of different flavors partially swap their
energy spectra as in the 1D bulb model. This finding may have interesting
ramifications in other aspects of supernova physics.

models. We then create a discrete abstraction of the continuous abstraction and
use formal methods to synthesize a controller satisfying the specifications
shrunk by the obtained error bound. Combining both controllers finally solves
the main control problem on the initial system. This two-step framework allows
the discrete abstraction methods to deal with higher-dimensional systems which
may be computationally expensive without the prior continuous abstraction. The
main novelty of the proposed SOS continuous abstraction is that it allows the
error between abstract and concrete models to explicitly depend on the control
input of the abstract model, which offers more freedom in the choice of the
continuous abstraction model and provides lower error bounds than when only the
states of both models are considered. This approach is illustrated on the
docking problem of a marine vessel.

pions and thence $\gamma$-rays. In this paper we present a first-principles
calculation of the mechanisms by which CRs propagate through such environments,
combining astrochemical models with analysis of turbulence in weakly ionised
plasma. We show that CRs cannot scatter off the strong large-scale turbulence
found in starbursts, because efficient ion-neutral damping prevents such
turbulence from cascading down to the scales of CR gyroradii. Instead, CRs
stream along field lines at a rate determined by the competition between
streaming instability and ion-neutral damping, leading to transport via a
process of field line random walk. This results in an effective diffusion
coefficient that is nearly energy-independent up to CR energies of $\sim 1$
TeV. We apply our computed diffusion coefficient to a simple model of CR escape
and loss, and show that the resulting $\gamma$-ray spectra are in good
agreement with the observed spectra of the starbursts NGC 253, M82, and Arp

  Audio Source Separation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monoaural audio source separation is a challenging research area in machine
learning. In this area, a mixture containing multiple audio sources is given,
and a model is expected to disentangle the mixture into isolated atomic
sources. In this paper, we first introduce a challenging new dataset for
monoaural source separation called WildMix. WildMix is designed with the goal
of extending the boundaries of source separation beyond what previous datasets
in this area would allow. It contains diverse in-the-wild recordings from 25
different sound classes, combined with each other using arbitrary composition
policies. Source separation often requires modeling long-range dependencies in
both temporal and spectral domains. To this end, we introduce a novel
trasnformer-based model called Spectro-Temporal Transformer (STT). STT utilizes
a specialized encoder, called Spectro-Temporal Encoder (STE). STE highlights
temporal and spectral components of sources within a mixture, using a
self-attention mechanism. It subsequently disentangles them in a hierarchical
manner. In our experiments, STT swiftly outperforms various previous baselines
for monoaural source separation on the challenging WildMix dataset.

  Recognition","Accepted by AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial-temporal feature learning is of vital importance for video emotion
recognition. Previous deep network structures often focused on macro-motion
which extends over long time scales, e.g., on the order of seconds. We believe
integrating structures capturing information about both micro- and macro-motion
will benefit emotion prediction, because human perceive both micro- and
macro-expressions. In this paper, we propose to combine micro- and macro-motion
features to improve video emotion recognition with a two-stream recurrent
network, named MIMAMO (Micro-Macro-Motion) Net. Specifically, smaller and
shorter micro-motions are analyzed by a two-stream network, while larger and
more sustained macro-motions can be well captured by a subsequent recurrent
network. Assigning specific interpretations to the roles of different parts of
the network enables us to make choice of parameters based on prior knowledge:
choices that turn out to be optimal. One of the important innovations in our
model is the use of interframe phase differences rather than optical flow as
input to the temporal stream. Compared with the optical flow, phase differences
require less computation and are more robust to illumination changes. Our
proposed network achieves state of the art performance on two video emotion
datasets, the OMG emotion dataset and the Aff-Wild dataset. The most
significant gains are for arousal prediction, for which motion information is
intuitively more informative. Source code is available at

work, requiring between $5\times$ and $16\times$ less data to reach the same

supervised relation extraction. Existing approaches usually consider that the
noisy sentences are useless and will harm the model's performance. Therefore,
they mainly alleviate this problem by reducing the influence of noisy
sentences, such as applying bag-level selective attention or removing noisy
sentences from sentence-bags. However, the underlying cause of the noisy
labeling problem is not the lack of useful information, but the missing
relation labels. Intuitively, if we can allocate credible labels for noisy
sentences, they will be transformed into useful training data and benefit the
model's performance. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel method for distant
supervised relation extraction, which employs unsupervised deep clustering to
generate reliable labels for noisy sentences. Specifically, our model contains
three modules: a sentence encoder, a noise detector and a label generator. The
sentence encoder is used to obtain feature representations. The noise detector
detects noisy sentences from sentence-bags, and the label generator produces
high-confidence relation labels for noisy sentences. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines

common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with

short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the

offers an attractive avenue for applications such as fast magnetic devices for

(HI-AOS) of the magnetization has thus far only been observed in Gd-based,
ferrimagnetic amorphous (\textit{a}-) rare earth-transition metal
(\textit{a}-RE-TM) systems, and a comprehensive understanding of the reversal
mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report HI-AOS in ferrimagnetic
\textit{a}-Gd$_{22-x}$Tb$_x$Co$_{78}$ thin films, from x = 0 to x = 18, and
elucidate the role of Gd in HI-AOS in \textit{a}-RE-TM alloys and multilayers.
Increasing Tb content results in increasing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
and coercivity, without modifying magnetization density, and slower
remagnetization rates and higher critical fluences for switching but still
shows picosecond HI-AOS. Simulations of the atomistic spin dynamics based on
the two-temperature model reproduce these results qualitatively and predict
that the lower damping on the RE sublattice arising from the small spin-orbit
coupling of Gd (with $L = 0$) is instrumental for the faster dynamics and lower
critical fluences of the Gd-rich alloys. Annealing
\textit{a}-Gd$_{10}$Tb$_{12}$Co$_{78}$ leads to slower dynamics which we argue
is due to an increase in damping. These simulations strongly indicate that
acounting for element-specific damping is crucial in understanding HI-AOS
phenomena. The results suggest that engineering the element specific damping of
materials can open up new classes of materials that exhibit low-energy,
ultrafast HI-AOS.

local information is so far missing in spite of the scientific interest. In
this manuscript we resolve this problem through a tractable linear programming
formulation that applies to and beyond polynomial congestion games. When
specializing our approach to the polynomial case, we obtain tight values for
the optimal price of anarchy and corresponding tolls, uncovering an unexpected
link with load balancing games. We also derive optimal tolling mechanisms that
are constant with the congestion level, generalizing the results of Caragiannis
et al. [ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 2010] to polynomial congestion games
and beyond. Finally, we apply our techniques to compute the efficiency of the
marginal cost mechanism. Surprisingly, optimal tolling mechanism using only
local information perform closely to existing mechanism that utilize global
information [Bil\`o and Vinci, ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation,

continuous-flow model, has lower efficiency than that encountered levying no

challenge: the number of variables that the hardware can manage to solve is
very limited. Given that large-scale practical problems, including problems in
operations research, combinatorial scientific computing, data science and

result in an end-to-end manner. These approaches require large number of
training parameters integrated with the low-level representations, and thus are
memory and computational inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new model
named ""LorentzFM"" that can learn feature interactions embedded in a hyperbolic
space in which the violation of triangle inequality for Lorentz distances is
available. To this end, the learned representation is benefited by the peculiar
geometric properties of hyperbolic triangles, and result in a significant
reduction in the number of parameters (20\% to 80\%) because all the top deep
learning layers are not required. With such a lightweight architecture,
LorentzFM achieves comparable and even materially better results than the deep
learning methods such as DeepFM, xDeepFM and Deep \& Cross in both
recommendation and CTR prediction tasks.

configurations, such as polar flux-closure via external stimuli, enables many
applications in electromechanical devices and nanoelectronics including
high-density information storage. Here, by using the atomically resolved in
situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we find that a polar
flux-closure structure in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices films can be reversibly
switched to ordinary mono ferroelectric c domain or a domain under electric
field or stress. Specifically, the electric field initially drives the
flux-closure move and breaks them to form intermediate a/c striped domains,
while the mechanical stress firstly starts to squeeze the flux-closures to
convert into small vortices at the interface and form a continues dipole wave.
After the removal of the external stimuli, the flux-closure structure
spontaneously returns. Our atomic study provides valuable insights into
understanding the lattice-charge interactions and the competing interactions
balance in these complex topological structures. Such reversible switching
between the flux-closure and ordinary ferroelectric domains also provides the
foundation for applications such as memories and sensors.

fundamental research area. Arguably, modeling arbitrarily distributed
spatio-temporal dynamics within and across modalities is the biggest challenge

The proposed factorization allows for increasing the number of self-attentions

periodically solving an online nominal MPC problem, which requires prior model
information and frequent access to onboard computational resources. In this
paper, we propose an efficient robust MPC solution based on receding horizon
reinforcement learning, called r-LPC, for unknown nonlinear systems with state
constraints and disturbances. The proposed r-LPC utilizes a Koopman
operator-based prediction model obtained off-line from pre-collected

interval of r-LPC, we use an actor-critic structure to learn a near-optimal
feedback control policy rather than a control sequence. The resulting
closed-loop control policy can be learned off-line and deployed online or
learned online in an asynchronous way. In the latter case, online learning can
be activated whenever necessary; for instance, the safety constraint is
violated with the deployed policy. The closed-loop recursive feasibility,
robustness, and asymptotic stability are proven under function approximation

nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances have demonstrated that
our approach has better or comparable performance when compared with tube-based

source of barrier in the ligand recognition process by polar cavity, the nature
of solvent's role in the recognition process involving hydrophobic cavity and
hydrophobic ligand remains to be addressed. In this work, we quantitatively
assess the role of solvent in dictating the kinetic process of recognition in a
popular system involving hydrophobic cavity and ligand. In this prototypical
system the hydrophobic cavity undergoes \textit{dewetting transition} as the
ligand approaches the cavity, which influences the cavity-ligand recognition
kinetics. Here, we build Markov state model (MSM) using adaptively sampled
unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to map the kinetic
recognition process. The MSM-reconstructed free energy surface recovers a broad
water distribution at an intermediate cavity-ligand separation, consistent with
previous report of dewetting transition in this system. Time-structured
independent component analysis of the simulated trajectories quantitatively
shows that cavity-solvent density contributes considerably in an optimised
reaction coordinate involving cavity-ligand separation and water occupancy. Our
approach quantifies two solvent-mediated macro states at an intermediate
separation of the cavity-ligand recognition pathways, apart from the fully
ligand-bound and fully ligand-unbound macro states. Interestingly, we find that
these water-mediated intermediates, while transient in populations, can undergo
slow mutual interconversion and create possibilities of multiple pathways of
cavity recognition by the ligand. Overall, the work provides a quantitative
assessment of the role that solvent plays in facilitating the recognition
process involving hydrophobic cavity.

challenge for instructors to handle the pronunciation needs of language
learners. There are relatively scarce pedagogical tools for pronunciation
teaching and learning. Unlike inefficient, traditional pronunciation
instructions like listening and repeating, electronic visual feedback (EVF)
systems such as ultrasound technology have been employed in new approaches.
Recently, an ultrasound-enhanced multimodal method has been developed for
visualizing tongue movements of a language learner overlaid on the face-side of
the speaker's head. That system was evaluated for several language courses via
a blended learning paradigm at the university level. The result was asserted
that visualizing the articulator's system as biofeedback to language learners
will significantly improve articulation learning efficiency. In spite of the
successful usage of multimodal techniques for pronunciation training, it still
requires manual works and human manipulation. In this article, we aim to
contribute to this growing body of research by addressing difficulties of the
previous approaches by proposing a new comprehensive, automatic, real-time
multimodal pronunciation training system, benefits from powerful artificial
intelligence techniques. The main objective of this research was to combine the
advantages of ultrasound technology, three-dimensional printing, and deep
learning algorithms to enhance the performance of previous systems. Our
preliminary pedagogical evaluation of the proposed system revealed a
significant improvement in flexibility, control, robustness, and autonomy.

redshift range of $z\in[1.2, 2.3]$. These measurements are enabled by the
synergy of slitless spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared
channels and the lensing magnification from foreground galaxy clusters. Our
sample consists of 76 galaxies with stellar mass ranging from 10$^7$ to
10$^{10}$ $M_\odot$, instantaneous star-formation rate in the range of [1, 100]
$M_\odot$/yr, and global metallicity [$\frac{1}{12}$, 2] solar. At 2-$\sigma$
confidence level, 15/76 galaxies in our sample show negative radial gradients,
whereas 7/76 show inverted gradients. Combining ours and all other metallicity
gradients obtained at similar resolution currently available in the literature,
we measure a negative mass dependence of $\Delta\log({\rm O/H})/\Delta r~
[\mathrm{dex~kpc^{-1}}] = \left(-0.020\pm0.007\right) +
\left(-0.016\pm0.008\right) \log(M_\ast/10^{9.4} M_\odot)$ with the intrinsic

mass. Our result is consistent with strong feedback, not secular processes,
being the primary governor of the chemo-structural evolution of star-forming
galaxies during the disk mass assembly at cosmic noon. We also find that the
intrinsic scatter of metallicity gradients increases with decreasing stellar
mass and increasing specific star-formation rate. This increase in the
intrinsic scatter is likely caused by the combined effect of cold-mode gas
accretion and merger-induced starbursts, with the latter more predominant in
the dwarf mass regime of $M_\ast\lesssim10^9 M_\odot$.

fundamental characteristics, their initial progenitor mass. We present our
constraints on SN progenitors derived by comparing the radial distributions of
80 SNe in the SINGG and SUNGG surveys to the R-band, Halpha, and UV light
distributions of the 55 host galaxies. The strong correlation of Type Ia SNe
with R-band light is consistent with models containing only low mass
progenitors, reflecting earlier findings. When we limit the analysis of Type II
SNe to apertures containing 90 per cent of the total flux, the radial
distribution of these SNe best traces far ultraviolet (FUV) emission,
consistent with recent direct detections indicating Type II SNe have moderately
massive red supergiant progenitors. Stripped Envelope (SE) SNe have the
strongest correlation with Halpha fluxes, indicative of very massive
progenitors (M* > 20 M_solar). This result contradicts a small, but growing,
number of direct detections of SE SN progenitors indicating they are moderately
massive binary systems. Our result is consistent, however, with a recent
population analysis suggesting binary SE SN progenitor masses are regularly
underestimated. SE SNe are centralised with respect to Type II SNe and there
are no SE SNe recorded beyond half the maximum disc radius in the optical and
one third the disc radius in the ultraviolet. The absence of SE SNe beyond
these distances is consistent with reduced massive star formation efficiencies
in the outskirts of the host galaxies.

While FaaS simplifies provisioning and scaling for application developers, it

schedulers need to handle functions that are very short-lived, have
unpredictable arrival patterns, and require expensive setup of sandboxes. The
challenge of running a large number of such functions in a multi-tenant cluster
makes existing scheduling frameworks unsuitable.
  We present Archipelago, a platform that enables low latency request execution
in a multi-tenant serverless setting. Archipelago views each application as a
DAG of functions, and every DAG in associated with a latency deadline.
Archipelago achieves its per-DAG request latency goals by: (1) partitioning a
given cluster into a number of smaller worker pools, and associating each pool
with a semi-global scheduler (SGS), (2) using a latency-aware scheduler within
each SGS along with proactive sandbox allocation to reduce overheads, and (3)
using a load balancing layer to route requests for different DAGs to the
appropriate SGS, and automatically scale the number of SGSs per DAG. Our
testbed results show that Archipelago meets the latency deadline for more than

paradigm that has evolved for dealing with this problem is data programming. An
existing data programming paradigm allows human supervision to be provided as a
set of discrete labeling functions (LF) that output possibly noisy labels to
input instances and a generative modelfor consolidating the weak labels. We
enhance and generalize this paradigm by supporting functions that output a
continuous score (instead of a hard label) that noisily correlates with labels.
We show across five applications that continuous LFs are more natural to
program and lead to improved recall. We also show that accuracy of existing
generative models is unstable with respect to initialization, training epochs,
and learning rates. We give control to the data programmer to guide the
training process by providing intuitive quality guides with each LF. We propose
an elegant method of incorporating these guides into the generative model. Our
overall method, called CAGE, makes the data programming paradigm more reliable
than other tricks based on initialization, sign-penalties, or soft-accuracy

UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) supported by a ground vehicle. Limited by UAVs'
battery life and communication distance, complete coverage of large areas
typically involves multiple take-offs and landings to recharge batteries, and
the transportation of UAVs between operation areas by a ground vehicle. In this
paper, we introduce a novel large-area-coverage planning framework which
collectively optimizes the paths for aerial and ground vehicles. Our method
first partitions a large area into sub-areas, each of which a given fleet of

are then generated for each sub-area. Next, the assignment of trials to
different UAVs and the order in which UAVs visit their assigned trails are
simultaneously optimized to minimize the total UAV flight distance. Finally, a
ground vehicle transportation path which visits all sub-areas is found by
solving an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Although finding the
globally optimal trail assignment and transition paths can be formulated as a
Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), the MIQP is intractable even for small

their increasing connectivity and range of functionality. Such increased attack
vectors enable adversaries to access a vehicle Electronic Control Unit (ECU).
As of today in-vehicle access can cause drastic consequences, because the most
commonly used in-vehicle bus technology, the Controller Area Network (CAN),
lacks sender identification. With low limits on bandwidth and payload, as well
as resource constrains on hardware, usage of cryptographic measures is limited.
As an alternative, sender identification methods were presented, identifying
the sending ECU on the basis of its analog message signal. While prior works
showed promising results on the security and feasibility for those approaches,
the potential changes in signals over a vehicle's lifetime have only been
partly addressed. This paper closes this gap. We conduct a 4~months measurement
campaign containing more than 80,000 frames from a real vehicle. The data
reflects different driving situations, different seasons and weather
conditions, a 19-week break, and a car repair altering the physical CAN
properties. We demonstrate the impact of temperature dependencies, analyze the
signal changes and define strategies for their handling. In the evaluation, the
identification rate can be increased from 91.23% to 99.98% by a targeted
updating of the system parameters. At the same time, the detection of
intrusions can be improved from 76.83% to 99.74%, while no false positives
occured during evaluation. Lastly, we show how to increase the overall
performance of such systems by double monitoring the bus at different
positions.

often such tuples are found in unstructured text. There may be multiple
relation tuples present in a text and they may share one or both entities among

sharing of entities or overlapping entities among the tuples makes it more
challenging. Most prior work adopted a pipeline approach where entities were
identified first followed by finding the relations among them, thus missing the

two approaches to use encoder-decoder architecture for jointly extracting
entities and relations. In the first approach, we propose a representation
scheme for relation tuples which enables the decoder to generate one word at a
time like machine translation models and still finds all the tuples present in
a sentence with full entity names of different length and with overlapping

tends to be highly laborious and time-consuming. However, by systematically
capturing and analyzing the feedback patterns of human users, vital information
concerning the multimedia contents can be harvested for effective indexing and
subsequent search. By learning from the human judgment and mental evaluation of
users, effective search indices can be gradually developed and built up, and
subsequently be exploited to find the most relevant multimedia objects. To
avoid hovering around a local maximum, we apply the epsilon-greedy method to
systematically explore the search space. Through such methodic exploration, we
show that the proposed approach is able to guarantee that the most relevant

overlooked or not regarded as relevant. The search behavior of the present

performed which show good agreement with the theoretical findings. The present

observed that, for any oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, we have
$\chi_p(\overrightarrow{G}) \leq \chi_o(\overrightarrow{G}) \leq 2

is dedicated to the pushable chromatic number of oriented graphs fulfilling
particular degree conditions. For all $\Delta \geq 29$, we first prove that the
maximum value of the pushable chromatic number of an oriented graph with
maximum degree $\Delta$ lies between $2^{\frac{\Delta}{2}-1}$ and $(\Delta-3)

degree less than~$3$ lies between~$5$ and~$6$. The former upper bound of~$7$
also holds as an upper bound on the pushable chromatic number of planar

properties for algebraic representatives along separable field extensions. In

both the general knowledge shared across domains and the particular knowledge

standard neural machine translation (NMT) model, trained on mixed-domain data,
generally captures the general knowledge, but misses the domain-specific
knowledge. In response to this problem, we augment NMT model with additional
domain transformation networks to transform the general representations to
domain-specific representations, which are subsequently fed to the NMT decoder.
To guarantee the knowledge transformation, we also propose two complementary
supervision signals by leveraging the power of knowledge distillation and
adversarial learning. Experimental results on several language pairs, covering
both balanced and unbalanced multi-domain translation, demonstrate the
effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach. Encouragingly, the
proposed unified model achieves comparable results with the fine-tuning
approach that requires multiple models to preserve the particular knowledge.
Further analyses reveal that the domain transformation networks successfully
capture the domain-specific knowledge as expected.

string around charged black brane with hyperscaling violation (HV). The Hawking
temperature, Lifshitz dynamical exponent and HV exponent together affect the
chaotic dynamics of this system. The temperature plays the role of driving the
closed string to escape to infinity. There is a threshold value $z_{\ast}=2$,
below which the string is captured by the black brane no matter where the
string is placed at the beginning. However, when $z>2$, the string escapes to
infinity if it is placed near the black brane at the beginning, but if the
initial position of string is far away from the black brane, it oscillates
around the black brane till eternity, which is a quasi-periodic motion. HV
exponent plays the role of driving the string falling into the black brane.
With the increase of HV exponent $\theta$, the falling velocity becomes faster.
We find that when we heat the system with large HV exponent, the chaotic system
does not essentially changes. It indicates that the HV exponent plays a very
important role in determining the state of the chaotic system. Also we study
the the effect from the winding number of the string. The study indicates that
the chaotic dynamics of the string is insensitive to the winding number.

of nebular HeII emission, which is observed in many low metallicity galaxies,
both in UV and optical spectra. Several possible explanations have been
proposed in the literature, including Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, binaries, very

estimate if it can drive significant volcanic activity at HD3167b and shown
that for some magnetic fields the heating can be substantial. HD3167 is an
ideal target to search for the exosphere of a planet, and signs of volcanic

different quantum numbers $S = 1/2, 1, 3/2$, as well as of chains consisting of
classical spins. Based on this comparison as well as by analyzing the
statistics of energy-level spacings, we show that the putative many-body
localization transition is shifted to considerably stronger values of disorder
for increasing $S$. In this context, we introduce an effective disorder
strength $W_\text{eff}$, which provides a mapping between the dynamics for
different spin quantum numbers. For small $W_\text{eff}$, we show that the
real-time correlations become essentially independent of $S$, and are moreover
very well captured by the dynamics of classical spins. Especially for $S =
3/2$, the agreement between quantum and classical dynamics is remarkably
observed even for very strong values of disorder. This behavior also reflects
itself in the corresponding spectral functions, which are obtained via a
Fourier transform from the time to the frequency domain. As an aside, we also
comment on the self-averaging properties of the correlation function at weak

which has been of great interest in the area of theoretical and experimental
physics. The multiplicity distribution of particles produced in pp collisions
and the multiplicity dependence of various global event features serve as
rudimentary observables which reflect the features of the inherent dynamics of
the process of particle production. Recent availability of dimuon data has
triggered spur of interests in revisiting strong interaction process, the study
of which in detail is extremely important for enhancement of our understanding
on not only the theory of strong interaction but also possible physics
scenarios beyond the standard model. Numerous papers have come up where
background of production process of dimuon in pp collision has been discussed
and analyzed particularly for production of dimuon from {\gamma}{\gamma}
interaction. Apart from conventional approaches the present authors proposed a
new approach with successful application in context of symmetry scaling in AA
collision data from ALICE, pp collisions at 8TeV from CMS and so on. The
different approach essentially analyses fluctuation pattern from the
perspective of symmetry scaling or degree of self-similarity involved in the
process. The proposed methods of analysis using pseudorapidity values of
di-muon data taken from the primary dataset of RunA(2011)-7TeV and
RunB(2012)-8TeV of the pp collision from CMS, reveal that pseudorapidity spaces
corresponding to different ranges of rapidity are highly scale-free and the
scaling pattern changes from one rapidity range to another at both energy.
Also, the degree of cross-correlation between rapidity and azimuthal space has
been found to follow the similar behavior.

modules such as backbone, feature fusion neck, RPN and RCNN head, where each

computational cost and accuracy trade-off for the structural combination as
well as the modular selection of multiple modules? Neural architecture search
(NAS) has shown great potential in finding an optimal solution. Existing NAS
works for object detection only focus on searching better design of a single
module such as backbone or feature fusion neck, while neglecting the balance of
the whole system. In this paper, we present a two-stage coarse-to-fine
searching strategy named Structural-to-Modular NAS (SM-NAS) for searching a
GPU-friendly design of both an efficient combination of modules and better
modular-level architecture for object detection. Specifically, Structural-level
searching stage first aims to find an efficient combination of different
modules; Modular-level searching stage then evolves each specific module and
pushes the Pareto front forward to a faster task-specific network. We consider
a multi-objective search where the search space covers many popular designs of
detection methods. We directly search a detection backbone without pre-trained
models or any proxy task by exploring a fast training from scratch strategy.
The resulting architectures dominate state-of-the-art object detection systems

multiple detection datasets, e.g. halving the inference time with additional 1%
mAP improvement compared to FPN and reaching 46% mAP with the similar inference

aims to infer the reflectance and shading of the scene. It is challenging since
it needs to separate one image into two components. To tackle this,
conventional methods introduce various priors to constrain the solution, yet
with limited performance. Meanwhile, the problem is typically solved by
supervised learning methods, which is actually not an ideal solution since
obtaining ground truth reflectance and shading for massive general natural
scenes is challenging and even impossible. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition framework, which relies on neither
labeled training data nor hand-crafted priors. Instead, it directly learns the
latent feature of reflectance and shading from unsupervised and uncorrelated
data. To enable this, we explore the independence between reflectance and
shading, the domain invariant content constraint and the physical constraint.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real image datasets demonstrate
consistently superior performance of the proposed method.

show important properties of the dynamical torsion: it is invariant under
deformations among contact Anosov flows, it is holomorphic in the
representation and it has the same logarithmic derivative as some refined
combinatorial torsion of Turaev. This shows that the ratio between this torsion
and the Turaev torsion is locally constant on the space of acyclic
representations.
  In particular, for contact Anosov flows path connected to the geodesic flow
of some hyperbolic manifold among contact Anosov flows, we relate the leading
term of the Laurent expansion of $\zeta$ at the origin, the Reidemeister
torsion and the torsions of the finite dimensional complexes of the generalized
resonant states of both flows for the resonance $0$. This extends previous work

using at least two linear segments, is a popular tool for examining nonlinear
change patterns. Among such models, the linear-linear piecewise change pattern
is the most straightforward one. An earlier study has proved that other than
the intercept and slopes, the knot (or change-point), at which two linear
segments join together, can be estimated as a growth factor in a
reparameterized longitudinal model in the latent growth curve modeling
framework. However, the reparameterized coefficients were no longer directly
related to the underlying developmental process and therefore lacked
meaningful, substantive interpretation, although they were simple functions of
the original parameters. This study proposes transformation matrices between
parameters in the original and reparameterized models so that the interpretable
coefficients directly related to the underlying change pattern can be derived
from reparameterized ones. Additionally, the study extends the existing
linear-linear piecewise model to allow for individual measurement occasions,
and investigates predictors for the individual-differences in change patterns.
We present the proposed methods with simulation studies and a real-world data
analysis. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method can
generally provide an unbiased and consistent estimation of model parameters of
interest and confidence intervals with satisfactory coverage probabilities. An
empirical example using longitudinal mathematics achievement scores shows that
the model can estimate the growth factor coefficients and path coefficients
directly related to the underlying developmental process, thereby providing
meaningful interpretation. For easier implementation, we also provide the
corresponding code for the proposed models.

spaces can provide controllable image translation/ manipulation. In this paper,
we propose a framework to enable utilizing discrete multi-labels to control
which features to be disentangled, i.e., disentangling label-specific
fine-grained features for image manipulation (dubbed DLGAN). By mapping the
discrete label-specific attribute features into a continuous prior
distribution, we leverage the advantages of both discrete labels and reference
images to achieve image manipulation in a hybrid fashion. For example, given a
face image dataset (e.g., CelebA) with multiple discrete fine-grained labels,
we can learn to smoothly interpolate a face image between black hair and blond
hair through reference images while immediately controlling the gender and age
through discrete input labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that realizes such a hybrid manipulation within a single model. More
importantly, it is the first work to achieve image interpolation between two
different domains without requiring continuous labels as the supervision.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

balls, suitably defined, around these codewords covers an entire space.
Generally, the goal is to find the covering code with the minimum size
codebook. While most prior work on covering codes has focused on the Hamming
metric, we consider the problem of designing covering codes defined in terms of
either insertions or deletions. First, we provide new sphere-covering lower
bounds on the minimum possible size of such codes. Then, we provide new
existential upper bounds on the size of optimal covering codes for a single
insertion or a single deletion that are tight up to a constant factor. Finally,
we derive improved upper bounds for covering codes using $R\geq 2$ insertions
or deletions. We prove that codes exist with density that is only a factor $O(R
\log R)$ larger than the lower bounds for all fixed~$R$. In particular, our
upper bounds have an optimal dependence on the word length, and we achieve
asymptotic density matching the best known bounds for Hamming distance covering
codes.

the possible outcomes, their utilities and their opponents' utilities. Our
models and the ARA solutions are general and can be applied to most insider

first one, the source is the product of two spatial and temporal terms, and we
prove that both of them can be retrieved by knowledge of one arbitrary internal

the first term of the product varies with one fixed space variable, while the
second one is a function of all the remaining space variables and the time
variable, and we show that both terms are uniquely determined by two arbitrary
lateral measurements of the solution over the entire time span. These two
source identification results boil down to a weak unique continuation principle
in the first case and a unique continuation principle for Cauchy data in the
second one, that are preliminarily established. Finally, numerical
reconstruction of spatial term of source terms in the form of the product of

topics in the community of pattern recognition, and the recently proposed
non-negative representation based classification (NRC) achieved impressive
recognition results in various classification tasks. However, NRC ignores the
relationship between the coding and classification stages. Moreover, there is
no regularization term other than the reconstruction error term in the
formulation of NRC, which may result in unstable solution leading to
misclassification. To overcome these drawbacks of NRC, in this paper, we
propose a class-specific residual constraint non-negative representation (CRNR)
for pattern classification. CRNR introduces a class-specific residual
constraint into the formulation of NRC, which encourages training samples from
different classes to competitively represent the test sample. Based on the
proposed CRNR, we develop a CRNR based classifier (CRNRC) for pattern
classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
the superiority of CRNRC over conventional RBCM as well as the recently
proposed NRC. Moreover, CRNRC works better or comparable to some

they rely on their experience and on reference works. We have developed two
complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images
captured on site. One method relies on the shape of the fracture outline of a
sherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the
outline-identification tool, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed,
one that integrates shape information from points along the inner and outer
surfaces. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard
architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the
classifiers required tackling challenges that arise when working with
real-world archeological data: paucity of labeled data; extreme imbalance
between instances of the different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting
rare classes and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some
classes. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using
synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple
data-augmentation techniques. A novel form of training loss allowed us to
overcome the problems caused by under-populated classes and non-homogeneous
distribution of discriminative features.

shear instability, usually explained as the result of a resonance between a
gravity wave and a vorticity wave. Historically, it has been studied by linear
stability analyses at infinite Reynolds number, $Re$, and by direct numerical
simulations at relatively low $Re$ in the regions known to be unstable from the
inviscid linear stability results. In this paper, we perform linear stability
analyses of the classical `Hazel model' of a stratified shear layer (where the
background velocity and density distributions are assumed to take the
functional form of hyperbolic tangents with different characteristic vertical
scales) over a range of different parameters at finite $Re$, finding new
unstable regions of parameter space. In particular, we find instability when
the Richardson number is everywhere greater than $1/4$, where the flow would be
stable at infinite $Re$ by the Miles-Howard theorem. We find unstable modes
with no critical layer, and show that despite the necessity of viscosity for
the new instability, the growth rate relative to diffusion of the background
profile is maximised at large $Re$. We use these results to shed new light on
the wave-resonance and over-reflection interpretations of stratified shear
instability. We argue for a definition of Holmboe instability as being
characterised by propagating vortices above or below the shear layer, as
opposed to any reference to sharp density interfaces.

while the receiver may have genie-provided CSI (coherent receiver), or the

is no gap between the coherent capacity and the non-coherent capacity in terms
of capacity scaling behavior. On the other hand, when the bandwidth is larger
than this threshold, there is a capacity scaling gap. Since achievable rates
using pilot symbols for channel estimation are subject to the non-coherent

phase. Interestingly, for closed in phase orbits, the geometric phase must be
quantized to $2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, else the superposition vanishes. This
corresponds to exact Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization. The maximum of the
Husimi-Kano $Q$ quasiprobability distribution is used to diagnose where in

generator eigenstate is constant along each orbit. We conjecture that the
maximum of the $Q$ function corresponds to these privileged in phase orbits. We
provide some intuition for this proposition using interference in phase space,

five times higher than `maximum' (i.e. Eddington-limited) starbursts, implying
a highly transient phase. The estimated outflow rate is
$\sim500$M$_{\odot}$year$^{-1}$, which is much lower than the SFR, implying
that in this extreme starburst the outflow capabilities saturate and the
outflow is no longer capable of regulating star formation, resulting in a
runaway process in which star formation will use up all available gas in less
than 30Myr. Finally, while previous kinematic investigations of this source
revealed possible evidence for an ongoing major merger, the coincidence of the
hyper-compact starburst and high-excitation water absorption indicates that

level? Which research directions do these gaps suggest?
  Method: 54 expert interviews with senior members of the ICSE community,
evaluated qualitatively using elements of Grounded Theory Methodology.
  Results: Our understanding of complexity, of good-enoughness, and of
developers' strengths is underdeveloped. Some other relevant factors' relevance

training data as it learns on mini-batches iteratively and is independent of
the training set size. Thirdly, motivated by our relative weight analysis,
seamless sample reweighting is incorporated. It rescales samples' gradients to

therefrom, resulting in an action similar to that of the Euclidean operator

which leads to a generic enlargement of the superselection sectors. We conclude
with an explanation of the mechanism that prevents this enlargement in the

equivalence of objects in the Fukaya category. However, there are currently no
known non-trivial examples of monotone Lagrangian cobordisms with two ends. We
look at an extension of their theory to the pearly model of Lagrangian Floer
cohomology and unobstructed Lagrangian cobordisms. In particular, we examine
the suspension cobordism of a Hamiltonian isotopy and the Haug mutation
cobordism between mutant Lagrangian surfaces. In both cases, we show that these
Lagrangian cobordisms can be unobstructed by bounding cochain and additionally
induce an $A_\infty$ homomorphism between the Floer cohomology of the ends.
This gives a first example of a two-ended Lagrangian cobordism giving a
non-trivial equivalence of Lagrangian Floer cohomology.
  A brief computation is also included which shows that the incorporation of
bounding cochain from this equivalence accounts for the ""instanton-corrections""
considered by Auroux, Ekholm, Pascaleff, Rizell, and Tonkonog for the
wall-crossing formula between Chekanov and product tori in $(\mathbb

in which the operating points are within the operating constraints. In
consideration of uncertain varying topology changes with ESSR, the resilience
enhancement problem is built as a bilevel programming optimization model, in
which the system operators deploy the optimal strategy against the most
threatening scenario caused by the extreme weather events. To avoid the curse

To date, there are ~60 known bCSPNe. However, both theory and observation
indicates that this represents only the tip of the iceberg, with the Galactic
PN population hosting orders of magnitude more. We are involved in a search for
new bCSPNe to enhance the statistical validation of the key role of binarity in
the formation and shaping of PNe. New discoveries of bCSPNe and their
characterization carry important implications not only for understanding PN
evolution, but also for studying binary evolution and the poorly-understood
common-envelope phase. We used data from the TESS satellite to search for
variability in the eight CSPNe that belong to the two-minute cadence
preselected targets in Cycle 1, with their available pipeline-extracted light
curves. We identified strong periodicities and analysed them in the context of
the binary scenario.All the CSPNe but one (Abell15) show clear signs of
periodic variability in TESS. The cause of this variability can be attributed
to different effects, some of them requiring the presence of a companion star.
We find simple sinusoidal modulations in several of the systems, compatible
with irradiation effects. In addition, two of the central stars (PG1034+001 and
NGC5189) also show photometric variations due to ellipsoidal variations and
other signs of variability probably caused by star spots or relativistic
Doppler-beaming. The case of the well-studied Helix Nebula is of particular
interest: here we constructed a series of binary models to explain the
modulations we see in the light curve. We find that the variability constrains
the possible companion to be very low-mass main-sequence star or sub-stellar
object. We also identify, in substantial detail, the individual pulsation
frequencies of NGC246.

guarantee equilibrium existence (and thus related fairness guarantees) in
markets with multiple items. We complement our results in [Babaioff et al.,

preferences, establishing positive results for small numbers of items and
mapping the limits of our approach. We then consider cardinal preferences,
define a hierarchy of such preference classes and establish relations among

prove Hadwiger's Conjecture for the class of uniquely optimally colorable

Here, we aim to identify and study a sample of He II $\lambda 1640$-emitting

survey.. We identified a total of 33 Bright He II emitters (S/N > 2.5) and 17
Faint emitters (S/N < 2.5) in the VANDELS survey and used the available deep
multi-wavelength data to study their physical properties. After identifying
seven potential AGNs in our sample and discarding them from further analysis,
we divided the sample of \emph{Bright} emitters into 20 \emph{Narrow} (FWHM <
1000 km s$^{-1}$) and 6 \emph{Broad} (FWHM > 1000 km s$^{-1}$) He II emitters.
We created stacks of Faint, Narrow, and Broad emitters and measured other
rest-frame UV lines such as O III] and C III] in both individual galaxies and
stacks. We then compared the UV line ratios with the output of stellar
population-synthesis models to study the ionising properties of He II emitters.
We do not see a significant difference between the stellar masses,
star-formation rates, and rest-frame UV magnitudes of galaxies with He II and
no He II emission. The stellar population models reproduce the observed UV line
ratios from metals in a consistent manner, however they under-predict the total
number of \heii ionising photons, confirming earlier studies and suggesting
that additional mechanisms capable of producing He II are needed, such as X-ray
binaries or stripped stars. The models favour subsolar metallicities
($\sim0.1Z_\odot$) and young stellar ages ($10^6 - 10^7$ years) for the He II
emitters. However, the metallicity measured for He II emitters is comparable to
that of non-He II emitters at similar redshifts. We argue that galaxies with He
II emission may have undergone a recent star-formation event, or may be powered
by additional sources of He II ionisation.

attention due to its impressive performance in various pattern classification

propose a locality constraint dictionary learning with support vector
discriminative term (LCDL-SV), in which the locality information is preserved
by employing the graph Laplacian matrix of the learned dictionary. To jointly
learn a classifier during the training phase, a support vector discriminative
term is incorporated into the proposed objective function. Moreover, in the
classification stage, the identity of test data is jointly determined by the
regularized residual and the learned multi-class support vector machine.
Finally, the resulting optimization problem is solved by utilizing the
alternative strategy. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method over previous dictionary learning

induces Hall anisotropic conduction, phase-space Landau-level quantization and,
if sufficiently strong, interferes with prominent QCD phenomena such as
dynamical quark mass generation, likely affecting the quark matter electrical
conductivity, which depends strongly on the quark masses. To address these
issues, we used a quasi-particle description of quark matter in which the
electric charge carriers are constituent quarks with temperature- and
magnetic-field-dependent masses predicted by a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The
model accurately describes recent lattice QCD results showing magnetic
catalysis at low temperatures and inverse magnetic catalysis at temperatures
close to the pseudo-critical temperature ($T_{\rm pc}$) of the QCD phase
transition. We found that the magnetic field increases the conductivity
component parallel to it and decreases the transverse component, in qualitative
agreement with recent lattice QCD results. In addition, we found that: (1)~the
space anisotropy of the conductivity increases with~$B$, (2)~the longitudinal
conductivity increases due to phase-space Landau-level quantization, (3)~a
lowest Landau level approximation behaves poorly for temperatures close to
$T_{\rm pc}$, and (5)~inverse magnetic catalysis leaves a distinctive signal in
all components of the conductivity, a prominent peak at $T_{\rm pc}$. Our study
adds to the existing body of work on the hot quark matter electrical

against such adversarial attacks is an active research area, with some
approaches proposing robust models that are immune to such adversaries, while
other techniques attempt to detect such adversarial inputs. In this paper, we
present a novel statistical approach for adversarial detection in image
classification. Our approach is based on constructing a per-class feature
distribution and detecting adversaries based on comparison of features of a
test image with the feature distribution of its class. For this purpose, we
make use of various statistical distances such as ED (Energy Distance), MMD
(Maximum Mean Discrepancy) for adversarial detection, and analyze the
performance of each metric. We experimentally show that our approach achieves
good adversarial detection performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets

effective way to improve the service evaluation is to hire fake rating

first proposed. So far, most sound zone control methods rely on either an
optimization of physical metrics such as acoustic contrast and signal
distortion or a mode decomposition of the desired sound field. By using these
types of methods, approximately 15 dB of acoustic contrast between the
reproduced sound field in the target zone and its leakage to other zone(s) has
been reported in practical set-ups, but this is typically not high enough to
satisfy the people inside the zones. In this paper, we propose a sound zone
control method shaping the leakage errors so that they are as inaudible as
possible for a given acoustic contrast. The shaping of the leakage errors is
performed by taking the time-varying input signal characteristics and the human
auditory system into account when the loudspeaker control filters are
calculated. We show how this shaping can be performed using variable span
trade-off filters, and we show theoretically how these filters can be used for
trading signal distortion in the target zone for acoustic contrast. The
proposed method is evaluated based on physical metrics such as acoustic
contrast and perceptual metrics such as STOI. The computational complexity and
processing time of the proposed method for different system set-ups are also
investigated. Lastly, the results of a MUSHRA listening test are reported. The

transform. It does not take into account the complex Fourier phase and defines
Gaussian maximum entropy models. We introduce a general family of phase
harmonic covariance moments, which rely on complex phases to capture
non-Gaussian properties. They are defined as the covariance of $\hat{H} (L X)$,
where $L$ is a complex linear operator and $\hat{H} $ is a non-linear phase
harmonic operator which multiplies the phase of each complex coefficient by
integers. The operator $\hat{H} (L X)$ can also be calculated from rectifiers,
which relates $\hat{H} (L X)$ to neural network coefficients. If $L$ is a
Fourier transform then the covariance is a sparse matrix whose non-zero
off-diagonal coefficients capture dependencies between frequencies. These
coefficients have similarities with high order moment, but smaller statistical
variabilities because $\hat{H} (L X)$ is Lipschitz. If $L$ is a complex wavelet
transform then off-diagonal coefficients reveal dependencies across scales,
which specify the geometry of local coherent structures. We introduce maximum
entropy models conditioned by these wavelet phase harmonic covariances. The
precision of these models is numerically evaluated to synthesize images of
turbulent flows and other stationary processes.

can be obtained from 8.5 GHz to 11 GHz with a 25.6% fractional bandwidth (FBW),
and the bandwidth of reflection below -10 dB is up to 92% from 5.6 GHz to 15.13

bands (5.66-6.9 GHz and 12.8-15.2GHz) with the polarization conversion ratio
over 90%. Besides, by arranging the proposed structure in a checkerboard-like
distribution, the backward scattering energy can be reduced in a wide frequency
band ranging from 4 to 16 GHz. Both simulation and experimental results are in
good agreements, which demonstrates our design strategy. Compared with the
conventional polarization conversion designs, the proposed design presents an
extra frequency-selective performance and hence can be applied to various
practical situations, for instance, working as radomes to transmit the in-band
signals with high-efficiency while keeping low-backward scattering for the

heliosphere are similar in strength. This led the authors of these observations
to hypothesize that the heliosphere is bubble-like rather than comet-like,
meaning that it has no extended tail. We investigate the directional
distribution of the ENA flux for a wide energy range (3--88 keV) including the
observations from IBEX (Interstellar Boundary Explorer), INCA (Ion and Neutral
Camera, on board Cassini), and HSTOF (High energy Suprathermal Time Of Flight
sensor, on board SOHO, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory). An essential
element is the model of pickup ion acceleration at the termination shock (TS)
proposed by Zank. We use state of the art models of the global heliosphere,
interstellar neutral gas density, and pickup ion distributions. The results,
based on the ""comet-like"" model of the heliosphere, are close in flux magnitude
to ENA observations by IBEX, HSTOF and partly by INCA (except for the 5.2-13.5
keV energy channel). We find that the ENA flux from the tail dominates at high
energy (in agreement with HSTOF, but not INCA). At low energy, our comet-like
model produces the similar strengths of the ENA fluxes from the upwind and
downwind directions, which, therefore, removes this as a compelling argument
for a bubble-like heliosphere.

The event was discovered at radio wavelengths, and was followed at soft X-ray
energies by observatories, such as XPNAV and NICER. aims: This work aims to
compare the glitch behavior at the two wavelengths mentioned above. Preliminary
work in this regard has been done by the X-ray satellite XPNAV. NICER with its
far superior sensitivity is expected to reveal much more detailed behavior.
methods: NICER has accumulated more than $301$ kilo seconds of data on the Crab
pulsar, equivalent to more than $3.3$ billion soft X-ray photons. These data
were first processed using the standard NICER analysis pipeline. Then the
arrival times of the X-ray photons were referred to the solar system's
barycenter. Then specific analysis was done to study the specific behavior
outlined in the following sections, while taking dead time into account.
results: The variation of the rotation frequency of the Crab pulsar and its
time derivative during the glitch is almost exactly similar at the radio and
X-ray energies. The following properties of the Crab pulsar remain essentially
constant before and after the glitch: the total X-ray flux; the flux, widths,
and peaks of the two components of its integrated profile; and the soft X-ray
spectrum. There is no evidence for giant pulses at X-ray energies. However, the
timing noise of the Crab pulsar shows quasi sinusoidal variation before the
glitch, with increasing amplitude, which is absent after the glitch.
conclusions: Even the strongest glitch in the Crab pulsar appears not to affect
all but one of the properties mentioned above, at either frequency. The fact
that the timing noise appears to change due to the glitch is an important clue
to unravel as this is still an unexplained phenomenon.

gas must be at temperatures of $\sim 1$ keV and have an optical depth of
$\tau_{\mathrm{T}}\approx 10$--$20$. We present one-dimensional calculations of
the physical conditions and emitted spectra of a $\tau_{\mathrm{T}}=10$ or $20$
gas layer subject to illumination from an X-ray power-law (from above), a
blackbody (from below) and a variable amount of internal heating. The models
show that a warm corona with $kT \sim 1$ keV can develop, producing a strong
Comptonized soft excess, but only if the internal heating flux is within a
relatively narrow range. Similarly, if the gas density of the layer is too
large then efficient cooling will stop a warm corona from forming. The
radiation from the hard X-ray power-law is crucial in producing a warm corona,
indicating that a warm and hot corona may co-exist in AGN accretion discs, and
their combined effect leads to the observed soft excess. Intense heating of a
warm corona leads to steep X-ray spectra with ionised Fe K$\alpha$ lines,
similar to those seen in some narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.

to testing sets of null hypotheses of the form ""the average of this list is not

social choice functions include majority, super-majority, plurality,
multi-winner plurality, Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Borda count, approval
voting, and STAR-Voting, among others. The audit stops without a full hand
count iff all the null hypotheses are rejected. The nulls can be tested in many
ways. Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling
risk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.
Ballot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion
that the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,
that null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot
polling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.
SHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits
for two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested
are both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while
previous methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and
(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation. The SHANGRLA abstraction
simplifies stratified audits, including audits that combine ballot polling with
ballot-level comparisons, producing sharper audits than the ""SUITE"" approach.
SHANGRLA works with the ""phantoms to evil zombies"" strategy to treat missing
ballot cards and missing or redacted cast vote records. That also facilitates
sampling from ""ballot-style manifests,"" which can dramatically improve
efficiency when the audited contests do not appear on every ballot card.

time-varying convex optimization problems to solve dynamic programs arising
from Model Predictive Control. In particular, the prediction step tracks the
evolution of the optimal solution of the problem which depends on the current
state of the system. The cost of said step is that of inverting one Hessian and
it guarantees, under some conditions, that the iterate remains in the quadratic
convergence region of the optimization problem at the next time step. These
conditions imply (i) that the variation of the state in a control interval
cannot be too large and that (ii) the solution computed in the previous time
step needs to be sufficiently accurate. The latter can be guaranteed by running
classic Newton iterations, which we term correction steps. Since this method
exhibits quadratic convergence the number of iterations to achieve a desired
accuracy $\eta$ is of order $\log_2\log_2 1/\eta$, where the cost of each
iteration is approximately that of inverting a Hessian. This grants the
prediction-correction control law low computational complexity. In addition,
the solution achieved by the algorithm is such that the closed loop system
remains stable, which allows extending the applicability of Model Predictive
Control to systems with faster dynamics and less computational power. Numerical
examples where we consider nonlinear systems support the theoretical
conclusions.

provides additional opportunities to control light-matter interactions at the
single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Here, we present temperature-dependent 3D
reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction in
combination with high-resolution birefringence experiments on disk-like

isotropic liquid state and discotic stacking in linear columns as well as
circular concentric ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis.

tuneable in magnitude and in sign from positive to negative via pore size, pore
surface-grafting and temperature. Our study demonstrates that the advent of
large-scale, self-organised nanoporosity in monolithic solids along with

information that can be extracted from individual pixels of cluster images.
  Aims. We aim to create a CNN capable of inferring star cluster evolutionary,
structural, and environmental parameters from multi-band images, as well to
demonstrate its capabilities in discriminating genuine clusters from galactic
stellar backgrounds.
  Methods. A CNN based on the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture was
created and trained to infer cluster ages, masses, sizes, and extinctions, with
respect to the degeneracies between them. Mock clusters placed on M83 Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) images utilizing three photometric passbands (F336W,
F438W, and F814W) were used. The CNN is also capable of predicting the
likelihood of a cluster's presence in an image, as well as quantifying its
visibility (signal-to-noise).
  Results. The CNN was tested on mock images of artificial clusters and has
demonstrated reliable inference results for clusters of ages $\lesssim$100 Myr,
extinctions $A_V$ between 0 and 3 mag, masses between $3\times10^3$ and
$3\times10^5$ ${\rm M_\odot}$, and sizes between 0.04 and 0.4 arcsec at the

systems that provide a score for evaluating objects, including individuals. The
scores are generated by a function (mechanism) that takes a set of features as

human-designed and can be used for different decision purposes such as ranking
or classification.
  Given the potential impact of these scoring mechanisms on individuals' lives
and on society, it is important to make sure these scores are computed

this paper, focusing on linear scoring functions, we highlight the importance
of unbiased function sampling and perturbation in the function space for
devising such tools. We provide unbiased samplers for the entire function

  We then illustrate the value of these samplers for designing effective

we propose a novel approach for approximating the construction of the

arrangement in the number of dimensions, using function sampling, our algorithm
is linear in the number of samples and hyperplanes, and independent of the

concept of consensus optimization among nodes without requiring a centralized
control. Decentralized frequency consensus can be achieved through iterative
frequency exchange among nodes. We derive a model of the signal received from a
coherent distributed array and analyze the effects on beamforming of phase
errors induced by oscillator frequency drift. We introduce and discuss the
average consensus protocol for frequency transfer in undirected networks where
each node transmits and receives frequency information from other nodes. We
analyze the following cases: 1) undirected networks with a static topology; 2)
undirected networks with dynamic topology, where connections between nodes are
made and lost dynamically; and 3) undirected networks with oscillator frequency
drift. We show that all the nodes in a given network achieve average consensus
and the number of iterations needed to achieve consensus can be minimized for a
given cluster of nodes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the consensus
algorithm enables tolerable errors to obtain high coherent gain of greater that
90\% of the ideal gain in an error-free distributed phased array.

universe motivate the existence of a homogeneous Cosmic ALP Background (CAB)
with 0.1-1 keV energies analogous to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
arising via the decay of string theory moduli in the very early universe. The
coupling between the CAB ALPs traveling in cosmic magnetic fields and photons
allows ALPs to oscillate into photons and vice versa. In this work, we test the
CAB model that is put forward to explain the soft X-ray excess in the Coma
cluster due to CAB ALPs conversion into photons using the M87 jet environment.
Then we demonstrate the potential of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) jet
environment to probe low-mass ALP models, and to potentially constrain the

that the overall X-ray emission for the M87 AGN requires an ALP-photon coupling
$g_{a\gamma}$ in the range of $\sim7.50\times 10^{-15}-6.56\times 10^{-14}$
GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-13}$ eV as long as the M87 jet is
misaligned by less than about 20 degrees from the line of sight. These values
are up to an order of magnitude smaller than the current best fit value on
$g_{a\gamma}\sim 2\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ obtained in soft X-ray excess CAB
model for the Coma cluster. Our results cast doubt on the current limits of the

molecules around Sagittarius B2 with ARO 12m telescope at 3-mm wavelength.
Based on their spatial distribution, molecules can be classified as either
""extended"" that detected not only in Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), or ""compact"" that
only detected toward or near to Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M). The ""extended""
molecules including glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO), methyl formate (CH3OCHO), formic
acid (t-HCOOH), ethanol (C2H5OH) and methyl amine (CH3NH2), while the ""compact""
molecules including dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), and amino
acetonitrile (H2NCH2CN). These ""compact"" molecules are likely produced under
strong UV radiation, while ""extended"" molecules are likely formed under
low-temperature, via gas-phase or grain surface reactions. The spatial
distribution of ""warm"" CH2OHCHO at 89 GHz differ from the spatial distribution
of ""cold"" CH2OHCHO observed at 13 GHz. We found evidence for an overabundance
of CH2OHCHO compared to that expected from the gas-phase model, which indicates
that grain-surface reactions are necessary to explain the origin of CH2OHCHO in
Sagittarius B2. Grain-surface reactions are also needed to explain the
correlation between the abundances of ""cold"" CH2OHCHO and C2H5OH. These results
demonstrate the importance of grain-surface chemistry in the production of
complex organic molecules.

their current knowledge level, informs them of how much attention they should
pay to particular content or practice problems. Similarly, a machine learning
model could potentially be trained better with a scorer that ""adapts"" to its
current learning state and estimates the importance of each training data
instance. Training such an adaptive scorer efficiently is a challenging
problem; in order to precisely quantify the effect of a data instance at a
given time during the training, it is typically necessary to first complete the
entire training process. To efficiently optimize data usage, we propose a
reinforcement learning approach called Differentiable Data Selection (DDS). In
DDS, we formulate a scorer network as a learnable function of the training
data, which can be efficiently updated along with the main model being trained.
Specifically, DDS updates the scorer with an intuitive reward signal: it should
up-weigh the data that has a similar gradient with a dev set upon which we
would finally like to perform well. Without significant computing overhead, DDS
delivers strong and consistent improvements over several strong baselines on
two very different tasks of machine translation and image classification.

widely used in epidemiology and medical studies for detecting and evaluating
the statistical significance of disease hotspots. For the sake of simplicity,
the classical spatial scan statistic assumes that the observations of the
outcome variable in different locations are independent, while in practice the
data may exhibit a spatial correlation. In this article, we use spatial
autoregressive (SAR) models to account the spatial correlation in
parametric/non-parametric scan statistic. Firstly, the correlation parameter is
estimated in the SAR model to transform the outcome into a new independent
outcome over all locations. Secondly, we propose an adapted spatial scan
statistic based on this independent outcome for cluster detection. A simulation
study highlights the better performance of the proposed methods than the
classical one in presence of spatial correlation in the data. The latter shows
a sharp increase in Type I error and false-positive rate but also decreases the
true-positive rate when spatial correlation increases. Besides, our methods
retain the Type I error and have stable true and false positive rates with
respect to the spatial correlation. The proposed methods are illustrated using
a spatial economic dataset of the median income in Paris city. In this
application, we show that taking spatial correlation into account leads to the
identification of more concentrated clusters than those identified by the
classical spatial scan statistic.

outstanding performance in terms of accuracy, these approaches divide the whole
problem into standalone tasks (stereo and optical flow) addressing them with

the training procedure and requires power-hungry GPUs to infer scene flow
barely at 1 FPS. Conversely, we propose DWARF, a novel and lightweight

optical flow easily and elegantly trainable end-to-end from scratch. Moreover,
since ground truth images for full scene flow are scarce, we propose to
leverage on the knowledge learned by networks specialized in stereo or flow,
for which much more data are available, to distill proxy annotations.
Exhaustive experiments show that i) DWARF runs at about 10 FPS on a single
high-end GPU and about 1 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded at KITTI resolution,

To automate and scale this task, we use several state-of-the-art CNN

styles? (2) What may be the underlying relationships among different styles and

Inception V3 achieves a 9-class classification accuracy of 88.35%, which
outperforms the model in Elgammal et al.'s study by more than 20 percent.
Visualizations using Grad-CAM heat maps confirm that the model correctly
focuses on the characteristic parts of paintings. To help address the second

artists by extracting 512 features from the best-performing classification

patterns of development and separation among the art styles. The network
analysis also appears to show anticipated artist level connections from an art

problem, e.g. the weights in the objective function is fixed. Often, these
weights are mere estimates and increasingly machine learning techniques are
used to for their estimation. Recently, Smart Predict and Optimize (SPO) has
been proposed for problems with a linear objective function over the
predictions, more specifically linear programming problems. It takes the regret
of the predictions on the linear problem into account, by repeatedly solving it
during learning. We investigate the use of SPO to solve more realistic discrete
optimization problems. The main challenge is the repeated solving of the
optimization problem. To this end, we investigate ways to relax the problem as
well as warmstarting the learning and the solving. Our results show that even
for discrete problems it often suffices to train by solving the relaxation in
the SPO loss. Furthermore, this approach outperforms, for most instances, the
state-of-the-art approach of Wilder, Dilkina, and Tambe. We experiment with
weighted knapsack problems as well as complex scheduling problems and show for
the first time that a predict-and-optimize approach can successfully be used on
large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

Cyber insurance is a valuable mechanism to mitigate cyber risks for IoT
systems. In this work, we propose a bi-level game-theoretic framework called
FlipIn to design incentive-compatible and welfare-maximizing cyber insurance
contracts. The framework captures the strategic interactions among APT
attackers, IoT defenders, and cyber insurance insurers, and incorporates
influence networks to assess the systemic cyber risks of interconnected IoT
devices. The FlipIn framework formulates a game over networks within a

bi-level games for a network of distributed defenders and a semi-homogeneous
centralized defender and show that the optimal insurance contracts cover half

defenders and the Peltzman effect of insurance. We study a centralized security
management scenario and its decentralized counterpart, and leverage numerical
experiments to show that network connectivity plays an important role in the
security of the IoT devices and the insurability of both distributed and

fatigue (HCF) performance is critical to the lifetime estimation of beam
windows exposed to a periodic thermal stress from a pulsed proton beam. The 1st

metric for $K$-NN can be seen as minimizing the empirical risk of $K$-NN. In
this paper, we design a new type of continuous decision function of the $K$-NN
classification rule which can be used to construct the continuous empirical
risk function of $K$-NN. By minimizing this continuous empirical risk function,
we obtain a novel distance metric learning algorithm named as adaptive nearest
neighbor (ANN). We have proved that the current algorithms such as the large
margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), neighbourhood components analysis (NCA) and the
pairwise constraint methods are special cases of the proposed ANN by setting
the parameter different values. Compared with the LMNN, NCA, and pairwise
constraint methods, our method has a broader searching space which may contain
better solutions. At last, extensive experiments on various data sets are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
method.

densely at a constriction and thus cause clogging. The micro-alga
\textit{Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii} is used here as a model system to study this
phenomenon. Its negative phototaxis makes the algae swim away from a light
source and go through a microfabricated bottleneck-shaped constriction.
Successive clogging events interspersed with bursts of algae are observed. A
power law decrease is found to describe well the distribution of time lapses of
blockages. Moreover, the evacuation time is found to increase when increasing
the swimming velocity. These results might be related to the phenomenology of
crowd dynamics and in particular what has been called the Faster is Slower

of tangential solid friction between motile cells densely packed that may
accompany arches formation. Using the framework of crowd dynamics we analyze
the microswimmers behavior and in particular question the role of

theory. Indeed, many remarkable properties of string theory have been explained
using supersymmetry as a tool. In this dissertation, we review the basic
formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics starting with introducing the
concepts of supercharges and superalgebra. We show that, if there is a
supersymmetric state, it is the zero-energy ground state. If such a state
exists, the supersymmetry is unbroken otherwise it is broken. So far, there has
been no unbroken supersymmetry observed in nature, and if nature is described
by supersymmetry, it must be broken. In fact, supersymmetry may be broken
spontaneously at any order of perturbation theory, or dynamically due to
non-perturbative effects. The goal of this dissertation is to study the methods
of supersymmetry breaking. For this purpose, special attention is given to
discuss the normalization of the ground state of the supersymmetric harmonic
oscillator. Then we explain that perturbation theory gives us incorrect results
for both the ground state wave function as well as the energy spectrum and it
fails to give an explanation to the supersymmetry breaking. Later in the
dissertation, a review of the uses of instantons in quantum mechanics is given.
In particular, instantons are used to compute the tunneling effects within the
path integral approach to quantum mechanics. As a result, we give evidence that
the instantons, which are a non-perturbative effect in quantum mechanics and
can not be seen in perturbation theory, leads to calculate the corrections to
the ground state energy and provides a possible explanation for the
supersymmetry breaking.

beyond the notion of 'system'. While the first, called device-independent
approach, proposes an operational anti-metaphysical scheme in which language
plays an essential role; the second approach, takes an essentially metaphysical
path which attempts to present a new non-classical representation grounded on
intensive relations which, in turn, imposes the need to reconsider the

method, which is constructed from a cumulants correlation between outgoing

relations as a function of the transverse momentum are both shown in Pb-Pb and

  Programming via Dual Decomposition","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1506.05485",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a control algorithm for stable implementation of
asynchronous parallel quadratic programming (PQP) through dual decomposition
technique. In general, distributed and parallel optimization requires
synchronization of data at each iteration step due to the interdependency of
data. The synchronization latency may incur a large amount of waiting time
caused by an idle process during computation. We aim to mitigate this
synchronization penalty in PQP problems by implementing asynchronous updates of
the dual variable. The price to pay for adopting asynchronous computing
algorithms is the unpredictability of the solution, resulting in a tradeoff
between speedup and accuracy. In the worst case, the state of interest may
become unstable owing to the stochastic behavior of asynchrony. We investigate
the stability condition of asynchronous PQP problems by employing the switched
system framework. A formal algorithm is provided to ensure the asymptotic
stability of dual variables. Further, it is shown that the implementation of
the proposed algorithm guarantees the uniqueness of optimal solutions,
irrespective of asynchronous behavior. To verify the validity of the proposed
methods, simulation results are presented.

availability of large quantity and quality of training data. To achieve this,
various central agencies such as the government have suggested for different
data providers to pool their data together to learn a unified predictive model,
which performs better. However, these providers are usually profit-driven and
would only agree to participate inthe data sharing process if the process is
deemed both profitable and fair for themselves. Due to the lack of existing
literature, it is unclear whether a fair and stable outcome is possible in such
data sharing processes. Hence, we wish to investigate the outcomes surrounding
these scenarios and study if data providers would even agree to collaborate in
the first place. Tapping on cooperative game concepts in Game Theory, we
introduce the data sharing process between a group of agents as a new class of
cooperative games with modified definition of stability and fairness. Using
these new definitions, we then theoretically study the optimal and suboptimal
outcomes of such data sharing processes and their sensitivity to
perturbation.Through experiments, we present intuitive insights regarding
theoretical results analysed in this paper and discuss various ways in which

existing energy meters provide very little to no information regarding the
energy consumption of individual appliances apart from the aggregated power
rating, the spotting of individual appliances' energy usages by NILM will not
only provide consumers the feedback of appliance-specific energy usage but also
lead to the changes of their consumption behavior which facilitate energy
conservation. B Neenan et al. [2] have demonstrated that direct individual
appliance-specific energy usage signals lead to consumers' behavioral changes
which improves energy efficiency by as much as 15%. Upon disaggregation of an
energy signal, the signal needs to be classified according to the appropriate
appliance. Hence, the goal of this paper is to disaggregate total energy
consumption data to individual appliance signature and then classify
appliance-specific energy loads using a prominent supervised classification
method known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). To perform this operation we have
used a publicly accessible dataset of power signals from several houses known
as the REDD dataset. Before applying KNN, data is preprocessed for each device.
Then KNN is applied to check whether their energy consumption signature is
separable or not. KNN is applied with K=5.

massive collection and mining of personal data, but remains impractical due to
its large computational cost. Garbled Circuits (GC) is a protocol for
implementing SFE which can evaluate any function that can be expressed as a
Boolean circuit and obtain the result while keeping each party's input private.
Recent advances have led to a surge of garbled circuit implementations in
software for a variety of different tasks. However, these implementations are
inefficient and therefore GC is not widely used, especially for large problems.
This research investigates, implements and evaluates secure computation
generation using a heterogeneous computing platform featuring FPGAs. We have
designed and implemented SIFO: Secure computational Infrastructure using FPGA
Overlays. Unlike traditional FPGA design, a coarse grained overlay architecture
is adopted which supports mapping SFE problems that are too large to map to a
single FPGA. Host tools provided include SFE problem generator, parser and
automatic host code generation. Our design allows re-purposing an FPGA to
evaluate different SFE tasks without the need for reprogramming, and fully
explores the parallelism for any GC problem. Our system demonstrates an order
of magnitude speedup compared with an existing software platform.

development. Several novel water resources such as passive seawater solar
desalination and atmospheric water harvesting have made some progress in recent
years. However, no investigation has referred to harvesting water from shallow
subsurface soils, which are potential huge water reservoirs. Here, we introduce
a method of solar-driven water harvesting from soils, which can provide cheap
fresh water in impoverished, arid and decentralized areas. The concentrated
solar energy is used to heat the soils to evaporate the soil moisture. Then
vapors flow to the condenser through tubes and condense as freshwater.
Sustainable water harvesting is realized by water migration due to capillary
pumping effect within soils. In the laboratory condition, an experimental setup
is designed and its water-harvesting ability from soils is investigated. The
maximum water mass harvesting rate was 99.8 g h-1. In about 12 h, the total
harvesting water could be as high as about 900 ml. The whole process is
solar-driven and spontaneous without other mechanical or electrical
ancillaries. The water harvesting rate under one sun energy flux (1 kW m-2) is
estimated to be about 360 g h-1 with a 1 m2 solar concentrator. Our proposal
provides a potential onsite and sustainable fresh water supply solution to deal
with the water scarcity problem.

relationships between human and scene elements as well as causal relationships

Graph Reasoning Network (SCR-Graph), which can be used to predict human actions
by modeling the action-scene relationship, and causal relationship between
actions, in spatial and temporal dimensions respectively. Here, in spatial
dimension, a hierarchical graph attention module is designed by iteratively
aggregating the features of different kinds of scene elements in different
level. In temporal dimension, we designed a knowledge graph based causal
reasoning module and map the past actions to temporal causal features through
Diffusion RNN. Finally, we integrated the causality features into the
heterogeneous graph in the form of shadow node, and introduced a self-attention
module to determine the time when the knowledge graph information should be
activated. Extensive experimental results on the VIRAT datasets demonstrate the
favorable performance of the proposed framework.
