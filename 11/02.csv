two fundamental flavours of dynamical Dirac fermions. We focus on some of the
lightest (flavoured) spin-0 and spin-1 states. This theory provides an
ultraviolet completion for composite Higgs models based upon the SU(4)/Sp(4)
coset. We analyse the strongly coupled dynamics in isolation, without explicit
coupling to the standard model. We carry out continuum extrapolations using
dynamical ensembles generated at five different values of bare lattice
coupling, and for several values of the bare fermion mass. We fit the resulting
meson masses and decay constants to a low-energy effective field theory built
along the ideas of hidden local symmetry. We also compare our results to those
of other closely related lattice gauge theories, which have matter content
consisting of two fundamental Dirac flavours.

sensitive tests of general relativity can be devised. Black hole spectroscopy
has long been proposed as a way to test the no-hair theorem, that is, how
closely an astrophysical black hole can be described by the Kerr geometry. We
use simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes project to assess the
detectability of one extra quasinormal mode in the ringdown of a binary black
hole coalescence, with numbers $(\ell,m,n)$ distinct from the fundamental
quadrupolar mode (2,2,0). Our approach uses the complex waveform as well as the
time derivative of the phase in two prescriptions that allow us to estimate the
point at which the ringdown is best described by a single mode or by a sum of
two modes. By scaling all amplitudes to $t_{\rm peak}+10M$, our results for
non-spinning binaries indicate that for mass ratios of 1:1 to 5:1 the first
overtone (2,2,1) will always have a larger excitation amplitude than the
fundamental modes of other harmonics, making it a more promising candidate for
detection. Even though the (2,2,1) mode damps about three times faster than the
higher harmonics and its frequency is very close to that of the (2,2,0) mode,
its larger excitation amplitude still guarantees a more favorable scenario for
detection. In particular, for equal-mass binaries the ratio of the amplitude of
the first overtone (2,2,1) to the fundamental mode (2,2,0) will be $> 0.65$,
whereas the corresponding ratio for the higher harmonics will be $< 0.05$. For
binaries with mass ratios larger than 5:1 we find that the modes (2,2,1),
(2,1,0) and (3,3,0) should have comparable amplitude ratios in the range 0.3 -
0.4. The expectation that the (2,2,1) mode should be more easily detectable
than the (3,3,0) mode is confirmed with an extension of the mode resolvability
analysis for larger mass ratios.

fields. In all viable candidate field theories, a screening mechanism is
implemented to be consistent with existing tests of general relativity. The
screening effect in the symmetron theory manifests its influence only to the
thin outer layer of a bulk object, where inside a dense material the symmetry
of the field is restored and no force exists. For pointlike particles such as
atoms, the depth of screening is larger than the size of the particle, such
that the screening mechanism is ineffective and the symmetron force is fully
expressed on the atomic test particles. Extra force measurements using atom
interferometry are thus much more sensitive than bulk mass based measurements,
and indeed have placed the most stringent constraints on the parameters
characterizing symmetron field in certain region. There is however no clear
direct connection between the laboratory measurements and astrophysical
observations, where the constraints are far separated by 10 orders of magnitude
in the parameter space. In this paper, we present a closed-form expression for
the symmetron acceleration of realistic atomic experiments. The expression is
validated through numerical simulations for a terrestrial fifth-force
experiment using atom interferometry. As a result, we show the connection of
the atomic measurement constraints to the astrophysical ones. We also estimate
the attainable symmetron constraints from a previously proposed experiment in

to characterizing nearly conformal gauge theories in which lattice calculations
are used to identify the best low energy effective field theory (EFT)

realizing a geometrically regular pattern of elementary cells. In these
microstructured materials, the dispersion properties governing the free dynamic
propagation of elastic waves can be studied by formulating parametric
lagrangian models and applying the Floquet-Bloch theory. Within this framework,
governing the wave propagation by means of spectral design techniques and/or
energy dissipation mechanisms is a major issue of theoretical and applied
interest. Specifically, the wave propagation can be inhibited by purposely
designing the microstructural parameters to open band gaps in the material
spectrum at target center frequencies. Based on these motivations, a general
dynamic formulation for determining the dispersion properties of beam lattice
metamaterials, equipped with local resonators is presented. The mechanism of
local resonance is realized by tuning periodic auxiliary masses,
viscoelastically coupled with the beam lattice microstructure. As peculiar
aspect, the viscoelastic coupling is derived by a mechanical formulation based
on the Boltzmann superposition integral, whose kernel is approximated by a
Prony series. Consequently, the free propagation of damped waves is governed by
a linear homogeneous system of integral-differential equations of motion.
Therefore, differential equations of motion with frequency-dependent
coefficients are obtained by applying the bilateral Laplace transform. The
corresponding complex-valued branches characterizing the dispersion spectrum
are determined and parametrically analyzed. Particularly, the spectra

a comprehensive coalescence model that includes an extensive set of $s$ and

thermal limit of the produced hadron spectrum. By combining our hadronization
scheme with an advanced Langevin-hydrodynamics model that incorporates both
elastic and inelastic energy loss of heavy quarks inside the dynamical
quark-gluon plasma, we obtain a successful description of the
$p_\mathrm{T}$-integrated and differential $\Lambda_c/D^0$ and $D_s/D^0$ ratios
measured at RHIC and the LHC. We find that including the effect of radial flow
of the medium is essential for describing the enhanced $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratio
observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We also find that the puzzling
larger $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratio observed in Au+Au collisions at RHIC than in Pb+Pb
collisions at the LHC is due to the interplay between the effects of the QGP
radial flow and the charm quark transverse momentum spectrum at hadronization.
Our study further suggests that charmed hadrons have larger sizes in medium
than in vacuum.

wide-ranging applications across cosmology. Naively, computing it requires
repeated numerical integration to calculate the variance of the power spectrum
on different scales and determine which scales exceed the threshold for
nonlinear collapse. We accelerate this calculation by working in configuration
space and approximating the correlation function as a polynomial at $r <= 5$
$h^{-1}$ Mpc. This enables an analytic rather than numerical solution, accurate
across a variety of cosmologies to 0.1$-$1% (depending on redshift) and 10$-$20
times faster than the naive numerical method. We also present a further
acceleration (40$-$80 times faster than the naive method) in which we determine
the polynomial coefficients using a Taylor expansion in the cosmological
parameters rather than re-fitting a polynomial to the correlation function. Our
acceleration greatly reduces the cost of repeated calculation of the nonlinear
mass. This will be useful for MCMC analyses to constrain cosmological
parameters from the highly nonlinear regime, e.g. with data from upcoming

designing graphitic materials with unusual properties including predicted
high-temperature superconductivity and ferromagnetism. However, the lack of
control of the stacking sequence limits most research to the stable ABA form of
graphite. Here we demonstrate a strategy to control the stacking order using
van der Waals technology. To this end, we first visualise the distribution of
stacking domains in graphite films and then perform directional encapsulation
of ABC-rich graphite crystallites with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We found
that hBN-encapsulation which is introduced parallel to the graphite zigzag
edges preserves ABC stacking, while encapsulation along the armchair edges
transforms the stacking to ABA. The technique presented here should facilitate
new research on the important properties of ABC graphite.

model-based approach which incorporates spatial dependence and examines the
impact of a policy through a causal modeling framework. As the gross domestic
product (GDP) has been regarded as a dated measure and tool for benchmarking a
nation's economic performance, there has been a growing consensus for an
alternative measure---such as a composite `wellbeing' index---to holistically
capture a country's socioeconomic health performance. Many conventional ways of
constructing wellbeing/health indices involve combining different observable
metrics, such as life expectancy and education level, to form an index.
However, health is inherently latent with metrics actually being observable
indicators of health. In contrast to the GDP or other conventional health
indices, our approach provides a holistic quantification of the overall
`health' of a nation. We build upon the latent health factor index (LHFI)
approach that has been used to assess the unobservable ecological/ecosystem
health. This framework integratively models the relationship between metrics,
the latent health, and the covariates that drive the notion of health. In this
paper, the LHFI structure is integrated with spatial modeling and statistical
causal modeling, so as to evaluate the impact of a policy variable (mandatory

accounting for spatial dependency among the nations. We apply our model to
countries around the world using data on various metrics and potential
covariates pertaining to different aspects of societal health. The approach is

Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

initial tilt. In general we find that the planets and the disc do not remain
coplanar, in agreement with Lubow & Martin (2016) for the single planet case.
Instead, the planets and the disc undergo tilt oscillations. A high mass disc
between the two planets causes the planets and the disc to nodally precess at
the same average rate but they are generally misaligned. The amplitude of the
tilt oscillations between the planets is larger while the disc is present. We
then consider higher initial tilts using hydrodynamical simulations and explore
the possibility of the formation of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (KL) planets. We find
that the inner planet's orbit undergoes eccentricity growth for a large range
of disc masses and initial misalignments. For a low disc mass and large initial
misalignment both planets and the disc can undergo KL oscillations.
Furthermore, we find that sufficiently massive discs can cause the inner planet
to increase its inclination beyond $90^{\circ}$ and therefore to orbit the
binary in a retrograde fashion. The results have important implications for the
explanation of very eccentric planets and retrograde planets observed in
multi-planet systems.

turbulence. Its observational measurements are very challenging due to the
convolution between density and velocity and projection effects. We introduce
the projected velocity structure function, which can be generally applied to
statistical studies of both sub- and super-sonic turbulence in different
interstellar phases. It recovers the turbulent velocity spectrum from the
projected velocity field in different regimes, and when the thickness of a
cloud is less than the driving scale of turbulence, it can also be used to
determine the cloud thickness and the turbulence driving scale. By applying it
to the existing core velocity dispersion measurements of the Taurus cloud, we
find a transition from the Kolmogorov to the Burgers scaling of turbulent
velocities with decreasing length scales, corresponding to the large-scale
solenoidal motions and small-scale compressive motions, respectively. The
latter occupy a small fraction of the volume and can be selectively sampled by
clusters of cores with the typical cluster size indicated by the transition

generators play a key role for concisely representing both frequent itemsets

equivalence classes such that each class gathers the itemsets appearing in the
same subset aka objects or transactions of the given data. In this respect, we
proposed lossless reductions of the minimal generator set thanks to a new
substitution-based process. Our theoretical results are extended to the
association rule framework in order to reduce as much as possible the number of
retained rules without information loss. We then give a thorough formal study
of the related inference mechanism allowing to derive all redundant association
rules, starting from the retained ones. We also lead a thorough exploration of
the disjunctive search space, where itemsets are characterized by their
respective disjunctive supports, instead of the conjunctive ones. This
exploration is motivated by the fact that, in some applications, such
information brings richer knowledge to the end-users. To obtain a redundancy
free representation of the disjunctive search space, an interesting solution
consists in selecting a unique element to represent itemsets covering the same
set of data. Two itemsets are equivalent if their respective items cover the
same set of data. In this regard, we introduced a new operator dedicated to
this task. In each induced equivalence class, minimal elements are called
essential itemsets, while the largest one is called disjunctive closed itemset.
The introduced operator is then at the roots of new concise representations of
frequent itemsets. We also exploit the disjunctive search space to derive
generalized association rules. These latter rules generalize classic ones to
also offer disjunction and negation connectors between items, in addition to
the conjunctive one.

set of programs and scripts to compute, analyze, and visualize solutions for
the time-dependent and time-independent many-body Schr\""{o}dinger equation for
indistinguishable quantum particles. As the MCTDH-X software represents a
general solver for the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, it is applicable to a wide
range of problems in the fields of atomic, optical, molecular physics as well
as condensed matter systems. In particular, it can be used to study
light-matter interactions, correlated dynamics of electrons, as well as some
aspects related to quantum information and computing. The MCTDH-X software
solves a set of non-linear coupled working equations based on the application
of the variational principle to the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. These equations
are obtained by using an ansatz for the many-body wavefunction that is a
time-dependent expansion in a set of time-dependent many-body basis states. The
time-dependence of the basis set enables MCTDH-X to deal with quantum dynamics
at a superior accuracy as compared to, for instance, exact diagonalization
approaches. Herein, we give an introduction to the MCTDH-X software via an
easy-to-follow tutorial with a focus on accessibility. We use the double well
to illustrate the fermionization of bosonic particles, the crystallization of
fermionic particles, characteristics of the superfluid and Mott-insulator

renormalization group charges at the infrared, the logarithmic term is
different for a free Maxwell field and a Maxwell field interacting with heavy
charges. This is possible because of the presence of superselection sectors in
the IR theory. However, the correction due to the coupling with charged vacuum
fluctuations, that restores the anomaly coefficient, is independent of the
precise UV dynamics. The problem is invariant under electromagnetic duality,
and the solution requires both the existence of electric charges and magnetic
monopoles. We use a real-time operator approach but we also show how the

the low-temperature electronic and transport properties of disordered
two-dimensional (2D) materials with randomly distributed point defects

with realistic density-functional theory (DFT) descriptions of the defects and
their scattering matrix elements. From the $T$-matrix approximations to the
disorder-averaged Green's function (GF) and the collision integral in the
Boltzmann transport equation, the method allows calculations of, e.g., the
density of states (DOS) including contributions from bound defect states, the
quasiparticle spectrum and the spectral linewidth (scattering rate), and the
conductivity/mobility of disordered 2D materials. We demonstrate the method by
examining these quantities in monolayers of the archetypal 2D materials
graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) contaminated with vacancy
defects and substitutional impurity atoms. By comparing the Born and $T$-matrix
approximations, we also demonstrate a strong breakdown of the Born
approximation for defects in 2D materials manifested in a pronounced
renormalization of, e.g., the scattering rate by the higher-order $T$-matrix
method. As the $T$-matrix approximation is essentially exact for dilute
disorder, i.e., low defect concentrations ($c_\text{dis} \ll 1$) or density
($n_\text{dis}\ll A_\text{cell}^{-1}$ where $A_\text{cell}$ is the unit cell
area), our first-principles method provides an excellent framework for modeling
the properties of disordered 2D materials with defect concentrations relevant
for devices.

Despite its popularity and successful applications, its theoretical properties

is minimax optimal in the Gaussian Mixture Model with isotropic covariance
matrix, when the number of clusters is fixed and the signal-to-noise ratio is

analyze spectral clustering. On the contrary, these conditions are not needed

radially in the local comoving frame. Such radiation field is meant to
approximate the field produced by the surface of a rotating neutron star, or by
the central radiating hot corona of accreting black holes; it extends the
purely radial radiation field that we considered in a previous study. Its
angular momentum is expressed in terms of the rotation frequency and radius of
the emitting source. For the background we adopt a Kerr spacetime geometry. We
derive the equations of motion for test particles influenced by such radiation
field, recovering the classical and weak-field approximation for slow rotation.
We concentrate on solutions consisting of particles orbiting along circular
orbits off and parallel to the equatorial plane, which are stabilized by the
balance between gravitational attraction, radiation force and PR drag. Such
solutions are found to lie on a critical hypersurface, whose shape may morph
from prolate to oblate depending on the Kerr spin parameter and the luminosity,
rotation and radius of the radiating sphere. For selected parameter ranges, the
critical hypersurface intersects the radiating sphere giving rise to a bulging
equatorial region or, alternatively, two lobes above the poles. We calculate
the trajectories of test particles in the close vicinity of the critical
hypersurface for a selected set of initial parameters and analyze the spatial
and angular velocity of test particles captured on the critical hypersurface.

binary products boost the ionizing radiation of stellar populations. Accurate
predictions for binary products are needed to understand and quantify their
contribution to Cosmic Reionization.
  We investigate the contribution of stars stripped in binaries since (1) they
are, arguably, the best-understood products of binary evolution, (2) we
recently produced the first non-LTE radiative transfer calculations for the
atmospheres of these stripped stars that predict their ionizing spectra, and
(3) they are very promising sources since they boost the ionizing emission of
stellar populations at late times. This allows stellar feedback to clear the
surroundings such that a higher fraction of their photons can escape and ionize
the intergalactic medium.
  Combining our detailed predictions for the ionizing spectra with a simple
cosmic reionization model, we estimate that stripped stars contributed tens of
percent of the photons that caused cosmic reionization of hydrogen, depending
on the assumed escape fractions. More importantly, stripped stars harden the
ionizing emission. We estimate that the spectral index for the ionizing part of
the spectrum can increase to -1 compared to <-2 for single stars. At high
redshift, stripped stars and massive single stars combined dominate the
HeII-ionizing emission, but we expect active galactic nuclei drive cosmic
helium reionization.
  Further observational consequences we expect are (1) high ionization states
for the intergalactic gas surrounding stellar systems, such as CIV and SiIV and
(2) additional heating of the intergalactic medium of up to a few thousand
Kelvin. Quantifying these warrants the inclusion of accurate models for
stripped stars and other binary products in full cosmological simulations.

impact of baryons on the halo profile, and hydrodynamical N-body simulations
with cold dark matter (CDM). The SIDM model predicts a strong correlation
between the core size and the stellar surface density, and it provides the best
global fit to the data. The CDM simulations without strong baryonic feedback
effects fail to explain the large dark matter cores seen in low surface
brightness galaxies. On the other hand, with strong feedback, CDM simulations
do not produce galaxy analogs with high stellar and dark matter densities, and
therefore they have trouble in explaining the rotation curves of high surface
brightness galaxies. This implies that current feedback implementations need to
be modified. We also explicitly show how the concentration-mass and
stellar-to-halo mass relations together lead to a radial acceleration relation
(RAR) in an averaged sense, and reiterate the point that the RAR does not
capture the diversity of galaxy rotation curves in the inner regions. These

learning workload in an energy-efficient manner. Unfortunately, certain NVMs
such as phase change memory (PCM) require high voltages for correct operation.
These voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If the charge pump is
activated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,
accelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability
(NBTI) generated defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can
lower the aging rate of its CMOS devices, but makes the neuromorphic hardware
unavailable to perform computations while its charge pump is being discharged.
This negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine
learning workload being executed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to exploit workload-specific performance and lifetime trade-offs in
neuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts the precise times at which
a charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations
within a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized
NBTI reliability model to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload
execution. We use our framework to evaluate workload-specific performance and
reliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies and 2)
different charge pump discharge strategies. We show that our framework can be
used by system designers to explore performance and reliability trade-offs
early in the design of neuromorphic hardware such that appropriate
reliability-oriented design margins can be set.

included a seldom used capability, known as Enhanced Seeing Mode (ESM), that
can improve the angular resolution over a 4' x 4' field of view (FOV). In full
AO operation, FLAO provides diffraction limited (DL) capabilities over a small
(30"" x 30"") FOV. By comparison, ESM can achieve significantly enhanced
resolution, over natural seeing, across a far larger FOV. This improves
operational efficiency over standard seeing limited (SL) observations and is
applicable across a broader range of scientific targets. ESM uses 11 modes of
correction (including tip and tilt) to remove residual aberrations and jitter
which significantly improves angular resolution over the full FOV. While this
mode does not reach the DL, it can achieve uniform angular resolutions as good
as 0"".22 over the FOV. Furthermore, it allows for the use of multi-object
spectroscopy with R~10,000 or imaging with angular resolution similar to that
achieved by the Wide-Field Camera 3 infrared channel on the Hubble Space
Telescope, but powered by 11.6 meters of effective aperture in binocular mode.
As part of the on-going characterization of ESM, we have demonstrated that even
in poor seeing conditions (1"".5-2"") the image quality delivered to the focal
station is improved by factors of 2-3. Here, we present the first results of
the characterization of ESM, including systematic tests of the delivered PSF
across the FOV as a function of the brightness of, and distance from, the AO

showing the improvements obtained over a broad range of seeing conditions and
propose ESM as a standard observational mode for near-Infrared observations.

proposed a CNNLSTM based neural network architecture termed EEG_CNNLSTMNet for
the classification of EEG signals in response to grating stimuli with different

bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The convolutional layers
capture local temporal characteristics of the EEG signal at each channel as
well as global spatial characteristics across channels, while the LSTM layer
extracts long-term temporal dependency of EEG signals. Our experiment showed
that EEG_CNNLSTMNet performed much better at EEG classification than a
traditional machine learning approach, i.e. a support vector machine (SVM) with
features. Additionally, EEG_CNNLSTMNet outperformed EEGNet, a state-of-art
neural network architecture for the intra-subject case. We infer that the
underperformance when using an LSTM layer in the inter-subject case is due to
long-term dependency characteristics in the EEG signal that vary greatly across
subjects. Moreover, the inter-subject fine-tuned classification model using
very little data of the new subject achieved much higher accuracy than that

add a $\left(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}\right)^{n}$ term to the action, we show that
the case of $n=5/8$ is the only one that can give a viable bouncing solution,
while the $n>5/8$ cases suffer from the same problem as EMSG, i.e. they give
nonsingular, geodesically incomplete solutions. Furthermore, we show that the
$1/2<n<5/8$ cases can provide a nonsingular initially de Sitter solution.
Finally, the expanding, geodesically incomplete branch of EMSG or its
generalizations can be combined with its contracting counterpart using junction
conditions to provide a (weakly) singular bouncing solution. We outline the
junction conditions needed for this extension and provide the extended solution
explicitly for EMSG. In this sense, EMSG replaces the standard early-time
singularity by a singular bounce instead of a regular one.

for telecom companies in the saturated and competitive market. Previous studies
focus on predicting churn customers in current or next month, in which telecom
companies don't have enough time to develop and carry out churn management
strategies. In this paper, we propose a new T+2 churn customer prediction
model, in which the churn customers in two months are recognized and the
one-month window T+1 is reserved to carry out churn management strategies.
However, the predictions for churn customers in two months are much more
difficult than in current or next month because of the weaker correlation
between the customer information and churn states. Two characteristics of
telecom dataset, the discrimination between churn and non-churn customers is
complicated and the class imbalance problem is serious, are observed. To
discriminate the churn customers accurately, random forest (RF) classifier is
chosen because RF solves the nonlinear separable problem with low bias and low
variance and handles high feature spaces and large number of training examples.
To overcome the imbalance problem, synthetic minority over-sampling with
borderline or tomek link, in which the distribution of the samples remains and
the number of the training examples becomes larger, is applied. Overall, a
precision ratio of about 50% with a recall ratio of about 50% is achieved in
the T+2 churn prediction. The proposed prediction model provides an accurate
and operable churn customer prediction model for telecom companies.

reconnections on the ratio of yields of mesonic and baryonic resonances with
respect to their stable counterpart have been explored as a function of event
activity. A suppression in the ratio is observed as a function of number of
multi-partonic interactions for mesonic resonances. The $\mathrm{\phi/K}$ and
$\mathrm{\phi/\pi}$ ratios show an enhancement for high multiplicity events due
to enhanced production of strange quarks via the microscopic process of rope
hadronization in the partonic phase. The mechanism of the hadronization of
color ropes together with the QCD-based color reconnection of partons predicted
an enhancement in the ratio for baryonic resonances to non-resonance baryons
having similar quark content. The yield ratios of resonances are found to be
independent of the collision energy and strongly dependent on event activity.

multi-wavelength analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142$+$1527 at a
redshift $z = 1.2$ discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of
WISE Survey (MaDCoWS). This analysis is based on high angular resolution
$Chandra$ X-ray and NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data. Although the X-ray data
have only about 1700 counts, we are able to determine the ICM thermodynamic
radial profiles, namely temperature, entropy, and hydrostatic mass. These have
been obtained with unprecedented precision at this redshift and up to
$0.7R_{500}$, thanks to the combination of high-resolution X-ray and SZ data.
The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by $Spitzer$
and the morphological properties of the ICM derived from the combined analysis
of the $Chandra$ and NIKA2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is
an on-going merger. We measure the hydrostatic mass profile of the cluster in
four angular sectors centered on the large-scale X-ray centroid. This allows us
to estimate a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that
characterizes both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical
symmetry and of the core dynamics on the mass profile. We further combine the
X-ray and SZ data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature and
entropy distributions averaged along the line of sight. We find a relatively
low entropy core at the position of the X-ray peak and high temperature regions
located on its south and west sides. The increase in ICM temperature at the
location of the SZ peak is expected given the merger dynamics. (abridged)

of which are still exposed. We perform DNS queries from nine vantage points
around the globe to characterize this relationship. We quantify the privacy
gain offered by ESNI for different hosting and CDN providers using two
different metrics, the k-anonymity degree due to co-hosting and the dynamics of
IP address changes. We find that 20% of the domains studied will not gain any
privacy benefit since they have a one-to-one mapping between their hostname and
IP address. On the other hand, 30% will gain a significant privacy benefit with
a k value greater than 100, since these domains are co-hosted with more than
100 other domains. Domains whose visitors' privacy will meaningfully improve
are far less popular, while for popular domains the benefit is not significant.
Analyzing the dynamics of IP addresses of long-lived domains, we find that only
7.7% of them change their hosting IP addresses on a daily basis. We conclude by

well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated
when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions

that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n
vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers,
because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be
executed on smart contracts.
  In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in
an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data
dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static
analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have
the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We
have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated
smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool
Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly
chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about

group theory, topology, category theory or programming language theory,
checking them for logical and mathematical correctness.
  Agda is a constructive mathematical system by default, which amounts to
saying that it can also be considered as a programming language for
manipulating mathematical objects. But we can assume the axiom of choice or the
principle of excluded middle for pieces of mathematics that require them, at
the cost of losing the implicit programming-language character of the system.
For a fully constructive development of univalent mathematics in Agda, we would
need to use its new cubical flavour, and we hope these notes provide a base for
researchers interested in learning cubical type theory and cubical Agda as the
next step.

holes. The key innovation, called live bidirectional evaluation, propagates
examples ""backward"" through partially evaluated sketches. Live bidirectional
evaluation enables Smyth to (a) synthesize recursive functions without
trace-complete sets of examples and (b) specify and solve interdependent
synthesis goals. Eliminating the trace-completeness requirement resolves a
significant limitation faced by prior synthesis techniques when given partial
specifications in the form of input-output examples.
  To assess the practical implications of our techniques, we ran several
experiments on benchmarks used to evaluate Myth, a state-of-the-art
example-based synthesis tool. First, given expert examples (and no partial
implementations), we find that Smyth requires on average 66% of the number of
expert examples required by Myth. Second, we find that Smyth is robust to
randomly-generated examples, synthesizing many tasks with relatively few more
random examples than those provided by an expert. Third, we create a suite of
small sketching tasks by systematically employing a simple sketching strategy
to the Myth benchmarks; we find that user-provided sketches in Smyth often
further reduce the total specification burden (i.e. the combination of partial
implementations and examples). Lastly, we find that Leon and Synquid, two
state-of-the-art logic-based synthesis tools, fail to complete several tasks on
which Smyth succeeds.

Defended 09.09.2019",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is one of the core problems in computer
science. As one of the fundamental NP-complete problems, it can be used - by
known reductions - to represent instances of variety of hard decision problems.
Additionally, those representations can be passed to a program for finding
satisfying assignments to Boolean formulas, for example, to a program called
MiniSat. Those programs (called SAT-solvers) have been intensively developed
for many years and - despite their worst-case exponential time complexity - are
able to solve a multitude of hard practical instances. A drawback of this
approach is that clauses are neither expressive, nor compact, and using them to
describe decision problems can pose a big challenge on its own.
  We can improve this by using high-level constraints as a bridge between a
problem at hand and SAT. Such constraints are then automatically translated to
eqisatisfiable Boolean formulas. The main theme of this thesis revolves around
one type of such constraints, namely Boolean Cardinality Constraints (or simply
cardinality constraints). Cardinality constraints state that at most (at least,
or exactly) k out of n propositional literals can be true. Such cardinality
constraints appear naturally in formulations of different real-world problems
including cumulative scheduling, timetabling or formal hardware verification.
  The goal of this thesis is to propose and analyze new and efficient methods
to encode (translate) cardinality constraints into equisatisfiable proposition
formulas in CNF, such that the resulting SAT instances are small and that the
SAT-solver runtime is as short as possible.

pose, using spherical or energy-angular variables as momentum coordinates, the
corresponding Vlasov Boltzmann eq. with a linear collision operator with a
singular measure modeling the scattering as functions of the energy band. We
show stability results of semi-discrete DG schemes under an entropy norm for
1D-position 2D-momentum, and 2D-position 3D-momentum, using the dissipative
properties of the collisional operator given its entropy inequality, which
depends on the whole Hamiltonian rather than only the kinetic energy. For the
1D problem, knowledge of the analytic solution to Poisson and of the
convergence to a constant current is crucial to obtain full stability. For the
2D problem, specular reflection BC are considered in addition to periodicity in
the estimate for stability under an entropy norm. Regarding positivity
preservation (1D position), we treat the collision operator as a source term
and find convex combinations of the transport and collision terms which
guarantee the positivity of the cell average of our numerical pdf at the next
time step. The positivity of the numerical pdf in the whole domain is
guaranteed by applying the natural limiters that preserve the cell average but
modify the slope of the piecewise linear solutions in order to make the
function non-negative. The use of a spherical coordinate system
$\vec{p}(|\vec{p}|,\mu=cos\theta,\varphi)$ is slightly different to the choice
in previous DG solvers for BP, since the proposed DG formulation gives simpler
integrals involving just piecewise polynomial functions for both transport and

problems requires specific domain knowledge about the problems and often needs
a trial-and-error problem solving approach. Graph coloring is one of the
essential fields to provide an efficient solution for combinatorial
applications such as flight scheduling, frequency allocation in networking, and
register allocation. In particular, some optimization algorithms have been
proposed to solve the multi-coloring graph problems but most of the cases a
simple searching method would be the best approach to find an optimal solution
for graph coloring problems. However, this naive approach can increase the
computation cost exponentially as the graph size and the number of colors
increase. To mitigate such intolerable overhead, we investigate the methods to
take the advantages of quantum computing properties to find a solution for
multi-coloring graph problems in polynomial time. We utilize the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique and quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA) to find solutions for three combinatorial applications by both
transferring each problem model to the corresponding Ising model and by using
the calculated Hamiltonian matrices. Our results demonstrate that VQE and QAOA
algorithms can find one of the best solutions for each application. Therefore,
our modeling approach with hybrid quantum algorithms can be applicable for
combinatorial problems in various fields to find an optimal solution in
polynomial time.

$_{44}^{96}Ru+_{44}^{96}Ru$ and $_{40}^{96}Zr+_{40}^{96}Zr$ at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV to search for the presence of the chiral magnetic
effect in collisions of nuclei. The isobar collision species alternated
frequently between $_{44}^{96}Ru+_{44}^{96}Ru$ and $_{40}^{96}Zr+_{40}^{96}Zr$.
In order to conduct blind analyses of studies related to the chiral magnetic
effect in these isobar data, STAR developed a three-step blind analysis
procedure. Analysts are initially provided a ""reference sample"" of data,
comprised of a mix of events from the two species, the order of which respects
time-dependent changes in run conditions. After tuning analysis codes and
performing time-dependent quality assurance on the reference sample, analysts
are provided a species-blind sample suitable for calculating efficiencies and
corrections for individual $\approx30$-minute data-taking runs. For this
sample, species-specific information is disguised, but individual output files
contain data from a single isobar species. Only run-by-run corrections and code
alteration subsequent to these corrections are allowed at this stage. Following
these modifications, the ""frozen"" code is passed over the fully un-blind data,
completing the blind analysis. As a check of the feasibility of the blind
analysis procedure, analysts completed a ""mock data challenge,"" analyzing data
from $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ GeV, collected in 2018. The
$Au+Au$ data were prepared in the same manner intended for the isobar blind
data. The details of the blind analysis procedure and results from the mock
data challenge are presented.

to characterize experimentally. While entanglement witnesses based on the
fidelity to the target entangled state are efficient detectors of entanglement,
they in general underestimate the amount of entanglement due to errors during
state preparation and measurement. Therefore, to detect entanglement more
robustly in the presence of such control errors, we introduce a 'subspace'
witness that detects a broader class of entangled states with strictly larger
violation than the conventional state-fidelity witness at the cost of
additional measurements, while remaining more efficient with respect to state
tomography. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of the subspace
witness by generating and detecting entanglement with a hybrid, two-qubit
system composed of electronic spins in diamond. We further extend the notion of
subspace witness to specific genuine multipartite entangled (GME) states such
as GHZ, W, and Dicke states, and motivate the choice of the metric based on
quantum information tasks such as entanglement-enhanced sensing. In addition,
as the subspace witness identifies the many-body coherences of the target
entangled state, it facilitates (beyond detection) lower-bound quantification
of entanglement via generalized concurrences. We expect the straightforward and
efficient implementation of subspace witnesses would be beneficial in detecting
specific GME states in noisy, intermediate-scale quantum processors with a
hundred qubits.

this paper introduces a new steganographic mechanism that provides (1) robust
privacy protection of secret information by concealing them arbitrarily in the

originality for the normal streams. This model surpasses our previous works by
employing the Discrete Cosine Transform to expand the hiding capacity and
reduce complexity. The resultant distortion has been accurately measured at all

DMI by the CoGd cap layer composition, the stack symmetry and the ferrimagnetic
layer thickness. The DMI thickness dependence confirms its interfacial nature.
In addition, magnetic force microscopy reveals the ability to tune DMI in a
range that stabilizes sub-100 nm skyrmions at room temperature in zero field.
Our work opens new paths for controlling interfacial DMI in ferrimagnets to
nucleate and manipulate skyrmions.

near-Earth encounter at an altitude of 27,700 km or 4.2 Earth radii. We present
here the results of an extensive, multi-observatory campaign designed to probe
for spectral and/or rotational changes to Duende due to gravitational
interactions with the Earth during the flyby. Our spectral data reveal no
changes within the systematic uncertainties of the data. Post-flyby lightcurve
photometry places strong constraints on the rotation state of Duende, showing
that it is in non-principal axis rotation with fundamental periods of P_1 =
8.71 +/- 0.03 and P_2 = 23.7 +/- 0.2 hours. Multiple lightcurve analysis
techniques, coupled with theoretical considerations and delay-doppler radar
imaging, allows us to assign these periods to specific rotational axes of the
body. In particular we suggest that Duende is now in a non-principal, short
axis mode rotation state with a precessional period equal to P_1 and
oscillation about the symmetry axis at a rate equal to P_2. Temporal and
signal-to-noise limitations inherent to the pre-flyby photometric dataset make
it difficult to definitively diagnose whether these periods represent a change
imparted due to gravitational torques during the flyby. However, based on
multiple analysis techniques and a number of plausibility arguments, we suggest
that Duende experienced a rotational change during the planetary encounter with
an increase in its precessional rotation period. Our preferred interpretation
of the available data is that the precession rate increased from 8.4 hours
prior to the flyby to 8.7 hours afterwards. A companion paper by Benson et al.
(2019) provides a more detailed dynamical analysis of this event and compares
the data to synthetic lightcurves computed from a simple shape model of Duende.

Population III (PopIII) stars are believed to fragment, resulting in multiple
accreting cores. In this paper, we build a theoretical framework for
calculating the optical depth of H$_2$ ro-vibrational line cooling based on the
vertical structure in these accretion disks. Applying this physically motivated
prescription for the optical depth, we find that cooling in the inner disk with
$r \lesssim 10 {\rm\ AU}$ is attenuated significantly as a result of high
surface density; $PdV$ heating becomes more efficient than cooling, which
prevents fragmentation in the inner disk. Despite this, cooling becomes
dynamically important in the outer disk, favoring fragmentation. We argue that
most of the resultant fragments are initially at the outer disk, and that any
surviving fragment has to migrate slower than the disk-scale photo-evaporation
process. Since type I migration is fast, migration slows down as a result of
gap-opening in the disk structure. Two possible processes for gap-opening are
studied: (1) through a massive, densely-cored ($\rho \gtrsim 10^{-8} {\rm\ g\
cm^{-3}}$) clump able to radiate away the excess gravitational potential
energy, and (2) through a fast-growing central star, with $\dot{M} \gtrsim 2

star-disk system and favors gap opening.

in the lifetime of stars. The processes of disk evolution and planet formation
are intrinsically linked. We spatially resolve with GRAVITY/VLTI in the K-band
the sub au-scale region of 27 stars to gain statistical understanding of their
properties. We look for correlations with stellar parameters, such as
luminosity, mass, temperature and age. Our sample also cover a range of various
properties in terms of reprocessed flux, flared or flat morphology, and gaps.
We developed semi-physical geometrical models to fit our interferometric data.
Our best models correspond to smooth and wide rings, implying that wedge-shaped
rims at the dust sublimation edge are favored, as found in the H-band. The
closure phases are generally non-null with a median value of ~10 deg,
indicating spatial asymmetries of the intensity distributions. Multi-size grain
populations could explain the closure phase ranges below 20-25 deg but other
scenarios should be invoked to explain the largest ones. Our measurements
extend the Radius-Luminosity relation to ~1e4 Lsun and confirm the significant
spread around the mean relation observed in the H-band. Gapped sources exhibit
a large N-to-K band size ratio and large values of this ratio are only observed
for the members of our sample that would be older than 1 Ma, less massive, and
with lower luminosity. In the 2 Ms mass range, we observe a correlation in the
increase of the relative age with the transition from group II to group I, and
an increase of the N-to-K size ratio. However, the size of the current sample
does not yet permit us to invoke a clear universal evolution mechanism across
the HAeBe mass range. The measured locations of the K-band emission suggest
that these disks might be structured by forming young planets, rather than by
depletion due to EUV, FUV, and X-ray photo-evaporation.

equations. The bifurcations are seen in the probability density function (PDF)
of the largest scale mode with the control parameter being the Reynolds number
based on the friction coefficient denoted as $Rh$. As one increases $Rh$ in the
turbulent regime, the PDF of the large scale mode first bifurcates from a
Gaussian to a bimodal behaviour, signifying the emergence of reversals of the
large scale flow where the flow fluctuates between two distinct turbulent
states. Further increase in $Rh$ leads to a bifurcation from bimodal to
unimodal PDF which denotes the disappearance of the reversals of the largest
scale mode. We attribute the latter transition to the long-time memory that the
large scale flow exhibits related to low frequency $1/f^\alpha$ type of noise
with $0 < \alpha < 2$. We also demonstrate that a minimal model with 15 modes,
obtained from the truncated Euler equation, is able to capture the bifurcations
of the large scale jets exhibited by the Navier-Stokes equations.

direct evaluation of absolute myocardial perfusion, by computing pixel-wise
flow maps. Clinical studies suggest quantitative evaluation would be more
desirable for objectivity and efficiency. Objective assessment can be further
facilitated by segmenting the myocardium and automatically generating reports
following the AHA model. This will free user interaction for analysis and lead
to a 'one-click' solution to improve workflow. This paper proposes a deep
neural network based computational workflow for inline myocardial perfusion
analysis. Adenosine stress and rest perfusion scans were acquired from three
hospitals. Training set included N=1,825 perfusion series from 1,034 patients.
Independent test set included 200 scans from 105 patients. Data were
consecutively acquired at each site. A convolution neural net (CNN) model was
trained to provide segmentation for LV cavity, myocardium and right ventricular
by processing incoming 2D+T perfusion Gd series. Model outputs were compared to
manual ground-truth for accuracy of segmentation and flow measures derived on
global and per-sector basis. The trained models were integrated onto MR
scanners for effective inference. Segmentation accuracy and myocardial flow
measures were compared between CNN models and manual ground-truth. The mean
Dice ratio of CNN derived myocardium was 0.93 +/- 0.04. Both global flow and
per-sector values showed no significant difference, compared to manual results.
The AHA 16 segment model was automatically generated and reported on the MR
scanner. As a result, the fully automated analysis of perfusion flow mapping
was achieved. This solution was integrated on the MR scanner, enabling
'one-click' analysis and reporting of myocardial blood flow.

atmospheric shortwave absorptivities is investigated in a three-dimensional
general circulation model with grey radiation. Shortwave absorption in the
atmosphere reduces the incoming radiation reaching the surface but warms the
upper atmosphere, significantly shifting the habitable zone toward the star.
The strong stratification under high shortwave absorptivity suppresses the
Hadley cell in a manner that matches previous Hadley cell scalings. General
circulation changes may be observable through cloud coverage and superrotation.
The equatorial superrotation in the upper atmosphere strengthens with the
shortwave opacity, as predicted based on the gradient wind of the
radiative-convective equilibrium profile. There is a sudden drop of equatorial
superrotation at very low shortwave opacity. This is because the Hadley cell in
those cases are strong enough to fill the entire troposphere with zero momentum
air from the surface. A diurnal cycle (westward motion of substellar point
relative to the planet) leads to acceleration of the equatorial westerlies in
general, through the enhancement of the equatorward eddy momentum transport,
but the response is not completely monotonic, perhaps due to the resonance of
tropical waves and the diurnal forcing.

  Decision Making. 11 pages (including references and appendix)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in contextual bandit optimization and reinforcement learning
have garnered interest in applying these methods to real-world sequential
decision making problems. Real-world applications frequently have constraints
with respect to a currently deployed policy. Many of the existing
constraint-aware algorithms consider problems with a single objective (the
reward) and a constraint on the reward with respect to a baseline policy.
However, many important applications involve multiple competing objectives and
auxiliary constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Thompson sampling
algorithm for multi-outcome contextual bandit problems with auxiliary
constraints. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on a synthetic problem.
Lastly, we apply our method to a real world video transcoding problem and
provide a practical way for navigating the trade-off between safety and
performance using Bayesian optimization.

  Algorithm",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265) standard doubles the
compression efficiency of the widely used H.264/AVC standard. For practical
applications, rate control (RC) algorithms for HEVC need to be developed. Based
on the R-Q, R-${\rho}$ or R-${\lambda}$ models, rate control algorithms aim at
encoding a video clip/segment to a target bit rate accurately with high video
quality after compression. Among the various models used by HEVC rate control
algorithms, the R-${\lambda}$ model performs the best in both coding efficiency
and rate control accuracy. However, compared with encoding with a fixed
quantization parameter (QP), even the best rate control algorithm [1] still
under-performs when comparing the video quality achieved at identical average
bit rates. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized
rate-distortion-${\lambda}$ (R-D-${\lambda}$) model for the relationship
between rate (R), distortion (D) and the Lagrangian multiplier (${\lambda}$) in
rate-distortion (RD) optimized encoding. In addition to the well designed
hierarchical initialization and coefficient update scheme, a new model based
rate allocation scheme composed of amortization, smooth window and consistency
control is proposed for a better rate allocation. Experimental results
implementing the proposed algorithm in the HEVC reference software HM-16.9 show
that the proposed rate control algorithm is able to achieve an average of BDBR
saving of 6.09%, 3.15% and 4.03% for random access (RA), low delay P (LDP) and
low delay B (LDB) configurations respectively as compared with the
R-${\lambda}$ model based RC algorithm [1] implemented in HM. The proposed
algorithm also outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, while rate control
accuracy and encoding speed are hardly impacted.

expressions for the gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole collisions
from ab initio models. More precisely, our expressions are built from numerical
surrogate models based on supercomputer simulations of the Einstein equations,
which have been shown to be essentially indistinguishable from each other.
Distinct aspects of our approach are that: i) representations of the
gravitational waves can be explicitly written in a few lines, ii) these
representations are free-form yet still fast to search for and validate and
iii) there are no underlying physical approximations in the underlying model.
The key strategy is combining techniques from Artificial Intelligence and
Reduced Order Modeling for parameterized systems. Namely, symbolic regression
through genetic programming combined with sparse representations in parameter
space and the time domain using Reduced Basis and the Empirical Interpolation
Method enabling fast free-form symbolic searches and large-scale a posteriori
validations. As a proof of concept we present our results for the collision of
two black holes, initially without spin, and with an initial separation
corresponding to $25-31$ gravitational wave cycles before merger. The minimum
overlap, compared to ground truth solutions, is $99\%$. That is, $1\%$
difference between our closed-form expressions and supercomputer simulations;
this is considered for gravitational (GW) science more than the minimum
required due to experimental numerical errors which otherwise dominate. This
paper aims to contribute to the field of GWs in particular and Artificial

as well as the properties of local environments. To understand how dust
polarization varies with grain mechanical properties and the local environment,
in this paper, we model the wavelength-dependence polarization of starlight and
polarized dust emission by aligned grains by simultaneously taking into account
grain alignment and rotational disruption by radiative torques (RATs). We
explore a wide range of the local radiation field and grain mechanical
properties characterized by tensile strength. We find that the maximum
polarization and the peak wavelength shift to shorter wavelengths as the
radiation strength $U$ increases due to the enhanced alignment of small grains.
Grain rotational disruption by RATs tends to decrease the optical-near infrared
polarization but increases the ultraviolet polarization of starlight due to the
conversion of large grains into smaller ones. In particular, we find that the
submillimeter (submm) polarization degree at $850~\mu \rm m$ ($P_{850}$) does
not increase monotonically with the radiation strength or grain temperature
($T_{d}$), but it depends on the tensile strength of grain materials. Our
physical model of dust polarization can be tested with observations toward
star-forming regions or molecular clouds irradiated by a nearby star, which
have higher radiation intensity than the average interstellar radiation field.
Finally, we compare our predictions of the $P_{850}-T_{d}$ relationship with
{\it Planck} data and find that the observed decrease of $P_{850}$ with $T_{d}$
can be explained when grain disruption by RATs is accounted for, suggesting
that interstellar grains unlikely to have a compact structure but perhaps a
composite one. The variation of the submm polarization with U (or $T_{d}$) can
provide a valuable constraint on the internal structures of cosmic dust.

image (NPI), computer generated graphic (CGG), and deep network generated image
(DGI). A method is presented for effectively identifying the origin of digital
images that is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and uses a
local-to-global framework to reduce training complexity. By feeding labeled
data, the CNN is trained to predict the origin of local patches cropped from an
image. The origin of the full-size image is then determined by majority voting.
Unlike previous forensic methods, the CNN takes the raw pixels as input without
the aid of ""residual map"". Experimental results revealed that not only the
high-frequency components but also the middle-frequency ones contribute to
origin identification. The proposed method achieved up to 95.21% identification
accuracy and behaved robustly against several common post-processing operations

neurons to over-fire, which makes UAP generation feasible even without using

unseen datasets and unseen FFMs. Moreover, we conducted subjective assessment
for imperceptibility of the adversarial perturbations, revealing that the
crafted UAPs are visually negligible. These findings provide a baseline for

shape transition at 98 Sr has been investigated via single-neutron transfer
reactions using the (d, p) reaction in inverse kinematics. These reactions
selectively populate states with a large overlap of the projectile ground state
coupled to a neutron in a single-particle orbital. Radioactive 94,95,96Sr
nuclei with energies of 5.5 AMeV were used to bombard a CD 2 target. Recoiling
light charged particles and {\gamma} rays were detected using a quasi-4{\pi}
silicon strip detector array and a 12 element Ge array. The excitation energy
of states populated was reconstructed employing the missing mass method
combined with {\gamma}-ray tagging and differential cross sections for final
states were extracted. A reaction model analysis of the angular distributions
allowed for firm spin assignments to be made for the low-lying 352, 556 and 681
keV excited states in 95Sr and a constraint has been placed on the spin of the
higher-lying 1666 keV state. Angular distributions have been extracted for 10
states populated in the d(95Sr,p)96Sr reaction, and constraints have been
provided for the spins and parities of several final states. Results are
compared to shell model calculations in several model spaces and the structure
of low-lying states in 94Sr and 95Sr is well-described. The spectroscopic
strength of the 0+ and 2 states in 96Sr is significantly more fragmented than
predicted.

variability can have direct impact on the reliability of assessments made by
deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method for modelling such
uncertainty in the context of 2D echocardiography (echo), which is a routine
procedure for detecting cardiovascular disease at point-of-care. Echo imaging
quality and acquisition time is highly dependent on the operator's experience
level. Recent developments have shown the possibility of automating echo image
quality quantification by mapping an expert's assessment of quality to the echo
image via deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the observer variability in
the expert's assessment can impact the quality quantification accuracy. Here,
we aim to model the intra-observer variability in echo quality assessment as an
aleatoric uncertainty modelling regression problem with the introduction of a
novel method that handles the regression problem with categorical labels. A key
feature of our design is that only a single forward pass is sufficient to
estimate the level of uncertainty for the network output. Compared to the $0.11
\pm 0.09$ absolute error (in a scale from 0 to 1) archived by the conventional
regression method, the proposed method brings the error down to $0.09 \pm
0.08$, where the improvement is statistically significant and equivalents to
$5.7\%$ test accuracy improvement. The simplicity of the proposed approach
means that it could be generalized to other applications of deep learning in
medical imaging, where there is often uncertainty in clinical labels.

generalization of the Jaccard similarity to measure the proximity of sets whose
elements are associated with relative frequencies or probabilities. In
combination with a hash algorithm that maps those weighted sets to compact
signatures which allow fast estimation of pairwise similarities, it constitutes
a valuable method for big data applications such as near-duplicate detection,
nearest neighbor search, or clustering. This paper introduces a class of
one-pass locality-sensitive hash algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster
than the original approach. The performance gain is achieved by calculating
signature components not independently, but collectively. Four different
algorithms are proposed based on this idea. Two of them are statistically
equivalent to the original approach and can be used as drop-in replacements.
The other two may even improve the estimation error by introducing statistical

method and master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) configuration is proposed
for power scaling of 1.6-um-band single-frequency fiber lasers (SFFLs), where
the Er3+ ion has a limited gain. The CEP technique is fulfilled by coupling a
primary signal light at 1.6 um and a C-band auxiliary laser. The numerical
model of the fiber amplifier with the CEP technique reveals that the energy
transfer process involves the pump competition and the in-band particle
transition between the signal and auxiliary lights. Moreover, for the signal
emission, the population density in the upper level is enhanced and the
effective population inversion is achieved due to the CEP. A single-frequency
MOPA laser at 1603 nm with an output power of 52.6 W is obtained
experimentally. Besides, a slope efficiency of 30.4% is improved by more than
10% through the CEP technique. Both the output power and slope efficiency are
by far the highest for 1.6-um-band SFFLs. Meanwhile, a laser linewidth of 5.2
kHz and a polarization-extinction ratio of ~18 dB are obtained at the maximum
output power. The proposed technique provides an optional method of increasing
the slope efficiency and power scaling for fiber lasers operating at L-band.

separate post-processing step after signal restoration, making the segmentation
performance largely depend on the quality of restoration. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep-learning framework to tackle semantic segmentation and

proposed approach contains two components: Semantically-Guided Adaptation,
which exploits semantic information from degraded images to refine the
segmentation; and Exemplar-Guided Synthesis, which restores images from
semantic label maps given degraded exemplars as the guidance. Our method
cooperatively leverages the complementarity and interdependence of low-level
restoration and high-level segmentation in adverse environmental conditions.
Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our approach can not
only improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation with degradation cues, but
also boost the perceptual quality and structural similarity of image
restoration with semantic guidance.

These transitions in turn can open and close the band gap of SL-TMDs, leading
to metal-insulator transitions, and lead to emergence of more complex quantum

mesoscopic mechanisms of these structural phase transitions. Here we develop
the Landau-type thermodynamic description of SL-TMDs on example of

  Despite the fact that many face editing algorithms seem to produce realistic

simple way to detect such fake face images - so-called DeepFakes. Our method is

Compared to previous systems, which need to be fed with large amounts of

several public datasets of real and fake faces into a new benchmark: Faces-HQ.

inferences based on the assumption that we can correctly specify a model.
However, it is difficult to confirm whether a model is correctly specified. To
overcome this problem, existing works have devised statistical tests for model
specification. Existing works have defined a correctly specified model in
regression as a model with zero conditional mean of the error term over train
data only. Extending the definition in conventional statistical tests, we
define a correctly specified model as a model with zero conditional mean of the
error term over any distribution of the explanatory variable. This definition
is a natural consequence of the orthogonality of the explanatory variable and
the error term. If a model does not satisfy this condition, the model might
lack robustness with regards to the distribution shift. The proposed method
would enable us to reject a misspecified model under our definition. By
applying the proposed method, we can obtain a model that predicts the label for
the unlabeled test data well without losing the interpretability of the model.

static vine copulas and a generalization of dynamic C-vine and D-vine copulas
studied by Almeida et al (2016) and Goel and Mehra (2019). Within this class,
we allow for time-varying dependence by driving the vine copula parameters with
latent AR(1) processes. This modeling approach is very flexible but estimation
is not straightforward due to the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose
a Bayesian estimation approach, which relies on a novel approximation of the
posterior distribution. This approximation allows to use Markov Chain Monte
Carlo methods, such as elliptical slice sampling, in a sequential way. In
contrast to other Bayesian sequential estimation procedures for vine copula
models as proposed by Gruber and Czado (2015), there is no need to collapse
copula parameters to point estimates before proceeding to the next tree. Thus
more information and uncertainty is propagated from lower to higher trees. A
simulation study shows satisfactory performance of the Bayesian procedure. This
dynamic modeling and inference approach can be applied in various fields, where
static vine copulas have already proven to be successful, including
environmental sciences, medicine and finance. Here we study the dependence
among 21 exchange rates. For comparison we also estimate a static vine copula

superior performance of the proposed dynamic vine copula model with respect to

Hall systems. Under zero magnetic field, THCs spontaneously become non-zero for
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken systems, and can have contributions from
topologically protected edge states. Here we focus on an additional bulk
effect, the impurity mechanism in TRS broken superconductors. Inspired by $Sr_2
Ru O_4$, the low temperature THC was calculated [Sup. Sci. and Tech. 29, 085006
(2016)] for the chiral p-wave superconductors induced by point impurities.
Compared to topological part of THC, this contribution can be orders of
magnitude larger as it scales with the density of states at the Fermi level.
Motivated by TRS broken superconductors, URu$_2$Si$_2$ and SrPtAs and
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as recently also been suggested as d-wave possibly, we calculate
the THCs to $i.$ finite temperatures $ii.$ d-wave pairing states, $iii.$ finite
size impurities.
  For this study, the non-equilibrium quasi-classical Keldysh Green's function
formalism is utilized. The THCs are calculated by the systematic expansion of
the quasiclassical transport equation in the center of mass gradients,
self-consistently. $\kappa_{ij}$ are obtained analytically at low temperatures
($T \to 0$) and numerically at finite temperatures.
  We find that the impurity mechanism is dominant in $\kappa_{yx}$ at finite
temperatures when compared to the topological part except at very low
temperatures.There are two experimental signatures of IM on $\kappa_{yx}$: A
non-monotonic temperature dependence and a sign change as a function of
temperature depending on the scattering process.

size of letters. However, readers occasionally need to make longer saccades
(known as return-sweeps) that take their eyes from the end of one line of text
to the beginning of the next. In this study, we tested whether return-sweep
saccades are also guided by font size information and whether this guidance
depends on visual acuity of the return-sweep target area. To do this, we
manipulated the font size of letters (0.29 vs 0.39 deg. per character) and the
length of the first line of text (16 vs 26 deg.). The larger font resulted in
return-sweeps that landed further to the right of the line start and in a
reduction of under-sweeps compared to the smaller font. This suggests that font
size information is used when programming return-sweeps. Return-sweeps in the
longer line condition landed further to the right of the line start and the
proportion of under-sweeps increased compared to the short line condition. This
likely reflects an increase in saccadic undershoot error with the increase in
intended saccade size. Critically, there was no interaction between font size
and line length. This suggests that when programming return-sweeps, the use of
font size information does not depend on visual acuity at the saccade target.
Instead, it appears that readers rely on global typographic properties of the

and thus the encoders cannot easily adapt to certain combinations of
characters. This leads to a loss of important semantic information, which is
especially problematic for Chinese because the language does not have explicit
word boundaries. In this paper, we propose ZEN, a BERT-based Chinese (Z) text
encoder Enhanced by N-gram representations, where different combinations of
characters are considered during training. As a result, potential word or phase
boundaries are explicitly pre-trained and fine-tuned with the character encoder
(BERT). Therefore ZEN incorporates the comprehensive information of both the
character sequence and words or phrases it contains. Experimental results
illustrated the effectiveness of ZEN on a series of Chinese NLP tasks. We show
that ZEN, using less resource than other published encoders, can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on most tasks. Moreover, it is shown that
reasonable performance can be obtained when ZEN is trained on a small corpus,
which is important for applying pre-training techniques to scenarios with
limited data. The code and pre-trained models of ZEN are available at

sensor networks under the widely studied q-composite key predistribution
scheme. For network connectivity which ensures that any two sensors can find a
path in between for secure communication, we derive the conditions to guarantee
connectivity in consideration of (i) node-capture attacks, where the adversary
may capture a set of sensors and compromise keys in their memory; (ii) sensor
mobility, meaning that sensors can move around so that the network topology may
change over time; (iii) physical transmission constraints, under which two
sensors have to be within each other's transmission range for communication;
(iv) the boundary effect of network fields; and (v) link unreliability, meaning
that links are allowed to be unreliable. In contrast, many prior connectivity
analyses of secure sensor networks often ignore the above issues. For
resilience, although limited studies have presented formal analysis, it is
often assumed that the adversary captures a random set of sensors, whereas this
paper allows the adversary to capture an arbitrary set of sensors. We present
conditions to ensure unassailability and unsplittability in secure sensor
networks under the q-composite scheme. Unassailability ensures that an
adversary capturing any set consisting of a negligible fraction of sensors can
compromise only a negligible fraction of communication links although the
adversary may compromise communications between noncaptured nodes which happen
to use keys that are shared by captured nodes. Unsplittability means that when
a negligible fraction of sensors are captured, almost all of the remaining
nodes are still securely connected. Based on the results of connectivity,
unassailability and unsplittability, we provide useful guidelines for the
design of secure sensor networks.

We derive scheme parameters to have a desired level of resiliency, and obtain
optimal parameters that defend against different adversaries as much as

same ""perfect resilience"" property as in the random pairwise key
predistribution for attacks launched after neighbor discovery. Despite
considerable attention to this scheme, much prior work explicitly or implicitly
uses an incorrect computation for the probability of link compromise under

species is safe from extinction? We study an ecosystem of interacting species
that are influenced by random environmental fluctuations. At any point in time,
we can either harvest or seed (repopulate) species. Harvesting brings an
economic gain while seeding incurs a cost. The problem is to find the optimal
harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from
harvesting minus the cost one has to pay for the seeding of various species. We
consider what happens when one, or both, of the seeding and harvesting rates
are bounded. The focus of this paper is the analysis of these three novel
settings: bounded seeding and infinite harvesting, bounded seeding and bounded
harvesting, and infinite seeding and bounded harvesting.
  We prove analytical results and develop numerical approximation methods. By
implementing these approximations, we are able to gain qualitative information
about how to best harvest and seed species. We are able to show that in the
single species setting there are thresholds $0<L_1<L_2<\infty$ such that: 1) if
the population size is `low', so that it lies in $(0, L_1]$, there is seeding
using the maximal seeding rate; 2) if the population size `moderate', so that
it lies in $(L_1,L_2)$, there is no harvesting or seeding; 3) if the population
size is `high', so that it lies in the interval $[L_2, \infty)$, there is
harvesting using the maximal harvesting rate. Once we have a system with at

filtering for mitigation of outlier interference. In such filtering, the upper
and the lower fences establish a robust range that excludes noise outliers
while including the signal of interest and the non-outlier noise. Then, the
outlier values are replaced with those in mid-range. To increase the
effectiveness of outlier noise identification, and to minimize the false
negatives, the fences need to be both tight and robust to outlier noise. On the
other hand, to minimize the false positives and to avoid the detrimental
effects, such as instabilities and excessive distortions, often associated with
nonlinear filtering, the fences need to be inclusive, so that the signal of
interest and the non-outlier noise remain within the fences. Quantile Tracking
Filters (QTFs) are an appealing choice for such robust fencing in
intermittently nonlinear filtering, as QTFs are analog filters suitable for
wideband real-time processing of continuous-time signals and are easily
implemented in analog circuitry. Further, their numerical computations are O(1)
per output value in both time and storage, which also enables their high-rate
digital implementations in real time. In this paper, we first provide a brief
general discussion of the outlier noise and its mitigation by intermittently
nonlinear filters. We then focus on the basic properties of the QTF-based
fencing, discuss the approaches to choosing its parameters, and illustrate the
use of the QTF fencing for various types of the signal+noise mixtures. We also
demonstrate how the Complementary Intermittently Nonlinear Filtering (CINF)

is a complex problem to solve computationally. Previous research has shown
non-expert crowd evaluations of surgical performances are as accurate as the
gold standard, expert surgeon review. The aim of this research is to learn
whether crowdsourced evaluators give higher ratings of technical skill to video
of performances with increased playback speed, the use in discriminating skill
levels, and if this increase is related to the evaluator consciously being
aware that the video is being manually edited. Methods: A set of ten peg
transfer videos (5 novices, 5 experts), were used to evaluate the perceived
skill of the performers at each video playback speed used (0.4x-3.6x).
Objective metrics used for measuring technical skill were also computed for
comparison by manipulating the corresponding kinematic data of each
performance. Two videos of an expert and novice performing dry lab laparoscopic
trials of peg transfer tasks were used to obtain evaluations at each playback
speed (0.2x-3.0x) of perception of whether a video is played at real-time
playback speed or not. Results: We found that while both novices and experts
had increased perceived technical skill as the video playback was increased,
the amount of increase was significantly greater for experts. Each increase in
playback speed by 0.4x was associated with, on average, a 0.72-point increase
in the GOALS score (95% CI: 0.60-0.84 point increase; p < 0.001) for expert
videos and only a 0.24-point increase in the GOALS score (95% CI: 0.13-0.36
point increase; p < 0.001) for novice videos. Conclusion: Due to the
differential increase in perceived technical skill due to increased playback
speed for experts, the difference between novice and expert skill levels of
surgical performances may be more easily discerned by manually increasing the
video playback speed.

While such a Lyapunov function does not, in general, represent a true

when it does), it can nevertheless be used to study the asymptotic behavior of
the spacetimes. The Lyapunov function attains its infimum only in the limit
that the matter sources be `turned off` or, at least, become asymptotically
negligible provided that the universe model does not re-collapse and form
singularities. Later we specialize our result to the case of a perfect fluid
which satisfies the desired energy conditions. However, even in this special

form that unlike the vacuum spacetimes (with or without a positive cosmological
constant), construction of a true Hamiltonian for the dynamics in constant mean
curvature temporal gauge is difficult and therefore the Lyapunov function does
not have a straightforward physical interpretation. Nevertheless, we show, for
the fluid with equation of state $P=(\gamma-1)\rho$ ($1\leq\gamma\leq2$), that
the general results obtained hold true and the infimum of the weak Lyapunov
function can be related to the Sigma constant, a topological invariant of the

configurations increases exponentially, finding the near-optimal configuration
of a software system becomes challenging. Recent approaches address this
challenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of
configurations. However, collecting enough sample configurations can be very
expensive since each such sample requires configuring, compiling, and executing
the entire system using a complex test suite. When learning on new data is too
expensive, it is possible to use \textit{Transfer Learning} to ""transfer"" old
lessons to the new context. Traditional transfer learning has a number of
challenges, specifically, (a) learning from excessive data takes excessive
time, and (b) the performance of the models built via transfer can deteriorate
as a result of learning from a poor source. To resolve these problems, we
propose a novel transfer learning framework called BEETLE, which is a
""bellwether""-based transfer learner that focuses on identifying and learning
from the most relevant source from amongst the old data. This paper evaluates
BEETLE with 57 different software configuration problems based on five software
systems (a video encoder, an SAT solver, a SQL database, a high-performance
C-compiler, and a streaming data analytics tool). In each of these cases,
BEETLE found configurations that are as good as or better than those found by
other state-of-the-art transfer learners while requiring only a fraction
($\frac{1}{7}$th) of the measurements needed by those other methods. Based on
these results, we say that BEETLE is a new high-water mark in optimally
configuring software.

used in a wide range of applications ranging from key predistribution in
wireless sensor networks to modeling social networks. For these graphs, each
node is equipped with a set of objects in a random manner, and two nodes have
an undirected edge in between if they have at least one object in common. In
this paper, we investigate connectivity and robustness in a general random
intersection graph model. Specifically, we establish sharp asymptotic zero-one
laws for k-connectivity and k-robustness, as well as the asymptotically exact
probability of k-connectivity, for any positive integer k. The k-connectivity
property quantifies how resilient is the connectivity of a graph against node
or edge failures, while k-robustness measures the effectiveness of
local-information-based consensus algorithms (that do not use global graph
topology information) in the presence of adversarial nodes. In addition to
presenting the results under the general random intersection graph model, we
consider two special cases of the general model, a binomial random intersection
graph and a uniform random intersection graph, which both have numerous
applications as well. For these two specialized graphs, our results on
asymptotically exact probabilities of k-connectivity and asymptotic zero-one

often because they are thought to be too small. The impact of this issue in
applied nuclear science has been discussed widely in recent years. Commonly
suggested causes are: poor estimates of specific error components, neglect of
uncertainty correlations, and overlooked known error sources. However,
instances have been reported where very careful, objective assessments of all
known error sources have been made with realistic error magnitudes and
correlations provided, yet the resulting evaluated uncertainties still appear
to be inconsistent with observed scatter of predicted mean values. These
discrepancies might be attributed to significant unrecognized sources of
uncertainty (USU) that limit the accuracy to which these physical quantities
can be determined. The objective of our work has been to develop procedures for
revealing and including USU estimates in nuclear data evaluations involving
experimental input data. We conclude that the presence of USU may be revealed,
and estimates of magnitudes made, through quantitative analyses. This paper
identifies several specific clues that can be explored by evaluators in
identifying the existence of USU. It then describes numerical procedures to
generate quantitative estimates of USU magnitudes. Key requirements for these
procedures to be viable are that sufficient numbers of data points be
available, for statistical reasons, and that additional supporting information
about the measurements be provided by the experimenters. Realistic examples are
described to illustrate these procedures and demonstrate their outcomes as well
as limitations. Our work strongly supports the view that USU is an important
issue in nuclear data evaluation, with significant consequences for
applications, and that this topic warrants further investigation by the nuclear

the length of $lcp(x,y)$. This result is in some sense stronger than the
compatibility property, proved by Mantaci, Restivo, Rosone and Sciortino for
the Lyndon factorization and here for the inverse Lyndon factorization.
Roughly, the compatibility property allows us to extend the mutual order
between local suffixes of (inverse) Lyndon factors to the suffixes of the whole
word.
  A main tool used in the proof of the above results is a property that we
state for factors $m_i$ with nonempty borders in an inverse Lyndon
factorization: a nonempty border of $m_i$ cannot be a prefix of the next factor
$m_{i+1}$. The last property we prove shows that if two words share a common
overlap, then their Lyndon factorizations can be used to capture the common
overlap of the two words.
  The above results open to the study of new applications of Lyndon words and
inverse Lyndon words in the field of string comparison.

by providing narrowband sensing of ambient dephasing noise, coupling additively

is achieved by introducing a finite-difference control modulation, which
linearizes the sensor's response and affords tunable band-limited ""windowing""

perform efficient experimental reconstruction of a ""mixed"" dephasing spectrum,

demonstrate the simultaneous reconstruction of overlapping dephasing and

two noise sources contribute equally to the sensor's response. Our approach
provides a direct means to augment quantum-sensor performance in the presence

important achievements of algebra and number theory in the last century is the

local fields. The third step is to construct two maps Br(Q) to Br(R) and Br(Q)
to Br(Q_p) and to use these two maps to understand Br(Q). This dissertation
completed the first two steps of this enormous project.

dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body
pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our

these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to
dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal

stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained
why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with
a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was
more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel
control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal

framework is proposed to provide model-free resource allocation for ultra
reliable low latency communication (URLLC). The proposed, experienced deep-RL
framework can guarantee high end-to-end reliability and low end-to-end latency,
under explicit data rate constraints, for each wireless without any models of
or assumptions on the users' traffic. In particular, in order to enable the
deep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in
highly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial
networks (GANs) is proposed. This GAN approach is used to pre-train the deep-RL
framework using a mix of real and synthetic data, thus creating an experienced
deep-RL framework that has been exposed to a broad range of network conditions.
Formally, the URLLC resource allocation problem is posed as a power
minimization problem under reliability, latency, and rate constraints. To solve
this problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is
determined. Then, these rates are mapped to the resource block and power
allocation vectors of the studied wireless system. Finally, the end-to-end
reliability and latency of each user are used as feedback to the deep-RL
framework. It is then shown that at the fixed-point of the deep-RL algorithm,
the reliability and latency of the users are near-optimal. Moreover, for the
proposed GAN approach, a theoretical limit for the generator output is
analytically derived. Simulation results show how the proposed approach can
achieve near-optimal performance within the rate-reliability-latency region,
depending on the network and service requirements. The results also show that
the proposed experienced deep-RL framework is able to remove the transient
training time that makes conventional deep-RL methods unsuitable for URLLC.

objects in the environment, which causes paths to go from line-of-sight (LOS)
to non-LOS (NLOS). We consider macrodiversity as a strategy to improve the
performance of mmWave cellular systems, where the user attempts to connect with
two or more base stations. An accurate analysis of macrodiversity must account
for the possibility of correlated blocking, which occurs when a single blockage
simultaneously blocks the paths to two base stations. In this paper, we analyze
the macrodiverity gain in the presence of correlated random blocking and
interference. To do so, we develop a framework to determine distributions for
the LOS probability, SNR, and SINR by taking into account correlated blocking.
We consider a cellular uplink with both diversity combining and selection
combining schemes. We also study the impact of blockage size and blockage
density. We show that blocking can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one
hand, the signal from the source transmitter could be blocked, and on the other
hand, interfering signals tend to also be blocked, which leads to a completely
different effect on macrodiversity gains. We also show that the assumption of
independent blocking can lead to an incorrect evaluation of macrodiversity
gain, as the correlation tends to decrease macrodiversity gain.

still a lack of rigorous analysis for secure WSNs operating under the
q-composite scheme in consideration of the unreliability of links. One main
difficulty lies in analyzing the network topology, whose links are not
independent. Wireless links can be unreliable in practice due to the presence
of physical barriers between sensors or because of harsh environmental
conditions severely impairing communications. In this paper, we resolve the
difficult challenge and investigate topological properties related to node
degree in WSNs operating under the q-composite scheme with unreliable
communication links modeled as independent ON/OFF channels. Specifically, we
derive the asymptotically exact probability for the property of minimum degree
being at least k, present the asymptotic probability distribution for the
minimum degree, and demonstrate that the number of nodes with a fixed degree is
in distribution asymptotically equivalent to a Poisson random variable. We
further use the theoretical results to provide useful design guidelines for
secure WSNs. Experimental results also confirm the validity of our analytical
findings.

fluid are investigated in the context of the $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, for
which $R$ and $\mathcal{T}$ stand for the Ricci scalar and the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor, respectively. By considering the functional form $f(R,
\mathcal{T})=R+2\chi \mathcal{T}$, where $\chi$ is the matter-geometry coupling
constant, and for a Gaussian ansatz for the electric distribution, some
physical properties of charged white dwarfs were derived, namely: mass, radius,
charge, electric field, effective pressure and energy density; their dependence
on the parameter $\chi$ was also derived. In particular, the $\chi$ value
important for the equilibrium configurations of charged white dwarfs has the
same scale of $10^{-4}$ of that for non-charged stars and the order of the
charge was $10^{20}$C, which is scales with the value of one solar mass, i.e.,
$\sqrt{G}M_\odot\sim 10^{20}$C. We have also shown that charged white dwarf
stars in the context of the $f(R,\mathcal{T})$ have surface electric fields
generally below the Schwinger limit of $1.3\times 10^{18}$V/m. In particular, a
striking feature of the coupling between the effects of charge and
$f(R,\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory is that the modifications in the background
gravity increase the stellar radius, which in turn diminishes the surface
electric field, thus enhancing stellar stability of charged stars. Most
importantly, our study reveals that the present $f(R,T)$ gravity model can
suitably explain the super-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white dwarfs, which are
supposed to be the reason behind the over-luminous SNeIa and remain mostly
unexplained in the background of general relativity (GR).

a group of voters decide to misrepresent their vote in order to secure an

honestly. The present paper is devoted to study coalitional manipulability
within the class of scoring voting rules. For any such rule and any number of
alternatives, we introduce a new approach allowing to characterize all the
outcomes that can be manipulable by a coalition of voters. This gives us the
possibility to find the probability of manipulable outcomes for some
well-studied scoring voting rules in case of small number of alternatives and
large electorates under a well-known assumption on individual preference

important for oil exploration. Poststack depth migration in frequency-space
(f-x) domain is one of commonly used algorithms. The wave-equation solution can
be approximated as FIR filtering process to extrapolate the raw data and
extract the subsurface image. Because of its computational complexity, its
parallel implementation is encouraged. For calculating the next depth level,
previous depth level is required. So, this part cannot be parallelized because
of data dependence. But at each depth level there is plenty of roam for
parallelism and can be parallelized. In case of CUDA programming, each thread
calculate a single pixel on the next depth plan. After calculating the next
depth plan, we can calculate the depth row by summing over all the frequencies
and calculating all the depth rows results in the final migrated image. The
poststack depth migration is implemented in CUDA and its performance is
evaluated with the sequential code with different problem sizes.

day to represent the as is state of the original one due to the availability of
high resolution digital cameras, smartphones, and medical tests images.
Therefore, we need to come up with some technique to convert these images into
smaller size without loosing much information from the actual. There are both
lossy and lossless image compression format available and JPEG is one of the
popular lossy compression among them. In this paper, we present the
architecture and implementation of JPEG compression using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware
Description Language) and compare the performance with some contemporary
implementation. JPEG compression takes place in five steps with color space
conversion, down sampling, discrete cosine transformation (DCT), quantization,
and entropy encoding. The five steps cover for the compression purpose only.
Additionally, we implement the reverse order in VHDL to get the original image
back. We use optimized matrix multiplication and quantization for DCT to
achieve better performance. Our experimental results show that significant
amount of compression ratio has been achieved with very little change in the
images, which is barely noticeable to human eye.

distribution systems. In addition to their main use as connecting elements,
transmission lines can also be employed as continuous sensors for the
measurement and detection of external influences such as mechanical strains and
deformations. The measuring principle is based on deformation-induced changes
of the characteristic impedance. Reflections of an injected test signal at
resulting impedance mismatches can be used to infer applied deformations. To
determine the effect of deformations on the characteristic impedance, we
develop a numerical framework that allows us to solve Maxwell's equations for
any desired transmission-line geometry over a wide frequency range. The
proposed framework utilizes a staggered finite-difference Yee method on
non-uniform grids to efficiently solve a set of decoupled partial differential
equations that we derive from the frequency domain Maxwell equations. To test
our framework, we compare simulation results with analytical predictions and
corresponding experimental data. Our results suggest that the proposed
numerical framework is able to capture experimentally observed deformation
effects and may therefore be used in transmission-line-based deformation and
strain sensing applications. Furthermore, our framework can also be utilized to
simulate and study the electromagnetic properties of complex arrangements of
conductor, insulator, and shielding materials.
