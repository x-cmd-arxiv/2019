  mechanics at fixed Reynolds number",,,,,"math.AP math.DS math.PR physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1959, Batchelor predicted that the stationary statistics of passive
scalars advected in fluids with small diffusivity $\kappa$ should display a
$|k|^{-1}$ power spectrum along an inertial range contained in the
viscous-convective range of the fluid model. This prediction has been
extensively tested, both experimentally and numerically, and is a core
prediction of passive scalar turbulence.
  In this article we provide a rigorous proof of a version of Batchelor's
prediction in the $\kappa \to 0$ limit when the scalar is subjected to a
spatially-smooth, white-in-time stochastic source and is advected by the 2D
Navier-Stokes equations or 3D hyperviscous Navier-Stokes equations in
$\mathbb{T}^d$ forced by sufficiently regular, nondegenerate stochastic
forcing. Although our results hold for fluids at arbitrary Reynolds number,
this value is fixed throughout. Our results rely on the quantitative
understanding of Lagrangian chaos and passive scalar mixing established in our
recent works. Additionally, in the $\kappa \to 0$ limit, we obtain
statistically stationary, weak solutions in $H^{-\epsilon}$ to the
stochastically-forced advection problem without diffusivity. These solutions
are almost-surely not locally integrable distributions with non-vanishing
average anomalous flux and satisfy the Batchelor spectrum at all sufficiently
small scales. We also prove an Onsager-type criticality result which shows that
no such dissipative, weak solutions with a little more regularity can exist.

$(-1)^d$. Persistent magnitude has good formal properties, such as additivity
with respect to exact sequences and compatibility with tensor products, and has
interpretations in terms of both the associated graded functor, and the Laplace
transform.
  Our definition is inspired by Otter's notion of blurred magnitude homology:
we show that the magnitude of a finite metric space is precisely the persistent
magnitude of its blurred magnitude homology. Turning this result on its head,
we obtain a strategy for turning existing persistent homology theories into new
numerical invariants by applying the persistent magnitude. We explore this
strategy in detail in the case of persistent homology of Morse functions, and
in the case of Rips homology.

available data (usually 50% to 80%) is used for training and the rest for
validation. In many problems, however, the data is highly imbalanced in regard
to different classes or does not have good coverage of the feasible data space
which, in turn, creates problems in validation and usage phase. In this paper,
we propose a technique for synthesising feasible and likely data to help
balance the classes as well as to boost the performance in terms of confusion
matrix as well as overall. The idea, in a nutshell, is to synthesise data
samples in close vicinity to the actual data samples specifically for the less
represented (minority) classes. This has also implications to the so-called
fairness of machine learning. In this paper, we propose a specific method for
synthesising data in a way to balance the classes and boost the performance,
especially of the minority classes. It is generic and can be applied to
different base algorithms, e.g. support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour,
deep networks, rule-based classifiers, decision trees, etc. The results
demonstrated that: i) a significantly more balanced (and fair) classification
results can be achieved; ii) that the overall performance as well as the
performance per class measured by confusion matrix can be boosted. In addition,
this approach can be very valuable for the cases when the number of actual
available labelled data is small which itself is one of the problems of the
contemporary machine learning.

Despite the competition for the same limiting resource, coexistence of several
plant species is commonly observed. We propose a two-species reaction-diffusion
model based on the single-species Klausmeier model, to analytically investigate
the existence of states in which both species coexist. Ecologically, the study
finds that coexistence is supported if there is a small difference in the plant
species' average fitness, measured by the ratio of a species' capabilities to
convert water into new biomass to its mortality rate. Mathematically,
coexistence is not a stable solution of the system, but both spatially uniform
and patterned coexistence states occur as metastable states. In this context, a
metastable solution in which both species coexist corresponds to a long
transient (exceeding $10^3$ years in dimensional parameters) to a stable
one-species state. This behaviour is characterised by the small size of a
positive eigenvalue which has the same order of magnitude as the average
fitness difference between the two species. Two mechanisms causing the
occurrence of metastable solutions are established: a spatially uniform
unstable equilibrium and a stable one-species pattern which is unstable to the
introduction of a competitor. We further discuss effects of asymmetric
interspecific competition (e.g. shading) on the metastability property.

a subjective, time-consuming evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert
clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity
and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However,
successful construction of deep learning models from fMRI requires addressing
key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and
number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC)
features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of
granularity. Once a model has been built, it is vital to determine which
features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas
granularity levels. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations,
probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing
models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity
features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important
features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the
highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per
layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important
across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor
gyrus and language association cortex, regions associated with deficits in
social and sensory processing in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not
included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal
connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify
important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the
selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of
granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.

learning (ML) systems can fail because of adversarial attacks on the algorithms
and data; this number balloons if we were to incorporate papers covering
non-adversarial failure modes. The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML
practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with
the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems
become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the
hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only
become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident
responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about
this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into ""Intentional
failures"" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to
subvert the system to attain her goals; and ""Unintentional failures"" where the
failure is because an ML system produces an inherently unsafe outcome. After
developing the initial version of the taxonomy last year, we worked with
security and ML teams across Microsoft, 23 external partners, standards
organization, and governments to understand how stakeholders would use our
framework. Throughout the paper, we attempt to highlight how machine learning
failure modes are meaningfully different from traditional software failures

individual discoveries remain sparse and depend on detection technique. To
utilize more than a small section of the exoplanet dataset, tools need to be
developed to estimate missing values based on the known measurements. Here, we
demonstrate the use of a neural network that models the density of planets in a
space of six properties that is then used to impute a probability distribution
for missing values. Our results focus on planetary mass which neither the
radial velocity nor transit techniques for planet identification can provide
alone. The neural network can impute mass across the four orders of magnitude
in the exoplanet archive, and return a distribution of masses for each planet
that can inform about trends in the underlying dataset. The average error on
this mass estimate from a radial velocity detection is a factor of 1.5 of the
observed value, and 2.7 for a transit observation. The mass of Proxima Centauri
b found by this method is $1.6^{\rm +0.46}_{\rm -0.36}$ M$_\oplus$, where the
upper and lower bounds are derived from the root mean square deviation from the
log mass probability distribution. The network can similarly impute the other
potentially missing properties, and we use this to predict planet radius for
radial velocity measurements, with an average error of a factor 1.4 of the
observed value. The ability of neural networks to search for patterns in
multidimensional data means that such techniques have the potential to greatly
expand the use of the exoplanet catalogue.

Klausmeier model, a coupled reaction-advection-diffusion system, is a
deliberately simple model describing the phenomenon. In this paper, we replace
the diffusion term describing plant dispersal by a more realistic nonlocal
convolution integral to account for the possibility of long-range dispersal of
seeds. Our analysis focuses on the rainfall level at which there is a
transition between uniform vegetation and pattern formation. We obtain results,
valid to leading order in the large parameter comparing the rate of water flow
downhill to the rate of plant dispersal, for a negative exponential dispersal
kernel. Our results indicate that both a wider dispersal of seeds and an
increase in dispersal rate inhibit the formation of patterns. Assuming an
evolutionary trade-off between these two quantities, mathematically motivated
by the limiting behaviour of the convolution term, allows us to make
comparisons to existing results for the original reaction-advection-diffusion
system. These comparisons show that the nonlocal model always predicts a larger
parameter region supporting pattern formation. We then numerically extend the
results to other dispersal kernels, showing that the tendency to form patterns
depends on the type of decay of the kernel.

allow for efficient sampling of fully internally-contracted multireference

described to allow for the close control over the resolution of stochastic
sampling of the effective higher-body intermediates within the active space. It
is found that while CASPT2 seems less amenable to a stochastic reformulation,
NEVPT2 is far more stable, requiring a similar number of walkers to converge
the NEVPT2 expectation values as to converge the underlying CI problem. We
demonstrate the application of the stochastic approach to the computation of
NEVPT2 within a (24,24) active space in a biologically relevant system, and
show that small numbers of walkers are sufficient for a faithful sampling of
the NEVPT2 energy to chemical accuracy, despite the active space already
exceeding the limits of practicality for traditional approaches. This raises
prospects of an efficient stochastic solver for multireference chemical
problems requiring large active spaces, with an accurate treatment of external

some aspects of fairness. The notion of envy being inherently subjective
though, it might be the case that an agent envies another agent, but that she
objectively has no reason to do so. The difficulty here is to define the notion
of objectivity, since no ground-truth can properly serve as a basis of this
definition. A natural approach is to consider the judgement of the other agents
as a proxy for objectivity. Building on previous work by Parijs (who introduced
""unanimous envy"") we propose the notion of approval envy: an agent $a_i$
experiences approval envy towards $a_j$ if she is envious of $a_j$, and
sufficiently many agents agree that this should be the case, from their own
perspectives. Some interesting properties of this notion are put forward.

to eternal remnants for sufficiently small black holes and evaporates to a
thermodynamic stable extremel black hole remnants with vanishing temperature.

of correlations that arise from making local measurements on entangled states
of arbitrary dimension. Currently, the best-known method to tackle this problem
is the NPA hierarchy; an infinite sequence of semidefinite programs that
provides increasingly tighter outer approximations to the desired set of
correlations. In this work we consider a more general scenario in which one
performs sequences of local measurements on an entangled state of arbitrary
dimension. We show that a simple adaptation of the original NPA hierarchy
provides an analogous hierarchy for this scenario, with comparable resource
requirements and convergence properties. We then use the method to tackle some
problems in device-independent quantum information. First, we show how one can
robustly certify over 2.3 bits of device-independent local randomness from a
two-quibt state using a sequence of measurements, going beyond the theoretical
maximum of two bits that can be achieved with non-sequential measurements.
Finally, we show tight upper bounds to two previously defined tasks in
sequential Bell test scenarios.

GPTs based on a Gleason-type theorem, we fully characterize these structures
with respect to their permission and rejection of generalized (non)contextual
ontological models. It follows that in any GPT construction the three
insistence of (i) the no-restriction hypothesis, (ii) the ontological

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is considered as one of the
leading candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the near term. QAOA
is a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximately solving
combinatorial optimization problems. The quality of the solution obtained by
QAOA for a given problem instance depends on the performance of the classical
optimizer used to optimize the variational parameters. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of finding optimal QAOA parameters as a learning task in
which the knowledge gained from solving training instances can be leveraged to
find high-quality solutions for unseen test instances. To this end, we develop
two machine-learning-based approaches. Our first approach adopts a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn a policy network to optimize
QAOA circuits. Our second approach adopts a kernel density estimation (KDE)
technique to learn a generative model of optimal QAOA parameters. In both
approaches, the training procedure is performed on small-sized problem
instances that can be simulated on a classical computer; yet the learned RL
policy and the generative model can be used to efficiently solve larger
problems. Extensive simulations using the IBM Qiskit Aer quantum circuit
simulator demonstrate that our proposed RL- and KDE-based approaches reduce the
optimality gap by factors up to 30.15 when compared with other commonly used

from the acoustic attenuation induced by the magneto-elastic (ME) interaction
between the SAW strain field and spin waves in the ferromagnetic film, which
depends on the SAW propagation direction and can be controlled via the
amplitude and orientation of an external magnetic field. The acoustic
transmission non-reciprocity, defined as the difference between the transmitted
acoustic power for forward and backward propagation under ME resonance, reaches
values of up to 20%, which are, to our knowledge, the largest non-reciprocity
reported for SAWs traveling along a semiconducting piezoelectric substrate
covered by a ferromagnetic film. The experimental results are well accounted
for by a model for ME interaction, which also shows that non-reciprocity can be
further enhanced by optimization of the sample design. These results make
Fe$_3$Si/GaAs a promising platform for the realization of efficient

inelastic X-ray scattering measurements and with density-functional-theory
based first-principles calculations in the ferromagnetic low-temperature and
paramagnetic high-temperature phase. In experiments and calculations, we
observe pronounced differences in the shape of the Fe-partial VDOS between
non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated samples. This shows that hydrogen does not
only shift the temperature of the first-order phase transition, but also
affects the elastic response of the Fe-subsystem significantly. In turn, the
anomalous redshift of the Fe VDOS, observed by going to the low-volume PM
phase, survives hydrogenation. As a consequence, the change in the Fe specific
vibrational entropy $\Delta S_\mathrm{lat}$ across the phase transition has the
same sign as the magnetic and electronic contribution. DFT calculations show
that the same mechanism, which is a consequence of the itinerant electron
metamagnetism associated with the Fe subsystem, is effective in both the
hydrogenated and he hydrogen-free compounds. Although reduced by 50 % as
compared to the hydrogen-free system, the measured change $\Delta
S_\mathrm{lat}$ of 3.2\pm1.9 J/kgK across the FM to PM transition contributes
with 35 % significantly and cooperatively to the total isothermal entropy
change $\Delta S_\mathrm{iso}$. Hydrogenation is observed to induce an overall
blueshift of the Fe-VDOS with respect to the H-free compound; this effect,
together with the enhanced Debye temperature observed, is a fingerprint of the
hardening of the Fe sublattice by hydrogen incorporation. In addition, the mean
Debye velocity of sound of LaFe$_{11.4}$Si$_{1.6}$H$_{1.6}$ was determined from

TCs develop far from land-based observing networks, geostationary satellite

challenging to analyze in real time, and off-the-shelf machine learning
algorithms have limited applicability on this front due to their ``black box''

lower-dimensional but rich representations that support analysis and

uses the logistic lasso, a penalized generalized linear model, to relate
predictors to rapid intensity change. Using ORB alone, binary classifiers

achieve accuracy comparable to classifiers using environmental predictors

presence of magnetic field improves the evaporation rates of ferrofluid
droplets. First we tackle the question of improved evaporation of the colloidal
droplets compared to water, and propose physical mechanisms to explain the
same. Experiments show that the changes in evaporation rates aided by the
magnetic field cannot be explained on the basis of changes in surface tension,
or based on classical diffusion driven evaporation models. Probing using
particle image velocimetry shows that the internal advection kinetics of such
droplets plays a direct role towards the augmented evaporation rates by
modulating the associated Stefan flow. Infrared thermography reveal changes in
the thermal gradients within the droplet and evaluating the dynamic surface
tension reveals presence of solutal gradients within the droplet, both brought
about by the external field. Based on the premise, a scaling analysis of the
internal magnetothermal and magnetosolutal ferroadvection behavior is
presented. The model incorporates the role of the governing Hartmann number,
the magnetothermal Prandtl number and the magnetosolutal Schmidt number. The
analysis and stability maps reveal that the magneto-solutal ferroadvection is
the more dominant mechanism, and the model is able to predict the internal
advection velocities with accuracy. Further, another scaling model to predict
the modified Stefan flow is proposed, and is found to accurately predict the

When maximum ratio combining (MRC) is used at the BSs, the re-use of pilots
across cells causes the pilot contamination effect which yields interference
components that do not vanish as the number of base-station (BS) antennas $M
\rightarrow \infty$. When treating interference as noise (TIN), this phenomenon
limits the performance of multi-cell massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we
analyze more advanced schemes based on simultaneous unique decoding (SD) as
well as simultaneous non-unique decoding (SND) of the interference that can
provide unbounded rate as $M \rightarrow \infty$. We also establish a
worst-case uncorrelated noise technique for multiple-access channels to derive
achievable rate expressions for finite $M$. Furthermore, we study a much

chirality of matter through optical means. So far, experiments to check the
chirality of matter or nanostructures have been carried out using free-space
propagating light beams. However, for the sake of miniaturization, it would be
desirable to perform chiral spectroscopy in photonic integrated platforms, with
the additional benefit of massive parallel detection, low-cost production,
repeatability, and portability of such a chiroptical device. Here we show that
all-dielectric integrated photonic waveguides can support chiral modes under
proper combination of the fundamental eigenmodes. In particular, we investigate
two mainstream configurations: a dielectric wire with square cross-section and
a slotted waveguide. We analyze numerically three different scenarios in which
such waveguides could be used for chiral detection: all-dielectric waveguides
as near-field probes, evanescent-induced chiral fields, and chiroptical
interaction in void slots. In all the cases we consider a metallic nanohelix as
a chiral probe, though all the approaches can be extended to other kinds of
chiral nanostructures as well as matter. Our results establish that chiral
applications such as sensing and spectroscopy could be realized in standard
integrated optics, in particular, with silicon-based technology.

describing the power system dynamics, which is a nonlinear second order
differential equation. Existing challenges: No analytical solution to the swing
equation has been identified, due to the complex nature of power systems. Two
major approaches are pursued for stability assessments on systems: (1)
computationally simple models based on physically unacceptable assumptions, and
(2) digital simulations with high computational costs. Motivation: The motion
of the rotor angle that the swing equation describes is a vector function.
Often, a simple form of the physical laws is revealed by coordinate
transformation. Methods: The study included the formulation of the swing
equation in the Cartesian coordinate system, which is different from
conventional approaches that describe the equation in the polar coordinate
system. Based on the properties and operational conditions of electric power
grids referred to in the literature, we identified the swing equation in the
Cartesian coordinate system and derived an analytical solution within a
validity region. Results: The estimated results from the analytical solution
derived in this study agree with the results using conventional methods, which
indicates the derived analytical solution is correct. Conclusion: An analytical
solution to the swing equation is derived without unphysical assumptions, and
the closed-form solution correctly estimates the dynamics after a fault occurs.

If the gauge boson is light, it can mediate both elastic and inelastic dark
matter self-interactions in dark halos, leading to observational consequences.
Using a numerical technique based on partial wave analysis, we accurately
calculate the elastic and inelastic self-scattering cross sections. We assume a
thermal freeze-out scenario and fix the gauge coupling constant using the relic
density constraint. Then, we focus on six benchmark masses of dark matter,
covering a wide range from $10~{\rm MeV}$ to $160~{\rm GeV}$ and map parameter
regions where the elastic scattering cross section per unit mass is within
$1~{\rm cm^2/g} - 5~{\rm cm^2/g}$, favored to solve small-scale issues of cold
dark matter. If the heavy state can decay to the light state and a massless
species, the inelastic up-scattering process can cool the halo and lead to core
collapse. Taking galaxies with evidence of dark matter density cores, we
further derive constraints on the parameter space. For dark matter masses below
$10~{\rm GeV}$, the mass splitting must be large enough to forbid up scattering
in the dwarf halo for evading the core-collapse constraint; while for higher
masses, the up-scattering process can still be allowed. Our results show
astrophysical observations can provide powerful tests for dark matter models

Many existing graph kernels, which focus on local patterns within graphs rather
than their global properties, suffer from significant structure information
loss when representing graphs. Some recent global graph kernels, which utilizes
the alignment of geometric node embeddings of graphs, yield state-of-the-art
performance. However, these graph kernels are not necessarily
positive-definite. More importantly, computing the graph kernel matrix will
have at least quadratic {time} complexity in terms of the number and the size
of the graphs. In this paper, we propose a new family of global alignment graph
kernels, which take into account the global properties of graphs by using
geometric node embeddings and an associated node transportation based on earth
mover's distance. Compared to existing global kernels, the proposed kernel is
positive-definite. Our graph kernel is obtained by defining a distribution over
\emph{random graphs}, which can naturally yield random feature approximations.
The random feature approximations lead to our graph embeddings, which is named
as ""random graph embeddings"" (RGE). In particular, RGE is shown to achieve
\emph{(quasi-)linear scalability} with respect to the number and the size of
the graphs. The experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate
that RGE outperforms or matches twelve state-of-the-art graph classification
algorithms.

tasks in areas such as bioinformatics, text, and audio mining. Existing string

the string, which hardly capture long discriminative patterns, (ii) sum over
too many substructures, such as all possible subsequences, which leads to
diagonal dominance of the kernel matrix, or (iii) rely on non-positive-definite
similarity measures derived from the edit distance. Furthermore, while there
have been works addressing the computational challenge with respect to the
length of string, most of them still experience quadratic complexity in terms
of the number of training samples when used in a kernel-based classifier. In
this paper, we present a new class of global string kernels that aims to (i)
discover global properties hidden in the strings through global alignments,
(ii) maintain positive-definiteness of the kernel, without introducing a
diagonal dominant kernel matrix, and (iii) have a training cost linear with
respect to not only the length of the string but also the number of training
string samples. To this end, the proposed kernels are explicitly defined
through a series of different random feature maps, each corresponding to a
distribution of random strings. We show that kernels defined this way are
always positive-definite, and exhibit computational benefits as they always
produce \emph{Random String Embeddings (RSE)} that can be directly used in any
linear classification models. Our extensive experiments on nine benchmark

potential in Randall-Sundrum scenarios, with the Goldberger-Wise stabilization
mechanism. Various prescriptions have been used in the literature, most of them
based on heuristic derivations and then applied in some approximations. We
define rigorously a light radion 4D effective action by using the interpolating
field method. For a given choice of the interpolating field, defined as a
functional of 5D fields, the radion effective action is uniquely defined by the
procedure of integrating out the other fields, with the constrained 5D
equations of motion always satisfied with help of the Lagrange multipliers.
Thus, for a given choice of the interpolating fields we obtain a precise
prescription for calculating the effective potential. Different choices of the
interpolating fields give different prescriptions but in most cases very
similar effective potentials. We confirm the correctness of one prescription
used so far on a more heuristic basis and also find several new, much more
economical, ways of calculating the radion effective potential. Our general
considerations are illustrated by several numerical examples. It is shown that
in some cases the old methods, especially in models with strong back-reaction,
give results which are off even by orders of magnitude. Thus, our results are
important e.g. for estimation of critical temperature in phase transitions.

intersect the boundary at arbitrary angles. The entanglement entropy (EE)
contains a logarithmic contribution coming from the chiral edge modes, and
matches the corresponding conformal field theory prediction. We uncover an

understanding the nature of dark matter and the physics of the early cosmos.
Different observables have been able to map this distribution at large scales,
corresponding to wavenumbers $k\lesssim 10$ Mpc$^{-1}$, but smaller scales
remain much less constrained. The 21-cm line is a promising tracer of early
stellar formation, which took place in small haloes (with masses $M\sim
10^6-10^8M_\odot$), formed out of matter overdensities with wavenumbers as
large as $k\approx100$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here we forecast how well both the 21-cm
global signal, and its fluctuations, could probe the matter power spectrum
during cosmic dawn ($z=12-25$). We find that the long-wavelength modes (with
$k\lesssim40$ Mpc$^{-1}$) are highly degenerate with astrophysical parameters,
whereas the modes with $k= (40-80)$ Mpc$^{-1}$ are more readily observable.
This is further illustrated in terms of the principal components of the matter
power spectrum, which peak at $k\sim 50$ Mpc$^{-1}$ both for a typical
experiment measuring the 21-cm global signal and its fluctuations. We find
that, imposing broad priors on astrophysical parameters, a global-signal
experiment can measure the amplitude of the matter power spectrum integrated
over $k= (40-80)$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with a precision of tens of percent. A fluctuation
experiment, on the other hand, can constrain the power spectrum to a similar
accuracy over both the $k=(40-60)$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $(60-80)$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ranges
even without astrophysical priors. The constraints outlined in this work would
be able to test the behavior of dark matter at the smallest scales yet
measured, for instance probing warm-dark matter masses up to $m_{\rm WDM}=8$
keV for the global signal and $14$ keV for the 21-cm fluctuations. This could
shed light on the nature of dark matter beyond the reach of other cosmic
probes.

general, linear in only one direction, and as a consequence their band
structure is characterized by the monopole charge $n$ which can be greater than
one. We show that a single screw dislocation defect oriented in the direction
connecting the nodal points, which acts as an effective pseudo-magnetic flux
tube, can serve as a direct probe of the monopole charge $n\geq1$
characterizing the bulk band structure of a multi-Weyl semimetal. To this end,
as a proof of principle, we propose a rather simple mesoscopic setup in which
the monopole charge leaves a direct imprint on the conductance measured in the
plane perpendicular to the dislocation. In particular, the ratio of the
positions of the neighboring maxima in the conductance as a function of the
gate voltage can serve to deduce the monopole charge, while the value of the
effective pseudo-magnetic flux can be extracted from the position of a
conductance maximum. We expect that these findings will prompt further studies
on the role of multiple dislocations, as well as other topological lattice
defects, such as grain boundaries and disclinations, in topological nodal

A trans-Planckian axion decay constant can only be realized if the potential
exhibits an additional (subdominant) modulation with sub-Planckian periodicity.
The resulting wiggles in the axion potential generate a characteristic
modulation in the scalar power spectrum of inflation which is logarithmic in
the angular scale. The compatibility of this modulation is tested against the
most recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data by Planck and BICEP/Keck.
Intriguingly, we find that the modulation completely resolves the tension of
natural inflation with the CMB. A Bayesian model comparison reveals that
natural inflation with modulations describes all existing data equally well as
the cosmological standard model $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, the bound of a
tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.002 correlated with a striking small-scale
suppression of the scalar power spectrum occurs. Future CMB experiments could
directly probe the modulation through their improved sensitivity to smaller
angular scales and possibly the measurement of spectral distortions. They
could, thus, verify a key prediction of the weak gravity conjecture and provide
dramatic new insights into the theory of quantum gravity.

the case in the well-studied spiral galaxy M83, where one microquasar candidate
(M83-MQ1) has already been identified, we studied the properties of nine SNR
candidates, selected because of their elongated or irregular morphology, from
the set of previously identified SNRs in that galaxy. Using multiwavelength
data from Chandra, the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array, we found that at least six of our nine sources are
best interpreted as SNRs. For one source, we do not have enough observational
data to explain its linear morphology. Another source shows a nebular optical
spectrum dominated by photo-ionization by O stars, but its excess [Fe II] and
radio luminosity suggest a possible hidden SNR. Finally, one source (S2) shows
an elongated structure of ionized gas, two radio sources along that line, and
an accretion-powered X-ray source in between them (the Chandra source L14-139).
While S2 could be a chance alignment of multiple SNRs and one X-ray binary, it
seems more likely that it is a single physical structure powered by the jet
from the accreting compact object. In the latter case, the size and luminosity
of S2 suggest a kinetic power of around 10^{40} erg/s, in the same class as the

mass of $ 2 \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ with C/H $\approx 3 \times 10^{-6}$ and O/H
$\approx 6 \times 10^{-6}$. The elemental oxygen and carbon abundances of the
inner disk are $\sim 50$ times underabundant compared to the ISM and are
consistent with those found in the outer disk. The uniformly low volatile
abundances imply that the inner disk is not enriched by ices on drifting bodies
that evaporate. This indicates that drifting grains are stopped in a dust trap
outside the water ice line. Such a dust trap would also form a cavity as seen
in high resolution sub-millimeter continuum observations. If CO is the major
carbon carrier in the ices, dust needs to be trapped efficiently outside the CO
ice line of $\sim$20 AU. This would imply that the shallow sub-millimeter rings
in the TW Hya disk outside of 20 AU correspond to very efficient dust traps.
The more likely scenario is that more than 98\% of the CO has been converted
into less volatile species, e.g. CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH. A giant planet forming in
the inner disk would be accreting gas with low carbon and oxygen abundances as
well as very little icy dust, potentially leading to a planet atmosphere with
strongly substellar C/H and O/H ratios.

and intimately connected to the galaxy via accretion of gas on to the galaxy
and gaseous outflows from the galaxy. Here we analyse the magnetic field in the
CGM of the Milky Way-like galaxies simulated as part of the \textsc{Auriga}
project that constitutes a set of high resolution cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical zoom simulations. We show that before $z=1$ the CGM
becomes magnetised via galactic outflows that transport magnetised gas from the
disk into the halo. At this time the magnetisation of the CGM closely follows
its metal enrichment. We then show that at low redshift an in-situ turbulent
dynamo that operates on a timescale of Gigayears further amplifies the magnetic
field in the CGM and saturates before $z=0$. The magnetic field strength
reaches a typical value of $0.1\,\mu G$ at the virial radius at $z=0$ and
becomes mostly uniform within the virial radius. Its Faraday rotation signal is
in excellent agreement with recent observations. For most of its evolution the
magnetic field in the CGM is an unordered small scale field. Only strong
coherent outflows at low redshift are able to order the magnetic field in parts
of the CGM that are directly displaced by these outflows.

stellar distribution, where they are commonly referred to as the circumgalactic
medium (CGM), imprint important information about feedback processes powered by
the stellar populations of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes
(SMBH). In this work we study the properties of this hot X-ray emitting medium
using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We analyse their mock X-ray
spectra, obtained from the diffuse and metal-enriched gas in TNG100 and TNG50,
and compare the results with X-ray observations of nearby early-type galaxies.
The simulations reproduce the observed X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm X}$) and
temperature ($T_{\rm X})$ at small ($<R_{\rm e}$) and intermediate ($<5R_{\rm
e}$) radii reasonably well. We find that the X-ray properties of lower mass
galaxies depend on their star formation rates. In particular, in the magnitude
range where the star-forming and quenched populations overlap, $M_{\rm
K}\sim-24$ $ (M_*\sim10^{10.7}M_\odot)$, we find that the X-ray luminosities of
star-forming galaxies are on average about an order of magnitude higher than
those of their quenched counterparts. We show that this diversity in $L_{\rm
X}$ is a direct manifestation of the quenching mechanism in the simulations,
where the galaxies are quenched due to gas expulsion driven by SMBH kinetic
feedback. The observed dichotomy in $L_{\rm X}$ is thus an important observable
prediction for the SMBH feedback-based quenching mechanisms implemented in
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. While the current X-ray observations
of star forming galaxies are broadly consistent with the predictions of the
simulations, the observed samples are small and more decisive tests are
expected from the sensitive all-sky X-ray survey with eROSITA.

angular momentum (OAM). Various predictions of the intrinsic OAM density or the
macroscopic OAM of a two-dimensional chiral superfluid differ by several orders
of magnitude, which constitute the so-called Angular Momentum Paradox.
Following several previous studies, we substantiate the semiclassical
Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory of the single-particle edge current and OAM in
two-dimensional chiral superfluids in the BCS limit. The analysis provides a
simple intuitive understanding for the vanishing of OAM for a non-p-wave chiral
superfluid (such as $d+id$) confined in a rigid potential. When generalized to
anisotropic chiral superconductors and three-dimensional chiral superfluids,
the theory similarly returns an accurate description. We also present a
detailed numerical study of the chiral phases in the BEC limit. Our study
suggests that, in both BCS and BEC phases the relative OAM of the individual
Cooper pairs contribute to the total OAM additively, and that in both phases
the corresponding macroscopic OAM density distribution is localized at the
boundary.

quantum coherence of its state, leading to an effective classical dynamics at
the longest time scales. We show that systems with anyon-like defects can
exhibit universal late-time dynamics that is stochastic, but fundamentally
non-classical, because some of the quantum information about the state is
topologically protected from the environment.
  Our coarse-grained model describes one-dimensional systems with domain-wall
defects carrying Majorana modes. These defects undergo Brownian motion due to
coupling with a bath. Since the fermion parity of a given pair of defects is
nonlocal, it cannot be measured by the bath until the two defects happen to
come into contact. We examine how such a system anneals to zero temperature via
the diffusion and pairwise annihilation of Majorana defects, and we
characterize the nontrivial entanglement structure that arises in such
stochastic processes.
  Separately, we also investigate simplified ""quantum measurement circuits"" in
one or more dimensions, involving repeated pairwise measurement of fermion
parities for a lattice of Majoranas. The dynamics of these circuits can be
solved by exact mappings to classical loop models. They yield analytically
tractable examples of measurement-induced phase transitions, with critical
entanglement structures that are governed by nonunitary conformal fixed points.
  In the system of diffusing and annihilating Majorana defects, the relaxation
to the ground state is analogous to coarsening in a classical 1D Ising model
via domain wall annihilation. Here, however, configurations are labeled not
only by the defect positions but by a nonlocal entanglement structure. The
resulting dynamical process is a new universality class for the coarsening of
topological domain walls, whose universal properties can be obtained from an
exact mapping.

that the multiplication map $W/U \times U \to W$ is a length-additive
bijection, or splitting, of the Weyl group $W$ when $U$ is an order ideal in
right weak order generated by a separable element; this generalizes a result
for the symmetric group, answering an open problem of Wei.
  For a generalized quotient of the symmetric group, we show that this
multiplication map is a bijection if and only if $U$ is an order ideal in right
weak order generated by a separable element, thereby classifying those
generalized quotients which induce splittings of the symmetric group, resolving
a problem of Bj\""{o}rner and Wachs from 1988. We also prove that this map is
always surjective when $U$ is an order ideal in right weak order. Interpreting
these sets of permutations as linear extensions of 2-dimensional posets gives
the first direct combinatorial proof of an inequality due originally to
Sidorenko in 1991, answering an open problem Morales, Pak, and Panova. We also
prove a new $q$-analog of Sidorenko's formula. All of these results are
conjectured to extend to arbitrary finite Weyl groups.
  Finally, we show that separable elements in $W$ are in bijection with the
faces of all dimensions of several copies of the graph associahedron of the
Dynkin diagram of $W$. This correspondence associates to each separable element
$w$ a certain nested set; we give product formulas for the rank generating
functions of the principal upper and lower order ideals generated by $w$ in

link observed near-field amplitude changes to underlying structural modulations
and test ferroelectric switching models against real space measurements of
local structure. This initiative opens the door to broadband infrared

fundamental component of generalized intelligence. In this paper, we approach
the transfer learning challenge from a causal theory perspective. Our agent is
endowed with two basic yet general theories for transfer learning: (i) a task
shares a common abstract structure that is invariant across domains, and (ii)
the behavior of specific features of the environment remain constant across
domains. We adopt a Bayesian perspective of causal theory induction and use
these theories to transfer knowledge between environments. Given these general
theories, the goal is to train an agent by interactively exploring the problem
space to (i) discover, form, and transfer useful abstract and structural
knowledge, and (ii) induce useful knowledge from the instance-level attributes
observed in the environment. A hierarchy of Bayesian structures is used to
model abstract-level structural causal knowledge, and an instance-level
associative learning scheme learns which specific objects can be used to induce
state changes through interaction. This model-learning scheme is then
integrated with a model-based planner to achieve a task in the OpenLock
environment, a virtual ``escape room'' with a complex hierarchy that requires
agents to reason about an abstract, generalized causal structure. We compare
performances against a set of predominate model-free reinforcement learning(RL)
algorithms. RL agents showed poor ability transferring learned knowledge across
different trials. Whereas the proposed model revealed similar performance
trends as human learners, and more importantly, demonstrated transfer behavior
across trials and learning situations.

  resolution of long-standing difficulties",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Formation energies of charged point defects in semiconductors are calculated
using periodic supercells, which entail a divergence arising from long-range
Coulombic interactions. The divergence is typically removed by the so-called
jellium approach. Recently, Wu, Zhang and Pantelides [WZP, Phys. Rev. Lett.
119, 105501 (2017)] traced the origin of the divergence to the assumption that
charged defects are formed by physically removing electrons from or adding
electrons to the crystal, violating charge neutrality, a key principle of
statistical mechanics that determines the Fermi level. An alternative theory
was constructed by recognizing that ""charged"" defects form by trading carriers
with the energy bands, whereby supercells are always charge-neutral so that no
divergence is present and no ad-hoc procedures need to be adopted for
calculations. Here we give a more detailed exposition of the foundations of
both methods and show that the jellium approach can be derived from the
statistical-mechanics-backed WZP definition by steps whose validity cannot be
assessed a priori. In particular, the divergence appears when the charge
density of band carriers is dropped, leaving a supercharged crystal. In the
case of charged defects in two-dimensional (2D) materials, unphysical fields
appear in vacuum regions. None of these pathological features are present in
the reformulated theory. Finally, we report new calculations in both bulk and
2D materials. The WZP approach yields formation energies that differ from
jellium values by up to ~1 eV. By analyzing the spatial distribution of wave
functions and defect potentials, we provide insights into the inner workings of
both methods and demonstrate that the failure of the jellium approach to
include the neutralizing electron density of band carriers, as is the case in
the physical system, is responsible for the numerical differences between the
two methods.

compact outflow driven by Cha-MMS1 that would match the predictions of MHD
simulations for this short phase of star formation. We use the Atacama Large
Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to map Cha-MMS1 at high angular
resolution in CO 3-2 and 13CO 3-2 as well as in continuum emission. We report
the detection of a bipolar outflow emanating from the central core, along a
(projected) direction roughly parallel to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is
embedded and perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field. The morphology of
the outflow indicates that its axis lies close to the plane of the sky. We
measure velocities corrected for inclination of more than 90km/s which is
clearly incompatible with the expected properties of a FHSC outflow. Several
properties of the outflow are determined and compared to previous studies of
Class 0 and Class I protostars. The outflow of Cha-MMS1 has a much smaller
momentum force than the outflows of other Class 0 protostars. In addition, we
find a dynamical age of 200-3000yr indicating that Cha-MMS1 might be one of the
youngest ever observed Class 0 protostars. While the existence of the outflow
suggests the presence of a disk, no disk is detected in continuum emission and
we derive an upper limit of 55au to its radius. We conclude that Cha-MMS1 has
already gone through the FHSC phase and is a young Class 0 protostar, but it
has not brought its outflow to full power yet.

robustness of (Gaussian) maximum likelihood and cross validation towards
non-Gaussianity. Our proofs rely on two technical results that are of

inverses of large covariance matrices decay at an inverse polynomial rate as a
function of the corresponding observation location distances. Second, we
provide a general central limit theorem for quadratic forms obtained from

choose between models that display internal inconsistencies, or models that
include significant deviations with respect to general relativity, which should
therefore be amenable to observational tests via multi-messenger astrophysics.

describe a method for digitally programmable bitstream generation based on

efficient than SMTJ-based bitstream generators that tune probabilities with
spin currents and a factor of two more efficient than related CMOS-based

use them as the fundamental units of a novel neural network architecture. To
take advantage of the potential savings, we codesign the algorithm with the

the network to the explicitly energy efficient choices we make at the device

However, despite the increasing attention towards the inverse energy flux in
the Faraday flow and other not strictly two-dimensional systems, very little is
known about the velocity fields developing beneath the fluid surface. In this
study planar velocity fields are measured by means of particle image
velocimetry (PIV) with high spatial and temporal resolution on the water
surface and below it. A sudden drop in velocity is observed immediately below
the water surface, such that at 5 mm below the water surface the mean absolute
velocities are already about 6.5 times smaller than the surface velocity.
Additionally, the flow structures below the surface are found to comprise much
larger spatial scales than those on the surface. These large structures are
also found to be slow and temporarily persistent, as proven by analysing the
autocorrelation of the velocity fields in time.

utilizes a robust active stabilization system that has consistently
demonstrated a 1 sigma sky-fixed pointing stability at 48 milliarcseconds over
multiple 1 hour observations at float. This is achieved by actively tracking
compound pendulations via a three-axis gimballed platform, which provides
sky-fixed telescope stability at < 500 milliarcseconds and corrects for field
rotation, while employing high-bandwidth tip/tilt optics to remove residual
disturbances across the science imaging focal plane. SuperBIT's performance

were used to observe K+F corona scattering, which is critical for the
diagnostics presented here. The total distance between sites along the path of
totality was 1400 km, corresponding to a difference of 28 minutes between the

measure the Fe XI and Fe XIV emission relative to continuum scattering, as well
as the relative abundance of Fe 10+ and Fe 13+ from the line ratio. The

occurred throughout much of the corona between the sites as a result of

fine pointing, sun pointing, ground pointing for payload operation and idle
state detumbling. The actuation is carried out by interfacing magnetorquers and
reaction wheels with the OBC. The software of the onboard computer is
implemented on a Linux based operating system run on the ARM Cortex A9
processor which is part of the Zynq-7000 SoC. A Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) is used specifically for image compression. The compressed image is
stored in a serial flash memory shared between the camera and the FPGA. The
architecture comprises of a system-wide I2C bus to which the sensors
interfaced. The collected data is used for logging followed by downlink and as
input to algorithms used for pointing and detumbling. An SPI interface is used
between the Power Subsystem microcontroller and the On-Board Computer since a
large amount of housekeeping data will have to be exchanged at high rates.
Reaction wheels and magnetorquers are actuated by current driver circuits which
get the control signals from the OBC. The satellite is modelled as a Finite

categories, Normal and Emergency. Each state has a predetermined set of logical
tasks to be run, which are abstracted as separate processes in the memory.
State transitions take place by polling the health metrics of the satellite.
However, hardware interrupts are implemented on selected peripherals which
ensure an asynchronous switching to the Emergency States for safety. A review

to represent 3D surfaces, and the best current ones rely on learning an
ensemble of parametric representations. Unfortunately, they offer no control
over the deformations of the surface patches that form the ensemble and thus
fail to prevent them from either overlapping or collapsing into single points
or lines. As a consequence, computing shape properties such as surface normals
and curvatures becomes difficult and unreliable.
  In this paper, we show that we can exploit the inherent differentiability of
deep networks to leverage differential surface properties during training so as
to prevent patch collapse and strongly reduce patch overlap. Furthermore, this
lets us reliably compute quantities such as surface normals and curvatures. We
will demonstrate on several tasks that this yields more accurate surface
reconstructions than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of normals
estimation and amount of collapsed and overlapped patches.

  For this generalization, we provide a bicriteria $(4,4)$-approximation that
downgrades nodes with total weight at most 4 times the budget and provides a
solution where the downgraded connectivity from the source to the sink is at
most 4 times that in an optimal solution. WE accomplish this with an LP

further generalize the downgrading problem to one where each vertex can be
downgraded to one of $k$ levels, and the arc capacities are functions of the

the context of boosted object tagging. By noting that the velocity distribution
is determined by the properties of the color string which ends on the parton

singlets, such as Standard Model electroweak bosons, will exhibit velocity
distributions that are boosted relative to QCD jets of similar jet energy. We
find that by performing a simple cut on the corresponding distribution of

Rosen-Morse-type potentials is solved in the framework of Feynman's path
integral approach. Explicit path integration leads to a closed form for the
radial Green's function associated with different shapes of the potentials. For
$q\leq -1$, and $\frac{1}{2\alpha }\ln \left\vert q\right\vert <r<+\infty $,
the energy equation and the corresponding wave functions are deduced for the
$l$ states using an appropriate approximation to the centrifugal potential
term. When $-1<q<0$ or $q>0$, it is shown that the quantization conditions for
the bound state energy levels $E_{n_{r}}$ are transcendental equations which
can be solved numerically. Three special cases such as the standard radial
Manning-Rosen potential $(\left\vert q\right\vert =1)$, the standard radial
Rosen-Morse potential $% (V_{2}\rightarrow -V_{2},q=1)$ and the radial Eckart

a novel objective function for adversarial robustness with an abstain option

then present a simple baseline in which an adversarially-trained classifier
abstains on all inputs within a certain distance of the decision boundary,

of the Standard Model (SM) is one of greatest mysteries currently facing
particle physics, and addressing these issues should provide some understanding
of how the observed relic abundance was produced. One widely considered
production mechanism, a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) produced as
a thermal relic, provides a target cross section for DM annihilation into SM
particles by solving the Boltzmann equation. In this thermal freeze-out
mechanism, dark matter is produced in thermal equilibrium with the SM in the
early universe, and drops out of equilibrium to its observed abundance as the
universe cools and expands. In this paper, we study the impact of a generalized
thermodynamics, known as Tsallis statistics and governed by a parameter $q$, on
the target DM annihilation cross section. We derive the phase space
distributions of particles in this generalized statistical framework, and check
their thermodynamic consistency, as well as analyzing the impact of this
generalization on the collisional term of the Boltzmann equation. We consider
the case of an initial value of $q_0>1$, with $q$ relaxing to 1 as the universe
expands and cools, and solve the generalized Boltzmann numerically for several
benchmark DM masses, finding the corresponding target annihilation cross
sections as a function of $q_0$. We find that as $q$ departs from the standard
thermodynamic case of $q=1$, the collisional term falls less slowly as a
function of $x = m_\chi/T$ than expected in the standard case. We also find
that the target cross section falls sharply from $\sigma v \simeq
2.2-2.6\times10^{-26} \textrm{cm}^3/\textrm{s}$ for $q_0=1$ to, for example,
$\sigma v \simeq 3\times 10^{-34} \textrm{cm}^3/\textrm{s}$ for $q_0=1.05$ for

an ensemble of binary classifiers. Ranking by Projecting uses interdependent
binary perceptrons. These perceptrons share the same direction vector, but use
different bias values. Similar approaches use independent direction vectors and
biases. To combine the binary predictions, most of them adopt a simple counting
heuristics. Here, we introduce a novel cumulative sum scoring function to
combine the binary predictions. The proposed score value aggregates the
strength of each one of the relevant binary classifications on how large is the
item's rank. We show that our modeling casts ordinal regression as a Structured
Perceptron problem. As a consequence, we simplify its formulation and
description, which results in two simple online learning algorithms. The second
algorithm is a Passive-Aggressive version of the first algorithm. We show that
under some rank separability condition both algorithms converge. Furthermore,
we provide mistake bounds for each one of the two online algorithms. For the
Passive-Aggressive version, we assume the knowledge of a separation margin,

use of a unidirectional relationship, i.e., mask segmentation can benefit from
iteratively refined bounding box detection. In this paper, we investigate an
alternative direction, i.e., how to take the advantage of precise mask
segmentation for bounding box detection in a cascade architecture. We propose a
Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation, which iteratively
imposes the shape guidances extracted from mask prediction at the previous
stage on bounding box detection at current stage. It forms a bi-directional
relationship between the two tasks by introducing three key components: (1)
Initial shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) with
the ability to generate class-agnostic masks; (2) Explicit shape guidance: A
mask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor, which employs mask
segmentation at previous stage to focus feature extraction at current stage
within a region aligned well with the shape of the instance-of-interest rather
than a rectangular RoI; (3) Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation
which feeds intermediate mask features at previous stage to the bounding box
head at current stage. Experimental results show that DSC outperforms the
state-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), by a
large margin and achieves 51.8 box AP and 45.5 mask AP on COCO test-dev. The

variability of simulation outputs due to uncertainty from multiple sources. In
this study, we focus on parameters that are essential to construct accurate
patient-specific representations of the coronary circulation, such as aortic
pressure waveform, intramyocardial pressure and quantify how their uncertainty
affects clinically relevant model outputs. We construct a deformable model of
the left coronary artery subject to a prescribed inlet pressure and with
open-loop outlet boundary conditions, treating fluid-structure interaction
through an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian frame of reference. Random input
uncertainty is estimated directly from repeated clinical measurements from
intra-coronary catheterization and complemented by literature data. We also
achieve significant computational cost reductions in uncertainty propagation
thanks to multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators of the outputs of interest,
leveraging the ability to generate, at practically no cost, one- and
zero-dimensional low-fidelity representations of left coronary artery flow,
with appropriate boundary conditions. The results demonstrate how the use of
multi-fidelity control variate estimators leads to significant reductions in
variance and accuracy improvements with respect to traditional Monte-Carlo.

results are two folded: (1) Analyzing the tight-binding model in the presence
of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an external magnetic field, we observed that
dice ladders qualitatively display properties similar to their two-dimensional
counterpart all the way to the limit of only two legs in the short direction.
This includes flat bands near the Fermi level, edge currents and edge charge
localization near zero energy when open boundary conditions are used, two
chiral edge modes, and a nonzero Hall conductance. (2) We studied the effect of
Hubbard correlation $U$ in the two-leg dice ladder using Lanczos and density
matrix renormalization group techniques. We show that increasing $U$ the flat
bands split without the need of introducing external fields. Moreover, robust
ferrimagnetic order develops. Overall, our work establishes dice ladders as a
promising playground to study the combined effect of topology and correlation

electrons. The tunneling probability of each electron is determined by
interactions that typically extend to neighboring sites, as their corresponding
wave amplitudes decay rapidly away from an isolated atomic core. This kind of
description is essential to material science, and it rules the electronic
transport properties of metals, insulators and other condensed matter systems.
The corresponding phenomenology is well captured by tight-binding models, where
the electronic band structure emerges from atomic orbitals of isolated atoms
plus their coupling to neighboring sites in a cristal. In this work, a
mechanical system that emulates dynamically a tightly bound electron is built.
This is done by connecting mechanical resonators via locally periodic aluminum
bars acting as couplers. When the frequency of a particular resonator lies
within the frequency gap of a coupler, the vibrational wave amplitude imitates
a bound electron orbital. The localization of the wave at the resonator site
and its exponential decay along the coupler are experimentally verified. The
quantum dynamical tight-binding model and frequency measurements in mechanical
structures show an excellent agreement.

as the product map of a Morse function and the identity map on an open ball. A
special generic map is a fold map such that the Morse function can be taken as
a natural height function on an unit disk. The class of special generic maps
includes a Morse function with exactly two singular points on a closed
manifold, characterizing a sphere topologically (except 4-dimensional cases) as
the Reeb's theorem shows, and canonical projections of unit spheres.
  It has been known that so-called exotic spheres do not admit special generic
maps into Euclidean spaces whose dimensions are sufficiently high and smaller
than the dimensions of the spheres. Exotic 7-dimensional homotopy spheres do
not admit special generic maps into the 4-dimensional Euclidean space for
example. We can easily obtain special generic maps on fundamental manifolds
such as ones represented as connected sums of products of two standard spheres
and in considerable cases, smooth manifolds resembling topologically them and
different from them do not admit special generic maps. These interesting
results are due to studies of Saeki, Sakuma and Wrazidlo since the 1990s.

the studies before and they are reviewed in the presentation of the new

Galactic field MSPs are found to be solitary. To interpret this problem, we
assume that the accreting neutron star in binaries may collapse and become a
strange star when it reaches some critical mass limit. Mass loss and a weak
kick induced by asymmetric collapse during the phase transition (PT) from
neutron star to strange star can result in isolated MSPs. In this work, we use
a population-synthesis code to examine the PT model. The simulated results show
that a kick velocity of $\sim60~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ can produce $\sim6\times10^3$

In this paper, we propose random space masking (RS-Mask) as a countermeasure
against both power analysis and statistical fault analysis (SFA) techniques. In
the RS-Mask scheme, the distribution of all sensitive variables, faulty and/or
correct values is uniform, and it therefore protects the implementations
against any SFA technique that exploits the distribution of intermediate

fault analysis (SIFA) and fault intensity map analysis (FIMA). We implement
RS-Mask on AES, and show that a SIFA attack is not able to identify the correct
key. We additionally show that an FPGA implementation of AES, protected with
RS-Mask, is resistant to power analysis SCA using Welch's t-test. The area of
the RS-Masked AES is about 3.5 times that of an unprotected AES implementation
of similar architecture, and about 2 times that of a known FPGA SCA-resistant
AES implementation. Finally, we introduce infective RS-Mask that provides
security against differential techniques, such as differential fault analysis

young stars with detected gas and dust emission. The continuum emitting regions
have not been resolved until now. Here, we present 1.3 mm observations of the
FU Ori binary system with ALMA. The disks are resolved at 40 mas resolution.
Radiative transfer modeling shows that the emission from FU Ori north (primary)
is consistent with a dust disk with a characteristic radius of $\sim$11 au. The
ratio between major and minor axes shows that the inclination of the disk is
$\sim$37 deg. FU Ori south is consistent with a dust disk of similar
inclination and size. Assuming the binary orbit shares the same inclination
angle as the disks, the deprojected distance between north and south components
is 0.6'', i.e. $\sim$250 au. Maps of $^{12}$CO emission show a complex
kinematic environment with signatures disk rotation at the location of the
northern component, and also (to a lesser extent) for FU Ori south. The revised
disk geometry allows us to update FU Ori accretion models (Zhu et al.),
yielding a stellar mass and mass accretion rate of FU Ori north of 0.6
M$_{\odot}$ and 3.8$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively.

offered exciting potential to wireless communication systems and radar alike.
Communication systems can offer higher rates and support more users with mmWave
bands while radar systems can benefit from higher resolution captures. This
leads to the possibility that portions of mmWave spectrum will be occupied by
both communication and radar (e.g., 60 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical
(ISM) band). This potential coexistence motivates the work of this paper, in
which we present a design that can enable simultaneous, in-band operation of a
communication system and radar system across the same mmWave frequencies. To
enable such a feat, we mitigate the interference that would otherwise be
incurred by leveraging the numerous antennas offered in mmWave communication
systems. Dense antenna arrays allow us to avoid interference spatially, even
with the hybrid beamforming constraints often imposed by mmWave communication

with artificial class density function to estimate the target class density
function through the Bayes formulation. The benchmark dataset, ADFA-LD, is
employed for the simulation study. ADFA-LD dataset contains thousands of system
call traces collected during various normal and attack processes for the Linux

windowing on the system call trace data followed by the principal component

of quantum information for long times. We study a variation of the
disordered-Heisenberg model, which is known to exhibit an MBL phase [5][6],
known as the quasi-Heisenberg model. Our model is a variation of the
quasi-Heisenberg model with fields in both x and y directions. We found that
while our model shares some characteristics for MBl, as seen by other
quasi-Heisenberg models, the adjacent gap ratio for our system falls well below
the expected Poisson limit when it transitions to an MBL phase. A similar model
to ours has been experimentally realized in [11], and so we are motivated
further to study MBL characteristics. To determine the characteristics of the
system when transitioning from the ergodic to MBL phase, we calculate the
quantities: entanglement entropy, adjacent gap ratio, and the probability
distributions for both. We calculate the aforementioned quantities through the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system's Hamiltonian, which are obtained
through exact diagonalization. We find the entanglement entropy of the system
behaves as expected for MBL, with the spectral average of the entanglement
entropy dropping close to zero as it enters the MBL phase. However, the
spectral average for the adjacent gap ratio falls below the Poisson limit,
0.386, which corresponds to uncorrelated energy levels This drop in adjacent
gap ratio can be explained through some level of attraction between energy
levels, and is ultimately a consequence of the separability of the quasirandom
field. The probability distribution for the adjacent gap ratio is fitted from a
derived distribution which was found using the Brody function for energy level
spacing. The Brody function accounts for energy level attraction when the Brody
parameter, $\omega$, becomes negative...

Understanding dynamic patterns requires a disentangled representational model
that separates the factorial components. A commonly used model for dynamic
patterns is the state space model, where the state evolves over time according
to a transition model and the state generates the observed image frames
according to an emission model. To model the motions explicitly, it is natural
for the model to be based on the motions or the displacement fields of the
pixels. Thus in the emission model, we let the hidden state generate the
displacement field, which warps the trackable component in the previous image
frame to generate the next frame while adding a simultaneously emitted residual
image to account for the change that cannot be explained by the deformation.
The warping of the previous image is about the trackable part of the change of
image frame, while the residual image is about the intrackable part of the
image. We use a maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the model that iterates
between inferring latent noise vectors that drive the transition model and
updating the parameters given the inferred latent vectors. Meanwhile we adopt a
regularization term to penalize the norms of the residual images to encourage
the model to explain the change of image frames by trackable motion. Unlike
existing methods on dynamic patterns, we learn our model in unsupervised
setting without ground truth displacement fields. In addition, our model
defines a notion of intrackability by the separation of warped component and
residual component in each image frame. We show that our method can synthesize
realistic dynamic pattern, and disentangling appearance, trackable and
intrackable motions. The learned models are useful for motion transfer, and it
is natural to adopt it to define and measure intrackability of a dynamic
pattern.

with a spectrum dominated by extremely intense, narrow C II emission lines. The
spectrum is similar to those of the very rare, late-type [WC11] low-mass
Wolf-Rayet stars. Despite the recognition of these stars as a distinct class
decades ago, there remains barely a handful of Galactic members, all of which
are also planetary-nebula central stars. Although no obvious surrounding
nebulosity is present in J0608, [O II], [N II], and [S II] emission suggest the
presence of an inconspicuous, low-excitation nebula. There is low-amplitude
incoherent photometric variability on timescales of days to years, as well as
numerous prominent P Cygni profiles, implying mass loss. There are indications
of a binary companion. The star is located on the outskirts of the LMC, and the
observed radial velocity (~250 km/s) and proper motion strongly suggest
membership. If indeed an LMC member, this is the first extragalactic late [WC]
star, and the first with an accurately determined luminosity, as the Galactic
examples are too distant for precise parallax determinations. A high-quality,
broad-coverage spectrum of the prototype of the late [WC] class, CPD -56 8032,
is also presented. We discuss different excitation mechanisms capable of
producing the great strength of the C II emission. Numerous autoionizing levels
of C II are definitely populated by processes other than dielectronic
recombination. Despite the spectacular emission spectra, observational
selection makes objects such as these difficult to discover. Members of the
[WC11] class may in fact be considerably more common than the handful of
previously known late [WC] stars.

Specifically, we propose a new snippet score-based method, named Snippet

relatedness"". Snippet relatedness represents which snippets are related to a
specific action instance. To effectively learn this snippet relatedness, we
present ""pyramid non-local operations"" for locally and globally capturing
long-range dependencies among snippets. By employing these components, SRG
first produces a 2D relatedness score map that enables the generation of
various temporal intervals reliably covering most action instances with high
overlap. Then, SRG evaluates the action confidence scores of these temporal
intervals and refines their boundaries to obtain temporal action proposals. On

with the affinity matrix (equivalently the association graph) whereby the
matching problem is translated into a constrained vertex classification task.
The association graph is learned by an embedding network for vertex
classification, followed by Sinkhorn normalization and a cross-entropy loss for
end-to-end learning. We further improve the embedding model on association
graph by introducing Sinkhorn based matching-aware constraint, as well as dummy
nodes to deal with unequal sizes of graphs. To our best knowledge, this is one
of the first network to directly learn with the general Lawler's QAP. In
contrast, recent deep matching methods focus on the learning of node/edge
features in two graphs respectively. We also show how to extend our network to
hypergraph matching, and matching of multiple graphs. Experimental results on
both synthetic graphs and real-world images show its effectiveness. For pure

  Network for Low Light Image Enhancement","The 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM'19)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contrast enhancement and noise removal are coupled problems for low-light
image enhancement. The existing Retinex based methods do not take the coupling
relation into consideration, resulting in under or over-smoothing of the
enhanced images. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel progressive
Retinex framework, in which illumination and noise of low-light image are
perceived in a mutually reinforced manner, leading to noise reduction low-light
enhancement results. Specifically, two fully pointwise convolutional neural
networks are devised to model the statistical regularities of ambient light and
image noise respectively, and to leverage them as constraints to facilitate the
mutual learning process. The proposed method not only suppresses the
interference caused by the ambiguity between tiny textures and image noises,
but also greatly improves the computational efficiency. Moreover, to solve the
problem of insufficient training data, we propose an image synthesis strategy
based on camera imaging model, which generates color images corrupted by
illumination-dependent noises. Experimental results on both synthetic and real
low-light images demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches against
the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) low-light enhancement methods.

service with fault tolerance. However, its requirement for the deterministic
execution of transactions often results in single-threaded replicas, which
cannot fully exploit the multicore capabilities of today's processors.
Therefore, parallel SMR has become a hot topic of recent research. The basic
idea behind it is that independent transactions can be executed in parallel,
while dependent transactions must be executed in their relative order to ensure
consistency among replicas. The dependency detection of existing parallel SMR
methods is mainly based on pairwise transaction comparison or batch comparison.
These methods cannot simultaneously guarantee both effective detection and
concurrent execution. Moreover, the scheduling process cannot execute
concurrently, which introduces extra scheduling overhead as well. In order to
further reduce scheduling overhead and ensure the parallel execution of
transactions, we propose an efficient scheduler based on a specific index
structure. The index is composed of a Bloom Filter and the associated
transaction queues, which provides an efficient dependency detection and
preserve necessary dependency information respectively. Based on the index
structure, we further devise an elaborated concurrent scheduling process. The
experimental results show that the proposed scheduler is more efficient,
scalable and robust than the comparison methods.

attention due to their promising applications as nano-size spintronics.
However, realizing robust ferromagnetic couplings that can survive at high
temperature is restrained by two decisive factors: super-exchange couplings and
anisotropy. Despite widely explored low-dimensional anisotropy, strengthening
super-exchange couplings has rarely been investigated. Here, we found that
ligands with lower electronegativity can strengthen ferromagnetic
super-exchange couplings and further proposed the ligand modulation strategy to
enhance the Curie temperature of low-dimensional ferromagnets. Based on the
metallic CrX2 (X = S, Se, Te) family, substituting ligand atoms by halides can
form stable semiconducting phase as CrSeCl, CrSeBr and CrTeBr. It is
interesting to discover that, the nearest ferromagnetic super-exchange
couplings can be strengthened when substituting ligands from S to Se and Te.
Such evolution originates from the enhanced electron hopping integral and
reduced energy intervals between d and p orbits. While the second nearest
anti-ferromagnetic couplings are also benefitted due to delocalized p-p
interactions. Finally, ligand modulation strategy is applied in other
ferromagnetic monolayers, further verifying our theory and providing a
fundamental understanding on controlling super-exchange couplings in
low-dimension.

spectrum sharing model in which the UAVs are grouped into two classes of
relaying UAVs that service the spectrum owner and the sensing UAVs that perform
the disaster relief mission using the obtained spectrum. The operation of the
UAV network is managed by a hierarchical mechanism in which a central
controller assigns the tasks of the UAVs based on their resources and determine
their operation region based on the level of priority of impacted areas and
then the UAVs autonomously fine-tune their position using a model-free
reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the individual throughput and
prolong their lifetime. We analyze the performance and the convergence for the
proposed method analytically and with extensive simulations in different
scenarios.

such as common habits and location proximity. In this paper, we investigate the
formation of hotspots from an alternative perspective that considers the routes
along the network paths as the auxiliary information, and attempt to find the
route hotspots in large labeled networks. A route hotspot is a cohesive
subgraph that is covered by a set of routes, and these routes correspond to the
same sequential pattern consisting of vertices' labels. To the best of our
knowledge, the problem of Finding Route Hotspots in Large Labeled Networks has
not been tackled in the literature. However, it is challenging as counting the

the sizes of hotspots decrease with the increasing lengths of patterns, we
prove several anti-monotonicity properties of hotspots, and then develop a
scalable algorithm called FastRH that can use these properties to effectively
prune the patterns that cannot form any hotspots. In addition, to avoid the
duplicate computation overhead, we judiciously design an effective index
structure called RH-Index for storing the hotspot and pattern information
collectively, which also enables incremental updating and efficient query
processing. Our experimental results on real-world datasets clearly demonstrate
the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed methods.

disorders. For voiced sounds, hypernasality introduces an additional resonance
in the lower frequencies and, for unvoiced sounds, there is reduced
articulatory precision due to air escaping through the nasal cavity. However,
the acoustic manifestation of these symptoms is highly variable, making
hypernasality estimation very challenging, both for human specialists and
automated systems. Previous work in this area relies on either engineered
features based on statistical signal processing or machine learning models
trained on clinical ratings. Engineered features often fail to capture the
complex acoustic patterns associated with hypernasality, whereas metrics based
on machine learning are prone to overfitting to the small disease-specific
speech datasets on which they are trained. Here we propose a new set of
acoustic features that capture these complementary dimensions. The features are
based on two acoustic models trained on a large corpus of healthy speech. The
first acoustic model aims to measure nasal resonance from voiced sounds,
whereas the second acoustic model aims to measure articulatory imprecision from
unvoiced sounds. To demonstrate that the features derived from these acoustic
models are specific to hypernasal speech, we evaluate them across different
dysarthria corpora. Our results show that the features generalize even when
training on hypernasal speech from one disease and evaluating on hypernasal

on Huntington's disease), and when training on neurologically disordered speech

injects noise at every iterative update to guarantee differential privacy.
Previous work first determines the noise level that can satisfy the privacy
requirement and then analyzes the utility of noisy gradient updates as in the
non-private case. In contrast, we explore how privacy noise affects
optimization property. We show that for differentially private convex
optimization, the utility guarantee of differentially private (stochastic)
gradient descent is determined by an \emph{expected curvature} rather than the
minimum curvature. The \emph{expected curvature}, which represents the average
curvature over the optimization path, is usually much larger than the minimum
curvature. By using the \emph{expected curvature}, we show that gradient
perturbation can achieve a significantly improved utility guarantee that can
theoretically justify the advantage of gradient perturbation over other
perturbation methods. Finally, our extensive experiments suggest that gradient
perturbation with the advanced composition method indeed outperforms other
perturbation approaches by a large margin, matching our theoretical findings.

separate clouds: a first cloud, including the densest main filament at a
distance of $\sim$600 pc, and a second cloud, associated with the Cocoon Nebula
at a distance of $\sim$800 pc. The spatially averaged H-band polarization map
revealed a well-ordered magnetic field morphology, with the polarization
segments perpendicular to the main filament but parallel to the nearby
sub-filaments, consistent with models assuming that the magnetic field is
regulating cloud evolution. We estimated the magnetic field strength using the
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, and found that the magnetic field strength
scales with volume density with a power-law index of $\sim0.5$ in the density
range from $N_{H_2}\sim$ 10 to 3000 cm$^{-3}$, which indicates an anisotropic
cloud contraction with a preferred direction along the magnetic field. In
addition, the mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud gradually changes from
subcritical to supercritical from the cloud envelope to the deep regions. These
features are consistent with strong magnetic field star-formation models and
suggest that the magnetic field is important in regulating the evolution of the
IC5146 cloud.

mediate a nemato-orbital coupling that ties the orientation of the nematic
director to certain soft directions in momentum space, rendering the
Potts-nematic transition mean-field and first-order. In contrast to the case of

equally great challenges, as they are susceptible to defects and disorders. The
presence of defects and disorders induces the inhomogeneity of electronic
states, often making it difficult to directly probe the intrinsic properties of
materials. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic
homogeneity, for example, by reducing the density of defects and disorders in
the materials and at the interface. However, little attention is paid to the
disorders embedded in underlying substrates. Here we investigate how individual
dopants in substrate interact with 2D materials and give rise to the
electron-hole puddles by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)

grown on nitrogen doped silicon carbide (SiC) substrates as a model system,
which has played the essential roles in many applications and fundamental
studies. The nitrogen dopants inside SiC substrate were imaged over the
epitaxial graphene by STM for the first time. The charged nitrogen dopants from
the substrate induce the electron-lack puddles in graphene with a diameter of
~2 nm, via Coulomb interaction. The Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point
is modulated by the puddles with an amplitude of ~40 meV, causing the
electronic inhomogeneity of epitaxial graphene. Our findings on this prototype

any intermediate meson states), the axial-vector channel with two intermediate
physical states $K_{1}(1270)$ and $K_{1}(1400)$, the vector channel with
intermediate $K^{*}(892)$ meson and the pseudoscalar channel with intermediate
$K$ meson. It is shown that the first two channels give the dominant
contribution to the decay width. Of the remaining two channels, the
pseudoscalar channel plays a more prominent role. The final result is in
satisfactory agreement with experimental data. Prediction for the differential
decay width is presented.

of RGB trackers for representation. However, these feature models learned on
RGB images are neither effective in representing TIR objects nor taking
fine-grained TIR information into consideration. To this end, we develop a
multi-task framework to learn the TIR-specific discriminative features and
fine-grained correlation features for TIR tracking. Specifically, we first use
an auxiliary classification network to guide the generation of TIR-specific
discriminative features for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to
different classes. Second, we design a fine-grained aware module to capture
more subtle information for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to the
same class. These two kinds of features complement each other and recognize TIR
objects in the levels of inter-class and intra-class respectively. These two
feature models are learned using a multi-task matching framework and are
jointly optimized on the TIR tracking task. In addition, we develop a
large-scale TIR training dataset to train the network for adapting the model to
the TIR domain. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that
the proposed algorithm achieves a relative gain of 10% over the baseline and
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Codes and the proposed
TIR dataset are available at {https://github.com/QiaoLiuHit/MMNet}.

several bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it
becomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e.,
an image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog
components. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight
Transformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the

structure similar to the Transformer and employs the same design of attention
computation, whereas it has only a small number of parameters, yet has

of visual dialog, a layer built upon the proposed attention block has less than
one-tenth of parameters as compared with its counterpart, a natural Transformer

promising technology to reduce power consumption and simplify deployment.
However, backscatter communication lacks stability, along with limited
communication range within a few meters. Due to the limited computation ability
of backscatter tags, it is burdensome to effectively adapt the bitrate for the
time-varying channel. Thus, backscatter tags are failed to fully utilize the
optimal transmission rate. In this paper, we design a system named COOK with
self-reliant bitrate adaptation in backscatter communication. Channel symmetry
allows backscatter tags to adjust bitrate depending on the received signal
strength of the excitation source (ES) without feedback. In addition, the chirp
spreading signal is exploited as the ES signal to enable backscatter tags to
work under noise floor. Our modulation approach is denoted as Chirp-OOK since
the tags reflect the chirp signal by employing the on-off keying modulation. It
allows that receiver can decode under the noise floor and the bitrate varies
flexibly as the communication range changes. We have implemented the prototype
system based on the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) platform.
Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
system. Our system provides valid communication distance up to $27m$, which is
7 times as compared with normal backscatter system. The system significantly
increases the backscatter communication stability, by supporting bitrate
adaptation ranges from 0.33kbps to 1.2Mbps, and guaranteeing the bit error rate
(BER) is below 1%.

fabricated via a standard electrochemical process that produced a triangular
array of 66 nm diameter holes having a lattice constant of 100 nm. The critical
field transition of the Al films was measured near $T_c$ as a function of field
orientation relative to the substrate normal. With the field oriented along the
normal ($\theta=0$), we observe reentrant superconductivity at a characteristic
matching field $H_m=0.22\,\mathrm{T}$, corresponding to one flux quantum per
hole. In tilted fields, the position $H^*$ of the reentrance feature increases
as $\sec(\theta)$, but the resistivity traces are somewhat more complex than
those of a continuous superconducting film. We show that when the tilt angle is
tuned such that $H^*$ is of the order of the upper critical field $H_c$, the
entire critical region is dominated by the enhanced dissipation associated with
a sub-matching perpendicular component of the applied field. At higher tilt
angles a local maximum in the critical field is observed when the perpendicular
component of the field is equal to the matching field.

by aggregating multi-level features extracted from convolutional neural
networks. However, because of the different receptive fields of different
convolutional layers, there exists big differences between features generated
by these layers. Common feature fusion strategies (addition or concatenation)
ignore these differences and may cause suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we
propose the F3Net to solve above problem, which mainly consists of cross
feature module (CFM) and cascaded feedback decoder (CFD) trained by minimizing
a new pixel position aware loss (PPA). Specifically, CFM aims to selectively
aggregate multi-level features. Different from addition and concatenation, CFM
adaptively selects complementary components from input features before fusion,
which can effectively avoid introducing too much redundant information that may
destroy the original features. Besides, CFD adopts a multi-stage feedback
mechanism, where features closed to supervision will be introduced to the
output of previous layers to supplement them and eliminate the differences
between features. These refined features will go through multiple similar
iterations before generating the final saliency maps. Furthermore, different
from binary cross entropy, the proposed PPA loss doesn't treat pixels equally,
which can synthesize the local structure information of a pixel to guide the
network to focus more on local details. Hard pixels from boundaries or
error-prone parts will be given more attention to emphasize their importance.
F3Net is able to segment salient object regions accurately and provide clear
local details. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate
that F3Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on six evaluation metrics.

decreases, the signal statistics drops and the identification of these low

neutrino detectors characterise the observed clusters of events with a
parameter called multiplicity, i.e. the number of collected events in a fixed

expected signal with respect to background. By adding this parameter to the
multiplicity we optimise the search of astrophysical bursts and we increase
their detection horizon. Moreover, the use of the $\xi$ can be easily
implemented in an online system and can apply also to a network of detectors
like SNEWS. For these reasons this work is relevant in the multi-messengers era

dielectric and structural properties of CuBr2. The multiferroic transition
temperature is greatly enhanced under hydrostatic pressure. From ambient to
about 1 GPa (the limit of our homemade apparatus), TN increases unprecedentedly
by more than 20K, and no sign of saturation is observed in our experiments.
Meanwhile the corresponding dielectric loss keeps rather low (<<0.1). Further
synchrotron-based high pressure X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that
there is no pressure-induced structural phase transition in CuBr2 up to 10.2
GPa. Upon increasing pressure, the b-axis (along the spin chain) just changes
slowly while transverse a- and c- axis parameters shrink much more greatly.
Pressure greatly reduces the separation between spin chains and enhance the
inter-chain coupling interactions in CuBr2, which results in the giant increase
of multiferroic critical temperate. Our finding suggests a new effective way to
improve the known multiferroic systems towards practical high temperature
multiferroicity.

data mining, and AI communities for many decades, the study of dynamic networks
has recently taken center stage due to the prominence of social media and its
effects on the dynamics of social networks. In this paper, we propose a
statistical model for dynamically evolving networks, together with a
variational inference approach. Our model, Neural Latent Space Model with
Variational Inference, encodes edge dependencies across different time
snapshots. It represents nodes via latent vectors and uses interaction matrices
to model the presence of edges. These matrices can be used to incorporate
multiple relations in heterogeneous networks by having a separate matrix for
each of the relations. To capture the temporal dynamics, both node vectors and
interaction matrices are allowed to evolve with time. Existing network analysis
methods use representation learning techniques for modelling networks. These
techniques are different for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks because
heterogeneous networks can have multiple types of edges and nodes as opposed to
a homogeneous network. Unlike these, we propose a unified model for homogeneous
and heterogeneous networks in a variational inference framework. Moreover, the
learned node latent vectors and interaction matrices may be interpretable and
therefore provide insights on the mechanisms behind network evolution. We
experimented with a single step and multi-step link forecasting on real-world
networks of homogeneous, bipartite, and heterogeneous nature, and demonstrated
that our model significantly outperforms existing models.

tool that can be used in a wide variety of contexts. It is particularly useful
for territorial planning in situations where several actors with different, and
sometimes contradictory, point of views have to take a decision regarding land
use development. While the impact of the weights used to represent the relative
importance of criteria has been widely studied in the recent literature, the
impact of the order weights used to combine the criteria have rarely been
investigated. This paper presents a spatial sensitivity analysis to assess the
impact of order weights determination in GIS-based Multi-Criteria Analysis by
Ordered Weighted Averaging. We propose a methodology based on an efficient
exploration of the decision-strategy space defined by the level of risk and
trade-off in the decision process. We illustrate our approach with a land use
planning process in the South of France. The objective is to find suitable
areas for urban development while preserving green areas and their associated
ecosystem services. The ecosystem service approach has indeed the potential to
widen the scope of traditional landscape-ecological planning by including
ecosystem-based benefits, including social and economic benefits, green
infrastructures and biophysical parameters in urban and territorial planning.
We show that in this particular case the decision-strategy space can be divided
into four clusters. Each of them is associated with a map summarizing the
average spatial suitability distribution used to identify potential areas for
urban development. We also demonstrate the pertinence of a spatial variance
within-cluster analysis to disentangle the relationship between risk and
trade-off values. At the end, we perform a site suitability ranking analysis to
assess the relationship between the four detected clusters.

understanding. Video context is a critical cue to effectively detect actions,
but current works mainly focus on temporal context, while neglecting semantic
context as well as other important context properties. In this work, we propose
a graph convolutional network (GCN) model to adaptively incorporate multi-level
semantic context into video features and cast temporal action detection as a
sub-graph localization problem. Specifically, we formulate video snippets as
graph nodes, snippet-snippet correlations as edges, and actions associated with
context as target sub-graphs. With graph convolution as the basic operation, we
design a GCN block called GCNeXt, which learns the features of each node by
aggregating its context and dynamically updates the edges in the graph. To
localize each sub-graph, we also design an SGAlign layer to embed each
sub-graph into the Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that G-TAD is
capable of finding effective video context without extra supervision and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on two detection benchmarks. On
ActivityNet-1.3, it obtains an average mAP of 34.09%; on THUMOS14, it reaches

is safe to conclude that the origins of these lie partly in the field of
psychometrics. From our historical review, two new ideas arose which we
investigated further: The first is about the relationship between reliability
and predictive validity; the second is whether optimal regression weights
should be estimated by regularizing their values towards equality or shrinking
their values towards zero. In a simulation study we show that the reliability
of a test score does not influence the predictive validity as much as is
usually written in psychometric textbooks. Using an empirical example we show

optics, in entanglement generation and qubit operations. STIRAP in
optomechanics has been considered for optical frequency conversion where a
mechanical mode provides the mediating state. Given the advances of
optomechanical devices with exceptionally high mechanical-quality factors,
STIRAP between mechanical modes has the prospect of generating macroscopic
quantum superposition and of supporting quantum information protocols. An
optical cavity mode can mediate the coupling between mechanical modes, without
detrimental effects of optical losses. We demonstrate STIRAP between two
mechanical modes of a phononic membrane-in-the-middle system with an efficiency
of 86% and immune against photon loss through the mediating optical cavity.

processes. Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity
can facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information
processing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong
winner-take-all like competitions between subgroups of correlated synaptic
inputs. Consequently, one might expect that STDP would induce strong
competition between different rhythmicity channels thus preventing the
multiplexing of information across different frequency channels. This study
explored whether STDP facilitates the multiplexing of information across
multiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We investigated
the STDP dynamics in the framework of a model consisting of two competing
subpopulations of neurons that synapse in a feedforward manner onto a single
postsynaptic neuron. Each sub-population was assumed to oscillate in an
independent manner and in a different frequency band. To investigate the STDP
dynamics, a mean field Fokker-Planck theory was developed in the limit of the
slow learning rate. Surprisingly, our theory predicted limited interactions
between the different sub-groups. Our analysis further revealed that the
interaction between these channels was mainly mediated by the shared component
of the mean activity. Next, we generalized these results beyond the simplistic
model using numerical simulations. We found that for a wide range of
parameters, the system converged to a solution in which the post-synaptic
neuron responded to both rhythms. Nevertheless, all the synaptic weights
remained dynamic and did not converge to a fixed point. These findings imply
that STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information and demonstrate
how functionality can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all
the synaptic weights.

large datasets that can be used to study e.g. ecology and biodiversity. Unknown
and varying sampling effort is a major issue when making inference based on
citizen science data. In this paper we propose a modeling approach for
accounting for variation in sampling effort due to accessibility. The paper is
based on a illustrative case study using citizen science data of moose
occurrence in Hedmark, Norway. The aim is to make inference about the
importance of two geographical properties known to influence moose occurrence;
terrain ruggedness index and solar radiation. Explanatory analysis show that
moose occurrences are overrepresented close to roads, and we use distance to
roads as a proxy for accessibility. We propose a model based on a Bayesian
Log-Gaussian Cox Process specification for occurrence. The model accounts for
accessibility through a distance sampling approach. This approach can be seen
as a thinning process where probability of thinning, i.e. not observing,
increases with increasing distances. For the moose case study distance to roads
are used. Computationally efficient full Bayesian inference is performed using
the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and the Stochastic Partial
Differential Equation approach for spatial modeling. The proposed model as well
as the consequences of not accounting for varying sampling effort due to
accessibility are studied through a simulation study based on the case study.
Considerable biases are found in estimates for the effect of radiation on moose
occurrence when accessibility is not considered in the model.

internet traffic, the unreliable IPv4 protocol has been replaced by a more
secure protocol, called IPv6 for Internet system. The IPv6 protocol does not
allow intermediate routers to fragment the on-going IPv6 packet. Moreover, due
to IP tunneling, some extra headers are added to the IPv6 packet, exceeding the
packet size higher than the maximum transmission unit (MTU), resulting in
increase in packet drops. One probable solution is to find the MTU of every
link in advance using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets and
accordingly fragment the packets at the source itself. However, most of the
intermediate routers and the network firewalls do not allow ICMP packets to
traverse through their network, resulting in network black holes, where we
cannot know the MTU of some links in advance. This method tries to handle the
packet drops in IPv6 network by proposing a DMTU scheme where we dynamically
adjust the MTU of each link depending upon the original size of the IPv6
packet, thereby reducing the number of packet drops by a significant amount.
Using mathematical and graphical analysis, our scheme proves to be much more
efficient than the state-of-the-art PMTUD scheme. In this paper the method,
mathematical and graphical representations are focusing solely in IPv6 Internet
communication.

  The tau statistic is a recent second-order correlation function that can
assess the magnitude and range of global spatiotemporal clustering from
epidemiological data containing geolocations of individual cases and, usually,
disease onset times. This is the first review of its use, and the aspects of
its computation and presentation that could affect inferences drawn and bias
estimates of the statistic.
  Methods
  Using Google Scholar we searched papers or preprints that cited the papers
that first defined/reformed the statistic. We tabulated their key
characteristics to understand the statistic's development since 2012.
  Results
  Only half of the 16 studies found were considered to be using true tau
statistics, but their inclusion in the review still provided important insights
into their analysis motivations. All papers that used graphical hypothesis
testing and parameter estimation used incorrect methods. There is a lack of
clarity over how to choose the time-relatedness interval to relate cases and
the distance band set, that are both required to calculate the statistic. Some
studies demonstrated nuanced applications of the tau statistic in settings with
unusual data or time relation variables, which enriched understanding of its
possibilities. A gap was noticed in the estimators available to account for
variable person-time at risk.
  Discussion
  Our review comprehensively covers current uses of the tau statistic for
descriptive analysis, graphical hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation of
spatiotemporal clustering. We also define a new estimator of the tau statistic
for disease rates. For the tau statistic there are still open questions on its
implementation which we hope this review inspires others to research.

simulate the pool boiling above a smooth horizontal heater. The effects of
homogenous and heterogeneous wettability on entire boiling curves from the
onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) to fully developed film boiling were
investigated comprehensively. Results show that concerning the homogeneous and
hydrophilic heater, increasing the wall wettability results in a high critical
heat flux (CHF) and yields a rightward and upward shift of the boiling curve.
It is also found that decreasing the wettability promotes the occurrence of ONB
at a lower overheat, but it also makes the boiling process move into a film
boiling regime with a lower degree of wall superheat. Regarding the homogeneous
and hydrophobic heater, there are quite lower CHF and shorter transition
boiling regime, whereas the CHF point and film boiling occur at a lower wall
superheat. For the heterogeneous and hydrophilic heater, increasing the
difference of wettability yields a leftward shift of the boiling curve.
Furthermore, the effects of surface wettability and the width between two
hydrophilic-hydrophobic mixed surface on boiling curves were studied, which
indicated that decreasing the wettability of the hydrophobic surface produces
an upward shift of boiling curve and decreasing the width generates a leftward
and upward shift of the nucleate boiling pattern. Moreover, the enhancement of
boiling heat transfer in terms of hydrophilic-hydrophobic mixed surfaces was
also quantitively verified.

constructions of cluster samples from peaks in weak lensing mass maps and
measurements of cluster masses from their tangential shear profiles share the
same noise. We quantify this mass bias from large sets of mock cluster samples
with analytical density profiles and realistic large-scale structure noise from
ray-tracing simulations. We find that, even for peaks with signal-to-noise
ratio larger than $4.0$ in weak lensing mass maps constructed in a deep survey
with a high source galaxy number density of $30~\mathrm{arcmin}^{-2}$, derived
weak lensing masses for these shear-selected clusters are still biased high by
$\sim55\%$ on average. Such a large bias mainly originates from up-scattered
low mass objects, which is an inevitable consequence of selecting clusters with
a noisy observable directly linked to the mass measurement. We also investigate
the dependence of the mass bias on different physical and observational
parameters, finding that the mass bias strongly correlates with cluster
redshifts, true halo masses, and selection signal-to-noise thresholds, but
having moderate dependence on observed weak lensing masses and survey depths.
This bias, albeit considerable, can still be modeled accurately in statistical
studies of shear-selected clusters as the intrinsic scatter around the mean
bias is found to be reasonable in size. We demonstrate that such a bias can
explain the deviation in X-ray properties previously found on a shear-selected
cluster sample. Our result will be useful for turning large samples of
shear-selected clusters available in future surveys into potential probes of

  Counting",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep
networks to estimate crowd density. While effective, deep learning approaches
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which, in a crowd-counting context, can
lead to serious security issues. However, attack and defense mechanisms have
been virtually unexplored in regression tasks, let alone for crowd density
estimation.
  In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of existing attack strategies
on crowd-counting networks, and introduce a simple yet effective pixel-wise
detection mechanism. It builds on the intuition that, when attacking a
multitask network, in our case estimating crowd density and scene depth, both
outputs will be perturbed, and thus the second one can be used for detection
purposes. We will demonstrate that this significantly outperforms heuristic and
uncertainty-based strategies.

charge transfer states in organic donor acceptor blends, can contribute to
light absorption. Due to their low number density or ultrasmall absorption
cross-section, the absorption coefficient of these states is challenging to
measure using conventional transmission reflection spectrophotometry. As an
alternative, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photovoltaic devices is
often used as a representative of the absorption coefficient, where the
spectral line shape of the EQE is considered to follow the absorption
coefficient of the active layer material. In this work, it is shown that the
subbandgap EQE is subject to thickness dependent low finesse cavity
interference effects within the device, making this assumption questionable. A
better estimate for the absorption coefficient is obtained when EQE spectra
corresponding to different active layer thicknesses are fitted simultaneously
for one attenuation coefficient using an iterative transfer matrix method. The
principle is demonstrated for two model acceptor-donor systems (PCE12ITIC and
PBTTTPC71BM) and accurate subgap absorption coefficients are determined. This
approach has particular relevance for both understanding sub-gap states and
their utilization in organic optoelectronic devices.

nonminimal interaction. Unlike the case of metric gravity, and due to the
absence of anisotropic stresses, the second source disappears for single

notion of adiabaticity is not affected by the transition to minimal coupling
contrary to the metric gravity case where it is confused by changing the

paradigm and non-superfluid dark matter. The equations for superfluid
hydrodynamics were computed numerically in an expanding $\Lambda$CDM background
with spherical symmetry; the effect of various superfluid fractions,
temperatures, interactions, and masses on the collapse of structures was taken
into consideration. We derived the linear perturbation of the superfluid
equations, giving further insights into the dynamics of the superfluid
collapse. We found that while a conventional dark matter fluid with
self-interactions and finite temperatures experiences a suppression in the
growth of structures on smaller scales, as expected due to the presence of
pressure terms, a superfluid can collapse much more efficiently than was
naively expected due to its ability to suppress the growth of entropy
perturbations and thus gradients in the thermal pressure. We also found that
the cores of the dark matter halos initially become more superfluid during the
collapse, but eventually reach a point where the superfluid fraction falls
sharply. The formation of superfluid dark matter halos surrounded by a normal
fluid dark matter background is therefore disfavored by the present work.

ground state in a wide regime of the phase diagram near $t'/t=1/\sqrt{2}$,
where the Fermi surface is well-nested for both $(\pi,\pi)$ and

sandwiched by a single-${\bf Q}$ N\'{e}el phase and a double-${\bf Q}$ coplanar

energy spectrum in the chiral spin density wave phase consists of four pairs of
degenerate bands. These give rise to two pairs of Dirac cones with the same
chirality at the point $({\pi \over 2},{\pi\over 2})$ of the Brillouin zone. We
demonstrate that the application of a diagonal strain induces a $d_{xy}$-wave
next nearest neighbor hopping which, in turn, opens gaps in the two Dirac cones
with opposite masses. As a result, four pairs of well-separated
topologically-nontrivial bands emerge, and each pair of those contributes with
a Chern number $\pm1$. At half-filling, this leads to a zero total Chern number
and renders the topologically-notrivial properties observable only in the ac

the subtle movements of the lips, and consequently facilitate the training of
lip readers. This is achieved, specifically, by distilling multi-granularity

theory reduces to a $\sigma$-model on instanton moduli space, extended by
couplings to additional fields from the parent theory, and possessing (8+8)
super(conformal) symmetries along with 8 further fermionic shift symmetries. We
derive this model explicitly for the single $SU(2)$ instanton.

has remained complex, very often relying on the intuition and expertise of the
designer, ultimately limiting the reach and penetration of this groundbreaking
approach. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies suggesting
to apply Machine Learning techniques for the design of nanostructures. Most of
these studies engage Deep Learning techniques, which entails training a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) to approximate the highly non-linear function of the
underlying physical process between spectra and nanostructures. At the end of
the training, the DNN allows an on-demand design of nanostructures, i.e. the
model can infer nanostructure geometries for desired spectra. In this work, we
introduce spectra2pix, which is a model DNN trained to generate 2D images of
the designed nanostructures. Our model architecture is not limited to a closed
set of nanostructure shapes, and can be trained for the design of any geometry.
We show, for the first time, a successful generalization ability by designing a
completely unseen sub-family of geometries. This generalization capability
highlights the importance of our model architecture, and allows higher
applicability for real-world design problems.

strongest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the Universe. However, the
dynamics of their coalescence is the subject of much debate. In this study, we
use a suite of $N$-body simulations to follow the merger of two nuclear star
clusters (NSCs), each hosting a SMBH in their centre. We find that the presence
of distinct star clusters around each SMBH has important consequences for the
dynamical evolution of the SMBH binary: (i) The separation between the SMBHs
decreases by a few orders of magnitude in the first few Myrs by the combined
effects of dynamical friction and a drag force caused by tidally stripped
stars. In fact, this is a significant speedup for equal mass ratio binaries,
and becomes extreme for unequal mass ratios, e.g. 1:10 or 1:100, which
traditional dynamical friction alone would not permit to bind. (ii) The
subsequent binary hardening is driven by the gravitational slingshots between
the SMBH binary and stars, and also depends on the mass ratio between the
SMBHs. Thus, with this additional drag force, we find that all SMBHs in our
suite coalesce within a Hubble time. Given that about 50% of Milky Way sized
galaxies host NSCs, our results are encouraging for upcoming GW observations
with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna -- LISA -- which will detect SMBH
coalescence in the $10^4-10^7$$M_{\rm \odot}$ mass range.

discuss the applicability of the continuous $\beta$ function calculation in
conformal systems, extending the possible phase diagram to include a 4-fermion

the $\beta$ function in the $c=0$ gradient flow renormalization scheme. The
continuous $\beta$ function predicts the existence of a conformal fixed point

factor of coordinate systems, such that feature encoder is learned from
multiple scenes for general feature representation and more important,

interband transitions at higher frequencies. The temperature-induced changes in

Dyadic CART and a closely related estimator, namely Optimal Regression Tree
(ORT), in the context of estimating piecewise smooth functions in general
dimensions in the fixed design setup. More precisely, these optimal decision
tree estimators fit piecewise polynomials of any given degree. Like Dyadic CART
in two dimensions, we reason that these estimators can also be computed in
polynomial time in the sample size $N$ via dynamic programming. We prove oracle
inequalities for the finite sample risk of Dyadic CART and ORT which imply
tight risk bounds for several function classes of interest. Firstly, they imply
that the finite sample risk of ORT of order $r \geq 0$ is always bounded by $C
k \frac{\log N}{N}$ whenever the regression function is piecewise polynomial of
degree $r$ on some reasonably regular axis aligned rectangular partition of the

are scarcely available in the literature for computationally efficient

explain the origin of non-thermal particles in high-energy astrophysical
sources. However, it has been suggested that the particle distribution may
effectively thermalise when the radiative (synchrotron and/or Inverse Compton)
losses are severe. Inspired by recent PIC simulations of relativistic
turbulence, which show that electrons are impulsively heated in intermittent
current sheets by a strong electric field aligned with the local magnetic
field, we instead argue that in plasmas where the particle number density is
dominated by the pairs (electron-positron and electron-positron-ion plasmas):
(i) as an effect of fast cooling and of different injection times, the electron
energy distribution is ${\rm d}n_e/{\rm d}\gamma\propto\gamma^{-2}$ for
$\gamma\lesssim\gamma_{\rm heat}$ (the Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm heat}$ being
close to the equipartition value), while the distribution steepens at higher
energies; (ii) since the time scales for the turbulent fields to decay and for
the photons to escape are of the same order, the magnetic and the radiation
energy densities in the dissipation region are comparable; (iii) if the mass
energy of the plasma is dominated by the ion component, the pairs with a
Lorentz factor smaller than a critical one (of the order of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio) become isotropic, while the pitch angle remains
small otherwise. The outlined scenario is consistent with the typical
conditions required to reproduce the Spectral Energy Distribution of blazars,
and allows one to estimate the magnetisation of the emission site. Finally, we
show that turbulence within the Crab Nebula may power the observed gamma-ray
flares if the pulsar wind is nearly charge-separated at high latitudes.

ranging from quantum chromodynamics to string theory and holography. However,
they remain a difficult technical challenge because in most cases it is not
known how to perform the sum over planar graphs, which dominate the models at
large $N$. In this thesis, we study large $D$ matrix models, which provide a
framework to build new limits for matrix models in which the sum over planar
graphs simplifies when $D$ is large. The basic degrees of freedom are real
matrices of size $N\times N$ with $r$ additional indices of range $D$. They can
be interpreted as a real tensor of rank $R=r+2$ with indices of different
ranges, making a compelling connection with tensor models. We define a new
large $D$ limit for the sum over Feynman graphs of fixed genus in matrix
models, based on an enhanced large $D$ scaling of the coupling constants. Then,
we show that the resulting large $D$ expansion is well-defined and organized
according to a half-integer called the index. When $N=D$, the result provides a
new large $N$ limit for general $\text{O}(N)^R$ invariant tensor models. In the
large $D$ limit, the sum over planar graphs of large $N$ matrix models
simplifies to a non-trivial sum over generalized melonic graphs. This class of
graphs extends the one obtained in tensor models with standard scaling and
allows for a wider class of interactions, including all the maximally
single-trace terms. The general classification of generalized melonic graphs
remains an open problem. However, in the case of the complete interaction of
order $R+1$ for $R$ a prime number, we identify them in detail and demonstrate
that they exhibit the same important features as the SYK model with
$q=(R+1)$-fold random interactions, including the emergent conformal symmetry
in the infrared regime and maximal chaos.

least two secondary separation events that occurred at significantly different
times. We considered a possible formation mechanism for these clusters: The
parent of an asteroid cluster was spun up to its critical rotation frequency,
underwent a rotation fission and was slowed down by escape of the newly formed
secondary/ies. Then the YORP effect spun up the primary again and it reached
its critical rotation frequency and underwent another fission. We created a
simple model to test whether this scenario is possible for the four clusters.
We obtained a good agreement between the model and the cluster properties for
the clusters of Kap'bos and (63440). For the cluster of Emilkowalski, the time
needed for the primary to reach its critical frequency after the first fission
event was predicted to be too long by a factor of several. We suspect,
considering also its D type taxonomic classification and the existence of a
dust band associated with the cluster, that the asteroid Emilkowalski may
actually be a cometary nucleus. For the cluster of (157123), the final
rotational frequency of the primary after the last fission event predicted by
our model is in a good agreement with the observed rotation frequency of
(157123). However, a separation of the older secondary is not possible in our
model due to the deficiency of free energy needed for an escape of the large
secondary. This could be due to an error in the H value of the secondary or the

ionized halo that surrounds the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We present the

(l,b) = (289.5,-35.0) to (315.1,-5.3) and covering +90 <= vLSR <= +210 km s-1.
The ionized gas emission extends far beyond the central stellar component of
the galaxy, reaching similar distances to that of the diffuse neutral halo
traced by 21 cm observations. H-alpha emission extends several degrees beyond
the sensitivity of current H I surveys toward smaller Galactic longitudes and
more negative Galactic latitudes. The velocity field of the ionized gas near
the SMC appears similar to to the neutral halo of the galaxy. Using the
observed emission measure as a guide, we estimate the mass of this newly
revealed ionized component to be roughly (0.8 - 1.0) x 10^9 M_sun, which is
comparable to the total neutral mass in the same region of (0.9 - 1.1) x 10^9
M_sun. We find ratios of the total ionized gas mass divided by the total
neutral plus ionized gas mass in three distinct subregions to be: (1) 46%-54%
throughout the SMC and its extended halo, (2) 12%-32% in the SMC Tail that
extends toward the Magellanic Bridge, and (3) 65%-79% in a filament that
extends away from the SMC toward the Magellanic Stream. This newly discovered,
coherent H-alpha filament does not appear to have a well-structured neutral

It offers a peer-to-peer network of nodes with no centralised governing entity

certain advantages to the paper-based recording approach, it does not work well
with digital relationships where the data is in constant flux. Unlike
traditional channels, governed by centralized entities, blockchain offers its
users a certain level of anonymity by providing capabilities to interact
without disclosing their personal identities and allows them to build trust
without a third-party governing entity. Due to the aforementioned
characteristics of blockchain, more and more users around the globe are
inclined towards making a digital transaction via blockchain than via
rudimentary channels. Therefore, there is a dire need for us to gain insight on
how these transactions are processed by the blockchain and how much time it may
take for a peer to confirm a transaction and add it to the blockchain network.
This paper presents a novel approach that would allow one to estimate the time,
in block time or otherwise, it would take for a mining node to accept and
confirm a transaction to a block using machine learning. The paper also aims to
compare the predictive accuracy of two machine learning regression models-
Random Forest Regressor and Multilayer Perceptron against previously proposed

to determine whether machine learning offers a more accurate predictive model

interaction quench. It decays inversely with the distance for short times due
to the fermionic correlations in the initial state, which changes into a
non-integer power law decay for late times, representing dissipation induced
Luttinger liquid behaviour. However, the crossover between the two regions
occurs due to dissipation induced damping, and is unrelated to the propagation
of excitations. The velocity of information spreading is set by the dissipative

extensive value. Our results can be tested experimentally in one-dimensional

this paper derives analytically tractable expressions for the privacy

local attainability of a target which is the closure of an open set. When the
target is smooth and locally the sublevel set of a smooth function, we develop
second order attainability conditions as explicit pointwise conditions on the
vector fields at points where all the available vector fields are contained in
the tangent space of its boundary. Our sufficient condition requires the
function defining the target to be a strict supersolution of a second order
degenerate elliptic equation and if satisfied, it allows to reach the target
with a piecewise constant control with at most one switch. For symmetric
systems, our sufficient condition is also necessary and can be reformulated as
a suitable symmetric matrix having a negative eigenvalue. For nonlinear affine
systems to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition we require an additional
request on the drift. Our second order pde has the same role of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation for first order sufficient conditions.

long-standing problem in artificial intelligence, which has the potential to
not only bring the areas of logic and learning closer together but also
demonstrate how abstract concepts might emerge from sensory data. Precisely
because deep learning methods dominate perception-based learning, including
vision, speech, and linguistic grammar, there is fast-growing literature on how
to integrate symbolic reasoning and deep learning. Broadly, efforts seem to
fall into three camps: those focused on defining a logic whose formulas capture
deep learning, ones that integrate symbolic constraints in deep learning, and
others that allow neural computations and symbolic reasoning to co-exist
separately, to enjoy the strengths of both worlds. In this paper, we identify
another dimension to this inquiry: what do the hidden layers really capture,
and how can we reason about that logically? In particular, we consider
autoencoders that are widely used for dimensionality reduction and inject a
symbolic generative framework onto the feature layer. This allows us, among
other things, to generate example images for a class to get a sense of what was
learned. Moreover, the modular structure of the proposed model makes it
possible to learn relations over multiple images at a time, as well as handle
noisy labels. Our empirical evaluations show the promise of this inquiry.

Isotopic content of both crystal lattice and impurity centers cause the
effects, which can be examined by different optical techniques. While disorder
in the host lattice can be straight forward evaluated by inelastic light
scattering or by SIMS measurements, determination of isotopic contributions of
many orders less presented impurities remains challenging and usually observed
in high-resolution photoluminescence or optical absorption spectra. Boron-doped
diamonds exhibit complex infrared absorption spectra while boron-related
luminescence remains unobserved. Boron, as a most light element acting as a
hydrogen-like dopant in elemental semiconductors, has a largest relative
difference in its isotope masses, and by this, cause the largest isotopic
disorder in semiconductors, including diamond, an elemental semiconductor with
the lightest atomic mass of a host lattice. This enables an access to the
isotopic constitution of boron in diamond by infrared absorption spectroscopy.
By comparison of low-temperature absorption spectra of a natural (20% of 10B

the well known trust region policy optimization for deep reinforcement
learning. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the total expected reward
when the agent acts according to the policy. The trust region subproblem is
constructed with a surrogate function coherent to the total expected reward and
a general distance constraint around the latest policy. We solve the subproblem
using a preconditioned stochastic gradient method with a line search scheme to
ensure that each step promotes the model function and stays in the trust
region. To overcome the bias caused by sampling to the function estimations
under the random settings, we add the empirical standard deviation of the total
expected reward to the predicted increase in a ratio in order to update the
trust region radius and decide whether the trial point is accepted. Moreover,
for a Gaussian policy which is commonly used for continuous action space, the
maximization with respect to the mean and covariance is performed separately to
control the entropy loss. Our theoretical analysis shows that the deterministic

the total expected reward and the global convergence is guaranteed under

Rosetta. The ALMA maps show that the emission of PN and PO arises from several
spots associated with low-velocity gas with narrow linewidths in the cavity
walls of a bipolar outflow. PO is more abundant than PN in most of the spots,
with the PO/PN ratio increasing as a function of the distance to the protostar.
Our data favor a formation scenario in which shocks sputter phosphorus from the
surface of dust grains, and gas-phase photochemistry induced by UV photons from
the protostar allows efficient formation of the two species in the cavity
walls. Our analysis of the ROSINA data has revealed that PO is the main carrier
of P in the comet, with PO/PN>10. Since comets may have delivered a significant
amount of prebiotic material to the early Earth, this finding suggests that PO
could contribute significantly to the phosphorus reservoir during the dawn of
our planet. There is evidence that PO was already in the cometary ices prior to
the birth of the Sun, so the chemical budget of the comet might be inherited
from the natal environment of the Solar System, which is thought to be a

availability of structured patient data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to
aid caregivers. However, in case of hospitals in developing countries,
structured patient data formats are not widely adopted, where medical
professionals still rely on clinical notes in the form of unstructured text.
Such unstructured clinical notes recorded by medical personnel can also be a
potential source of rich patient-specific information which can be leveraged to
build CDSSs, even for hospitals in developing countries. If such unstructured
clinical text can be used, the manual and time-consuming process of EHR
generation will no longer be required, with huge person-hours and cost savings.
In this paper, we propose a generic ICD9 disease group prediction CDSS built on
unstructured physician notes modeled using hybrid word embeddings. These word
embeddings are used to train a deep neural network for effectively predicting
ICD9 disease groups. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach
outperformed the state-of-the-art disease group prediction model built on
structured EHRs by 15% in terms of AUROC and 40% in terms of AUPRC, thus
proving our hypothesis and eliminating dependency on availability of structured
patient data.

significant improvements to estimates of these parameters made using light
curve structure and period over estimates made using only the period. Given
that the models are able to reproduce most observables, we find that the
fundamental parameters of these stars can be estimated up to 60% more
accurately when light curve structure is taken into consideration. We quantify
which aspects of light curve structure are most important in determining
fundamental parameters, and find for example that the second Fourier amplitude
component of RR Lyrae light curves is even more important than period in
determining the effective temperature of the star. We apply this analysis to
observations of hundreds Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and thousands
of RR Lyrae in the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic bulge to produce catalogs of
estimated masses, radii, luminosities, and other parameters of these stars. As
an example application, we estimate Wesenheit indices and use those to derive

fringe-pattern phase analysis. Firstly, according to the experimental result of
the radial distortion of the image not related to the recording depth of field,
but depending on the field of view angle of the wide-angle lens imaging system,
two-dimensional image distortion calibration is need to be considered. Four
standard sinusoidal fringe-patterns with phase shift step of , which are used
as calibration templates, are shown on a Liquid Crystal Display screen, and
captured by the wide-angle lens imaging system. A four-step phase-shifting
method is employed to obtain the radial phase distribution of the distorted
fringe-pattern. Wavelet analysis is applied for the analysis of the
instantaneous frequency to show the fundamental frequency of the fringe-pattern
in the central region being unchanged. Performing numerical calculation by the
central 9 points of the central row of the fringe-pattern, we can get the
undistorted radial phase distribution, so, the radial modulated phase is
computed. Finally, the radial distortion distribution is determined according
to the radial modulated phase. By employing a bilinear interpolation algorithm,
the wide-angle lens image calibration is achieved. There is no need to
establish any kind of image distortion model for the proposed method. There is
no projecting system in the experimental apparatus, which avoids projection
shadow problems, and no need to align with the center of the template for
distortion measurement for the proposed method. Theoretical description,
numerical simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method is
simple, automatic and effective.

bit error rate (BER) into one with low BER (at the expense of rate). Our focus
is on obtaining codes with smooth (""graceful'') input-output BER curves (as
opposed to threshold-like curves typical for long error-correcting codes).
  This paper restricts attention to binary erasure channels (BEC) and contains
three contributions. First, we introduce the notion of Low Density Majority
Codes (LDMCs). These codes are non-linear sparse-graph codes, which output
majority function evaluated on randomly chosen small subsets of the data bits.
This is similar to Low Density Generator Matrix codes (LDGMs), except that the
XOR function is replaced with the majority. We show that even with a few
iterations of belief propagation (BP) the attained input-output curves provably
improve upon performance of any linear systematic code. The effect of
non-linearity bootstraping the initial iterations of BP, suggests that LDMCs
should improve performance in various applications, where LDGMs have been used
traditionally.
  Second, we establish several \textit{two-point converse bounds} that lower
bound the BER achievable at one erasure probability as a function of BER
achieved at another one. The novel nature of our bounds is that they are
specific to subclasses of codes (linear systematic and non-linear systematic)
and outperform similar bounds implied by the area theorem for the EXIT
function.

equilibrium is stable in the sense of measure, provided it is spectrally stable
and except six special resonant cases. Indeed, under this condition, there are
abundant KAM invariant tori or quasi-periodic solutions near Lagrange relative
equilibrium. Furthermore, these tori or quasi-periodic solutions form a set
whose relative measure rapidly tends to 1. We also prove that Lagrange relative

also right for a large open subset of spectrally stable space of masses.

ripples and dunes, and separated by a gap in wavelength. This gap is explained
in terms of an anomalous hydrodynamic response in the structure of the inner
boundary layer that leads to a shift of the position of the maximum shear
stress from upstream to downstream of the crest. This anomaly gradually
disappears when the bed becomes hydrodynamically rough. By also considering the
effect of the spatial relaxation of sediment transport we provide a new
unifying framework to compare ripples and dunes in planetary environments to

settling energy contracts among prosumers in a Residential Energy Cooperative
considering heterogeneity prosumer preferences. The heterogeneity arises from
prosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and
environmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those
criteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually
agree on periodical energy contracts/loans consisting of the energy volume to
be exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The
negotiating prosumers navigate through a common negotiation domain consisting
of potential energy contracts and evaluate those contracts from their
valuations on the entailed criteria against a utility function that is robust
against generation and demand uncertainty. From the repeated interactions, a
prosumer gradually learns about the compatibility of its peers in reaching
energy contracts that are closer to Nash solutions. Empirical evaluation on
real demand, generation and storage profiles -- in multiple system scales --
illustrates that the proposed negotiation based strategy can increase the
system efficiency (measured by utilitarian social welfare) and fairness
(measured by Nash social welfare) over a baseline strategy and an individual
flexibility control strategy representing the status quo strategy. We thus
elicit system benefits from peer-to-peer flexibility exchange already without
any central coordination and market operator, providing a simple yet flexible
and effective paradigm that complements existing markets.

metric can not be homogeneous for $\chi>\chi_\S$, as it is usually assumed. To
account for this, we propose a new causal boundary condition, that can be
fulfil by fixing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (a free parameter for
gravity). The resulting Universe is inhomogeneous, with possible variation of
cosmological parameters on scales $\chi \simeq \chi_\S$. The size of $\chi_\S$
depends on the details of inflation, but regardless of its size, the boundary
condition forces $\Lambda/8\pi G $ to cancel the contribution of a constant
vacuum energy $\rho_{vac}$ to the measured $\rho_\Lambda \equiv \Lambda/8\pi G
+ \rho_{vac}$. To reproduce the observed $\rho_{\Lambda} \simeq 2 \rho_m$ today
with $\chi_\S \rightarrow \infty$ we then need a universe filled with evolving
dark energy (DE) with pressure $p_{DE}> - \rho_{DE}$ and a fine tuned value of
$\rho_{DE} \simeq 2 \rho_m$ today. This seems very odd, but there is another
solution to this puzzle. We can have a finite value of $\chi_\S \simeq 3 c/H_0$

Thus, we have focused on the quantum mechanical states of the radiation quanta
and the mass in the black hole, showing that at first order plus small
corrections (condition needed to neglect effects of quantum gravity in normal
physics) the Hawking conclusion of mixed states/remnants holds. Finally, we

generalize better to diverse domains. But to be deployed on edge devices, the
model's complexity has to be constrained due to limited compute resource. In
this work, we propose a method to improve the model capacity without increasing
inference-time complexity. Our method is based on an assumption of data
locality: for an edge device, within a short period of time, the input data to
the device are sampled from a single domain with relatively low diversity.
Therefore, it is possible to utilize a specialized, low-complexity model to
achieve good performance in that input domain. To leverage this, we propose
Domain-aware Dynamic Network (DDN), which is a high-capacity dynamic network in
which each layer contains multiple weights. During inference, based on the
input domain, DDN dynamically combines those weights into one single weight
that specializes in the given domain. This way, DDN can keep the inference-time
complexity low but still maintain a high capacity. Experiments show that
without increasing the parameters, FLOPs, and actual latency, DDN achieves up
to 2.6\% higher AP50 than a static network on the BDD100K object-detection

functions have been proposed to increase the feature margin between different
classes. However, despite great achievements have been made, they mainly suffer
from three issues: 1) Obviously, they ignore the importance of informative
features mining for discriminative learning; 2) They encourage the feature
margin only from the ground truth class, without realizing the discriminability
from other non-ground truth classes; 3) The feature margin between different
classes is set to be same and fixed, which may not adapt the situations very
well. To cope with these issues, this paper develops a novel loss function,
which adaptively emphasizes the mis-classified feature vectors to guide the
discriminative feature learning. Thus we can address all the above issues and
achieve more discriminative face features. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to inherit the advantages of feature margin and feature

algorithm. Non-initiator determinants (i.e. determinants whose population is
below the initiator threshold) are subject to a systematic {\em undersampling}
bias, which in large systems leads to a bias in the energy when an insufficient
number of walkers is used. We show that the acceptance probability ($p_{acc}$),
that a non-initiator determinant has its spawns accepted, can be used to unbias
the initiator bias, in a simple and accurate manner, by reducing the applied
shift to the non-initiator proportionately to $p_{acc}$. This modification
preserves the property that in the large walker limit, when
$p_{acc}\rightarrow1$, the unbiasing procedure disappears, and the initiator
approximation becomes exact. We demonstrate that this algorithm shows rapid
convergence to the FCI limit with respect to walker number, and furthermore
largely removes the dependence of the algorithm on the initiator threshold,
enabling highly accurate results to be obtained even with large values of the
threshold. This is exemplified in the case of butadiene/ANO-L-pVDZ and
benzene/cc-pVDZ, correlating 22 and 30 electrons in 82 and 108 orbitals
respectively. In butadiene $5\times 10^7$ and in benzene $10^8$ walkers suffice
to obtain an energy to within a milli-Hartree of the CCSDT(Q) result, in
Hilbert spaces of $10^{26}$ and $10^{35}$ respectively. Essentially converged
results require $\sim 10^8$ walkers for butadiene and $\sim 10^9$ walkers for
benzene, and lie slightly lower than CCSDT(Q). Owing to large-scale
parallelisability, these calculations can be executed in a matter of hours on a
few hundred processors. The present method largely solves the initiator-bias
problems that the initiator method suffered from when applied to medium-sized
molecules.

of the most significant challenges to photo-response non-uniformity based
source camera attribution from videos. When performed digitally, stabilization
involves cropping, warping, and inpainting of video frames to eliminate
unwanted camera motion. Hence, successful attribution requires the inversion of
these transformations in a blind manner. To address this challenge, we
introduce a source camera verification method for videos that takes into
account the spatially variant nature of stabilization transformations and
assumes a larger degree of freedom in their search. Our method identifies
transformations at a sub-frame level, incorporates a number of constraints to
validate their correctness, and offers computational flexibility in the search
for the correct transformation. The method also adopts a holistic approach in
countering disruptive effects of other video generation steps, such as video
coding and downsizing, for more reliable attribution. Tests performed on one
public and two custom datasets show that the proposed method is able to verify
the source of 23-30% of all videos that underwent stronger stabilization,
depending on computation load, without a significant impact on false
attribution.

(MEMS), such as scanning micro mirrors, are well-established in automotive and
consumer products. As the areas of application broaden, the requirements for
the MEMS are increasing. Devices outside of the performance specifications have
to be rejected which is costly due to the high processing times of MEMS
technologies. In particular, nonlinear system behavior is often found to cause
unexpected device failure or performance issues. Thus, accurate simulation or
rather system models which account for nonlinear sensor dynamics can not only
increase process yield, but more importantly, lead to a comprehensive
understanding of the underlying physics and to improved MEMS design. We have
studied [1] the possibility of a rather drastic device failure induced by
nonlinearities on the example of a resonant scanning MEMS micro mirror. On the
level of a few selected chips, we have carefully measured the complex nonlinear
system behavior and modeled it by a nonlinear mode-coupling phenomenon known as
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The most intriguing feature of
SPDC is the sudden change from a rather linear to a nonlinear system behavior
at the critical oscillation amplitude. However, the threshold only lies within
the range of the mirror's operational amplitude, if certain frequency resonance
conditions regarding the mechanical modes are met. Thus, the critical amplitude
strongly depends on the frequency spectrum of the MEMS design which in turn is
largely influenced by fabrication imperfections. We validate the dependence of
the critical amplitude on the resonance condition by measuring it for over 600
micro mirrors on wafer-level. Our work does not only validate the theory of
SPDC with measurements on such a large scale, but also demonstrates modeling
strategies which are essential for MEMS product design.

low-dimensional embedding vectors. Recently, heterogeneous network has shown to
be effective in representing diverse information in data. However,
heterogeneous network embedding suffers from the imbalance issue, i.e. the size
of relation types (or the number of edges in the network regarding the type) is
imbalanced. In this paper, we devise a new heterogeneous network embedding
method, called BHIN2vec, which considers the balance among all relation types
in a network. We view the heterogeneous network embedding as simultaneously
solving multiple tasks in which each task corresponds to each relation type in
a network. After splitting the skip-gram loss into multiple losses
corresponding to different tasks, we propose a novel random-walk strategy to
focus on the tasks with high loss values by considering the relative training
ratio. Unlike previous random walk strategies, our proposed random-walk
strategy generates training samples according to the relative training ratio
among different tasks, which results in a balanced training for the node
embedding. Our extensive experiments on node classification and recommendation
demonstrate the superiority of BHIN2vec compared to the state-of-the-art
methods. Also, based on the relative training ratio, we analyze how much each

of avoiding long distance communications, preserve the energy of nodes and so
is attractive for related applications. The criticality of most applications of
WSNs and also their unattended nature, makes sensor nodes often susceptible to
many types of attacks. Based on this fact, it is clear that cluster heads (CHs)
are the most attacked targets by attackers, and also according to their
critical operations in CWSNs, their compromise and control by an attacker will
disrupt the entire cluster and sometimes the entire network, so their security
needs more attentiveness and must be ensured. In this paper, we introduce a
hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for securing CHs, to take advantages
of both anomaly-based and misuse-based detection methods, that is high
detection and low false alarm rate. Also by using a novel preprocessing model,
significantly reduces the computational and memory complexities of the proposed
IDS, and finally allows the use of the clustering algorithms for it. The
simulation results show that the proposed IDS in comparison to existing works,
which often have high computational and memory complexities, can be as an
effective and lightweight IDS for securing CHs.

others in the form of a message composed of classical bits of information.
Because in a classical world everything physical is observable and
communicable, it is a daunting task to explain how an empirically unobservable,
incommunicable consciousness could have any physical substrates such as neurons
composed of biochemical molecules, water, and electrolytes. The challenges
encountered by classical physics are exemplified by a number of thought
experiments including the inverted qualia argument, the private language
argument, the beetle in the box argument and the knowledge argument. These
thought experiments, however, do not imply that our consciousness is
nonphysical and our introspective conscious testimonies are untrustworthy. The
principles of classical physics have been superseded by modern quantum physics,
which contains two fundamentally different kinds of physical objects:
unobservable quantum state vectors, which define what physically exists, and
quantum operators (observables), which define what can physically be observed.
Identifying consciousness with the unobservable quantum information contained
by quantum physical brain states allows for application of quantum information
theorems to resolve possible paradoxes created by the inner privacy of
conscious experiences, and explains how the observable brain is constructed by
accessible bits of classical information that are bound by Holevo's theorem and
