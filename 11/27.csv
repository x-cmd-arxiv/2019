equilibrium with an environment can be achieved by means of the Hamiltonian of
mean force. In contrast to the reduced density matrix of an open quantum
system, or the reduced phase-space probability density function of a classical
open system, the Hamiltonian of mean force not only characterizes the reduced
state but also contains full information about the thermodynamics of the
considered open system. The resulting thermodynamic potentials all assume the
form as the difference of the potentials for the total system and the bare
environment in the absence of the system. In contrast to work as a mechanical
notion, one faces several problems with the definition of heat which turns out
to be largely ambiguous in the case of strong coupling between system and
environment. The general theory of the thermodynamics of open systems, in
particular, in view of strong coupling, is reviewed and illustrated with
several examples. The vagueness of heat is discussed in the context of the
ambiguities in the definitions of a fluctuating internal energy and other
fluctuating thermodynamic potentials.

diffusing-diffusivity approach, are popular concepts for the description of
non-Gaussian diffusion in heterogeneous media. Studies of these models
typically focus on the moments and the displacement probability density
function. Here we develop the complementary power spectral description for a
broad class of random diffusivity processes. In our approach we cater for
typical single particle tracking data in which a small number of trajectories
with finite duration are garnered. Apart from the diffusing-diffusivity model
we study a range of previously unconsidered random diffusivity processes, for
which we obtain exact forms of the probability density function. These new
processes are different versions of jump processes as well as functionals of
Brownian motion. The resulting behaviour subtly depends on the specific model
details. Thus, the central part of the probability density function may be
Gaussian or non-Gaussian, and the tails may assume Gaussian, exponential,
log-normal or even power-law forms. For all these models we derive analytically
the moment-generating function for the single-trajectory power spectral
density. We establish the generic $1/f^2$-scaling of the power spectral density
as function of frequency in all cases. Moreover, we establish the probability
density for the amplitudes of the random power spectral density of individual
trajectories. The latter functions reflect the very specific properties of the
different random diffusivity models considered here. Our exact results are in
excellent agreement with extensive numerical simulations.

Remaining agnostic about the microscopic physics, we use an effective field
theory approach to describe the scalar dynamics. We investigate the case in
which some of the higher derivative operators, that are highly suppressed on
cosmological scales, instead become important on typical distances for black
holes. If a coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet operator is one of them, a non-trivial
background profile for the scalar field can be sourced in the surroundings of
the black hole, resulting in a potentially large amount of ""hair"". In turn,
this can induce sizeable modifications to the spacetime geometry or a mixing
between the scalar and the gravitational perturbations. Both effects will
ultimately translate into a modification of the quasi-normal mode spectrum in a
way that is also sensitive to other operators besides the one sourcing the
scalar background. The presence of deviations from the predictions of general
relativity in the observed spectrum can therefore serve as a window onto dark
energy physics.

can leverage both paired and unpaired data as we disentangle the features into

the study of hadronic structure. In particular, one can discern the relevant
degrees of freedom at different distance scales through these studies. Purpose:
To study the transition between non-perturbative and perturbative Quantum
Chromodyanmics as the square of four momentum transfer to the struck proton,
-t, is increased. Method: Cross sections for the $^1$H(e,e'$\pi^+$)n reaction
were measured over the -t range of 0.272 to 2.127 GeV$^2$ with limited
azimuthal coverage at fixed beam energy of 4.709 GeV, Q$^2$ of 2.4 GeV$^2$ and
W of 2.0 GeV at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) Hall
C. Results: The -t dependence of the measured $\pi^+$ electroproduction cross
section generally agrees with prior data from JLab Halls B and C. The data are
consistent with a Regge amplitude based theoretical model, but show poor
agreement with a Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) based model. Conclusion:
The agreement of cross sections with prior data implies small contribution from
the interference terms, and the confirmation of the change in t-slopes between
the low and high -t regions previously observed in photoproduction indicates
the changing nature of the electroproduction reaction in our kinematic regime.

Waldhausen $\infty$-categories in the sense of Barwick equipped with a
compatible duality and a refinement of their (lax) hermitian objects
generalizing the concept of Poincar\'e $\infty$-categories of Lurie. They may
also be thought of as a version of complete Segal spaces enriched in genuine
$C_2$-spaces whose underlying $\infty$-category carries a compatible Waldhausen
structure, since we show that their respective $\infty$-categories are
equivalent.
  We define the real $K$-theory genuine $C_2$-spaces by means of an enriched
version of the $S_\bullet$-construction, defined for Waldhausen
$\infty$-categories with genuine duality. Moreover, we prove an Additivity
Theorem for this $S_\bullet$-construction which leads to an Additivity Theorem
for real $K$-theory. Furthermore, such real $K$-theory satisfy a universal
property -- analogous to that proved by Barwick for algebraic $K$-theory of
Waldhausen $\infty$-categories --: We prove that every theory can be
universally turned into an additive theory and identify our real K-theory with
the universal additive theory associated to the functor that associates to a
Waldhausen $\infty$-category with genuine duality its maximal subspace.
  Finally, we promote the real $K$-theory genuine $C_2$-spaces to genuine
$C_2$-spectra.

binary pulsar 4U 1626-67 with Chandra/HETGS acquired in 2010, two years after
the pulsar experienced a torque reversal. The well-known strong Ne and O
emission lines with Keplerian profiles are shown to arise at the inner edge of
the magnetically-channeled accretion disk. We exclude a photoionization model
for these lines based on the absence of sharp radiative recombination continua.
Instead, we show that the lines arise from a collisional plasma in the
inner-disk atmosphere, with $T\simeq 10^7$ K and $n_e \sim 10^{17}$ cm^(-3). We
suggest that the lines are powered by X-ray heating of the optically-thick disk
inner edge at normal incidence. Comparison of the line profiles in HETGS
observations from 2000, 2003, and 2010 show that the inner disk radius
decreased by a factor of two after the pulsar went from spin-down to spin-up,
as predicted by magnetic accretion torque theory. The inner disk is well inside
the corotation radius during spin-up, and slightly beyond the corotation radius
during spin-down. Based on the disk radius and accretion torque measured during
steady spin-up, the pulsar's X-ray luminosity is $2\times 10^{36}$ erg/s,
yielding a source distance of 3.5(+0.2-0.3) kpc. The mass accretion rate is an
order of magnitude larger than expected from gravitational radiation reaction,
possibly due to X-ray heating of the donor. The line profiles also indicate a
binary inclination of 39(+20-10) degrees, consistent with a 0.02 Msun donor
star. Our emission measure analysis favors a He white dwarf or a highly-evolved
H-poor main sequence remnant for the donor star, rather than a C-O or O-Ne
white dwarf. The measured Ne/O ratio is 0.46+-0.14 by number. In an appendix,
we show how to express the emission measure of a H-depleted collisional plasma
without reference to a H number density.

n-type doping in subsequent layers, potentially detrimental to the performance
of the solar cell. In this work, we present an inverted rear-heterojunction
GaInP solar cell that employs a thick Te-doped GaInP layer as absorber, with a
doping profile obtained exclusively by controlling the memory effect of Te
coming from the preceding growth of a heavily doped GaAs contact layer. In this
way, GaInP is partially disordered with the use of no additional surfactant,
leading to an increase in the solar cell bandgap of around 35 meV as compared
to traditional samples doped with silicon. In the proof-of-concept experimental
devices developed so far, the use of a rear-heterojunction configuration and
the bandgap increase results in a global open-circuit voltage enhancement of
109 mV. The photocurrent decreases by 1.32 mA/cm2, mostly due to the bandgap
blue-shift, with about 0.35 mA/cm2 attributable to lower carrier collection
efficiencies. These preliminary results are discussed by analyzing the I-V
curve parameters and quantum efficiencies of a Te-doped rear-heterojunction, a
Si-doped rear-heterojunction and a Si-doped front-junction solar cell. An
additional advantage is that the emitter sheet resistance is reduced from 551

of query processing. In fact it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems.
Traditional query optimizers use dynamic programming (DP) methods combined with
a set of rules and restrictions to avoid exhaustive enumeration of all possible
join orders. However, DP methods are very resource intensive. Moreover, given
simplifying assumptions of attribute independence, traditional query optimizers
rely on erroneous cost estimations, which can lead to suboptimal query plans.
Recent success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) creates new opportunities
for the field of query optimization to tackle the above-mentioned problems. In
this paper, we present our DRL-based Fully Observed Optimizer (FOOP) which is a
generic query optimization framework that enables plugging in different machine
learning algorithms. The main idea of FOOP is to use a data-adaptive learning
query optimizer that avoids exhaustive enumerations of join orders and is thus
significantly faster than traditional approaches based on dynamic programming.
In particular, we evaluate various DRL-algorithms and show that Proximal Policy
Optimization significantly outperforms Q-learning based algorithms. Finally we
demonstrate how ensemble learning techniques combined with DRL can further

perturbation theory (GF2) which avoids all dependency on continuous variables,

terms of static quantities and wave functions. Correlation effects from MP2
diagrams are iteratively incorporated to modify the underlying spectrum of
excitations by coupling the physical system to fictitious auxiliary degrees of
freedom, allowing for the single-particle orbitals to delocalize into this
additional space. The overall approach is shown to be rigorously
$\mathcal{O}[N^5]$, after an appropriate compression of this auxiliary space.
This is achieved via a novel scheme which ensures that a desired number of
moments of the underlying occupied and virtual spectra are conserved in the
compression, allowing a rapid and systematically improvable convergence to the
limit of the effective dynamical resolution. The approach is found to then
allow for the qualitative description of stronger correlation effects, avoiding
the divergences of MP2, as well as its orbital-optimized version. On
application to the G1 test set, we find that modifications to only up to the
third spectral moment of the underlying spectrum from which the double
excitations are built is required for accurate energetics, even in strongly

studying charge transport in molecular junctions accounting for strong
electron-vibration interactions and including electronic and phononic
environments. The method radically expands the scope of the input-output
theory, which was originally proposed to treat quantum optic problems. Based on
the GIOM we derive a Langevin-type equation of motion for molecular operators,
which posses a great generality and accuracy, and permits the derivation of a
stationary charge current expression involving only two types of transfer
rates. Furthermore, we devise the so-called ""Polaron Transport in Electronic
Resonance"" (PoTER) approximation, which allows to feasibly simulate electron
dynamics in generic tight-binding models with strong electron-vibration
interactions. For short chains, the charge current reduces to known limits and
reasonably agrees with exact numerical simulations. For extended junctions the
current displays a turnover from phonon-assisted to phonon-suppressed
transport. Nevertheless, the onset of ohmic behavior requires extensions beyond
the PoTER approximation. As an additional application, we consider a
cavity-coupled molecule junction. Here we identify a cavity-induced suppression
of charge current in the single-site case, and observe signatures of polariton
formation in the current-voltage characteristics in the strong light-matter
coupling regime. A critical understanding gained from the GIOM-PoTER scheme is
that the single-site vibrationally-coupled model is deceptively simpler, and
amenable to approximations than multi-site models. Therefore, benchmarking of
methods should not be concluded with the single-site case. The work manifests
that the input-output framework, which is normally employed in quantum optics,
can serve as a powerful and feasible tool in the realm of electron transport
junctions.

train models allowing to vectorize documents. Six of its parameters were
optimised by following a grid-search strategy to train more than 1,900 models.
Parameters combination leading to the best accuracy was used to train models on
abstracts from the PubMed database. Four evaluations tasks were defined to
determine what does or does not influence the proximity between documents for
both Doc2Vec and pmra. The two different Doc2Vec architectures have different
abilities to link documents about a common context. The terminological
indexing, words and stems contents of linked documents are highly similar
between pmra and Doc2Vec PV-DBOW architecture. These algorithms are also more
likely to bring closer documents having a similar size. In contrary, the manual
evaluation shows much better results for the pmra algorithm. While the pmra
algorithm links documents by explicitly using terminological indexing in its
formula, Doc2Vec does not need a prior indexing. It can infer relations between
documents sharing a similar indexing, without any knowledge about them,
particularly regarding the PV-DBOW architecture. In contrary, the human
evaluation, without any clear agreement between evaluators, implies future
studies to better understand this difference between PV-DBOW and pmra

driving behaviours is hard: while collisions---and their near-avoidance---are
essential to the learning process, directly executing immature policies on
autonomous vehicles raises considerable safety concerns. In this article, we
present a safe and efficient framework that enables the learning of driving
policies for autonomous vehicles operating in a shared workspace, where the
absence of collisions cannot be guaranteed. Key to our learning procedure is a
sim2real approach that uses real-world online policy adaptation in a
mixed-reality setup, where other vehicles and static obstacles exist in the
virtual domain. This allows us to perform safe learning by simulating (and
learning from) collisions between the learning agent(s) and other objects in
virtual reality. Our results demonstrate that, after only a few runs in
mixed-reality, collisions are significantly reduced.

3/4 of their mass at rest. Any excess of heat has to be dissipated in the
surrounding environment to prevent overheating. Most of that dissipation occurs
through the skin, but the efficiency of that mechanism decreases with the
animal's mass. The role of the other mechanisms for dissipating heat is then
raised, more particularly the one linked to the lung that forms a much larger
surface area than the skin. The dissipation occurring in the lung is however
often neglected, even though there exists no real knowledge of its dynamics,
hidden by the complexity of the organ's geometry and of the physics of the
exchanges. Here we show, based on an original and analytical model of the
exchanges in the lung, that all mammals, independently of their mass, dissipate
through their lung the same proportion of the heat they produced, about 6-7 %.
We found that the heat dissipation in mammals' lung is driven by a number,
universal among mammals, that arises from the dynamics of the temperature of
the bronchial mucosa. We propose a scenario to explain how evolution might have
tuned the lung for heat exchanges. Furthermore, our analysis allows to define
the pulmonary heat and water diffusive capacities. We show in the human case
that these capacities follow closely the oxygen consumption. Our work lays the
foundations for more detailed analysis of the heat exchanges occurring in the
lung. Future studies should focus on refining our understanding of the
universal number identified. In an ecological framework, our analysis paves the
way to a better understanding of the mammals' strategies for thermoregulation
and of the effect of warming environments on mammals' metabolism.

on a measurement of local primordial non-Gaussianity and the relativistic

of shot noise terms required to describe the stochasticity of the data.
Although the shot noise is white on large scales, it is desirable to
investigate the extent to which it can degrade constraints on the parameters of
interest. In a multi-tracer analysis of the power spectrum, a marginalization
over shot noise does not degrade the constraints on $f_\text{NL}$ by more than
$\sim 30$% so long as halos of mass $M\lesssim 10^{12}M_\odot$ are resolved.
However, ignoring cross shot noise terms induces large systematics on a
measurement of $f_\text{NL}$ at redshift $z<1$ when small mass halos are
resolved. These effects are less severe for the relativistic projections,
especially for the dipole term. In the case of a low and high mass tracer, the
optimal sample division maximizes the signal-to-noise on $f_\text{NL}$ and the
projection effects simultaneously, reducing the errors to the level of $\sim
10$ consecutive mass bins of equal number density. We also emphasize that the
non-Poissonian noise corrections that arise from small-scale clustering effects
cannot be measured with random dilutions of the data. Therefore, they must
either be properly modeled or marginalized over.

from the observed data by maximum marginal likelihood estimation, and can
simultaneously estimate multiple regularisation parameters. Furthermore, the
proposed algorithm uses the same basic operators as proximal optimisation
algorithms, namely gradient and proximal operators, and it is therefore
straightforward to apply to problems that are currently solved by using
proximal optimisation techniques. Our methodology is demonstrated with a range

variations large enough to make it difficult to disentangle planet signals from
the stellar noise. In this context, HD41248 is an interesting planet-host
candidate, with RV observations plagued by activity-induced signals. We report
on ESPRESSO observations of HD41248 and analyse them together with previous
observations from HARPS with the goal of evaluating the presence of orbiting
planets. Using different noise models within a general Bayesian framework
designed for planet detection in RV data, we test the significance of the
various signals present in the HD41248 dataset. We use Gaussian processes as
well as a first-order moving average component to try to correct for
activity-induced signals. At the same time, we analyse photometry from the TESS
mission, searching for transits and rotational modulation in the light curve.
The number of significantly detected Keplerian signals depends on the noise
model employed, which can range from 0 with the Gaussian process model to 3
with a white noise model. We find that the Gaussian process alone can explain
the RV data while allowing for the stellar rotation period and active region
evolution timescale to be constrained. The rotation period estimated from the
RVs agrees with the value determined from the TESS light curve. Based on the
data that is currently available, we conclude that the RV variations of HD41248
can be explained by stellar activity (using the Gaussian process model) in line
with the evidence from activity indicators and the TESS photometry.

user's definition of model-data agreement. This allows for model selection on
any type of data distribution, unlike Bayesian and standard regression
techniques, that ""fail"" in some cases. We show that our tool is capable of
representing and combining least squares, likelihood-based, and Bayesian
calibration techniques in a single framework while being able to generalize
aspects of these methods. This tool also offers new insights into the
interpretation of the predictive envelopes (also known as confidence bands)
while giving the analyst more control over these envelopes. We demonstrate the
validity of our method by providing three numerical examples to calibrate
different models, including a model for energy dissipation in lap joints under
impact loading. By calibrating models with respect to the validation metrics
one desires a model to ultimately pass, reliability and safety metrics may be
integrated into and automatically adopted by the model in the calibration
phase.

was recently analyzed at leading level in the deflection angle, uncovering an
interesting connection between exponentiation of infrared divergences in
momentum space and the eikonal exponentiation in impact parameter space. Here
we extend that analysis to the first non trivial sub-leading level in the
deflection angle which, for massless external particles, implies going to two
loops, i.e. to third post-Minkowskian (3PM) order. As in the case of the
leading eikonal, we see that the factorisation of the momentum space amplitude
into the exponential of the one-loop result times a finite remainder hides some
basic simplicity of the impact parameter formulation. For the conservative part
of the process, the explicit outcome is infrared (IR) finite, shows no
logarithmic enhancement, and agrees with an old claim in pure Einstein gravity,
while the dissipative part is IR divergent and should be regularized, as usual,
by including soft gravitational bremsstrahlung. Finally, using recent
three-loop results, we test the expectation that eikonal formulation accounts
for the exponentiation of the lower-loop results in the momentum space
amplitude. This passes a number of highly non-trivial tests, but appears to
fail for the dissipative part of the process at all loop orders and
sufficiently subleading order in $\epsilon$, hinting at some lack of
commutativity of the relevant infrared limits for each exponentiation.

Optimized horizontal data partitioning has a significant influence of
distributed data management systems. An optimally partitioned schema found in
the early phase of logical database design without loading of real data in the
system and its adaptation to changes of business environment are very important
for a successful implementation, system scalability and performance
improvement. In this paper we present a novel approach for finding an optimal
horizontally partitioned schema that manifests a minimal total execution cost

enables abstraction of the predicates in the workload queries, and are
subsequently used to define all relational fragments. This approach has
predictive features acquired by simulation of horizontal partitioning, without
loading any data into the partitions, but instead, altering the statistics in
the database catalogs. We define an optimization problem and employ a genetic
algorithm (GA) to find an approximately optimal horizontally partitioned
schema. The solutions to the optimization problem are evaluated using
PostgreSQL's query optimizer. The initial experimental evaluation of our
approach confirms its efficiency and correctness, and the numbers imply that
the approach is effective in reducing the workload execution cost.

estimate radiant and velocity accuracy which may be achieved by various meteor
observation systems as applied to several meteor showers. For low-resolution
all-sky systems, where the meteor deceleration is generally not measurable, the
multi-parameter fit method assuming a constant velocity better reproduces the
radiant and speed of synthetic meteors. For moderate field of view systems, our
novel method performs the best at all convergence angles, while multi-parameter
fit methods generally produce larger speed errors. For high-resolution, narrow
field of view systems, we find our new method of trajectory estimation
reproduces radiant and speed more accurately than all other methods tested. The
ablation properties of meteoroids are commonly found to be the limiting factor
in velocity accuracy. We show that the true radiant dispersion of meteor
showers can be reliably measured with moderate field of view (or more precise)
systems provided appropriate methods of meteor trajectory estimation are

clockwise and counterclockwise spiral galaxies imaged by the space-based COSMOS
survey is compared to the differences between clockwise and counterclockwise
galaxies imaged by the Earth-based SDSS and Pan-STARRS around the same field.
The annotation of clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies is a fully automatic
process that does not involve human intervention, and in all experiments both
clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies are separated from the same fields. The
comparison shows that the same asymmetry was identified by all three
telescopes, providing strong evidence that the rotation direction of a spiral
galaxy is linked to its luminosity as measured from Earth. Analysis of the
luminosity difference using a large number of galaxies from different parts of
the sky shows that the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise
galaxies changes with the direction of observation, and oriented around an
axis.

combinatorial Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. We construct a
geometric realization of this Hopf monoid over the adjoint of the
(essentialized) braid hyperplane arrangement, which identifies the monomial
basis with signed characteristic functions of the interiors of permutohedral
tangent cones. We show that the indecomposable quotient Lie coalgebra is
obtained by restricting functions to chambers of the adjoint arrangement, i.e.
by quotienting out the higher codimensions. The resulting functions are
characterized by the Steinmann relations of axiomatic quantum field theory,
demonstrating an equivalence between the Steinmann relations, tangent cones to
(generalized) permutohedra, and having algebraic structure internal to species.
Our results give a new interpretation of a construction appearing in the
mathematically rigorous formulation of renormalization by Epstein-Glaser,
called causal perturbation theory. In particular, we show that operator
products of time-ordered products correspond to the H-basis of the
cocommutative Hopf monoid of set compositions, and generalized retarded

can display surprisingly large fluctuations towards ordered behaviour, as
quantified by certain types of time-integrated plaquette observables, despite
the underlying dynamics being non-interacting. In the large deviation (LD)
regime of long times and large system size, this can give rise to a phase
transition in trajectory space. As a non-interacting system we consider a
collection of spins undergoing single spin-flip dynamics at
infinite-temperature. For the dynamical observables we study, the associated
tilted generators have an exact and explicit spin-plaquette duality. Such setup
suggests the existence of a transition (in the large size limit) at the
self-dual point of the tilted generator. The nature of the LD transition
depends on the observable. We consider explicitly two situations: (i) for a
pairwise bond observable the LD transition is continuous, and equivalent to
that of the transverse field Ising model; (ii) for a higher order plaquette
observable, in contrast, the LD transition is first order. Case (i) is easy to
prove analytically, while we confirm case (ii) numerically via an efficient
trajectory sampling scheme that exploits the non-interacting nature of the
original dynamics.

exchange field, is studied theoretically in two different setups: a single wire
in which all these fields coexist, and a double wire system in which
superconducting pairing and the spin-dependent fields are spatially separated.
We first explore a magnetoelectric effect, namely the appearance of anomalous
charge supercurrents. We determine the conditions under which such currents are
allowed by symmetry and express them in terms of the SU(2) electric and
magnetic fields. In leading order in the strength of the fields we find that in
the single wire setup such currents may appear only when the Zeeman field has
both, a longitudinal and transverse component with respect to the spin-orbit
field. In contrast, in the two wire setup a parallel component to the SOC can
generate the anomalous current, which is allowed by symmetry. We confirm these
findings by calculating explicitly the current in both setups together with the
self-consistent superconducting order parameter. The latter shows in the
ground-state a spatial modulation of the phase that leads to currents that
compensate the anomalous current, such that in both cases the ground state
corresponds to a total zero-current state. However, in the two wire setup this
zero-current state consists of two finite currents flowing in each of the wires
in opposite direction.

approving an arbitrary number of candidates. Previous work has proposed
proportionality axioms satisfied by Thiele's rule (now known as Proportional
Approval Voting, PAV) but not by Phragm\'en's rule. By proposing two new
proportionality axioms (laminar proportionality and priceability) satisfied by
Phragm\'en but not Thiele, we show that the two rules achieve two distinct
forms of proportional representation. Phragm\'en's rule ensures that all voters
have a similar amount of influence on the committee, and Thiele's rule ensures
a fair utility distribution.
  Thiele's rule is a welfarist voting rule (one that maximizes a function of
voter utilities). We show that no welfarist rule can satisfy our new axioms,
and we prove that no such rule can satisfy the core. Conversely, some welfarist
fairness properties cannot be guaranteed by Phragm\'en-type rules. This
formalizes the difference between the two types of proportionality. We then
introduce an attractive committee rule, the Method of Equal Shares, which
satisfies a property intermediate between the core and extended justified
representation (EJR). It satisfies laminar proportionality, priceability, and
is computable in polynomial time. We show that our new rule provides a
logarithmic approximation to the core. On the other hand, PAV provides a
factor-2 approximation to the core, and this factor is optimal for rules that

emergent gravity using a generalized Vaidya-type metric as a background. We
also analyze the cosmic censorship hypothesis for this system. We show that the
emergent gravity metric resembles closely to the new type of the generalized
Vaidya metrics for null fluid collapse with the {\bf k-}essence emergent mass
function, where we consider the {\bf k-}essence scalar field being a function
solely of the advanced or the retarded time. This new type of {\bf k-}essence
emergent Vaidya metric has satisfied the required energy conditions. The
existence of the locally naked central singularity, the strength and the
strongness of the singularities for the {\bf k-}essence emergent Vaidya metric
are the interesting outcomes of the present work.

concepts of minimizer and of infimizer, as two completely different notions. An
infimizer is proved to contain minimizers or at least minimizing sequences for
the linearly scalarized problems, with the scalarizing parameters being

convexity and coercivity hypotheses an existence result for an infimizer is
proved. In addition to the unconstrained problem, Euler-Lagrange equations are
provided for the case with isoperimetric constraints. Finally, the results are
applied to the optimization of the shape of energy-saving buildings.

physics of matter-radiation equality and early dark energy are completely
disconnected, so some degree of fine-tuning is needed in order for them to
occur nearly simultaneously. In this paper we propose a natural explanation for
this coincidence. If the early dark energy scalar couples to neutrinos then it
receives a large injection of energy around the time that neutrinos become
non-relativistic. This is precisely when their temperature is of order their
mass, which, coincidentally, occurs around the time of matter-radiation

proposal, potential observational signatures, and future directions for its

takes into account this angular scale dependence. Using this extended
formalism, we present forecasts for upcoming and future cosmological surveys
and we show at which extent the lensing ratio information can improve the CMB
constraints on cosmological parameters. We get that for extended cosmological
models where the neutrino mass, the spatial curvature and the dark energy
equation of state are allowed to vary, the constraints from $Planck$ on these

of noise, they reproduce images with fidelity. As an alternative, we propose a
novel family of GANs called noise robust GANs (NR-GANs), which can learn a
clean image generator even when training images are noisy. In particular,
NR-GANs can solve this problem without having complete noise information (e.g.,
the noise distribution type, noise amount, or signal-noise relationship). To
achieve this, we introduce a noise generator and train it along with a clean
image generator. However, without any constraints, there is no incentive to
generate an image and noise separately. Therefore, we propose distribution and
transformation constraints that encourage the noise generator to capture only
the noise-specific components. In particular, considering such constraints
under different assumptions, we devise two variants of NR-GANs for
signal-independent noise and three variants of NR-GANs for signal-dependent
noise. On three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NR-GANs

rays. The study of their overall spectrum indicates that most of the emission
of powerful blazars is in hard X-rays or in soft gamma-rays. In this band we
can find the most powerful jets, visible also at high redshifts. It is found
that the jet power is linked to the accretion luminosity, and exceeds it,
especially if they produce energetic neutrinos, that require the presence of
ultrarelativistic protons.

analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn
the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For
photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a
function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are
able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS
model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of
$10^3$-$10^4$ speed up over direct SPS computation. They have
readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based
inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to
call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS
computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the
computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies
from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS

the mass ratio is 1:3$-$3:1 and the distance is less than the sum of the virial
radii of target and neighbor. The neighbors are divided into the flyby or
merger samples if the pair's total energy is greater or smaller, respectively,
than the capture criterion with consideration of dynamical friction. The main
results are as follows: (a) The flyby fraction increases by up to a factor of
50 with decreasing halo mass and by up to a factor of 400 with increasing
large-scale density, while the merger fraction does not show any significant
dependencies on these two parameters; (b) The redshift evolution of the flyby
fraction is twofold, increasing with redshift at $0<z<1$ and remaining constant
at $z>1$, while the merger fraction increases monotonically with redshift at
$z=0\sim4$; (c) The multiple interactions with two or more neighbors are on
average flyby-dominated, and their fraction has a mass and environment
dependence similar to that for the flyby fraction; (d) Given that flybys
substantially outnumber mergers toward $z=0$ (by a factor of five) and the
multiple interactions are flyby-dominated, the flyby's contribution to galactic
evolution is stronger than ever at the present epoch, especially for less

Typically, the leftover electrons are in their ground state. In a radiative
Auger process, the leftover electrons are in an excited state and a redshifted
photon is created. In a semiconductor quantum dot, radiative Auger is predicted
for charged excitons. Here we report the observation of radiative Auger on
trions in single quantum dots. For a trion, a photon is created on
electron-hole recombination, leaving behind a single electron. The radiative
Auger process promotes this additional (Auger) electron to a higher shell of
the quantum dot. We show that the radiative Auger effect is a powerful probe of
this single electron: the energy separations between the resonance fluorescence
and the radiative Auger emission directly measure the single-particle
splittings of the electronic states in the quantum dot with high precision. In
semiconductors, these single-particle splittings are otherwise hard to access
by optical means as particles are excited typically in pairs, as excitons.
After the radiative Auger emission, the Auger carrier relaxes back to the
lowest shell. Going beyond the original theoretical proposals, we show how
applying quantum optics techniques to the radiative Auger photons gives access
to the single-electron dynamics, notably relaxation and tunneling. This is also
hard to access by optical means: even for quasi-resonant $p$-shell excitation,
electron relaxation takes place in the presence of a hole, complicating the
relaxation dynamics. The radiative Auger effect can be exploited in other
semiconductor nanostructures and quantum emitters in the solid state to
determine the energy levels and the dynamics of a single carrier.

in multi-messenger astronomy, in order to fully take advantage of the new

here we suggest a method to constrain the cosmological background, and the
Hubble constant in particular, by future observations of gravitationally lensed
radiation emitted by a single source in both the gravitational wave and the
electromagnetic regimes. The lensing of the gravitational wave radiation, in
fact, can leave a clear imprinting in the corresponding waveform, and we want
to analyze if such kind of measurements can be successfully employed to better
constrain the cosmological background. Thus, by making use of wave optics for
the gravitational wave lensed signal, and of standard geometrical optics
approximation for the electromagnetic one, we study the impact of different
cosmological parameters on the value of the arrival time delay due to
gravitational lensing, given specific gravitational wave frequencies, mass
models of the lens, and redshifts and positions (with respect to the lens) of
the source. Although the rate of lensing of gravitational waves is expected to
be low, we show that even one single lensing event, combined with a prior on
$\Omega_m$ from \textit{Planck}, could provide us with an uncertainty on $H_0$
comparable with present independent probes in a ""pessimistic"" scenario (with a
pulsar population similar to present Pulsar Timing Array state), and of two
orders smaller in an optimistic one (with a number of observed pulsars as large

other studies showing that the {free-rider effect} skews the effort invested by
individuals, making larger groups less productive. The difference between these
schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as
suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will
increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their
efficiency. We address this question by studying two planetary-scale
collaborative systems: GitHub and Wikipedia. By analyzing the activity of over
2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between
group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics:
the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but
saturates at larger sizes. This effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity
of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the
individual level. People tend to do more when collaborating with more people.
We propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the
non-linearity in collaboration effort. The proposed model is able to explain
and predict group work dynamics in GitHub and Wikipedia by capturing their
maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a
principled, data-driven science of collaboration.

$\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, for a structured ""error
polynomial"" $\epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. To complete the proof, we then
observe that the lower bound in [K19] is robust enough and continues to hold
for all polynomials $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where
$\epsilon(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ has the appropriate structure.
  We also use our ideas to show an $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound of the size of
algebraic formulas computing the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree
$0.1n$ on $n$ variables. This is a slight improvement upon the prior best known
formula lower bound (proved for a different polynomial) of $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$
[Nec66, K85, SY10]. Interestingly, this lower bound is asymptotically better
than $n^2/\log n$, the strongest lower bound that can be proved using previous
methods. This lower bound also matches the upper bound, due to Ben-Or, who
showed that elementary symmetric polynomials can be computed by algebraic
formula (in fact depth-$3$ formula) of size $O(n^2)$. Prior to this work,
Ben-Or's construction was known to be optimal only for algebraic formulas of
depth-$3$ [SW01].

Radiation damage usually leads to detrimental effects such as embrittlement,

last point merits special attention. Elucidating synergies between radiation
and corrosion has been one of the most challenging tasks impeding the
deployment of advanced reactors, stemming from the combined effects of high
temperature, corrosive coolants, and intense particle fluxes. Here we report
that proton irradiation significantly and repeatably decelerates intergranular
corrosion of Ni-Cr alloys in molten fluoride salt at 650C. We demonstrate this
effect by showing that the depth of intergranular voids resulting from Cr
leaching into the salt is reduced by the proton irradiation alone. Interstitial
defects generated from proton irradiation result in radiation-enhanced
diffusion, more rapidly replenishing corrosion-injected vacancies with alloy
constituents, thus playing the crucial role in decelerating corrosion. Our
results show that in industrially-relevant scenarios irradiation can have a
positive impact, challenging our view that radiation damage always results in
negative effects.

This is largely due to the challenges in analyzing biological data. Interesting
biological structures are not only small, but are often morphologically
irregular and highly dynamic. Although tracking cells in live organisms has
been studied for years, existing tracking methods for cells are not effective
in tracking subcellular structures, such as protein complexes, which feature in
continuous morphological changes including split and merge, in addition to fast

multi-object portion tracking to model the protein object tracking process. A
multi-object tracking method with portion matching is proposed based on 3D

directional correlations between a neutrino dataset and overdensities in the
galaxy distribution in the sky. The results of two correlation searches between
a seven-year time-integrated neutrino dataset from the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory, and the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) catalog are presented here.
The first analysis searches for neutrinos produced via interactions between
diffuse intergalactic Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and the matter
contained within galaxies. The second analysis searches for low-luminosity
sources within the local universe, which would produce subthreshold multiplets
in the IceCube dataset that directionally correlate with galaxy distribution.
No significant correlations were observed in either analyses. Constraints are
presented on the flux of neutrinos originating within the local universe
through diffuse intergalactic UHECR interactions, as well as on the density of
standard candle sources of neutrinos at low luminosities.

reveal the phase space mechanism by which a Caldera-type potential energy
surface (PES) exhibits the dynamical matching phenomenon. Using this technique,
we can easily establish that the non-existence of dynamical matching is a
consequence of heteroclinic connections between the unstable manifolds of the
unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the upper index-1 saddles (entrance channels
to the Caldera) and the stable manifolds of the family of UPOs of the central
minimum of the Caldera, resulting in the temporary trapping of trajectories.
Moreover, dynamical matching will occur when there is no heteroclinic
connection, which allows trajectories to enter and exit the Caldera without
interacting with the shallow region of the central minimum. Knowledge of this
phase space mechanism is relevant because it allows us to effectively predict
the existence, and non-existence, of dynamical matching. In this work we
explore a stretched Caldera potential by means of Lagrangian descriptors,
allowing us to accurately compute the critical value for the stretching
parameter for which dynamical matching behavior occurs in the system. This
approach is shown to provide a tremendous advantage for exploring this
mechanism in comparison to other methods from nonlinear dynamics that use phase
space dividing surfaces.

frequencies of the modes of acoustic oscillation. However, it is unclear how a
corotating patch of activity affects the oscillations, since such a
perturbation is unsteady in the frame of the observer. In this paper we
qualitatively describe the asteroseismic signature of a large active region in
the power spectrum of the dipole and quadrupole p modes. In the corotating
frame of the active region, the perturbations due to (differential) rotation
and the active region completely lift the $(2\ell + 1)$-fold azimuthal
degeneracy of the frequency spectrum of modes with harmonic degree $\ell$. In
the frame of the observer, the unsteady nature of the perturbation leads to the
appearance of $(2\ell+1)^2$ peaks in the power spectrum of a multiplet. These
peaks blend into each other to form asymmetric line profiles. In the limit of a
small active region, we approximate the power spectrum of a multiplet in terms
of $2\times(2\ell+1)$ peaks, whose amplitudes and frequencies depend on the
latitude of the active region and the inclination angle of the star's rotation
axis. In order to check the results and to explore the nonlinear regime, we

through quantum point contacts, which allows for a generic Abelian edge
structure and assumes strong equilibration between edge modes (incoherent
transport regime). We find that conductance plateaus are found whenever the
quantum point contact locally depletes the Hall bar to a stable region with a
filling factor lower than that of the bulk and the resulting edge states
equilibrate. The shot noise generated on these plateaus can be classified
according to 13 possible combinations of edge charge and heat transport in the
device. We also comment on a relation between the the emergence of quantized
plateaus and the suppression of Mach-Zehnder interference. Besides explaining

of identifying the bounding box of a particular class of object in an image.
Yet, in contexts such as robotics and augmented reality, it is often necessary
to find a specific object instance---a unique toy or a custom industrial part
for example---rather than a generic object class. Here, applications can
require a rapid shift from one object instance to another, thus requiring fast
turnaround which affords little-to-no training time. What is more, gathering a
dataset and training a model for every new object instance to be detected can
be an expensive and time-consuming process. In this context, we propose a
generic 2D object instance detection approach that uses example viewpoints of
the target object at test time to retrieve its 2D location in RGB images,
without requiring any additional training (i.e. fine-tuning) step. To this end,
we present an end-to-end architecture that extracts global and local
information of the object from its viewpoints. The global information is used
to tune early filters in the backbone while local viewpoints are correlated
with the input image. Our method offers an improvement of almost 30 mAP over
the previous template matching methods on the challenging Occluded Linemod

cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal at small scales, and their detection
is important for the next generation of CMB experiments. We develop a method
(PoSeIDoN) based on fully convolutional networks to detect PS in realistic
simulations, and we compare its performance against one of the most used PS
detection method, the Mexican hat wavelet 2 (MHW2). We produce realistic
simulations of PS taking into account contaminating signals as the CMB, the
cosmic infrared background, the Galactic thermal emission, the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and the instrumental and PS shot noises. We first
produce a set of training simulations at 217 GHz to train the network. Then we
apply both PoSeIDoN and the MHW2 to recover the PS in the validating
simulations at all 143, 217, and 353 GHz, comparing the results by estimating
the reliability, completeness, and flux density accuracy and by computing the
receiver operating characteristic curves. In the extra-galactic region with a
30{\deg} galactic cut, the network successfully recovers PS at 90% completeness
corresponding to 253, 126, and 250 mJy for 143, 217, and 353 GHz respectively.
The MHW2 with a 3$\sigma$ flux density detection limit recovers PS up to 181,
102, and 153 mJy at 90% completeness. In all cases PoSeIDoN produces a much
lower number of spurious sources with respect to MHW2. The results on spurious
sources for both techniques worsen when reducing the galactic cut to 10{\deg}.
Our results suggest that using neural networks is a very promising approach for
detecting PS, providing overall better results in dealing with spurious sources
with respect to usual filtering approaches. Moreover, PoSeIDoN gives

equiprobable states of Nature. If each juror independently receives a binary
signal identifying the correct state with identical probability $p$, then the
probability of a correct verdict tends to one as the jury size tends to
infinity (Condorcet, 1785). Recently, the first two authors developed a model
where jurors sequentially receive signals from an interval according to a
distribution, which depends on the state of Nature and on the juror's

binary signal, such a distribution must satisfy a functional equation related
to tail-balance, that is, to the ratio $\alpha(t)$ of the probability that a
mean-zero random variable satisfies $X >t$ given that $|X|>t$. In particular,
we show that under natural symmetry assumptions the tail-balances $\alpha(t)$

Solovay and Vop\v{e}nka in 1965, offering a natural and rich alternative for
describing forcing. The original method was adapted by Takeuti, Titani, Kozawa
and Ozawa to lattice-valued models of set theory. After this, L\""{o}we and
Tarafder proposed a class of algebras based on a certain kind of implication
which satisfy several axioms of ZF. From this class, they found a specific
3-valued model called PS3 which satisfies all the axioms of ZF, and can be
expanded with a paraconsistent negation *, thus obtaining a paraconsistent
model of ZF. The logic (PS3 ,*) coincides (up to language) with da Costa and
D'Ottaviano logic J3, a 3-valued paraconsistent logic that have been proposed
independently in the literature by several authors and with different
motivations such as CluNs, LFI1 and MPT. We propose in this paper a family of
algebraic models of ZFC based on LPT0, another linguistic variant of J3
introduced by us in 2016. The semantics of LPT0, as well as of its first-order
version QLPT0, is given by twist structures defined over Boolean agebras. From
this, it is possible to adapt the standard Boolean-valued models of (classical)
ZFC to twist-valued models of an expansion of ZFC by adding a paraconsistent
negation. We argue that the implication operator of LPT0 is more suitable for a
paraconsistent set theory than the implication of PS3, since it allows for
genuinely inconsistent sets w such that [(w = w)] = 1/2 . This implication is
not a 'reasonable implication' as defined by L\""{o}we and Tarafder. This
suggests that 'reasonable implication algebras' are just one way to define a
paraconsistent set theory. Our twist-valued models are adapted to provide a
class of twist-valued models for (PS3,*), thus generalizing L\""{o}we and
Tarafder result. It is shown that they are in fact models of ZFC (not only of

on a product space that marginalizes to any measures on pairs of its factors.
The homotopy and homology for this category allow measurement of obstructions
to finding measures on larger and larger product spaces. The obstruction theory
is compatible with a fibrant filtration built from the Wasserstein distance on
measures.
  Despite the abstract tools, this is motivated by a widespread problem in data
science. Data complexes provide a mathematical foundation for semi-automated
data-alignment tools that are common in commercial database software.
Practically speaking, the theory shows that database JOIN operations are
subject to genuine topological obstructions. Those obstructions can be detected
by an obstruction cocycle and can be resolved by moving through a filtration.
Thus, any collection of databases has a persistence level, which measures the
difficulty of JOINing those databases. Because of its general formulation, this
persistent obstruction theory also encompasses multi-modal data fusion
problems, some forms of Bayesian inference, and probability couplings.

consistent with a null detection, and thus it enables us to put the tightest
constraint on the acceleration efficiency of cosmic ray protons at shocks in

5\% with a $2\sigma$ confidence level when the hydrostatic mass bias of
clusters is assumed to be 30\%, and our result is not significantly affected by
the assumed value of the hydrostatic mass bias. Our constraint implies that the
non-thermal cosmic-ray pressure in the ICM can introduce only a $\le 3\%$ level
of the hydrostatic mass bias, highlighting that cosmic rays alone do not
account for the mass bias inferred by the Planck analyses. Finally, we discuss
future detectability prospects of cosmic-ray-induced gamma rays from the

particle physics by an extra $U(1)$ gauge group under which all the SM
particles are neutral. We then consider DM candidates interacting only with the
new spin-1 gauge boson, a heavy $Z^\prime$. We assume the presence of heavy
beyond the SM fermions charged under both extra $U(1)$ and SM $SU(3)_c$,
allowing for a feeble connection between DM and gluons. In the second scenario
\cite{bernal_spin-2_2018}, we assume that the interactions between DM and SM
particles are only mediated by gravitons and massive spin-2 fields, being
therefore suppressed by the Planck and some intermediate scales, respectively.
In both models, we show that the SM particles are able to produce the right
amount of DM candidates via freeze-in at most in the early stages of the
radiation era, for DM mass in the range $10^{-3}-10^{14}$ GeV. We have shown
that if heavy mediators were produced on-shell within a period of entropy
production in the early universe, as in the post-inflationary reheating, the DM
relic density may be enhanced by many orders of magnitude relative to the usual
instantaneous reheating approximation.

methodology are evaluated on a realistic virtual human liver with blood vessels
to demonstrate a clinically relevant scenario of thermal ablation of hepatic
cancer. Compared against the established non-linear procedures from commercial
finite element analysis package, ABAQUS/CAE, the proposed methodology can
achieve a typical 1.0e-3 level of normalized relative error at nodes and
between 1.0e-4 and 1.0e-5 level of total errors, which is in good agreement
with ABAQUS solutions. The proposed method consumes slightly more time than the
formulation without soft tissue deformation, and computation performance of
five different formulations are examined. The proposed method can be applied
with bio-mechanical deformable models for fast or near real-time computation of
non-linear bio-heat transfer, leading to translational potential in dynamic
tissue temperature predictive analysis and thermal dosimetry computation for
computer-integrated medical education and personalized treatments.

kill cancer cells. Immunotherapy is more effective and, in general, the
prognosis is better, when more immune cells infiltrate the tumor. We explore
the question of whether the spatial distribution rather than just the density
of immune cells in the tumor is important in forecasting whether cancer recurs.
After reviewing previous work on this issue, we introduce a novel application
of maximum entropy to quantify the spatial distribution of discrete point-like
objects. We apply our approach to B and T cells in images of tumor tissue taken
from triple negative breast cancer (TBNC) patients. We find that there is a
distinct difference in the spatial distribution of immune cells between good
clinical outcome (no recurrence of cancer within at least 5 years of diagnosis)
and poor clinical outcome (recurrence within 3 years of diagnosis). Our results
highlight the importance of spatial distribution of immune cells within tumors
with regard to clinical outcome, and raise new questions on their role in
cancer recurrence.

provide empirical speedups exceeding 25x over prior sampling methods on

can exhibit ferromagnetism due to their orbital hybridization. Charge/spin
transfer may occur from FM to OSC layer leading to the formation of
`spinterface' i.e. the interface exhibiting a finite magnetic moment. In this
work, the magnetic properties of Co/C$_{60}$ bilayer thin film have been
studied to probe the interface between Co and C$_{60}$ layer. Polarized neutron
reflectivity [PNR] measurement indicates that the thickness and moment of the
spinterface are $\sim$ 2 $\pm$ 0.18 nm and 0.8 $\pm$ 0.2 $\mu_B$/cage,
respectively. The comparison of the magnetization reversal between the
Co/C$_{60}$ bilayer and the parent single layer Co thin film reveals that
spinterface modifies the domain microstructure. Further, the anisotropy of the
bilayer system shows a significant enhancement ($\sim$ two times) in comparison
to its single layer counterpart which is probably due to an additional
interfacial anisotropy arising from the orbital hybridization at the
Co/C$_{60}$ interface.

a difficult and time-consuming process that hampers users' productivity.
  In this paper, we describe Dataset-On-Demand (DoD), a system that lets users
specify the schema of the view they want, and have the system find views for
them. With many underlying data sources, the number of resulting views for any
given query is high, and the burden of choosing the right one is onerous to
users. DoD uses a new method, 4C, to reduce the size of the view choice space
for users. 4C classifies views into 4 classes: compatible views are exactly the
same, contained views present a subsumption relationship, complementary views
are unionable, and contradictory views have incompatible values that indicate
fundamental differences between views. These 4 classes permit different
presentation strategies to reduce the total number of views a user must
consider.
  We evaluate DoD on two key metrics of interest: its ability to reduce the
size of the choice space, and the end to end performance. DoD finds all views
within minutes, and reduces the number of views presented to users by 2-10x.

parameters that drive both the absolute star formation rate surface density

molecular gas surface density (Sigma_H2) with a secondary dependence on stellar
mass surface density (Sigma_*), as expected from an `extended Kennicutt-Schmidt

role. Taken together, our results demonstrate that whilst the absolute rate of
star formation is primarily set by the amount of molecular gas, the variation

Intra-cochlear heat transfer analysis is required to ensure that the magnet
removal phase is thermally safe. The objective of this work is to determine the
safe range of input power density to detach the magnet without causing thermal
trauma in the ear, and to analyze the effectiveness of natural convection with
respect to conduction for removing the excess heat. A finite element model of
an uncoiled cochlea, which is verified and validated, is applied to determine
the range of maximum safe input power density to detach a 1-mm-long,
0.5-mm-diameter cylindrical magnet from the cochlear implant electrode array
tip. It is shown that heat dissipation in the cochlea is primarily mediated by
conduction through the electrode array. The electrode array simultaneously
reduces natural convection due to the no-slip boundary condition on its surface
and increases axial conduction in the cochlea. It is concluded that natural
convection heat transfer in a cochlea during robotic cochlear implant surgery
can be neglected. It is found that thermal trauma is avoided by applying a
power density from $2.265 \times 10^7$ W/m$^3$ for 114 s to $6.6\times10^7$

decreases below spin-orbit characteristic time as a result of enhanced
electron-electron interactions at lower carrier concentrations. The same
crossover is observed with increasing temperature. The linear temperature
behavior of inelastic scattering rate indicates that the dominant phase

propose an extended use of Backus average for finitely deformed materials of a

  IJCNN2019. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1903.12296",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art methods in image-to-image translation are capable of
learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image
data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still
produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not
high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do
not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the
source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In
this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks
(AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN
can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change
of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to
produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention
masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel
attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate
sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models.

  Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction","Accepted to appear at AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distantly supervised relation extraction intrinsically suffers from noisy
labels due to the strong assumption of distant supervision. Most prior works
adopt a selective attention mechanism over sentences in a bag to denoise from
wrongly labeled data, which however could be incompetent when there is only one
sentence in a bag. In this paper, we propose a brand-new light-weight neural
framework to address the distantly supervised relation extraction problem and
alleviate the defects in previous selective attention framework. Specifically,
in the proposed framework, 1) we use an entity-aware word embedding method to
integrate both relative position information and head/tail entity embeddings,
aiming to highlight the essence of entities for this task; 2) we develop a
self-attention mechanism to capture the rich contextual dependencies as a
complement for local dependencies captured by piecewise CNN; and 3) instead of
using selective attention, we design a pooling-equipped gate, which is based on
rich contextual representations, as an aggregator to generate bag-level
representation for final relation classification. Compared to selective
attention, one major advantage of the proposed gating mechanism is that, it
performs stably and promisingly even if only one sentence appears in a bag and
thus keeps the consistency across all training examples. The experiments on NYT
dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance in terms of both AUC and top-n precision metrics.

remains an important computational milestone in molecular biology to be
achieved. This feat is hinged on a clear understanding of the mechanism which
proteins use to fold into their native structures. Since Levinthal's paradox,
there has been a lot of progress in understanding this mechanism. Most of the
earlier attempts were caught between assigning either hydrophobic interactions
or hydrogen bonding as the dominant folding force. However, a consensus now
seems to be emerging about hydrogen bonding being a stronger force.
Interestingly, a view from chaperone action may further throw some light on the
nature of the folding mechanism. Thus the very mechanisms which prevent protein
aggregation and misfolding, could help us have a better understanding of the

methods circumvent this requirement by modelling the distribution of clean
image features, thereby making them more suitable for practical use. However,
majority of such methods either use hand-crafted features or require training
on human opinion scores (supervised learning), which are difficult to obtain
and standardise. We explore the possibility of using deep features instead,
particularly, the encoded (bottleneck) feature maps of a Convolutional
Autoencoder neural network architecture. Also, we do not train the network on
subjective scores (unsupervised learning). The primary requirements for an IQA
method are monotonic increase in predicted scores with increasing degree of
input image distortion, and consistent ranking of images with the same
distortion type and content, but different distortion levels. Quantitative
experiments using the Pearson, Kendall and Spearman correlation scores on a
diverse set of images show that our proposed method meets the above
requirements better than the state-of-art method (which uses hand-crafted
features) for three types of distortions: blurring, noise and compression
artefacts. This demonstrates the potential for future research in this
relatively unexplored sub-area within IQA.

effective clustering algorithms. However, most previous studies focus on
spectral clustering tasks with a fixed task set, which cannot incorporate with
a new spectral clustering task without accessing to previously learned tasks.
In this paper, we aim to explore the problem of spectral clustering in a
lifelong machine learning framework, i.e., Lifelong Spectral Clustering (L2SC).
Its goal is to efficiently learn a model for a new spectral clustering task by
selectively transferring previously accumulated experience from knowledge
library. Specifically, the knowledge library of L2SC contains two components:
1) orthogonal basis library: capturing latent cluster centers among the
clusters in each pair of tasks; 2) feature embedding library: embedding the
feature manifold information shared among multiple related tasks. As a new
spectral clustering task arrives, L2SC firstly transfers knowledge from both
basis library and feature library to obtain encoding matrix, and further
redefines the library base over time to maximize performance across all the
clustering tasks. Meanwhile, a general online update formulation is derived to
alternatively update the basis library and feature library. Finally, the
empirical experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our L2SC model can effectively improve the clustering performance when
comparing with other state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithms.

We show the latter process to be important using mutually consistent orbit

solution that brings these galaxies to within ~50 kpc of each other in the
past, ~6.5 Gyr ago. We explore the implications of their interaction using an
N-body/hydrodynamical simulation with a focus on the origin of two prominent
features: 1) M31's Giant Stellar Stream; and 2) the M31-M33 HI filament. We
find that the tidal interaction does not produce a structure reminiscent of the
stellar stream that survives up to the present day. In contrast, the M31-M33 HI
filament is likely a fossil structure dating back to the time of the ancient
encounter between these galaxies. Similarly, the observed outer disc warp in
M33 may well be a relic of this past event. Our model suggests the presence of
a tidally induced gas envelope around these galaxies, and the existence of a
diffuse gas stream, the 'Triangulum stream', stretching for tens of kpc from
M33 away from M31. We anticipate upcoming observations with the recently

will target the putative stream in its first years of operation.

Spatial and length
constraints have led to a number of novel packing strategies at both the
micro-scale, as when DNA packages inside a capsid, and the macro-scale, seen in
plant root development and the arrangement of the human intestinal tract. By
varying the arc length of an elastic loop injected into an array of
monodisperse, soft, spherical grains at varying initial number density, we
investigate the resulting packing behaviors between a growing slender structure
constrained by deformable boundaries. At low initial packing fractions, the
elastic loop deforms as though it were hitting a flat surface by periodically
folding into the array. Above a critical packing fraction $\phi_c$, local
re-orientations within the granular medium create an effectively curved surface
leading to the emergence of a distinct circular packing morphology in the
adjacent elastic structure. These results will bring new insight into the
packing behavior of wires and thin sheets and will be relevant to modeling
plant root morphogenesis, burrowing and locomotive strategies of vertebrates &
invertebrates, and developing smart, steerable needles.

into the Exascale regime, and is evidently more efficient than replication as
state size grows. However current systems use a nominal value for the
checkpoint interval, indicative of assuming roughly 1 failure every 19 days,
that does not take into account the salient aspects of the checkpoint process,
nor the system scale, which can readily lead to inefficient system operation.
To address this shortcoming, we provide a rigorous derivation of utilization --
the fraction of total time available for the system to do useful work -- that
incorporates checkpoint interval, failure rate, checkpoint cost, failure
detection and restart cost, depth of the system topology and message delay. Our
model yields an elegant expression for utilization and provides an optimal
checkpoint interval given these parameters, interestingly showing it to be
dependent only on checkpoint cost and failure rate. We confirm the accuracy and
efficacy of our model through experiments with Apache Flink, where we obtain
improvements in system utilization for every case, especially as the system

Due to the subwavelength thickness of the ITO ENZ material, and the fact that

developing various machine learning algorithms to detect fake news. However,
users' perception of machine learning outcomes and related behaviors have been

to pass the detection results of machine learning to the users, and aid their
decisions in handling misinformation. An online experiment was conducted, to
evaluate the effect of the proposed machine learning warning sign against a
control condition. We examined participants' detection and sharing of news. The
data showed that warning sign's effects on participants' trust toward the fake
news were not significant. However, we found that people's uncertainty about
the authenticity of the news dropped with the presence of the machine learning
warning sign. We also found that social media experience had effects on users'
trust toward the fake news, and age and social media experience had effects on
users' sharing decision. Therefore, the results indicate that there are many
factors worth studying that affect people's trust in the news. Moreover, the
warning sign in communicating machine learning detection results is different
from ordinary warnings and needs more detailed research and design. These
findings hold important implications for the design of machine learning

for implementation. LqRT preserves high power when the distributional
assumption is violated, and maintains the satisfactory performance when the

robust tests in power, such as Wilcoxon test and sign test, while maintaining a
valid size. To the extent that the robustness of the Wilcoxon test (minimum
asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the Wilcoxon test vs the t-test is
0.864) suggests that the Wilcoxon test should be the default test of choice

transfer in confined impinging jets, and how it is driven by both the Mach
number and the wall heat-flux. Hence, we present a collection of cases at
several Mach numbers with different heat-flux values applied at the impingement
wall. The wall temperature scales linearly with the imposed heat-flux and the
adiabatic wall temperature is found to be purely governed by the flow
compression. Especially for high heat-flux values, the non-constant wall
temperature induces considerable differences in the thermal conductivity of the
fluid. This phenomenon has to date not been discussed and it strongly modulates
the Nusselt number. In contrast, the heat transfer coefficient is independent
of the varying thermal properties of the fluid and the wall heat-flux.
Furthermore, we introduce the impingement efficiency, which highlights the
areas of the wall where the temperature is influenced by compressibility
effects. This parameter shows how the contribution of the flow compression to
raising the wall temperature becomes more dominant as the heat-flux decreases.
Thus, knowing the adiabatic wall temperature is indispensable for obtaining the
correct heat transfer coefficient when low heat-flux values are used, even at
low Mach numbers. Lastly, a detailed analysis of the dilatation field also
shows how the compressibility effects only affect the heat transfer in the
vicinity of the stagnation point. These compressibility effects decay rapidly
further away from the flow impingement, and the density changes along the
developing boundary layer are caused instead by variable inertia effects.

framework for zero-sum games. However, using the current deep neural network
models, the implementation of fictitious play faces crucial challenges. Neural
network model training employs gradient descent approaches to update all
connection weights, and thus is easy to forget the old opponents after training
to beat the new opponents. Existing approaches often maintain a pool of
historical policy models to avoid the forgetting. However, learning to beat a
pool in stochastic games, i.e., a wide distribution over policy models, is
either sample-consuming or insufficient to exploit all models with limited
amount of samples. In this paper, we propose a learning process with neural
fictitious play to alleviate the above issues. We train a single model as our
policy model, which consists of sub-models and a selector. Everytime facing a
new opponent, the model is expanded by adding a new sub-model, where only the
new sub-model is updated instead of the whole model. At the same time, the
selector is also updated to mix up the new sub-model with the previous ones at
the state-level, so that the model is maintained as a behavior strategy instead
of a wide distribution over policy models. Experiments on Kuhn poker, a
grid-world Treasure Hunting game, and Mini-RTS environments show that the
proposed approach alleviates the forgetting problem, and consequently improves
the learning efficiency and the robustness of neural fictitious play.

comprehension. There have been works showing that syntactic, semantic and word
sense knowledge are contained in such representations, which explains why they
benefit such tasks. However, relatively little work has been done investigating
commonsense knowledge contained in contextualized representations, which is
crucial for human question answering and reading comprehension. We study the
commonsense ability of GPT, BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by testing them on seven
challenging benchmarks, finding that language modeling and its variants are
effective objectives for promoting models' commonsense ability while
bi-directional context and larger training set are bonuses. We additionally
find that current models do poorly on tasks require more necessary inference
steps. Finally, we test the robustness of models by making dual test cases,
which are correlated so that the correct prediction of one sample should lead
to correct prediction of the other. Interestingly, the models show confusion on
these test cases, which suggests that they learn commonsense at the surface
rather than the deep level. We release a test set, named CATs publicly, for
future research.

edge devices, for latency, privacy, or energy reasons. While datacenter
networks can be protected using conventional cybersecurity measures, edge
neural networks bring a host of new security challenges. Unlike classic IoT
applications, edge neural networks are typically very compute and memory
intensive, their execution is data-independent, and they are robust to noise
and faults. Neural network models may be very expensive to develop, and can
potentially reveal information about the private data they were trained on,
requiring special care in distribution. The hidden states and outputs of the
network can also be used in reconstructing user inputs, potentially violating
users' privacy. Furthermore, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, which may cause misclassifications and violate the integrity of the
output. These properties add challenges when securing edge-deployed DNNs,
requiring new considerations, threat models, priorities, and approaches in
securely and privately deploying DNNs to the edge. In this work, we cover the
landscape of attacks on, and defenses, of neural networks deployed in edge
devices and provide a taxonomy of attacks and defenses targeting edge DNNs.

starts the translation process before the end of an input. This task faces a
trade-off between translation accuracy and latency. We have to determine when
we start the translation for observed inputs so far, to achieve good practical
performance. In this work, we propose a neural machine translation method to
determine this timing in an adaptive manner. The proposed method introduces a
special token '<wait>', which is generated when the translation model chooses
to read the next input token instead of generating an output token. It also
introduces an objective function to handle the ambiguity in wait timings that
can be optimized using an algorithm called Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC). The use of CTC enables the optimization to consider all
possible output sequences including '<wait>' that are equivalent to the
reference translations and to choose the best one adaptively. We apply the
proposed method into simultaneous translation from English to Japanese and

active and open research problems particularly when no assumptions are made on

find global maximisation of acquisition function, which itself is a non-convex
optimization problem in the original search space. With growing dimensions, the
computational budget for this maximisation gets increasingly short leading to
inaccurate solution of the maximisation. This inaccuracy adversely affects both
the convergence and the efficiency of BO. We propose a novel approach where the
acquisition function only requires maximisation on a discrete set of low
dimensional subspaces embedded in the original high-dimensional search space.
Our method is free of any low dimensional structure assumption on the function
unlike many recent high-dimensional BO methods. Optimising acquisition function
in low dimensional subspaces allows our method to obtain accurate solutions

trade the convergence rate with the number of subspaces used in the

  Assessment via Deep Bidirectional Transformer Language Models for Stance
  Detection","Accepted to the AI for Social Good Workshop at NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The exponential rise of social media and digital news in the past decade has
had the unfortunate consequence of escalating what the United Nations has
called a global topic of concern: the growing prevalence of disinformation.
Given the complexity and time-consuming nature of combating disinformation
through human assessment, one is motivated to explore harnessing AI solutions
to automatically assess news articles for the presence of disinformation. A
valuable first step towards automatic identification of disinformation is
stance detection, where given a claim and a news article, the aim is to predict
if the article agrees, disagrees, takes no position, or is unrelated to the
claim. Existing approaches in literature have largely relied on hand-engineered
features or shallow learned representations (e.g., word embeddings) to encode
the claim-article pairs, which can limit the level of representational
expressiveness needed to tackle the high complexity of disinformation
identification. In this work, we explore the notion of harnessing large-scale
deep bidirectional transformer language models for encoding claim-article pairs
in an effort to construct state-of-the-art stance detection geared for
identifying disinformation. Taking advantage of bidirectional cross-attention
between claim-article pairs via pair encoding with self-attention, we construct
a large-scale language model for stance detection by performing transfer
learning on a RoBERTa deep bidirectional transformer language model, and were
able to achieve state-of-the-art performance (weighted accuracy of 90.01%) on
the Fake News Challenge Stage 1 (FNC-I) benchmark. These promising results
serve as motivation for harnessing such large-scale language models as powerful
building blocks for creating effective AI solutions to combat disinformation.

light curve of this short-duration event appears to be a single-lens event
affected by severe finite-source effects. Analysis of the light curve based on
single-lens single-source (1L1S) modeling yields very small values of the event
timescale, $t_{\rm E}\sim 3.5$ days, and the angular Einstein radius,
$\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.009$ mas, making the lens a candidate of a free-floating
planet. Close inspection reveals that the 1L1S solution leaves small residuals
with amplitude $\Delta I\lesssim 0.03$ mag. We find that the residuals are
explained by the existence of an additional widely-separated heavier lens
component, indicating that the lens is a wide-separation planetary system
rather than a free-floating planet. From Bayesian analysis, it is estimated
that the planet has a mass of $M_{\rm p} = 0.79^{+1.30}_{-0.39} M_{\rm J}$ and
it is orbiting a low-mass host star with a mass of $M_{\rm
host}=0.10^{+0.17}_{-0.05} M_\odot$ located with a projected separation of
$a_\perp=3.4^{+2.1}_{-1.0}$ au. The planetary system is located in the Galactic
bulge with a line-of-sight separation from the source star of $D_{\rm

deviations in the signatures of host stars for apparently isolated planetary
lensing events and that it is possible to identify a host even when a deviation
is subtle.

matter haloes is a central aim of galaxy evolution theory. This paper
introduces a dimensionless parameter $s\in[0,1]$, the ""tree entropy"", to
parametrise the geometry of a halo's entire mass assembly hierarchy, building
on a generalisation of Shannon's information entropy. By construction, the
minimum entropy ($s=0$) corresponds to smoothly assembled haloes without any
mergers. In contrast, the highest entropy ($s=1$) represents haloes grown
purely by equal-mass binary mergers. Using simulated merger trees extracted
from the cosmological $N$-body simulation SURFS, we compute the natural
distribution of $s$, a skewed bell curve peaking near $s=0.4$. This
distribution exhibits weak dependences on halo mass $M$ and redshift $z$, which
can be reduced to a single dependence on the relative peak height $\delta_{\rm
c}/\sigma(M,z)$ in the matter perturbation field. By exploring the correlations
between $s$ and global galaxy properties generated by the SHARK semi-analytic
model, we find that $s$ contains a significant amount of information on the
morphology of galaxies $-$ in fact more information than the spin,
concentration and assembly time of the halo. Therefore, the tree entropy
provides an information-rich link between galaxies and their dark matter
haloes.

Knowledge transfer by leveraging the publicly available trimmed videos as

bidirectional point process modeling, given only video-level annotations. By
decomposing the original features into domain-adaptable and domain-specific
ones based on their adaptability, trimmed-untrimmed knowledge transfer can be
safely confined within a more coherent subspace. An encoder-decoder based
structure is carefully designed and jointly optimized to facilitate effective
action classification and temporal localization. Extensive experiments are
conducted on two benchmark datasets (i.e., THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3), and

variance-reduction statistical method for Uncertainty quantification in PDE

hierarchy of meshes in a similar way as multigrid. The generation of
body-fitted mesh hierarchies is only possible for simple geometries. On top of
that, MLMC for random domains involves the generation of a mesh for every
sample. Instead, here we consider the use of embedded methods which make use of
simple background meshes of an artificial domain (a bounding-box) for which it
is easy to define a mesh hierarchy, thus eliminating the need of body-fitted
unstructured meshes, but can produce ill-conditioned discrete problems. To
avoid this complication, we consider the recent aggregated finite element
method (AgFEM). In particular, we design an embedded MLMC framework for
(geometrically and topologically) random domains implicitly defined through a
random level-set function, which makes use of a set of hierarchical background
meshes and the AgFEM. Performance predictions from existing theory are verified
statistically in three numerical experiments, namely the solution of the
Poisson equation on a circular domain of random radius, the solution of the
Poisson equation on a topologically identical but more complex domain, and the
solution of a heat-transfer problem in a domain that has geometric and

how `connected' they are. It is estimated based on co-occurrence, closeness,
facial expressions, and the orientation of the head when they are looking to
each other. In our proposed graph, the nodes represent the subjects of the
collection, and the edges correspond to their connectivities. The location of
the nodes is estimated according to their connectivity (the closer the nodes,
the more connected are the subjects). Finally, we developed a graphical user
interface in which we can click onto the nodes (or the edges) to display the
corresponding images of the collection in which the subject of the nodes (or
the connected subjects) are present. We present relevant results by analyzing a
wedding celebration, a sitcom video, a volleyball game and images extracted
from Twitter given a hashtag. We believe that this tool can be very helpful to
detect the existing social relations in an image collection.

over-parameterization in the unsupervised setting has gained far less
attention. In this paper, we study the gradient dynamics of two-layer
over-parameterized autoencoders with ReLU activation. We make very few
assumptions about the given training dataset (other than mild non-degeneracy
conditions). Starting from a randomly initialized autoencoder network, we
rigorously prove the linear convergence of gradient descent in two learning
regimes, namely: (i) the weakly-trained regime where only the encoder is

decoder are trained. Our results indicate the considerable benefits of joint
training over weak training for finding global optima, achieving a dramatic
decrease in the required level of over-parameterization. We also analyze the
case of weight-tied autoencoders (which is a commonly used architectural choice
in practical settings) and prove that in the over-parameterized setting,
training such networks from randomly initialized points leads to certain
unexpected degeneracies.

introduce a novel self-attention graph network that improves the generative
capabilities of SAG-VAE by parameterizing the generative distribution allowing
SAG-VAE to generate new data via graph convolution, while still trainable via
backpropagation. A learnable relational graph representation enhances SAG-VAE's
robustness to perturbation and noise, while also providing deeper intuition
into model performance. Experiments based on graphs show that SAG-VAE is
capable of approximately retrieving edges and links between nodes based

that SAG-VAE is fairly robust against perturbations in image reconstruction and

been found to be effective in both supervised and reinforcement learning. Our
current work aims to further prevent forgetting by encouraging the generator to
accurately generate features important for task retention. More specifically,
the generator is improved by introducing a second discriminator into the
Generative Adversarial Network which learns to classify between real and fake

through a continual learning agent. Using Atari 2600 games, we experimentally
find that improving the generator can considerably reduce catastrophic

evaporate. If so a slight perturbation would likely render the singularity
naked. Fortunately, at least for the case of asymptotically flat 4-dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, Hiscock and Weems showed that it can never
reach extremality despite the fact that for a sufficiently massive black hole,
its charge-to-mass ratio can increase during Hawking evaporation. Hence cosmic
censorship is never violated by Hawking emission. However, we know that under
some processes, it is easier to violate cosmic censorship in higher dimensions,
therefore it is crucial to generalize Hiscock and Weems model to dimensions
above four to check cosmic censorship. We found that Hawking evaporation cannot
lead to violation of cosmic censorship even in higher dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetimes. Morerover, it seems to be more difficult to
reach extremality as number of dimension increases.

three stages of multi-view face model fitting, facial reflectance inference and

conjunction with the Blinn-Phong reflection model. It has the advantage of
requiring only a simple setup with two video streams, and is able to exploit
the interaction between the diffuse and specular reflections across multiple

recover high-fidelity facial reflectance and geometry, which facilitates
various applications such as generating photorealistic facial images under new

reconstruction from multiple RGB images. Multi-view stereo (MVS) aims to
reconstruct fine-grained scene geometry from multi-view images. Previous
learning-based MVS methods estimate per-view depth using plane sweep volumes
with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane; this generally requires densely
sampled planes for desired accuracy, and it is very hard to achieve
high-resolution depth. In contrast, we propose adaptive thin volumes (ATVs); in
an ATV, the depth hypothesis of each plane is spatially varying, which adapts
to the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions. Our UCS-Net has
three stages: the first stage processes a small standard plane sweep volume to
predict low-resolution depth; two ATVs are then used in the following stages to
refine the depth with higher resolution and higher accuracy. Our ATV consists
of only a small number of planes; yet, it efficiently partitions local depth
ranges within learned small intervals. In particular, we propose to use
variance-based uncertainty estimates to adaptively construct ATVs; this
differentiable process introduces reasonable and fine-grained spatial
partitioning. Our multi-stage framework progressively subdivides the vast scene
space with increasing depth resolution and precision, which enables scene
reconstruction with high completeness and accuracy in a coarse-to-fine fashion.
We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with
state-of-the-art benchmarks on various challenging datasets.

set
  $ V(G)\times V(H)$ defined by putting $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ adjacent if and

  $xx'\in E(G)$ and $yy'\in V(H)$. This conjecture received a lot of attention
in the past half century.
  It was disproved recently by Shitov.
  The Poljak-R\""{o}dl function is defined as $f(n) = \min\{\chi(G \times H):
\chi(G)=\chi(H)=n\}$.
  Hedetniemi's conjecture is equivalent to saying $f(n)=n$ for all integer $n$.
Shitov's result shows that
  $f(n)<n$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. Using Shitov's result, Tardif and
Zhu showed that $f(n) \le n - (\log n)^{1/4}$ for sufficiently large $n$. Using
Shitov's method, He--Wigderson showed that for $\epsilon \approx 10^{-9}$ and
$n$ sufficiently large, $f(n) \le (1-\epsilon)n$. In this note we prove that a
slight modification of the proof in the paper of Zhu and Tardif shows that
$f(n) \le (\frac 12 + o(1))n$ for sufficiently large $n$. On the other hand, it
is unknown whether $f(n)$ is bounded by a constant. However, we do know that if
$f(n)$ is bounded by a constant, then the smallest such constant is at most
$9$. This lecture note gives self-contained proofs of the above mentioned
results.

Specifically, given that visual words determine the semantic correctness of
captions, we design a mechanism of generating visual words to not only promote
the training of scene-related words but also capture relevant details from
videos to construct a coarse-grained sentence ""template"". Thereafter, we devise
dedicated decoding algorithms that fill in the ""template"" with suitable words
and modify inappropriate phrasing via iterative refinement to obtain a
fine-grained description. Extensive experiments on two mainstream video

to incentivize them to watch mobile ads, which enables the operators to collect
payments from advertisers and create new revenue streams. In this work, we
analyze and compare two data rewarding schemes: a Subscription-Aware Rewarding
(SAR) scheme and a Subscription-Unaware Rewarding (SUR) scheme. Under the SAR
scheme, only the subscribers of the operators' data plans are eligible for the
rewards; under the SUR scheme, all users are eligible for the rewards (e.g.,
the users who do not subscribe to the data plans can still get SIM cards and
receive data rewards by watching ads). We model the interactions among an
operator, users, and advertisers by a two-stage Stackelberg game, and
characterize their equilibrium strategies under both the SAR and SUR schemes.
We show that the SAR scheme can lead to more subscriptions and a higher
operator revenue from the data market, while the SUR scheme can lead to better
ad viewership and a higher operator revenue from the ad market. We further show
that the operator's optimal choice between the two schemes is sensitive to the
users' data consumption utility function and the operator's network capacity.
We provide some counter-intuitive insights. For example, when each user has a
logarithmic utility function, the operator should apply the SUR scheme (i.e.,
reward both subscribers and non-subscribers) if and only if it has a small

  engineering",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of high mobility encapsulated graphene devices, new
electronic components ruled by Dirac fermions optics have been envisioned and
realized. The main building blocks of electron-optics devices are gate-defined
p-n junctions, which guide, transmit and refract graphene charge carriers, just
like prisms and lenses in optics. The reflection and transmission are governed
by the p-n junction smoothness, a parameter difficult to tune in conventional
devices. Here we create p-n junctions in graphene, using the polarized tip of a
scanning gate microscope, yielding Fabry-P\'erot interference fringes in the
device resistance. We control the p-n junctions smoothness using the
tip-to-graphene distance, and show increased interference contrast using
smoother potential barriers. Extensive tight-binding simulation reveal that
smooth potential barriers induce a pronounced quasi-confinement of Dirac
fermions below the tip, yielding enhanced interference contrast. On the
opposite, sharp barriers are excellent Dirac fermions transmitters and lead to
poorly contrasted interferences. Our work emphasizes the importance of junction
smoothness for relativistic electron optics devices engineering.

an energy greater than the original particle energy. We obtain constraints on
the relative velocity of the decay products during the Penrose process in the

an issue of mode collapse induced by the separate design of task and domain

adversarial objective that encourages a mutually inhibitory relation between
category and domain predictions for any input instance. We show that under
practical conditions, it defines a minimax game that can promote the joint
distribution alignment. Except for the traditional closed set domain
adaptation, we also extend DADA for extremely challenging problem settings of

cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually
restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera
tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera
tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear
successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt
appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective.
Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory
cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global
matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance
features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in
tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise
MTMCT performance.
  To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce
locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an
intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for
multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from
their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the
re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully
applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed
method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and
a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.

with a large margin via a FP (feature pyramid). FP is a top-down aggregation to
collect semantically strong features to improve scale invariance in both
two-stage and one-stage detectors. However, this top-down pathway cannot
preserve accurate object positions due to the shift-effect of pooling. Thus,
the advantage of FP to improve detection accuracy will disappear when more
layers are used. The original FP lacks a bottom-up pathway to offset the lost
information from lower-layer feature maps. It performs well in large-sized
object detection but poor in small-sized object detection. A new structure
""residual feature pyramid"" is proposed in this paper. It is bidirectional to
fuse both deep and shallow features towards more effective and robust detection
for both small-sized and large-sized objects. Due to the ""residual"" nature, it
can be easily trained and integrated to different backbones (even deeper or
lighter) than other bi-directional methods. One important property of this
residual FP is: accuracy improvement is still found even if more layers are
adopted. Extensive experiments on VOC and MS COCO datasets showed the proposed

research topic due to its wide potential applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel GRAph PYramid Mutual Learning (Grapy-ML) method to address the
cross-dataset human parsing problem, where the annotations are at different
granularities. Starting from the prior knowledge of the human body hierarchical
structure, we devise a graph pyramid module (GPM) by stacking three levels of
graph structures from coarse granularity to fine granularity subsequently. At
each level, GPM utilizes the self-attention mechanism to model the correlations
between context nodes. Then, it adopts a top-down mechanism to progressively
refine the hierarchical features through all the levels. GPM also enables
efficient mutual learning. Specifically, the network weights of the first two
levels are shared to exchange the learned coarse-granularity information across
different datasets. By making use of the multi-granularity labels, Grapy-ML
learns a more discriminative feature representation and achieves
state-of-the-art performance, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments on
the three popular benchmarks, e.g. CIHP dataset. The source code is publicly

implications in developing the multi channel readouts mainly when fast signal
processing is required. Using TOT technique as a measure of energy loss instead
of charge integration methods significantly reduces the signals readout cost by
combining the time and energy information. Therefore, this approach can
potentially be used in J-PET tomograph which is build from plastic
scintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adopting
this technique is lying in the non-linear correlation between input energy loss
and TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop the
relationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it with the J-PET
tomograph.
  The experiment was performed using the $^{22}$Na beta emitter source placed
in the center of the J-PET tomograph. One can obtain primary photons of two
different energies: 511 keV photon from the annihilation of positron (direct
annihilation or through the formation of para-Positronim atom or pick-off
process of ortho-Positronium atoms), and 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows to
study the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy range up to
1000 keV. As the photon interacts dominantly via Compton scattering inside the
plastic scintillator, there is no direct information of primary photon energy.
However, using the J-PET geometry one can measure the scattering angle of the
interacting photon. Since, $^{22}$Na source emits photons of two different
energies, it is required to know unambiguously the energy of incident photons
and its corresponding scattering angle for the estimation of energy deposition.
In this work, the relationship between Time Over Threshold and energy loss by
interacting photons inside the plastic scintillators used in J-PET scanner is
established for a energy deposited range 100-1000 keV

and has received considerable interest recently. A randomized mechanism
satisfying $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy (DP) roughly means that,
except with a small probability $\delta$, altering a record in a dataset cannot
change the probability that an output is seen by more than a multiplicative
factor $e^{\epsilon} $. A well-known solution to $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP is the
Gaussian mechanism initiated by Dwork et al. [1] in 2006 with an improvement by
Dwork and Roth [2] in 2014, where a Gaussian noise amount $\sqrt{2\ln
\frac{2}{\delta}} \times \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}$ of [1] or $\sqrt{2\ln
\frac{1.25}{\delta}} \times \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}$ of [2] is added
independently to each dimension of the query result, for a query with
$\ell_2$-sensitivity $\Delta$. Although both classical Gaussian mechanisms
[1,2] assume $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$, our review finds that many studies in the
literature have used the classical Gaussian mechanisms under values of
$\epsilon$ and $\delta$ where the added noise amounts of [1,2] do not achieve
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. We obtain such result by analyzing the optimal noise
amount $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$ for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and identifying $\epsilon$
and $\delta$ where the noise amounts of classical mechanisms are even less than
$\sigma_{DP-OPT}$.
  Since $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$ has no closed-form expression and needs to be
approximated in an iterative manner, we propose Gaussian mechanisms by deriving
closed-form upper bounds for $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$. Our mechanisms achieve
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP for any $\epsilon$, while the classical mechanisms [1,2]
do not achieve $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP for large $\epsilon$ given $\delta$.
Moreover, the utilities of our mechanisms improve those of [1,2] and are close
to that of the optimal yet more computationally expensive Gaussian mechanism.

limited.
  Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al.,
Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory
causes, as well as circulatory causes linearly against the monthly proxies for
the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the
Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII)), adjusting for the baseline
rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal
trends.
  Results: For the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 seasons, influenza circulation
was associated with an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) deaths for
circulatory causes and 4179 (3250,5109) deaths for respiratory causes, with the
largest number of deaths (32298 (18071,46525) for circulatory causes and 6689
(5019,8359) for respiratory causes) estimated during the 2014/15 influenza
season. The biggest contributor to both circulatory and respiratory
influenza-associated deaths was influenza A/H3N2, followed by influenza B and
A/H1N1. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17
through the 2018/19 seasons (when levels of influenza vaccination were
significantly higher), the number of influenza-associated deaths declined by
about 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory deaths.
  Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality
burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction
observed following the major increase in vaccination coverage. Those results
support the potential utility of further extending the levels of influenza
vaccination, the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and extra efforts for
protecting individuals with circulatory disease in Russia, including

detectors to gain better insight into their vulnerabilities. This is an
important study in order to build better forgery detectors able to face
malicious attacks. Our proposal consists of a GAN-based approach that injects
camera traces into synthetic images. Given a GAN-generated image, we insert the
traces of a specific camera model into it and deceive state-of-the-art
detectors into believing the image was acquired by that model. Likewise, we
deceive independent detectors of synthetic GAN images into believing the image
is real. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in a wide
array of conditions. Moreover, no prior information on the attacked detectors
is needed, but only sample images from the target camera.

  Visualization","14 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.GR cond-mat.quant-gas hep-ph nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vectorizing vortex-core lines is crucial for high-quality visualization and
analysis of turbulence. While several techniques exist in the literature, they
can only be applied to classical fluids. Recently, quantum fluids with
turbulence get more and more attention in physics. It is thus desirable that
vortex-core lines can also be well extracted and visualized for quantum fluids.
In this paper, we aim for this goal and developed an efficient vortex-core line
vectorization method for quantum fluids, which enables real-time visualization
of high-resolution quantum turbulence structure. Given the datasets by
simulation, our technique is developed from the vortices identified by the
circulation-based method. To vectorize the vortex-core lines enclosed by those
vortices, we propose a novel graph-based data structure, with iterative graph
reduction and density-guided local optimization, to locate more precisely
sub-grid-scale vortex-core line samples, which are then vectorized by
continuous curves. This not only represents vortex-core line structures
continuously, but also naturally preserves complex topology, such as branching
during reconnection. By vectorization, the memory consumption can be largely
reduced by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time rendering performance.
Different types of interactive visualizations are demonstrated to show the
effectiveness of our technique, which could assist further research on quantum
turbulence.

$H(z)$ deviate significantly from that of the $\Lambda$CDM model, which
indicates that a dark energy model different from the cosmological constant can
help to relax the $H_0$ tension problem. The tension between our best-fit

  Traffic Analysis and Graph Inference",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose to identify compromised mobile devices from a
network administrator's point of view. Intuitively, inadvertent users (and thus
their devices) who download apps through untrustworthy markets are often
allured to install malicious apps through in-app advertisement or phishing. We
thus hypothesize that devices sharing a similar set of apps will have a similar
probability of being compromised, resulting in the association between a device
being compromised and apps in the device. Our goal is to leverage such
associations to identify unknown compromised devices (i.e., devices possibly
having yet currently not having known malicious apps) using the
guilt-by-association principle. Admittedly, such associations could be quite
weak as it is often hard, if not impossible, for an app to automatically
download and install other apps without explicit initiation from a user. We
describe how we can magnify such weak associations between devices and apps by
carefully choosing parameters when applying graph-based inferences. We
empirically show the effectiveness of our approach with a comprehensive study
on the mobile network traffic provided by a major mobile service provider.
Concretely, we achieve nearly 98\% accuracy in terms of AUC (area under the ROC
curve). Given the relatively weak nature of association, we further conduct
in-depth analysis of the different behavior of a graph-inference approach, by
comparing it to active DNS data. Moreover, we validate our results by showing
that detected compromised devices indeed present undesirable behavior in terms
of their privacy leakage and network infrastructure accessed.

from 2016 to 2017 during which several strong $\gamma$-ray flares were

\gray spectra of CTA 102 during the flaring period is performed. In several
periods the \gray spectrum is not consistent with a simple power-law, having a
hard photon index with an index of $\sim(1.8-2.0)$ that shows a spectral cutoff
around an observed photon energy of $\sim(9-16)$ GeV. The internal $\gamma$-ray
absorption via photon-photon pair production on the broad-line-region-reflected
photons cannot account for the observed cut-off/break even if the emitting
region is very close to the central source. This cut-off/break is likely due to
a similar intrinsic break in the energy distribution of emitting particles. The
origin of the spectral break is investigated through the multiwavelength
modeling of the spectral energy distribution, considering a different location
for the emitting region. The observed X-ray and $\gamma$-ray data is modeled as
inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron and/or external photons on the
electron population that produce the radio-to-optical emission which allowed to
constrain the power-law index and cut-off energy in the electron energy
distribution. The obtained results are discussed in the context of a diffusive
acceleration of electrons in the CTA 102 jet.

identify by first-principles calculations robust 2D multiferroic behaviors in
decorated Fe2O3 monolayer, showcasing N@Fe2O3 as a prototypical case, where
ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism stem from the same origin, namely Fe
d-orbit splitting induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion and associated crystal

be effectively reversed and regulated by applied electric field or strain,
offering efficient functionality. These findings establish strong materials

make a simple pattern in boundary condition through which this mechanism might

identification and mitigation of noise in quantum computing, but can be
expensive in terms of quantum resources and time to repeatedly employ. Another
challenging aspect is that parameters governing the performance of various
operations tend to drift over time, and monitoring these is hence a difficult
task. One of the most promising characterization techniques, gate set
tomography (GST), provides a self-consistent estimate of the completely
positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps for a complete set of gates, as well as
preparation and measurement operators. We develop a method for performance
optimization seeded by tomography (POST), which couples the power of GST with a
classical optimization routine to achieve a consistent gate improvement in just
a short number of steps within a given calibration cycle. By construction, the
POST procedure finds the best available gate operation given the hardware, and
is therefore robust to the effects of drift. Further, in comparison to other
quantum error mitigation techniques, it builds upon a one-time application of
GST. To demonstrate the performance of this method on a real quantum computer,
we map out the operations of six qubit pairs on the superconducting
\emph{ibmq\_poughkeepsie} quantum device. Under the restriction of logical-only
control, we monitor the performance of the POST approach on a chosen CNOT gate
over a period of six weeks. In this time, we achieve a consistent improvement
in gate fidelity, averaging a fidelity increase of 21.1\% as measured by
randomized benchmarking. The POST approach should find wide applicability as it
is hardware agnostic, and can be applied at the upper logical level or at a
deeper pulse control level.

  Photothermal Induced Resonance Spectroscopy",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Photothermal-Induced Resonance (PTIR) is increasingly used in the measurement
of infrared absorption spectra of sub-micrometer objects. The technique
measures IR absorption spectra by relying on the photothermal effect induced by
a rapid pulse of light and the excitation of the resonance spectrum of an AFM
cantilever in contact with the sample. In this work we assess the spatial
resolution and depth response of PTIR in resonant mode while systematically
varying the pulsing frequency of the excitation laser and the cantilever
resonance. The spatial resolution shows a shallow linear dependence on the
inverse of the pulse frequency, which rules out tip size as a limiting factor
for resolution in the frequency range under investigation. Measured resolution
values are also one order of magnitude lower than in the thermal diffusion
limit, excluding thermal wave propagation as a limiting factor. We also show
that the pulsing frequency of the laser and choice of cantilever resonance
affect the intensity of the signal and the surface selectivity in PTIR images,
with higher frequencies providing increased surface selectivity. The results
confirm a difference in signal generation between resonant PTIR and other
photothermal techniques and indicate that photothermal induced heating and
expansion cannot fully account for observed intensity and resolution.

encode an integer partition. In 1941, motivated by the modular representation
theory of the symmetric group, Nakayama introduced the idea of a p-core
partition, for p prime, using hook removals. In the following decade, Robinson,
Littlewood, Staal and Farahat codified the $p$-quotient of such a partition,
using variations of the star diagram. Since the 1970s, the convention has been
to build up the theory of both core and quotients with the abacus construction,
first introduced by G. James. In this paper we return to the earlier point of
view. First we show that, for any positive integer t, the t-core and t-quotient
of an integer partition can be directly obtained from its Frobenius symbol. The
argument also works in the opposite direction: that is, given the Frobenius
symbol of a t-core and a $t$-tuple of Frobenius symbols, one can recover the
Frobenius symbol of the corresponding partition. One immediate application is
the calculation of the Durfee number of the associated partition from the
Frobenius symbols of the core and quotient. In 1991, J. Scopes gathered
together the $p$-core partitions into families to prove that Donovan's
conjecture holds for the symmetric groups at the prime p. We describe, using
our methods, the action of the affine Weyl group W_p of type $A$ on Frobenius
symbols, and use this to parametrize and compute the explicit number of Scopes
families. In particular we enumerate both the infinite and finite Scopes
families. Core partitions have also attracted recent interest in number theory.
By constructing explicit and combinatorial bijections, we revisit some
well-known identities originally obtained using sophisticated methods. We end
with a close study of the relationship between certain hooks in the quotient
and certain hooks in the associated partition.

finite number of terms in order of decaying importance to ensure good QMC
convergence. The second part is a correction term which is sampled using
standard pseudo-random numbers. We show how the sampling of both terms can be
performed in linear time and memory complexity in the number of mesh cells via
a supermesh construction, yielding an overall linear cost. Furthermore, our
technique can be used to enforce the MLQMC coupling even in the case of

Many initialization methods have been proposed, but none of them can
dynamically adapt to datasets with various characteristics. In our previous
research, an initialization method for K-means based on hybrid distance was
proposed, and this algorithm can adapt to datasets with different
characteristics. However, it has the following drawbacks: (a) When calculating
density, the threshold cannot be uniquely determined, resulting in unstable
results. (b) Heavily depending on adjusting the parameter, the parameter must
be adjusted five times to obtain better clustering results. (c) The time
complexity of the algorithm is quadratic, which is difficult to apply to large

only adapt to datasets with various characteristics but also obtain better

for inverse stochastic resonance by considering a paradigmatic model of two
adaptively coupled stochastic active rotators whose local dynamics is close to
a bifurcation threshold. In the first scenario, shown for the two rotators in
the excitable regime, inverse stochastic resonance emerges due to a biased
switching between the oscillatory and the quasi-stationary metastable states
derived from the attractors of the noiseless system. In the second scenario,
illustrated for the rotators in the oscillatory regime, inverse stochastic

has not been possible to draw consistent conclusions from household studies of
infectious diseases, for example in the event of an influenza pandemic. Here,
we present a generalised linear modelling framework for binary outcomes in
sub-units that can (i) capture the effects of non-independence arising from a
transmission process and (ii) adjust estimates of disease risk and severity for
differences in study population characteristics. This model allows for
computationally fast estimation, uncertainty quantification, covariate choice

the abstract setting of tangent categories. The key notion is that of a curve
object which is, for differential geometry, the structural analogue of a
natural number object. A curve object is a preinitial object for dynamical
systems; dynamical systems may, in turn, be viewed as determining systems of
differential equations. The unique map from the curve object to a dynamical
system is a solution of the system, and a dynamical system is said to be
complete when for all initial conditions there is a solution. A subtle issue
concerns the question of when a dynamical system is complete, and the paper
provides abstract conditions for this.
  This abstract formulation also allows new perspectives on topics such as
commutative vector fields and flows. In addition, the stronger notion of a
differential curve object, which is the centrepiece of the last section of the
paper, has exponential maps and forms a differential exponential rig. This rig
then, somewhat surprisingly, has an action on every differential object and
bundle in the setting. In this manner, in a very strong sense, such a curve
object plays the role of the real numbers in standard differential geometry.

patterns, have led to more frequent outbreaks of plant disease epidemics
worldwide. Mathematical modelling is a key tool in predicting where and how
these new threats will spread, as well as in assessing how damaging they might
be. Models can also be used to inform disease management, providing a rational
methodology for comparing the performance of possible control strategies
against one another. For emerging epidemics, in which new pathogens or pathogen
strains are actively spreading into new regions, the spatial component of
spread becomes particularly important, both to make predictions and to optimise
disease control. In this chapter we illustrate how the spatial spread of
emerging plant diseases can be modelled at the landscape scale via spatially
explicit compartmental models. Our particular focus is on the crucial role of
the dispersal kernel-which parameterises the probability of pathogen spread
from an infected host to susceptible hosts at any given distance-in determining
outcomes of epidemics. We add disease management to our model by testing
performance of a simple ''one off'' form of reactive disease control, in which
sites within a particular distance of locations detected to contain infection
are removed in a single round of disease management. We use this simplified
model to show how ostensibly arcane decisions made by the modeller-most notably
whether or not the underpinning disease model allows for stochasticity (i.e.
randomness)-can greatly impact on disease management recommendations. Our
chapter is accompanied by example code in the programming language R available
via an online repository, allowing the reader to run the models we present for
him/herself.

manifests itself may be subtle, e.g. in the form of anomalous conformal Ward

single-minus amplitudes are a natural first step towards understanding the
conformal properties of Yang-Mills theory at loop level. Remarkably, we find
that the one-loop all-plus amplitudes are conformally invariant, whereas the
single-minus are not. Moreover, we present a formula for the one-loop all-plus

transforms covariantly under directional dual conformal variations. We prove
the formula directly using recursive techniques, and check that it has the
correct physical factorisations.

high-dimensional model of intermediate complexity, the fully-coupled
Cane-Zebiak model [ZC87], from the spectral analysis of Markov operators
governing the decay of correlations and resonances in the power spectrum.
Noise-induced oscillations excited before a supercritical Hopf bifurcation are
examined by means of complex resonances , the reduced Ruelle-Pollicott (RP)
resonances, via a numerical application of the reduction approach of the first
part of this contribution [CTND19] to model simulations. The oscillations
manifest themselves as peaks in the power spectrum which are associated with RP
resonances organized along parabolas, as the bifurcation is neared. These
resonances and the associated eigenvectors are furthermore well described by
the small-noise expansion formulas obtained by [Gas02] and made explicit in the
second part of this contribution [TCND19]. Beyond the bifurcation, the spectral
gap between the imaginary axis and the real part of the leading resonances
quantifies the diffusion of phase of the noise-induced oscillations and can be
computed from the linearization of the model and from the diffusion matrix of
the noise. In this model, the phase diffusion coefficient thus gives a measure
of the predictability of oscillatory events representing ENSO. ENSO events
being known to be locked to the seasonal cycle, these results should be
extended to the non-autonomous case. More generally, the reduction approach
theorized in [CTND19], complemented by our understanding of the spectral
properties of reference systems such as the stochastic Hopf bifurcation,
provides a promising methodology for the analysis of low-frequency variability

Conventional optimal wide-area control is model-based. However, in practice
detailed and accurate parametric power system models are rarely available. In

Further, we discuss how to relieve the computational burden of the Min-Max
DeePC by reducing the dimension of prediction uncertainty and how to leverage

with plausible definitions for the efficiency and irreversibility of the

numerical simulations of the model for reasonable choices of the population

that the efficiency of movements is indeed negatively correlated with the above

intervals of arriving to destinations and returning to origins, which are
usually larger than the time interval of the departures. This in turn gives

ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their increased mass relative
to light-flavor hadrons, long lifetime, and early production in hard-scattering
interactions, they provide access to the full evolution of the partonic medium
formed in heavy-ion collisions. This paper reports two-dimensional (2D) angular
correlations between neutral $D$-mesons and unidentified charged particles
produced in minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
$D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ mesons are reconstructed via their weak decay to $K^{\mp}
\pi^{\pm}$ using the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) in the Solenoidal Tracker at
RHIC (STAR) experiment. Correlations on relative pseudorapidity and azimuth
$(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)$ are presented for peripheral, mid-central and central
collisions with $D^0$ transverse momentum from 2 to 10 GeV/$c$. Attention is
focused on the 2D peaked correlation structure near the triggered $D^0$-meson,
the {\em near-side} (NS) peak, which serves as a proxy for a charm-quark
containing jet. The correlated NS yield of charged particles per $D^0$-meson
and the 2D widths of the NS peak increase significantly from peripheral to
central collisions. These results are compared with similar correlations using
unidentified charged particles, consisting primarily of light-flavor hadrons,
at similar trigger particle momenta. Similar per-trigger yields and widths of
the NS correlation peak are observed. The present results provide additional
evidence that $D^0$-mesons undergo significant interactions with the medium
formed in heavy-ion collision and show, for the first time, significant
centrality evolution of the NS 2D peak in the correlations of particles
associated with a heavy-flavor hadron produced in these collisions.

analysis of 2D and 3D vector fields. It states roughly that any vector field
can be $L^2$-orthogonally decomposed into a curl-free, divergence-free, and a
harmonic field. The harmonic field itself can be further decomposed into three
components, two of which are closely tied to the topology of the underlying
domain. For practical computations it is desirable to find a discretization
which preserves as many aspects inherent to the smooth theory as possible while
at the same time remains computationally tractable, in particular on
large-sized models. The correctness and convergence of such a discretization
depends strongly on the choice of ansatz spaces defined on the surface or
volumetric mesh to approximate infinite dimensional subspaces. This paper
presents a consistent discretization of Hodge-type decomposition for piecewise
constant vector fields on volumetric meshes. Our approach is based on a careful
interplay between edge-based \textNedelec elements and face-based
Crouzeix-Raviart elements resulting in a very simple formulation. The method is
stable under noisy vector field and mesh resolution, and has a good performance
for large sized models. We give pseudocodes for a possible implementation of
the method together with some insights on how the Hodge decomposition could

a geometric generalization of subgroup containment. Extending work of Cohen, we
show that cocompact lattices in a general semisimple Lie group $\mathbf{G}$
that is not isogenous to $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ admit translation-like
actions by $\mathbb{Z}^2$. This result follows from a more general result.
Namely, we prove that any cocompact lattice in the unipotent radical
$\mathbf{N}$ of the Borel subgroup $\mathbf{AN}$ of $\mathbf{G}$ acts
translation-like on any cocompact lattice in $\mathbf{G}$. We also prove that
for noncompact simple Lie groups $G,H$ with $H<G$ and lattices $\Gamma < G$ and
$\Delta < H$, that $\Gamma/\Delta$ is quasi-isometric to $G/H$ where
$\Gamma/\Delta$ is the quotient via a translation-like action of $\Delta$ on
$\Gamma$.

the large zoo of active galactic nuclei with a single physical object. The
discovery of broad permitted lines in the polarized spectrum of type 2 Seyfert
galaxies in the mid 80's led to the idea of an obscuring torus, whose
orientation with respect to our line of sight was the reason of the different
optical spectra. However, after many years of observations with different
techniques, including IR and mm interferometry, the resulting properties of the
observed dust structures differ from the torus model that would be needed to
explain the type 1 vs type 2 dichotomy. Moreover, in the last years,
multi-frequency monitoring of active galactic nuclei has shown an increasing
number of transitions from one type to the other one, which cannot be explained
in terms of the simple orientation of the dusty structure surrounding the
active galactic nucleus (AGN). The interrelations between the AGN and the host
galaxy, as also shown in the Magorrian relation, suggest that the evolution of
the host galaxy may also have an important role in the observed manifestation
of the nuclei. As an example, the observed delay between the maximum star
formation activity and the onset of the AGN activity, and the higher occurrence
of type 2 nuclei in star forming galaxies, have suggested the possible
evolutionary path from, e.g., HII $\rightarrow$ AGN2 $\rightarrow$ AGN1. In the
next years the models of unification need to also consider this observational
framework and not only simple orientation effects.

plays a crucial role in understanding various phases and exotic ground states

this end, we numerically diagonalize a 1D spin-orbital model with the
'Kugel-Khomskii' exchange interactions between spins and orbitals on different

spin-orbit coupling w.r.t. the spin-orbital exchange, the ground state to a

can, depending on the model parameters, either still show negligible
spin-orbital entanglement, or can evolve to a highly spin-orbitally entangled
phase with completely distinct properties that are described by an effective
XXZ model. The presented results suggest that: (i) the spin-orbital
entanglement may be induced by large on-site spin-orbit coupling, as found in
the 5d transition metal oxides, such as the iridates; (ii) for Mott insulators

an adaptive protocol that, by learning the qubit environment, narrows down the

($Q_{AA}$) within the BDMPS-Z formalism. We calculate these quantities for
three types of expansion scenarios, namely static, exponentially decaying and
Bjorken expanding media. The distribution of medium-induced gluons is
calculated using an evolution equation with splitting kernels derived from the
gluon emission spectra. A universal behavior of splitting kernels is derived in
the regime of soft gluon emissions when evaluated at a common effective
evolution time $\tau_{eff}$. Novel scaling features of the resulting gluon
distribution and jet $Q_{AA}$ are discussed. For realistic spectra valid beyond
the soft-gluon emission limit, where the results are obtained by a numerical
solution of the evolution equation, these features are partially replaced by a
scaling expected from considering an averaged jet quenching parameter along the
trajectory of propagation. Further we show that differences arising from
different types of the medium expansion can be to a large extent scaled out by
appropriate choice of the quenching parameter. Sizable differences among the
values of the quenching parameter for different types of medium expansion point
to the importance of the medium expansion for precise modeling of the jet

which the Falicov-Kimball model on a finite two-dimensional lattice is located
between two noninteracting semi-infinite leads. We use a combination of
nonequilibrium Green's functions techniques with a sign-problem-free Monte
Carlo method for finite temperatures or a simulated annealing technique for the
ground state to address steady-state transport through the system. We show that
different ground-state phases of the central system can lead to simple
metallic-like or insulating charge transport characteristics, but also to more
complicated current-voltage dependencies reflecting a multi-band character of
the transmission function. Interestingly, with increasing temperature, the
orderings tend to form transient phases before the system reaches the
disordered phase. This leads to nontrivial temperature dependencies of the
transmission function and charge current.

planning. Forward search algorithms typically rely on a single, relatively
simple variation of best-first search and remain fixed throughout the process
of solving a planning problem. Existing work combining multiple search
techniques usually aims at supporting best-first search with an additional
exploratory mechanism, triggered using a handcrafted criterion. A notable
exception is very recent work which combines various search techniques using a
trainable policy. It is, however, confined to a discrete action space
comprising several fixed subroutines.
  In this paper, we introduce a parametrized search algorithm template which
combines various search techniques within a single routine. The template's
parameter space defines an infinite space of search algorithms, including,
among others, BFS, local and random search. We further introduce a neural
architecture for designating the values of the search parameters given the
state of the search. This enables expressing neural search policies that change
the values of the parameters as the search progresses. The policies can be
learned automatically, with the objective of maximizing the planner's
performance on a given distribution of planning problems. We consider a
training setting based on a stochastic optimization algorithm known as the
cross-entropy method (CEM). Experimental evaluation of our approach shows that
it is capable of finding effective distribution-specific search policies,
outperforming the relevant baselines.

prediction have raised much research interest in recent years. Existing models
have shown superior performance, but there are still several major issues that
have not been fully taken into consideration. First, the historical variation
pattern of the biomarker in diverse time scales plays a vital role in
indicating the health status, but it has not been explicitly extracted by
existing works. Second, key factors that strongly indicate the health risk are
different among patients. It is still challenging to adaptively make use of the
features for patients in diverse conditions. Third, using prediction models as
the black box will limit the reliability in clinical practice. However, none of
the existing works can provide satisfying interpretability and meanwhile
achieve high prediction performance. In this work, we develop a general health
status representation learning model, named AdaCare. It can capture the long
and short-term variations of biomarkers as clinical features to depict the
health status in multiple time scales. It also models the correlation between
clinical features to enhance the ones which strongly indicate the health status
and thus can maintain a state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction
accuracy while providing qualitative interpretability. We conduct a health risk
prediction experiment on two real-world datasets. Experiment results indicate
that AdaCare outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and provides effective
interpretability, which is verifiable by clinical experts.

laboratories in Europe. The specifications required to operate a NB system on
DEMO are very demanding: the system has to provide plasma heating, current
drive and plasma control at a very high level of power (up to 150 MW) and
energy (1 or 2 MeV), including high performances in term of wall-plug
efficiency ($\eta$ > 60%), high availability and reliability. To this aim, a
novel NB concept based on the photodetachment of the energetic negative ion
beam is under study. The keystone of this new concept is the achievement of a
photoneutralizer where a high power photon flux (~3 MW) generated within a
Fabry Perot cavity will overlap, cross and partially photodetach the intense
negative ion beam accelerated at high energy (1 or 2 MeV). The aspect ratio of
the beam-line (source, accelerator, etc.) is specifically designed to maximize
the overlap of the photon beam with the ion beam. It is shown that such a
photoneutralized based NB system would have the capability to provide several
tens of MW of D 0 per beam line with a wall-plug efficiency higher than 60%. A
feasibility study of the concept has been launched between different
laboratories to address the different physics aspects, i.e., negative ion
source, plasma modelling, ion accelerator simulation, photoneutralization and
high voltage holding under vacuum. The paper describes the present status of

shift in BSC. From this, we make a detailed comparison with the isostructural
tetradymite Bi$_{2}$Te$_{2}$Se (BTS) [McFadden et al., Phys Rev. B 99, 125201
(2019)]. In the magnetic BTM, the effects of the dilute Mn moments predominate,
but remarkably the $^{8}$Li signal is not wiped out through the magnetic
transition at 13 K, with a prominent critical peak in the SLR that is
suppressed in a high applied field. This detailed characterization of the
$^{8}$Li NMR response is an important step towards using depth-resolved
$\beta$-NMR to study the low-energy properties of the chiral topological
surface state (TSS). With the bulk NMR response now established in several
Bi$_{2}$Ch$_{3}$ tetradymite topological insulators (TIs), the prospect of
directly probing their chiral TSS using the depth resolution afforded by
$\beta$-NMR remains strong.

coherence tomography (IVOCT) catheters are tracked in real time in order to
compensate for image artifacts related to relative motion. Our approach
demonstrates the feasibility for bimodal IVOCT and MPI in-vitro experiments.
Material and Methods: During IVOCT imaging of a stenosis phantom the catheter
is tracked using MPI. A 4D trajectory of the catheter tip is determined from
the MPI data using center of mass sub-voxel strategies. A custom built IVOCT
imaging adapter is used to perform different catheter motion profiles: no
motion artifacts, motion artifacts due to catheter bending, and heart beat
motion artifacts. Two IVOCT volume reconstruction methods are compared
qualitatively and quantitatively using the DICE metric and the known stenosis
length. Results: The MPI-tracked trajectory of the IVOCT catheter is validated
in multiple repeated measurements calculating the absolute mean error and
standard deviation. Both volume reconstruction methods are compared and
analyzed whether they are capable of compensating the motion artifacts. The
novel approach of MPI-guided catheter tracking corrects motion artifacts
leading to a DICE coefficient with a minimum of 86% in comparison to 58% for a
standard reconstruction approach. Conclusions: IVOCT catheter tracking with MPI
in real time is an auspicious method for radiation free MPI-guided IVOCT
interventions. The combination of MPI and IVOCT can help to reduce motion
artifacts due to catheter bending and heart beat for optimized IVOCT volume
reconstructions.

travels in interstellar space, it keeps colliding with interstellar medium
(ISM). Given a sufficiently long interaction time, its rotation state may
change significantly because of the angular momentum transfer with interstellar
medium. Using generated Gaussian random spheres with the dimension ratios 6:1:1
and 5:5:1, this paper explores the ISM torque curve and proposes that ISM
collision may account for 'Oumuamua's tumbling with the simple constant-torque
analytical method. The statistic results show that the asymptotic obliquities
distribute mostly at 0 and 180 degree and most cases spin down at the
asymptotic obliquity, indicating the ISM collision effect is similar to the
YORP effect with zero heat conductivity assumed. Given a long time of
deceleration of the spin rate, an initial major-axis rotation may evolve into
tumbling motion under ISM torque. Using a constant-torque analytical model, the
timescales of evolving into tumbling for the sample of 200 shapes are found to
range from several Gyrs to ens of Gyrs, highly dependent on the chosen shape.
The mean value is about 8.5 Gyrs for prolate shapes and 7.3 Gyrs for oblate
shapes. Rotation of asteroids in the Oort cloud might be also dominated by the
ISM collision effect since the YORP effect is quite weak at such a long
distance from the Sun. Although this paper assumes an ideal mirror reflection
and a constant relative velocity of 'Oumuamua, the results still show the
importance of the ISM collision effect.

coupled with Runge-Kutta exponential integrators (SLDG-RKEI) for nonlinear
Vlasov dynamics. The commutator-free Runge-Kutta (RK) exponential integrators
(EI) were proposed by Celledoni, et al. (FGCS, 2003). In the nonlinear
transport setting, the RKEI can be used to decompose the evolution of the
nonlinear transport into a composition of a sequence of linearized dynamics.
The resulting linearized transport equations can be solved by the
semi-Lagrangian (SL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method proposed in Cai, et al.
(JSC, 2017). The proposed method can achieve high order spatial accuracy via
the SLDG framework, and high order temporal accuracy via the RK EI. Due to the
SL nature, the proposed SLDG-RKEI method is not subject to the CFL condition,
thus they have the potential in using larger time-stepping sizes than those in
the Eulerian approach. Inheriting advantages from the SLDG method, the proposed
SLDG-RKEI schemes are mass conservative, positivity-preserving, have no
dimensional splitting error, perform well in resolving complex solution
structures, and can be evolved with adaptive time-stepping sizes. We show the
performance of the SLDG-RKEI algorithm by classical test problems for the
nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system, as well as the Guiding center Vlasov model.
Though that it is not our focus of this paper to explore the SLDG-RKEI scheme
for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that develop shocks, we show some
preliminary results on schemes' performance on the Burgers' equation.

physics at the Large Hadron collider. Concretely, I discuss the interpretation
of a 2015 excess seen by ATLAS in events with jets, missing transverse momentum
and 2 same-flavour, opposite-charge leptons within a model of gauge-mediated
supersymmetry breaking. Our model, which features supersymmetry breaking in
multiple hidden sectors, was able to explain the 2015 data because of the
appearance of an additional massive neutral particle at the bottom of the
spectrum, with couplings dictated by supersymmetry. However, using more recent
data, I show that this specific implementation of the model is now ruled out.
In the second part, I focus on astroparticle physics and neutrino astronomy.
This part consists of two projects. The first and largest of these investigates
the possibility that the neutrinos seen by IceCube are produced by sources
obscured by matter. We show that, in this case, existing bounds from the
extragalactic gamma-ray background can be evaded. In addition, we apply our
model to a set of sources selected for possible obscuration and obtain relevant
bounds on the parameter space. In the final project, I investigate current
constraints on neutrino emission from binary black hole mergers. While no such
neutrinos are typically expected, current constraints are not yet able to rule
out a substantial contribution of such events to the astrophysical neutrino
flux. I show that in the near future, this possibility will be constrained.

respective fields, written to be of general interest.

prescription ensures that only the information complementary to those event
variables is used in event selection and categorization. This eliminates a
major misalignment with the physics goals of the analysis (maximizing the
significance of an excess) that exists in the training of typical ML-based
event selectors and categorizers. In addition, this decorrelation of event
selectors from the relevant event variables prevents the background
distribution from becoming peaked in the signal region as a result of event
selection, thereby ameliorating the challenges imposed on signal searches by
systematic uncertainties. Our event selectors (categorizers) use the output of
machine-learning-based classifiers as input and apply optimal selection cutoffs
(categorization thresholds) that depend on the event variables being analyzed,
as opposed to flat cutoffs (thresholds). These optimal cutoffs and thresholds
are learned iteratively, using a novel approach with connections to Lloyd's
k-means clustering algorithm. We provide a public, Python 3 implementation of

bend-induced material deformation on the nature of light propagation and
refractive losses. We introduce bend ratio (ratio of bend radius to fiber core
radius), to explain the influence of geometry modification and the bend-induced
inhomogeneity in RI (BIRI) of the fiber core on RI sensitivity. The bend ratio
of bent plastic optical fiber sensors falls under one of the four bending
regimes namely, gentle, geometric, saturation and plastic, for which the bend
ratios are less than 35, 25, 17 and 7 respectively. The results also show that

sensitivity observed with U-bent probes as opposed to the simple geometric
modification. This study also indicates the existence of an optimum bend ratio

  Services: A Multi-Model Collaborative Learning Approach",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latency-critical services have been widely deployed in cloud environments.
For cost-efficiency, multiple services are usually co-located on a server.
Thus, run-time resource scheduling becomes the pivot for QoS control in these
complicated co-location cases. However, the scheduling exploration space
enlarges rapidly with the increasing server resources, making the schedulers
hardly provide ideal solutions quickly. More importantly, we observe that there
are ""resource cliffs"" in the scheduling exploration space. They affect the
exploration efficiency and always lead to severe QoS fluctuations. Resource
cliffs cannot be easily avoided in previous schedulers. To address these
problems, we propose a novel ML-based intelligent scheduler - OSML. It learns
the correlation between architectural hints (e.g., IPC, cache misses, memory
footprint, etc.), scheduling solutions and the QoS demands based on a data set
we collected from 11 widely deployed services running on off-the-shelf servers.
OSML employs multiple ML models to work collaboratively to predict QoS
variations, shepherd the scheduling, and recover from QoS violations in
complicated co-location cases. OSML can intelligently avoid resource cliffs
during scheduling and reach an optimal solution much faster than previous

significantly decrease memory usage when training Deep Neural Networks with the
back-propagation algorithm. Similarly to checkpoint-ing techniques coming from
the literature on Automatic Differentiation, it consists in dynamically
selecting the forward activations that are saved during the training phase, and
then automatically recomputing missing activations from those previously
recorded. We propose an original computation model that combines two types of
activation savings: either only storing the layer inputs, or recording the
complete history of operations that produced the outputs (this uses more
memory, but requires fewer recomputations in the backward phase), and we
provide an algorithm to compute the optimal computation sequence for this
model. This paper also describes a PyTorch implementation that processes the
entire chain, dealing with any sequential DNN whose internal layers may be
arbitrarily complex and automatically executing it according to the optimal
checkpointing strategy computed given a memory limit. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our implementation consistently outperforms existing
checkpoint-ing approaches for a large class of networks, image sizes and batch

investigation of whole-brain connectivity, which can potentially help to reveal
the brain's global network architecture and abnormalities involved in
neurological and mental disorders. However, the reliability of connection
inferences from dMRI-based fiber tracking is still debated, due to low
sensitivity, dominance of false positives, and inaccurate and incomplete
reconstruction of long-range connections. Furthermore, parameters of tracking
algorithms are typically tuned in a heuristic way, which leaves room for
manipulation of an intended result. Here we propose a data-driven framework to
optimize and validate parameters of dMRI-based fiber-tracking algorithms using
neural tracer data as a reference. Japan's Brain/MINDS Project provides
invaluable datasets containing both dMRI and neural tracer data from the same
primates. We considered four criteria for goodness of fiber tracking:
distance-weighted coverage, true/false positive ratio, projection coincidence,
and commissural passage, applied using a multi-objective optimization
algorithm. We implemented a variant of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
II (NSGA-II) to optimize five major parameters of a global fiber-tracking
algorithm over multiple brain samples in parallel. Using optimized parameters
compared to the default parameters, dMRI-based fiber tracking performance was
significantly improved, while minimizing false positives and impossible
cross-hemisphere connections. Parameters optimized for 10 tracer injection
sites showed good generalization capability for other brain samples. These
results demonstrate the importance of data-driven adjustment of fiber-tracking
algorithms and support the validity of dMRI-based tractography, if appropriate
adjustments are employed.

phenomenon of parametric resonance. In extremely high frequency regime where
frequency of spacetime oscillations is much larger than the field-mass, the
formed vortices are not topological in nature. Interestingly in this regime,
for a suitable choice of parameters of the simulation, we observe a persistent

detect since they have extremely low prevalence rates (varying from 1/1,000 to
1/200,000 patients) and are massively underdiagnosed. How do we reliably detect
rare diseases with such low prevalence rates? How to further leverage patients
with possibly uncertain diagnosis to improve detection? In this paper, we
propose a Complementary pattern Augmentation (CONAN) framework for rare disease
detection. CONAN combines ideas from both adversarial training and max-margin
classification. It first learns self-attentive and hierarchical embedding for
patient pattern characterization. Then, we develop a complementary generative
adversarial networks (GAN) model to generate candidate positive and negative
samples from the uncertain patients by encouraging a max-margin between
classes. In addition, CONAN has a disease detector that serves as the
discriminator during the adversarial training for identifying rare diseases. We
evaluated CONAN on two disease detection tasks. For low prevalence inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) detection, CONAN achieved .96 precision recall area under
the curve (PR-AUC) and 50.1% relative improvement over best baseline. For rare
disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) detection, CONAN achieves .22

limited.
  Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al.,
Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory
causes, as well as circulatory causes linearly against the monthly proxies for
the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the
Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII)), adjusting for the baseline
rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal
trends.
  Results: For the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 seasons, influenza circulation
was associated with an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) deaths for
circulatory causes and 4179 (3250,5109) deaths for respiratory causes, with the
largest number of deaths (32298 (18071,46525) for circulatory causes and 6689
(5019,8359) for respiratory causes) estimated during the 2014/15 influenza
season. The biggest contributor to both circulatory and respiratory
influenza-associated deaths was influenza A/H3N2, followed by influenza B and
A/H1N1. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17
through the 2018/19 seasons (when levels of influenza vaccination were
significantly higher), the volume of influenza-associated mortality declined by
about 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory deaths.
  Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality
burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction
observed following the major increase in vaccination coverage. Those results
support the potential utility of further extending the levels of influenza
vaccination, the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and extra efforts for
protecting individuals with circulatory disease in Russia, including
vaccination and the use of antiviral medications.

research in the fields of NLP and text mining. Attention mechanisms have been
at the forefront in order to learn contextual sentence representations. Current
state-of-the-art approaches for many NLP tasks use large pre-trained language
models such as BERT, XLNet and so on for learning representations. These models
are based on the Transformer architecture that involves recurrent blocks of
computation consisting of multi-head self-attention and feedforward networks.
One of the major bottlenecks largely contributing to the computational
complexity of the Transformer models is the self-attention layer, that is both
computationally expensive and parameter intensive. In this work, we introduce a
novel multi-head self-attention mechanism operating on GRUs that is shown to be
computationally cheaper and more parameter efficient than self-attention
mechanism proposed in Transformers for text classification tasks. The
efficiency of our approach mainly stems from two optimizations; 1) we use
low-rank matrix factorization of the affinity matrix to efficiently get
multiple attention distributions instead of having separate parameters for each
head 2) attention scores are obtained by querying a global context vector
instead of densely querying all the words in the sentence. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed model on tasks such as sentiment analysis from
movie reviews, predicting business ratings from reviews and classifying news
articles into topics. We find that the proposed approach matches or outperforms
a series of strong baselines and is more parameter efficient than comparable
multi-head approaches. We also perform qualitative analyses to verify that the
proposed approach is interpretable and captures context-dependent word
importance.

$\sim1.4M_\odot$ for a non-rotating non-magnetized white dwarf. On approaching
this limiting mass, a white dwarf is believed to spark off with an explosion
called type Ia supernova, which is considered to be a standard candle. However,
observations of several over-luminous, peculiar type Ia supernovae indicate
that the Chandrasekhar mass-limit to be significantly larger. By considering
noncommutativity among the components of position and momentum variables, hence
uncertainty in their measurements, at the quantum scales, we show that the mass
of white dwarfs could be significantly super-Chandrasekhar and thereby arrive
at a new mass-limit $\sim 2.6M_\odot$, explaining a possible origin of
over-luminous peculiar type Ia supernovae. The idea of noncommutativity, apart
from the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, is there for quite sometime,
without any observational proof however. Our finding offers a plausible
astrophysical evidence of noncommutativity, arguing for a possible second
standard candle, which has many far-reaching implications.

of magnitude and depends on molecular interactions and structure in a complex
way not amenable to first-principles theories. Despite the variations and
theoretical difficulties, we find a new quantity setting the minimal kinematic
viscosity of fluids: $\nu_m=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{m_em}}$, where
$m_e$ and $m$ are electron and molecule masses. We subsequently introduce a new
property, the ""elementary"" viscosity $\iota$ with the lower bound set by
fundamental physical constants and notably involving the proton-to-electron
mass ratio:
$\iota_m=\frac{\hbar}{4\pi}\left({\frac{m_p}{m_e}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where
$m_p$ is the proton mass. We discuss the connection of our result to the bound
found by Kovtun, Son and Starinets in strongly-interacting field theories.

of generalized virial is derived, in which generalized momenta are used as
particles momenta. This allows us to find exact formulas for the radial
component of the velocity of typical particles of the system and for their
root-mean-square speed, without using the notion of temperature. The relation
between the theorem and the cosmological constant, characterizing the physical
system under consideration, is shown. The difference is explained between the
kinetic energy and the energy of motion, the value of which is equal to half
the sum of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian. This difference is due to the
fact that the proper fields of each particle have mass-energy, which makes an
additional contribution into the kinetic energy. As a result, the total energy
of motion of particles and fields is obtained.

Cuprates HTSC. The model assumes various scenarios with respect to the order of
the holes hopping and evaluates the weighting parameters for the different
scenarios. The new model still results in the aggregation of holes into
strings, but yields a spectral distribution for the itinerancy rates of the
strings. From this distribution I infer a spectral distribution for the
magnetic interaction between the strings, which suggests also a spectral
distribution for the pseudogap parameter, and some relevant experimental
functions. Apart from these distributions, the basic assumptions of former
relevant theories remain intact. Such assumptions are the existence of the
anti-ferromagnetic phases A and B, the basic structure of the pseudogap ground
state, the excitation operators, and the field. The ground state and the field
are basically divided into two bands, the gapless low energy band, and the high
energy band. Due to the wide distributions, the bands may be partially
overlapped.

already found widespread use in data centers in the form of optical
interconnects. As global network traffic continues its rapid expansion, the
power consumption of such circuits becomes a critical consideration.
Electrically tunable devices in photonic integrated circuits contribute
significantly to the total power budget, as they traditionally rely on
inherently power-consuming phenomena such as the plasma dispersion effect or
the thermo-optic effect for operation. Here, we demonstrate ultra-low-power
refractive index tuning in a hybrid barium titanate (BTO)-silicon nitride (SiN)
platform integrated on silicon. We achieve tuning by exploiting the large
electric field-driven Pockels effect in ferroelectric BTO thin films of sub-100
nm thickness. The extrapolated power consumption for tuning a free spectral
range (FSR) in racetrack resonator devices is only 106 nW/FSR, several orders
of magnitude less than many previous reports. We demonstrate the technological
potential of our hybrid BTO-SiN technology by compensating thermally induced
refractive index variations over a temperature range of 20 {\deg}C and by using
our platform to fabricate tunable multiresonator optical filters. Our hybrid
BTO-SiN technology significantly advances the field of ultra-low-power
integrated photonic devices and allows for the realization of next-generation
efficient photonic circuits for use in a variety of fields, including
communications, sensing, and computing.

limited to fulfillment of the octet rule or similar simple deterministic
heuristics. We propose a model, inspired by language modeling from natural
language processing, with the ability to learn from a collection of undirected
molecular graphs, enabling fitting of any underlying structure rule present in
the collection. We introduce an adaption to the popular Transformer model,
which can learn relationships between atoms and bonds. To our knowledge, the
Transformer adaption is the first model that is trained to solve the
unsupervised task of recovering partially observed molecules. In this work, we
assess how different degrees of information impact performance w.r.t. to
fitting the QM9 dataset, which conforms to the octet rule, and to fitting the
ZINC dataset, which contains hypervalent molecules and ions requiring the model
to learn a more complex structure rule. More specifically, we test a full
discrete graph with bond order information, a full discrete graph with only
connectivity, a bag-of-neighbors, a bag-of-atoms, and a count-based unigram
statistics. These results provide encouraging evidence that neural networks,
even when only connectivity is available, can learn arbitrary molecular
structure rules specific to a dataset, as the Transformer adaption surpasses a
strong octet rule baseline on the ZINC dataset.
