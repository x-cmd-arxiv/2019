This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing

and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by
the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software
tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper
we present a new R-package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes

shortcomings, including high computational cost, excessive bias from the search

issues with a method that offers a simple, flexible, and efficient way of
building deep learning models automatically, and we demonstrate its
effectiveness in the context of convolutional neural networks. Instead of
searching for the 1-best architecture for a given task, we focus on building a
population of neural networks that are then ensembled into a neural network
committee, an approach we dub 'Neural Committee Search'. To ensure sufficient
performance from the committee, our search algorithm is based on an artificial
immune system that balances individual performance with population diversity.
This allows us to stop the search when accuracy starts to plateau, and to
bridge the performance gap through ensembling. In order to justify our method,
we first verify that the chosen search space exhibits the locality property. To
further improve efficiency, we also combine partial evaluation, weight
inheritance, and progressive search. First, experiments are run to verify the
validity of these techniques. Then, preliminary experimental results on two
popular computer vision benchmarks show that our method consistently
outperforms random search and yields promising results within reasonable GPU
budgets. An additional experiment also shows that ImmuNeCS's solutions transfer
effectively to a more difficult task, where they achieve results comparable to
a direct search on the new task. We believe these findings can open the way for
new, accessible alternatives to traditional NAS.

Mandelstam-Tamm-Messiah time-energy uncertainty relation $\tau_{F}\Delta_H\ge
\hbar/2$ provides a general lower bound to the characteristic time $\tau_F
=\Delta_F/|{\rm d} \langle F\rangle/dt|$ with which the mean value of a generic
quantum observable $F$ can change with respect to the width $\Delta_F$ of its
uncertainty distribution (square root of $F$ fluctuations). A useful practical
consequence is that in unitary dynamics the states with longer lifetimes are
those with smaller energy uncertainty $\Delta_H$ (square root of energy
fluctuations). Here we show that when unitary evolution is complemented with a
steepest-entropy-ascent model of dissipation, the resulting nonlinear master
equation entails that these lower bounds get modified and depend also on the
entropy uncertainty $\Delta_S$ (square root of entropy fluctuations). For
example, we obtain the time-energy--and--time-entropy uncertainty relation
$(2\tau_{F}\Delta_H/ \hbar)^2+(\tau_{F}\Delta_S/{k_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle

that for each given state defines the strength of the nonunitary,
steepest-entropy-ascent part of the assumed master equation. For purely
dissipative dynamics this reduces to the time-entropy uncertainty relation
$\tau_{F}\Delta_S\ge {k_{\rm\scriptscriptstyle B}}\tau$, meaning that the
nonequilibrium dissipative states with longer lifetime are those with smaller
entropy uncertainty $\Delta_S$.

human test performance. In this work, we investigate how Gestalt visual
reasoning on the Raven's test can be modeled using generative image inpainting
techniques from computer vision. We demonstrate that a self-supervised

score of 27/36 on the Colored Progressive Matrices, which corresponds to
average performance for nine-year-old children. We also show that models

may explain why intelligence tests like the Raven's are often sensitive to

transport, micro-organisms like bacteria, or animals moving within and
responding to their environment. For example, in cells the movement of
vesicles, organelles and other cargo are affected by their binding to and
unbinding from cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules through molecular
motor proteins. A typical goal of theoretical or numerical analysis of models
of such systems is to investigate the effective transport properties and their
dependence on model parameters. While the effective velocity of particles
undergoing switching diffusion is often easily characterized in terms of the
long-time fraction of time that particles spend in each state, the calculation
of the effective diffusivity is more complicated because it cannot be expressed
simply in terms of a statistical average of the particle transport state at one
moment of time. However, it is common that these systems are regenerative, in
the sense that they can be decomposed into independent cycles marked by returns
to a base state. Using decompositions of this kind, we calculate effective
transport properties by computing the moments of the dynamics within each cycle
and then applying renewal-reward theory. This method provides a useful
alternative large-time analysis to direct homogenization for linear
advection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equation models. Moreover, it
applies to a general class of semi-Markov processes and certain stochastic
differential equations that arise in models of intracellular transport.
Applications of the proposed framework are illustrated for case studies such as
mRNA transport in developing oocytes and processive cargo movement by teams of
motor proteins.

such games, the players' utility functions cannot be described analytically, as
they are given through a black-box simulator that can be queried to obtain
noisy estimates of the utilities. This is the case in many real-world games in
which a complete description of the elements involved is not available upfront,
such as complex military settings and online auctions. In these situations, one
usually needs to run costly simulation processes to get an accurate estimate of
the game outcome. As a result, solving these games begets the challenge of
designing learning algorithms that can find (approximate) equilibria with high
confidence, using as few simulator queries as possible. Moreover, since running
the simulator during the game is unfeasible, the algorithms must first perform
a pure exploration learning phase and, then, use the (approximate) equilibrium
learned this way to play the game. In this work, we focus on two-player
zero-sum games with infinite strategy spaces. Drawing from the best arm
identification literature, we design two algorithms with theoretical guarantees
to learn maximin strategies in these games. The first one works in the
fixed-confidence setting, guaranteeing the desired confidence level while
minimizing the number of queries. Instead, the second algorithm fits the
fixed-budget setting, maximizing the confidence without exceeding the given
maximum number of queries. First, we formally prove {\delta}-PAC theoretical
guarantees for our algorithms under some regularity assumptions, which are
encoded by letting the utility functions be drawn from a Gaussian process.
Then, we experimentally evaluate our techniques on a testbed made of randomly

displacement of diffusing particles evolves linearly with time whereas the
distribution of their displacements is Gaussian. However, recent experiments on
mesoscopic particle systems have discovered Brownian yet non-Gaussian regimes
where diffusion coexists with an exponential tail in the distribution of
displacements. Here we show that, contrary to the present theoretical
understanding, the length scale $\lambda$ associated to this exponential
distribution does not necessarily scale in a diffusive way. Simulations of
Lennard- Jones systems reveal a behavior $\lambda \sim t^{1/3}$ in three
dimensions and $\lambda \sim t^{1/2}$ in two dimensions. We propose a scaling
theory based on the idea of hopping motion to explain this result. In contrast,
simulations of a tetrahedral gelling system, where particles interact by a
non-isotropic potential, yield a temperature-dependent scaling of $\lambda$. We
interpret this behavior in terms of an intermittent hopping motion. Our
findings link the Brownian yet non-Gaussian phenomenon with generic features of
glassy dynamics and open new experimental perspectives on the class of
molecular and supramolecular systems whose dynamics is ruled by rare events.

contribute significantly to the abundances of the lighter heavy elements,

asymmetric yields correspondingly also deposit into the lanthanide region, we
consider the possible evidence for co-production by comparing our

metal-poor stars rich in $r$-process material. We show that for $r$-process
enhanced stars palladium over europium and silver over europium display mostly
flat trends suggestive of co-production and compare to the lanthanum over

enhanced oscillation of the elastic $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C cross section at backward
angles is due mainly to the elastic $\alpha$ transfer or the core exchange.
Such a process gives rise to a parity-dependent term in the total elastic
$S$-matrix, an indication of the parity dependence of the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C
optical potential (OP).
  Purpose: To explicitly determine the core exchange potential (CEP) induced by
the symmetric exchange of the two $^{12}$C cores in the elastic
$^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering at $E_{\rm lab}= 132$ and 300 MeV, and explore its
parity dependence.
  Method: $S$-matrix generated by CRC description of the elastic
$^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering is used as the input for the inversion calculation
to obtain the effective local OP that contains both the Wigner and Majorana
terms.
  Results: The high-precision inversion results show a strong contribution by
the complex Majorana term in the total OP of the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C system, and
thus provide for the first time a direct estimation of the parity-dependent
CEP.
  Conclusions: The elastic $\alpha$ transfer or exchange of the two $^{12}$C
cores in the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C system gives rise to a complex parity dependence
of the total OP. This should be a general feature of the OP for the light
heavy-ion systems that contain two identical cores.

parameters are underestimated; this is a consequence of choosing to fit the
logarithm of the averaged power. We defer fixing this problem as it is well
understood and not significant for measuring flows in the solar interior. The
scatter in the fit parameters from the Monte-Carlo simulations is well-modeled
by the formal error estimates from the code. Conclusions: We document and
demonstrate a reliable multi-ridge fitting method for ring-diagram analysis.
The differences between the updated fitting results and the original results
are less than one order of magnitude and therefore we suspect that the changes
will not eliminate the aforementioned orders-of-magnitude discrepancy in the
amplitude of convective flows in the solar interior.

the visual appearance of a person into latent discriminative factors at

In this paper, we propose CoPro, a novel formulation of feature-interaction

from that, we develop an efficient feature-interaction aware configuration
prioritization technique for a configurable system by ranking the
configurations according to their total number of potential bugs. We conducted
several experiments to evaluate CoPro on the ability to detect
configuration-related bugs in a public benchmark. We found that CoPro
outperforms the state-of-the-art configuration prioritization techniques when

the buggy configurations at the top 3 positions in the resulting list.
Interestingly, CoPro is able to detect 17 not-yet-discovered

Merlin-Arthur proof systems (QMA), the quantum analogue of NP. Our central
contribution is proving a longstanding conjecture that the Consistency of Local
Density Matrices (CLDM) problem is QMA-hard under Karp reductions. The input of
CLDM consists of local reduced density matrices on sets of at most k qubits,
and the problem asks if there is an n-qubit global quantum state that is
consistent with all of the k-qubit local density matrices. The containment of
this problem in QMA and the QMA-hardness under Turing reductions were proved by
Liu [APPROX-RANDOM 2006]. Liu also conjectured that CLDM is QMA-hard under Karp
reductions, which is desirable for applications, and we finally prove this
conjecture. We establish this result using the techniques of simulatable codes
of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS 2019], simplifying their proofs and
tailoring them to the context of QMA.
  In order to develop applications of CLDM, we propose a framework that we call
locally simulatable proofs for QMA: this provides QMA proofs that can be
efficiently verified by probing only k qubits and, furthermore, the reduced
density matrix of any k-qubit subsystem of an accepting witness can be computed
in polynomial time, independently of the witness. Within this framework, we
show advances in quantum zero-knowledge. We show the first commit-and-open
computational zero-knowledge proof system for all of QMA, as a quantum analogue
of a ""sigma"" protocol. We then define a Proof of Quantum Knowledge, which
guarantees that a prover is effectively in possession of a quantum witness in
an interactive proof, and show that our zero-knowledge proof system satisfies
this definition. Finally, we show that our proof system can be used to
establish that QMA has a quantum non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system in
the secret parameter setting.

simultaneously often require the fitting of a computational complex signal
model defined through the Bloch equations. Repeated Bloch simulations can be
avoided by matching the measured signal with a precomputed signal dictionary on
a discrete parameter grid, as used in MR Fingerprinting. However, accurate
estimation requires discretizing each parameter with a high resolution and
consequently high computational and memory costs for dictionary generation,
storage, and matching. Here, we reduce the required parameter resolution by
approximating the signal between grid points through B-spline interpolation.
The interpolant and its gradient are evaluated efficiently which enables a
least-squares fitting method for parameter mapping. The resolution of each
parameter was minimized while obtaining a user-specified interpolation
accuracy. The method was evaluated by phantom and in-vivo experiments using
fully-sampled and undersampled unbalanced (FISP) MR fingerprinting
acquisitions. Bloch simulations incorporated relaxation effects ($T_1,T_2$),
proton density ($PD$), receiver phase ($\phi_0$), transmit field inhomogeneity
($B_1^+$), and slice profile. Parameter maps were compared with those obtained
from dictionary matching, where the parameter resolution was chosen to obtain
similar signal (interpolation) accuracy. For both the phantom and the in-vivo
acquisition, the proposed method approximated the parameter maps obtained
through dictionary matching while reducing the parameter resolution in each
dimension ($T_1,T_2,B_1^+$) by, on average, an order of magnitude. In effect,
the applied dictionary was reduced from 1.47 GB to 464 KB. Dictionary fitting
with B-spline interpolation reduces the computational and memory costs of
dictionary-based methods and is therefore a promising method for
multi-parametric mapping.

is important to search efficiently with as low budget as possible. Bayesian
optimization is an efficient method for black-box optimization and provides
exploration-exploitation trade-off by constructing a surrogate model that

In this study, we develop a heuristic method refining the search space for
Bayesian optimization when the available evaluation budget is low. The proposed

Bayesian optimization can be executed with the promising region as the initial

Measuring magnetic and electronic properties at the atomic length scales would
provide crucial insight, but this is yet to be experimentally achieved. Here we
use spectroscopic-imaging spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM)
to visualize periodic spin-resolved modulations originating from the AF order

Crucially, we discover that the short-range AF order is locally uncorrelated

between images is of paramount importance for virtually all of computer vision.
Annotating the quadratic number of pairwise relations between training images
is simply not feasible, while unsupervised inference is prone to noise, thus
leaving the vast majority of these relations to be unreliable. To nevertheless
find those relations which can be reliably utilized for learning, we follow a
divide-and-conquer strategy: We find reliable similarities by extracting
compact groups of images and reliable dissimilarities by partitioning these
groups into subsets, converting the complicated overall problem into few
reliable local subproblems. For each of the subsets we obtain a representation
by learning a mapping to a target feature space so that their reliable
relations are kept. Transitivity relations between the subsets are then
exploited to consolidate the local solutions into a concerted global
representation. While iterating between grouping, partitioning, and learning,
we can successively use more and more reliable relations which, in turn,
improves our image representation. In experiments, our approach shows
state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised classification on ImageNet with
46.0% and competes favorably on different transfer learning tasks on PASCAL

The case of a multimode fiber which is also a gain medium presents further
intriguing prospects for control, due to the possibility of wavefront shaping
not only the signal light amplified by the medium, but also the pump light
absorbed within it. Provided that the lightwave used for pumping is coherent,
its shaping prior to injection will affect the complex, speckle-like spatial
patterns of excitation within the amplifier volume, which in turn will act upon
the signal as heterogeneous gain. We introduce a new theoretical model which
captures the essential features of a multimode amplifying fiber pumped by a
coherent beam with configurable modal content, allowing the calculation of the
gain-dependent transmission matrix. We numerically implement our model to
explore the extent to which one may control the amplified light in the
spatial-domain, by shaping the pump; we demonstrate a significant ability of
manipulation, as well as several interesting physical mechanisms limiting it.
In particular, we show how taking into account the cross-contributions between
all guided modes within the fiber is essential for understanding the full range

to a test of first row unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix.
The reason is that a CKM unitarity test involves only two parameters, while the
degrees of freedom for the assessment of the goodness-of-fit of the
universality of the Cabibbo angle entailed by the Standard Model (SM) is equal
to the number of measurements minus one. Beyond the SM all different processes
could in principle give different Cabibbo angles. Consequently, the difference
between the two tests becomes relevant starting from three observables giving
results for the Cabibbo angle that are in tension with each other. With current
data, depending on the treatment of the nuclear $\beta$ decays, we find that
New Physics is favored over the SM at $5.1\,\sigma$ or $3.6\,\sigma$ while CKM
unitarity is rejected at $4.8\sigma$ or $3.0\sigma$, respectively. We argue
that the best method to test the SM is to test the equality of the Cabibbo

momentum in a convective boundary layer. The detailed understanding of their
structure is of fundamental interest for a range of applications, from
wall-bounded engineering flows to quantifying surface-atmosphere flux
exchanges. We address the aspect of Reynolds stress anisotropy associated with
the intermittent nature of heat transport in thermal plumes by performing an
invariant analysis of the Reynolds stress tensor in an unstable atmospheric
surface layer flow, using a field-experimental dataset. Given the intermittent
and asymmetric nature of the turbulent heat flux, we formulate this problem in
an event-based framework. In this approach, we provide structural descriptions
of warm-updraft and cold-downdraft events and investigate the degree of
isotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor within these events of different sizes.
We discover that only a subset of these events are associated with the least
anisotropic turbulence in highly-convective conditions. Additionally,
intermittent large heat flux events are found to contribute substantially to
turbulence anisotropy under unstable stratification. Moreover, we find that the
sizes related to the maximum value of the degree of isotropy do not correspond
to the peak positions of the heat flux distributions. This is because, the
vertical velocity fluctuations pertaining to the sizes associated with the
maximum heat flux, transport significant amount of streamwise momentum. A
preliminary investigation shows that the sizes of the least anisotropic events
probably scale with a mixed-length scale ($z^{0.5}\lambda^{0.5}$, where $z$ is
the measurement height and $\lambda$ is the large-eddy length scale).

work develops a framework that achieves two chief objectives: i) to tightly
characterize the PoA for such scenarios, and ii) to do so through a tractable

enhancement of temperature. We show that these effects are pronounced at both

zones, at a certain investigation level, where a point-referenced event under

are usually referred to as hotspots, is essential in certain fields such as
criminology, epidemiology or traffic safety. Traditionally, hotspot detection
procedures have been developed over areal units of analysis. Although working
at this spatial scale can be suitable enough for many research or practical
purposes, detecting hotspots at a more accurate level (for instance, at the
road segment level) may be more convenient sometimes. Furthermore, it is
typical that hotspot detection procedures are entirely focused on the
determination of zones where an event is (overall) highly concentrated. It is
less common, by far, that such procedures prioritize the location of zones
where a specific type of event is overrepresented in relation to the other
types observed, which have been denoted as differential risk hotspots. The R
package DRHotNet provides several functionalities to facilitate the detection
of differential risk hotspots along a linear network. In this paper, DRHotNet
is depicted and its usage in the R console is shown through a detailed analysis

decontamination, that corrects for sample contamination by utilizing the
observed cross-correlations in the contaminated samples; this corrects any
correlation function estimator for contamination. Using this formalism, we
present a new estimator that uses the standard estimator to measure correlation
functions in the contaminated samples but then corrects for contamination. We
also introduce a weighted estimator that assigns each galaxy a weight in each
redshift bin based on its probability of being in that bin. We demonstrate that
these estimators effectively recover the true correlation functions and their
covariance matrices. Our estimators can correct for sample contamination caused
by misclassification between object types as well as photometric redshifts;
they should be particularly helpful for studies of galaxy evolution and
baryonic acoustic oscillations, where forward-modeling the clustering signal

that correspond to different level of homogenization. These are the situations
where one or more of the inertial time scale(s), the memory time scale(s) and
the noise correlation time scale(s) of the systems are taken to zero. We find
that, unless one restricts to special situations that do not break symmetry of
the Onsager matrix associated with the fast dynamics, it is generally not
possible to express the effective evolution of these functionals solely in
terms of trajectory of the homogenized process describing the system dynamics
via the widely adopted Stratonovich convention. In fact, an anomalous term is
often needed for a complete description, implying that convergence of these
functionals needs more information than simply the limit of the dynamical
process. We trace the origin of such impossibility to area anomaly, thereby
linking the symmetry breaking and area anomaly. This hold important
consequences for many nonequilibrium systems that can be modeled by generalized
Langevin equations. Our convergence results hold in a strong pathwise sense.

gravity, are directed graphs whose links are labeled by irreducible
representations of SU(2), or spins. Cosmic strings are 1-dimensional
topological defects carrying distributional curvature in an otherwise flat
spacetime. In this paper we prove that the classical phase space of spin
networks coupled to cosmic strings may obtained as a straightforward
discretization of general relativity in 3+1 spacetime dimensions. We decompose
the continuous spatial geometry into 3-dimensional cells, which are dual to a
spin network graph in a unique and well-defined way. Assuming that the geometry
may only be probed by holonomies (or Wilson loops) located on the spin network,
we truncate the geometry such that the cells become flat and the curvature is
concentrated at the edges of the cells, which we then interpret as a network of
cosmic strings. The discrete phase space thus describes a spin network coupled
to cosmic strings. This work proves that the relation between gravity and spin
networks exists not only at the quantum level, but already at the classical
level. Two appendices provide detailed derivations of the Ashtekar formulation
of gravity as a Yang-Mills theory and the distributional geometry of cosmic
strings in this formulation.

availability of training data in the form of paired low resolution (LR) and
high resolution (HR) images or the knowledge of the downgrading operator
(usually bicubic downscaling). While the proposed methods perform well on
standard benchmarks, they often fail to produce convincing results in
real-world settings. This is because real-world images can be subject to
corruptions such as sensor noise, which are severely altered by bicubic
downscaling. Therefore, the models never see a real-world image during
training, which limits their generalization capabilities. Moreover, it is
cumbersome to collect paired LR and HR images in the same source domain.
  To address this problem, we propose DSGAN to introduce natural image
characteristics in bicubically downscaled images. It can be trained in an
unsupervised fashion on HR images, thereby generating LR images with the same
characteristics as the original images. We then use the generated data to train
a SR model, which greatly improves its performance on real-world images.
Furthermore, we propose to separate the low and high image frequencies and
treat them differently during training. Since the low frequencies are preserved
by downsampling operations, we only require adversarial training to modify the
high frequencies. This idea is applied to our DSGAN model as well as the SR
model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several experiments
through quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our solution is the winner of
the AIM Challenge on Real World SR at ICCV 2019.

column densities (N(H_2)>=10^18 cm-2) in five out of eleven systems, three of
which are reported here for the first time. We compare the chemical properties
of this sample of ESDLAs, supplemented with literature measurements, to that of
DLAs located at the redshift of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB-DLAs). We
confirm that the two populations are almost indistinguishable in terms of
chemical enrichment, H_2 column density and gas kinematics. All this suggests
that ESDLAs and GRB-DLAs probe similar galactic environments. We search for the
galaxy counterparts of ESDLAs and find associated emission lines in three out
of eleven systems, two of which are reported here for the first time (towards
the quasars SDSS J002503.03+114547.80 and SDSS J114347.21+142021.60,
respectively). The measured separations between the quasar sightlines and the
emission associated with the ESDLA galaxy are all very small (rho < 3 kpc).
While the small impact parameters are similar to what is observed for GRB-DLAs,
the associated star-formation rates are on average lower than seen for GRB host
galaxies. This is explained by long-duration GRBs being associated with the
death of massive stars, hence pinpointing regions of active star formation in
the GRB host galaxies. Our observations support the suggestion from the
literature that ESDLAs could act as blind analogues of GRB-DLAs, probing high
column density neutral gas in the heart of high-redshift galaxies, without any
prior on the instantaneous star-formation rate.

matter (DM) distribution is strongly enhanced, offering opportunities for
astrophysical tests. Such an enhancement can be produced by a period of
pre-nucleosynthesis early matter domination (EMD). This cosmology arises in
many ultraviolet completions and generates the correct relic abundance for weak

We study the interplay between the initial ALP oscillation, reheating
temperature, and effective pressure to provide analytic estimates of the
minicluster abundance and properties. ALP miniclusters in the EMD cosmology are
denser and more abundant than in $\Lambda$CDM. While enhanced substructure

where a perturbative approach allows analytic progress to be made, and we

that when smoothed over a large region around the observer, conditioning on the
local density typically affects density power spectra by less than a percent at
cosmological distances, below cosmic variance. We find that while typical
corrections to the lensing angular power spectrum can be at the 10% level on
the largest angular scales and for source redshifts $z_s \lesssim 0.1$, for the
typical redshifts targeted by upcoming wide imaging surveys the corrections are
sub-percent and negligible, in contrast to previous claims in the literature.

While the MF rarely exceeds 60% in all three simulations, over 80% of all
protostars are part of a binary system at some point. We additionally find that
the distribution of binary spin mis-alignment angles is consistent with a
randomized distribution. In all three simulations, several binaries originate
with wide separations and dynamically evolve to <~ $10^2$ AU separations. We
show that a simple model of mass accretion and dynamical friction with the gas
can explain this orbital evolution.

several kpc of galactic disk mid-planes consists of warm clouds embedded within
a hot wind. A theoretical understanding of the outflow phenomenon, including
both winds and fountain flows, requires study of the interactions among thermal
phases. We develop a method to quantify these interactions via measurements of
mass, momentum, and energy flux exchanges using temporally and spatially
averaged quantities and conservation laws. We apply this method to a
star-forming ISM MHD simulation based on the TIGRESS framework, for Solar
neighbourhood conditions. To evaluate the extent of interactions among the
phases, we first examine the validity of the ``ballistic model,'' which
predicts trajectories of the warm phase ($5050\,\rm{K}<T<2\times10^4\,\rm{K}$)
treated as non-interacting clouds. This model is successful at intermediate
vertical velocities ($ 50$ km s$^{-1}$ $\lesssim |v_z| \lesssim 100 $ km
s$^{-1}$), but at higher velocities we observe an excess in simulated warm
outflow compared to the ballistic model. This discrepancy cannot be fully
accounted for by cooling of high-velocity intermediate-temperature
($2\times10^4\,\rm{K}<T<5\times10^5\,\rm{K}$) gas. By examining the fluxes of
mass, momentum and energy, we conclude that warm phase gains mass via cooling
of the intermediate phase, while momentum transfer occurs from the hot
($T>5\times10^5\,\rm{K}$) to the warm phase. The large energy flux from the hot
outflow that is transferred to the warm and intermediate phases is quickly
radiated away. A simple interaction model implies an effective warm cloud size
in the fountain flow of a few 100~pc, showing that warm-hot flux exchange
mainly involves a few large clouds rather than many small ones.

environmental properties might have contributed to the production of these very
high-energy photons, or if it is solely related to the released GRB emission.
The relatively low redshift of the GRB (z=0.425) allows us to study the host
galaxy of this event in detail, and to potentially identify idiosyncrasies that
could point to progenitor characteristics or environmental properties
responsible for such a unique event. We use ultraviolet, optical, infrared and
submillimetre imaging and spectroscopy obtained with HST, VLT and ALMA to
obtain an extensive dataset on which the analysis of the host galaxy is based.
The host system is composed of a close pair of interacting galaxies (Delta v =
50 km s^-1), both of which are well-detected by ALMA in CO(3-2). The GRB
occurred within the nuclear region (~170 pc from the centre) of the less
massive but more star-forming galaxy of the pair. The host is more massive
(log(M/M_odot)=9.3) than average GRB hosts at that redshift and the location of
the GRB is rather unique. The enhanced star-formation rate was probably
triggered by tidal interactions between the two galaxies. Our ALMA observations
indicate that both host galaxy and companion have a high molecular gas
fraction, as has been observed before in interacting galaxy pairs. The location
of the GRB within the core of an interacting galaxy with an extinguished
line-of-sight is indicative of a denser environment than typically observed for

a unified understanding of these dramatic effects. The slow dynamical behavior
is shown to be related to the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics. We
demonstrate that it is quantitatively captured for long time scales by
effective Hamiltonians exhibiting Stark localization of excitations and weak
growth of the entanglement entropy for arbitrary coupling strength. This
analysis explains the phenomenology of real-time string dynamics investigated

derive robust constraints on cosmological parameters. Rising evidence from

predicted by cosmological simulations.
  We analyse more than 300 simulated massive clusters, from `The Three Hundred
Project', and investigate the connection between mass bias and several
diagnostics extracted from synthetic X-ray images of these simulated clusters.
  We find that the azimuthal scatter measured in 12 sectors of the X-ray flux
maps is a statistically significant indication of the presence of an intrinsic
(i.e. 3D) clumpy gas distribution. We verify that a robust correction to the
hydrostatic mass bias can be inferred when estimates of the gas inhomogeneity
from X-ray maps (such as the azimuthal scatter or the gas ellipticity) are
combined with the asymptotic external slope of the gas density or pressure
profiles, which can be respectively derived from X-ray and millimetric
(Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) observations.
  We also obtain that mass measurements based on either gas density and
temperature or gas density and pressure result in similar distributions of the
mass bias. In both cases, we provide corrections that help reduce both the
dispersion and skewness of the mass bias distribution. These are effective even
when irregular clusters are included leading to interesting implications for
the modelling and correction of hydrostatic mass bias in cosmological analyses
of current and future X-ray and SZ cluster surveys.

growth, but most theories are phase averaged and cannot predict wave shape.
Most laboratory and numerical studies similarly focus on wave growth. A few
laboratory experiments have demonstrated that wind can change wave shape, and
two-phase numerical simulations have also noted wind-induced wave shape
changes. However, wind's effect on wave shape is poorly understood, and no
theory for it exists. For weakly nonlinear waves, wave shape parameters are the
phase of the harmonic relative to the primary frequency (or harmonic phase HP,
zero for a Stokes wave) and relative amplitude of the harmonic to the primary.
Here, surface pressure profiles (denoted Jeffreys, Miles, and Generalized
Miles) are prescribed based on wind-wave generation theories. Theoretical
solutions are derived for quasi-periodic progressive waves and the wind-induced
changes to HP, relative harmonic amplitude, as well as already known phase
speed changes and growth rates. The wave shape parameters depend upon the
chosen surface pressure profile, pressure magnitude and phase relative to the
wave profile, and the nondimensional depth. Wave asymmetry is linked to the
nondimensional growth rate. Atmospheric large eddy simulations constrain
pressure profile parameters. HP predictions are qualitatively consistent with
laboratory observations. This theory, together with the observables of HP and
relative harmonic amplitude, can provide insight into the actual wave surface
pressure profile.

hybridization. Moreover, the pseudogap present in the low doping regime is also
affected by the hybridization. The results show that both the doping and the
hybridization act in the sense of suppresses the pseudogap. Therefore, the
systematic investigation of the Fermi surface topology, shows that not only the
doping but also the hybridization can be considered as a control parameter for
both the pseudogap and the Lifshitz transition. Assuming that the hybridization
is sensitive to external pressure, the present results agree qualitatively with
recent experimental data for the cuprate Nd-LSCO.

  Tasks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task where agents learn to navigate
following natural language instructions. The key to this task is to perceive
both the visual scene and natural language sequentially. Conventional
approaches exploit the vision and language features in cross-modal grounding.
However, the VLN task remains challenging, since previous works have neglected
the rich semantic information contained in the environment (such as implicit
navigation graphs or sub-trajectory semantics). In this paper, we introduce
Auxiliary Reasoning Navigation (AuxRN), a framework with four self-supervised
auxiliary reasoning tasks to take advantage of the additional training signals
derived from the semantic information. The auxiliary tasks have four reasoning
objectives: explaining the previous actions, estimating the navigation
progress, predicting the next orientation, and evaluating the trajectory
consistency. As a result, these additional training signals help the agent to
acquire knowledge of semantic representations in order to reason about its
activity and build a thorough perception of the environment. Our experiments
indicate that auxiliary reasoning tasks improve both the performance of the
main task and the model generalizability by a large margin. Empirically, we
demonstrate that an agent trained with self-supervised auxiliary reasoning
tasks substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, being the
best existing approach on the standard benchmark.

turbulence at these levels allows large scale dynamo modes to grow, and the
saturation level is determined by the amount of net helicity remaining in the
dynamo-active regions (a.k.a. the quenching problem). %We demonstrate that the

where two transmitters wish to convey a message to a receiver under the
assumption of causal and imperfect channel state information at transmitters
(CSIT) and imperfect channel state information at receiver (CSIR). In order to
emphasize the limitation of transmitter cooperation between physically
distributed nodes, we focus on the so-called distributed CSIT assumption, i.e.
where each transmitter has its individual channel knowledge, while the message
can be assumed to be partially or entirely shared a priori between transmitters
by exploiting some on-board memory. Under this setup, the first part of the
paper characterizes the common message capacity of the channel at hand for
arbitrary CSIT and CSIR structure. The optimal scheme builds on Shannon
strategies, i.e. optimal codes are constructed by letting the channel inputs be
a function of current CSIT only. For a special case when CSIT is a
deterministic function of CSIR, the considered scheme also achieves the
capacity region of a common message and two private messages. The second part
addresses an important instance of the previous general result in a context of
a cooperative multi-antenna Gaussian channel under i.i.d. fading operating in
frequency-division duplex mode, such that CSIT is acquired via an explicit
feedback of perfect CSIR. The capacity of the channel at hand is achieved by
distributed linear precoding applied to Gaussian codes. Surprisingly, we

solution as well as the leading left and right eigenfunctions of its
linearization. We investigate the asymptotics of these ingredients, and utility
of the resulting approximations of the strength-extent curves, in the slow-fast

the asymptotics of the left and right eigenspaces are distinct. In particular,
the slow component of the left eigenfunction corresponding to the translational
symmetry does not become negligible in the asymptotic limit. This has a
significant detrimental effect on the critical curve predictions. The theory as
formulated previously uses an heuristic to address a difficulty related to the
translational invariance. We describe two alternatives to that heuristic, which
do not use the misbehaving eigenfunction component. These new heuristics show
much better predictive properties, including in the asymptotic limit, in all

redshifts of z = 0.05-1.75 and masses of $M_{500,c}=2\times10^{13}-10^{15}$
M$_\odot$ Specifically, we measure the relationship between the BCG+ICL stellar
mass $M_\star$ and $M_{500,c}$ at projected radii 10 < r < 100 kpc for three
different epochs. At intermediate redshift (z = 0.40), where we have the best
data, we find $M_\star\propto M_{500,c}^{0.48\pm0.06}$. Fixing the exponent of
this power law for all redshifts, we constrain the normalization of this
relation to be $2.08\pm0.21$ times higher at z = 0.40 than at high redshift (z
= 1.55). We find no change in the relation from intermediate to low redshift (z
= 0.10). In other words, for fixed $M_{500,c}$, $M_\star$ at 10 < r < 100 kpc
increases from z = 1.55 to z = 0.40 and not significantly thereafter.
Theoretical models predict that the physical mass growth of the cluster from z
= 1.5 to z = 0 within $r_{500,c}$ is a factor of 1.4, excluding evolution due
to definition of $r_{500,c}$. We find that $M_\star$ within the central 100 kpc
increases by a factor of 3.8 over the same period. Thus, the growth of
$M_\star$ in this central region is more than a factor of two greater than the
physical mass growth of the cluster as a whole. Furthermore, the concentration
of the BCG+ICL stellar mass, defined by the ratio of stellar mass within 10 kpc
to the total stellar mass within 100 kpc, decreases with increasing $M_{500,c}$
at all redshift. We interpret this result as evidence for inside-out growth of
the BCG+ICL over the past ten Gyrs, with stellar mass assembly occuring at
larger radii at later times.

persistent photoconductivity with unique characteristics: it occurs at room

SrTiO$_3$ crystals at room temperature with sub-bandgap light reduces the
electrical resistance by three orders of magnitude and persists for weeks or

Experiments indicate that oxygen vacancy and hydrogen play important roles, yet
the microscopic mechanism responsible for this remarkable effect has remained
unidentified. Using hybrid density functional theory calculations we show that
an instability associated with substitutional hydrogen H$_{\rm O}^+$ under
illumination, which becomes doubly ionized and leaves the oxygen site, can
explain the experimental observations. H$_{\rm O}$ then turns into an
interstitial hydrogen and an oxygen vacancy, leading to excess carriers in the
conduction band. This phenomenon is not exclusive to SrTiO$_3$, but it is also
predicted to occur in other oxides. Interestingly, this phenomenon represents
an elegant way of proving the existence of hydrogen substituting on an oxygen
site (H$_{\rm O}$), forming an interesting, and rarely observed, type of

particularly in the design of commercial air transportation vehicles.
Computational fluid dynamics models of transonic flow for aerospace
applications are computationally expensive to solve because of the high degrees
of freedom as well as the coupled nature of the conservation laws. While these
issues pose a bottleneck for the use of such models in aerospace design,
computational costs can be significantly minimized by constructing special,
structure-preserving surrogate models called reduced-order models. Such models
are known to incur huge off-line costs, however, which can sometimes outweigh
their potential benefits. Furthermore, their prediction accuracy is known to be
poor under transonic flow conditions. In this work, we propose a machine
learning method to construct reduced-order models via deep neural networks, and
we demonstrate its ability to preserve accuracy with significantly lower
offline and online costs. In addition, our machine learning methodology is
physics-informed and constrained through the utilization of an interpretable
encoding by way of proper orthogonal decomposition. Application to the inviscid
transonic flow past the RAE2822 airfoil under varying freestream Mach numbers
and angles of attack, as well as airfoil shape parameters with a deforming
mesh, shows that the proposed approach adapts to high-dimensional parameter
variation well. Notably, the proposed framework precludes knowledge of
numerical operators utilized in the data generation phase, thereby
demonstrating its potential utility in fast exploration of design space for
diverse engineering applications.

centerstage for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a joint ESA/NASA
gravitational wave observatory set to launch in 2034. Here, we continue our
work to characterize SMBH binary formation and evolution through increasingly
more realistic high resolution direct $N$-body simulations, focusing on the
effect of SMBH mass ratio, orientation, and eccentricity within a rotating and
flattened stellar host. During the dynamical friction phase, we found a
prolonged orbital decay for retrograde SMBHs and swift pairing timescales for
prograde SMBHs compared to their counterparts in non-rotating models, an effect
that becomes more pronounced for smaller mass ratios $M_{\rm sec}/M_{\rm prim}
= q$. During this pairing phase, the eccentricity dramatically increases for
retrograde configurations, but as the binary forms, the orbital plane flips so
that it is almost perfectly prograde, which stifles the rapid eccentricity
growth. In prograde configurations, SMBH binaries form and remain at
comparatively low eccentricities. As in our prior work, we note that the center
of mass of a prograde SMBH binary itself settles into an orbit about the center
of the galaxy. Since even the initially retrograde binaries flip their orbital
plane, we expect few binaries in rotating systems to reside at rest in the
dynamic center of the host galaxy, though this effect is smaller as $q$
decreases.

especially useful in an iterative setup, where source estimates from an initial

show that an ISP improves accuracy by 4.6%-12.2% on MobileNet architectures of

because the memory and computational costs of the ISP is minimal compared to
the cost of using a larger CNN to achieve the same accuracy.

complicated. Despite a great amount of efforts devoted to understanding the
behavior of tracking algorithms, reliable and quantifiable ways for studying
the per factor tracking behavior remain barely available. Addressing this
issue, in this paper we contribute to the community a tracking diagnosis
toolkit, TracKlinic, for diagnosis of challenge factors of tracking algorithms.
  TracKlinic consists of two novel components focusing on the data and analysis
aspects, respectively. For the data component, we carefully prepare a set of
2,390 annotated videos, each involving one and only one major challenge factor.
When analyzing an algorithm for a specific challenge factor, such
one-factor-per-sequence rule greatly inhibits the disturbance from other
factors and consequently leads to more faithful analysis. For the analysis
component, given the tracking results on all sequences, it investigates the
behavior of the tracker under each individual factor and generates the report
automatically. With TracKlinic, a thorough study is conducted on ten
state-of-the-art trackers on nine challenge factors (including two compound
ones). The results suggest that, heavy shape variation and occlusion are the
two most challenging factors faced by most trackers. Besides, out-of-view,

Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosities (\textbf{ICND}) is
considered in both the whole space and the periodic domain. First, for the
corresponding Cauchy problem, when shear and bulk viscosity coefficients are
both given as a constant multiple of the density's power ($\rho^\delta$ with
$0<\delta<1$), based on some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic
singular structures, we show that the $L^\infty$ norm of the deformation tensor
$D(u)$ and the $L^6$ norm of $\nabla \rho^{\delta-1}$ control the possible
breakdown of regular solutions with far field vacuum. This conclusion means
that if a solution with far field vacuum of the \textbf{ICND} system is
initially regular and loses its regularity at some later time, then the
formation of singularity must be caused by losing the bound of $D(u)$ or
$\nabla \rho^{\delta-1}$ as the critical time approaches. Second, under the
additional assumption that the shear and second viscosities (respectively
$\mu(\rho)$ and $\lambda(\rho)$) satisfy the BD relation
$\lambda(\rho)=2(\mu'(\rho)\rho-\mu(\rho))$, if we consider the corresponding
problem in some periodic domain and the initial density is away from the
vacuum, it can be proved that the possible breakdown of classical solutions can
be controlled only by the $L^\infty$ norm of $D(u)$. It is worth pointing out
that, except the conclusions mentioned above, another purpose of the current
paper is to show how to understand the intrinsic singular structures of the
fluid system considered now, and then how to develop the corresponding

weights for the unique regular solution with finite energy.

three to five machines. This is because these protocols seem to suffer from a
sharp performance decay. More specifically, as the size of a deployment---i.e.,
degree of replication---increases, the protocol performance greatly decreases.
There is not much experimental evidence for this decay in practice, however,
notably for larger system sizes, e.g., beyond a handful of machines.
  In this paper we execute agreement protocols on up to 100 machines and
observe on their performance decay. We consider well-known agreement protocols
part of mature systems, such as Apache ZooKeeper, etcd, and BFT-Smart, as well
as a chain and a novel ring-based agreement protocol which we implement
ourselves.
  We provide empirical evidence that current agreement protocols execute
gracefully on 100 machines. We observe that throughput decay is initially sharp
(consistent with previous observations); but intriguingly---as each system
grows beyond a few tens of replicas---the decay dampens. For chain- and
ring-based replication, this decay is slower than for the other systems. The
positive takeaway from our evaluation is that mature agreement protocol
implementations can sustain out-of-the-box 300 to 500 requests per second when
executing on 100 replicas on a wide-area public cloud platform. Chain- and
ring-based replication can reach between 4K and 11K (up to 20x improvements)

for a wide array of tasks such as image classification, object detection,
machine translation, etc. While DL models provide an opportunity to solve
otherwise intractable tasks, their adoption relies on them being optimized to
meet latency and resource requirements. Benchmarking is a key step in this
process but has been hampered in part due to the lack of representative and
up-to-date benchmarking suites. This is exacerbated by the fast-evolving pace
of DL models.
  This paper proposes DLBricks, a composable benchmark generation design that
reduces the effort of developing, maintaining, and running DL benchmarks on
CPUs. DLBricks decomposes DL models into a set of unique runnable networks and
constructs the original model's performance using the performance of the
generated benchmarks. DLBricks leverages two key observations: DL layers are
the performance building blocks of DL models and layers are extensively
repeated within and across DL models. Since benchmarks are generated
automatically and the benchmarking time is minimized, DLBricks can keep
up-to-date with the latest proposed models, relieving the pressure of selecting
representative DL models. Moreover, DLBricks allows users to represent
proprietary models within benchmark suites. We evaluate DLBricks using $50$
MXNet models spanning $5$ DL tasks on $4$ representative CPU systems. We show
that DLBricks provides an accurate performance estimate for the DL models and
reduces the benchmarking time across systems (e.g. within $95\%$ accuracy and
up to $4.4\times$ benchmarking time speedup on Amazon EC2 c5.xlarge).

various geometric transformations of inputs. Recently, Capsule Networks
(CapsNets) have been proposed to tackle this problem. In CapsNets, each entity
is represented by a vector and routed to high-level entity representations by a
dynamic routing algorithm. CapsNets have been shown to be more robust than CNNs
to affine transformations of inputs. However, there is still a huge gap between
their performance on transformed inputs compared to untransformed versions. In
this work, we first revisit the routing procedure by (un)rolling its forward
and backward passes. Our investigation reveals that the routing procedure
contributes neither to the generalization ability nor to the affine robustness
of the CapsNets. Furthermore, we explore the limitations of capsule
transformations and propose affine CapsNets (Aff-CapsNets), which are more
robust to affine transformations. On our benchmark task, where models are
trained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the AffNIST dataset, our
Aff-CapsNets improve the benchmark performance by a large margin (from 79% to
93.21%), without using any routing mechanism.

detection of innocuous perceptible backdoors in DNN image classifiers, wherein
the defender does not have access to the poisoned training set, but only to the
trained classifier, as well as unpoisoned examples. This problem is challenging
because without the poisoned training set, we have no hint about the actual
backdoor pattern used during training. This post-training scenario is also of
great import because in many practical contexts the DNN user did not train the
DNN and does not have access to the training data. We identify two important
properties of perceptible backdoor patterns - spatial invariance and robustness
- based upon which we propose a novel detector using the maximum achievable
misclassification fraction (MAMF) statistic. We detect whether the trained DNN
has been backdoor-attacked and infer the source and target classes. Our
detector outperforms other existing detectors and, coupled with an

results are: (1) The spatial mean-square displacement $<(\Delta r)^2>$ inside

energy $(W)$ larger than $1 MeV$, and it is normal ($a_r=1$) for the heated low
energy $(W< 10 keV)$ electrons. (2) The transport properties of the high energy
particles are closely related with the mean-free path that the particles travel
in-between the scatterers ($\lambda_{sc}$). The smaller $\lambda_{sc}$ is, the
faster the electrons and ions escape from the acceleration volume. (3) The mean
displacement in energy $<\Delta W> \sim t^{a_{W}}$ is strongly enhanced inside
the acceleration volume $(a_W=1.5- 2.5)$ for the high energy particles compared
to the thermal low energy particles ($a_W=0.4$), i.e.\ high energy particles

structure, it normally suffices to treat the incident and scattered neutron
beams as if composed of incoherent distributions of plane waves with
wavevectors of different magnitudes and directions which are taken to define an
instrumental resolution. However, despite the wide-ranging applicability of
this conventional treatment, there are cases in which the wave function of an
individual neutron in the beam must be described more accurately by a spatially
localized packet, in particular with respect to its transverse extent normal to
its mean direction of propagation. One such case involves the creation of
orbital angular momentum (OAM) states in a neutron via interaction with a
material device of a given size. It is shown in the work reported here that
there exist two distinct measures of coherence of special significance and
utility for describing neutron beams in scattering studies of materials in
general. One measure corresponds to the coherent superposition of basis
functions and their wavevectors which constitute each individual neutron packet
state function whereas the other measure can be associated with an incoherent
distribution of mean wavevectors of the individual neutron packets in a beam.
Both the distribution of the mean wavevectors of individual packets in the beam
as well as the wavevector components of the superposition of basis functions
within an individual packet can contribute to the conventional notion of
instrumental resolution. However, it is the transverse spatial extent of packet
wavefronts alone that determines the area within which a coherent scattering
process can occur in the first place. This picture is shown to be consistent
with standard quantum theory. It is also demonstrated that these two measures
of coherence can be distinguished from one another experimentally.

pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with
a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given
graph. It also learns a sparse soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer
to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive
experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis, we motivate our
choice of the components used in ASAP. Our experimental results show that
combining existing GNN architectures with ASAP leads to state-of-the-art
results on multiple graph classification benchmarks. ASAP has an average
improvement of 4%, compared to current sparse hierarchical state-of-the-art
method.

the mapping module learns to localize the agent and register consecutive

the samples from the target domain. To address this issue, different approaches
have been proposed to learn domain-invariant features or domain-specific

can be an issue which is usually overcome by pseudo-labeling. Inaccurate
pseudo-labeling, however, could result in catastrophic error accumulation

inspired by the fact that samples in the target domain are well clustered

task learning through kinesthetic feedback. The assistance assesses user
actions using a task-specific evaluation criterion and selectively accepts or
rejects them at each time instant. Through two human subject studies (total
n=68), we show that this hybrid approach of switching between full transparency

short-term retention compared to unassisted practice. Moreover, we show that
the shared control paradigm exhibits features previously shown to promote
successful training. It avoids user passivity by only rejecting user actions
and allowing failure at the task. It improves performance during assistance,
providing meaningful task-specific feedback. It is sensitive to initial skill
of the user and behaves as an `assist-as-needed' control scheme---adapting its
engagement in real time based on the performance and needs of the user. Unlike
other successful algorithms, it does not require explicit modulation of the
level of impedance or error amplification during training and it is permissive
to a range of strategies because of its evaluation criterion. We demonstrate

networks compute hierarchical representations of their inputs. While these
networks have been highly successful in machine learning, it remains unclear to
what extent they can aid our understanding of cortical function. Several groups
have developed metrics that provide a quantitative comparison between
representations computed by networks and representations measured in cortex. At
the same time, neuroscience is well into an unprecedented phase of large-scale
data collection, as evidenced by projects such as the Allen Brain Observatory.
Despite the magnitude of these efforts, in a given experiment only a fraction
of units are recorded, limiting the information available about the cortical
representation. Moreover, only a finite number of stimuli can be shown to an
animal over the course of a realistic experiment. These limitations raise the
question of how and whether metrics that compare representations of deep
networks are meaningful on these datasets. Here, we empirically quantify the
capabilities and limitations of these metrics due to limited image
presentations and neuron samples. We find that the comparison procedure is
robust to different choices of stimuli set and the level of subsampling that
one might expect in a large-scale brain survey with thousands of neurons. Using
these results, we compare the representations measured in the Allen Brain
Observatory in response to natural image presentations to deep neural network.
We show that the visual cortical areas are relatively high order
representations (in that they map to deeper layers of convolutional neural
networks). Furthermore, we see evidence of a broad, more parallel organization
rather than a sequential hierarchy, with the primary area VISp(V1) being lower
order relative to the other areas.

by spectral clustering algorithms in BSBM. Next, we propose a new
computationally simple and fast procedure achieving exact recovery under milder

$V_2$ in BSBM have sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, we show that the condition $p =
\Omega\left(\max\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log{n_1}}{n_1n_2}},\frac{\log{n_1}}{n_2}\right)\right)$
on the edge intensity $p$ is sufficient for exact recovery witin $V_1$. This
condition exhibits an elbow at $n_{2} \asymp n_1\log{n_1}$ between the
low-dimensional and high-dimensional regimes. The suggested procedure is a
variant of Lloyd's iterations initialized with a well-chosen spectral estimator
leading to what we expect to be the optimal condition for exact recovery in
BSBM. {The optimality conjecture is supported by showing that, for a supervised
oracle procedure, such a condition is necessary to achieve exact recovery.} The
key elements of the proof techniques are different from classical community
detection tools on random graphs. Numerical studies confirm our theory, and
show that the suggested algorithm is both very fast and achieves {almost the

control systems such as git, the program changes are still presented using
source code diffs. It is hard to understand what program conditions are changed

""invariant diffs"" to specify changes. Similar to source diffs that report
common code and code churns, we define version invariants to represent program
conditions that are common across versions, and invariant churns to show the
changes of program conditions between versions. We designed a static
demand-driven, path-sensitive analysis to compute and compare invariants for
multiple versions of programs using multiversion control flow graphs. We report
invariant diffs at the matched program points where comparing invariants are
meaningful. Importantly, our analysis correlates source diffs with invariant
diffs to explain what source code changes lead to the property changes. We
implemented our algorithms in a tool called $H_2$ and performed experiments on
104 versions of programs. Our results show that we are able to compute

invariants can capture the common properties of program versions even

Namely, COT provides a novel conceptual landscape plenty of analytic tools to

Given a large set of species and their interactions, COT identifies, in a
computationally feasible way, each and every sub-collection of species that is
closed and self-maintaining. These sub-collections, called organizations,
correspond to the groups of species that can survive together (co-exist) in the

can possibly happen in the dynamics of the ecological system. From here, we
propose to conceive the notion of stability from the properties of the
organizations, and thus apply the vast knowledge on the stability of reaction

COT to introduce new mathematical tools, we show that the set of organizations
can be equipped with suitable joint and meet operators, and that for certain
ecological systems the organizational structure is a non-boolean lattice,
providing in this way an unexpected connection between logico-algebraic

equally sized groups, which is called racks. The cost of cross-rack
communication is much more expensive compared with the intra-rack communication
cost. The codes for this system are called rack-aware regenerating codes.
Similar to standard minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, it is a
challenging task to construct minimum storage rack-aware regenerating (MSRR)
codes achieving the cut-set bound. The known constructions of MSRR codes
achieving the cut-set bound give codes with alphabet size $q$ exponential in
the code length $n$, more precisely, $q=\Omega(\exp(n^n))$.
  The main contribution of this paper is to provide explicit construction of
MSRR codes achieving the cut-set bound with the alphabet size linear in $n$. To
achieve this goal, we first present a general framework to repair Reed-Solomon
codes. It turns out that the known repairing schemes of Reed-Solomon codes can
be realized under our general framework. Several techniques are used in this
paper. In particular, we use the degree decent method to repair failure node.
This technique allows us to get Reed-Solomon codes with the alphabet size
linear in $n$. The other techniques include choice of good polynomials. Note
that good polynomials are used for construction of locally repairable code in
literature. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time in this paper to
make use of good polynomials for constructions of regenerating codes.

uncertainty of the agent's belief of the environment dynamics. Each random draw
from our generative model is a neural network that instantiates the dynamic
function, hence multiple draws would approximate the posterior, and the
variance in the future prediction based on this posterior is used as an
intrinsic reward for exploration. We design a training algorithm for our
generative model based on the amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent. In

that better reflect underlying data relations by leveraging the long- and

signal model is presented that considers both spatial and temporal relations.
In particular, we integrate a low-rank representation and a Gaussian Markov

is formulated as a joint low-rank component estimation and graph Laplacian
inference. Accordingly, we propose a low rank and spatiotemporal
smoothness-based graph learning method (GL-LRSS), which introduces a
spatiotemporal smoothness prior into time-vertex signal analysis. By jointly
exploiting the low rank of long-time observations and the smoothness of
short-time observations, the overall learning performance can be effectively
improved. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
substantial improvements in the learning accuracy of the proposed method over

control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage

the artificial intelligence applications on resource constrained devices, such
as mobile and wearable devices. Neural network pruning, as one of the
mainstream model compression techniques, is under extensive study to reduce the
number of parameters and computations. In contrast to irregular pruning that
incurs high index storage and decoding overhead, structured pruning techniques
have been proposed as the promising solutions. However, prior studies on
structured pruning tackle the problem mainly from the perspective of
facilitating hardware implementation, without analyzing the characteristics of
sparse neural networks. The neglect on the study of sparse neural networks
causes inefficient trade-off between regularity and pruning ratio.
Consequently, the potential of structurally pruning neural networks is not
sufficiently mined.
  In this work, we examine the structural characteristics of the irregularly
pruned weight matrices, such as the diverse redundancy of different rows, the
sensitivity of different rows to pruning, and the positional characteristics of
retained weights. By leveraging the gained insights as a guidance, we first
propose the novel block-max weight masking (BMWM) method, which can effectively
retain the salient weights while imposing high regularity to the weight matrix.
As a further optimization, we propose a density-adaptive regular-block (DARB)
pruning that outperforms prior structured pruning work with high pruning ratio
and decoding efficiency. Our experimental results show that DARB can achieve
13$\times$ to 25$\times$ pruning ratio, which are 2.8$\times$ to 4.3$\times$
improvements than the state-of-the-art counterparts on multiple neural network

most existing works only consider the single source and the identical

transmit simultaneously, and the measurement noise tends to be nonuniform. In
this paper, we study the multiple co-channel sources localization (MSL) problem

parameterized by the unknown source locations and propagation parameters, and
then reformulate it as a joint parametric sparsifying dictionary learning
(PSDL) and sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem which is solved under the
framework of sparse Bayesian learning with iterative parametric dictionary
approximation. Furthermore, multiple snapshot measurements are utilized to
improve the localization accuracy, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is
derived to analyze the theoretical estimation error bound. Comparing with the
state-of-the-art sparsity-based MSL algorithms as well as CRLB, extensive

assess global spatiotemporal clustering from epidemiological data. We test
different factors that could affect graphical hypothesis tests of clustering or
bias clustering range estimates based on the statistic, by comparison with a
baseline analysis of an open access measles dataset.
  From re-analysing this data we find that the spatial bootstrap sampling
method used to construct the confidence interval for the tau estimate and
confidence interval (CI) type can bias clustering range estimates. We suggest
that the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) CI is essential for asymmetric
sample bootstrap distributions of tau estimates.
  We also find evidence against no spatiotemporal clustering, $p$-value $\in$
[0,0.014] (global envelope test). We develop a tau-specific modification of the
Loh & Stein spatial bootstrap sampling method, which gives more precise
bootstrapped tau estimates and a 20% higher estimated clustering endpoint than
previously published (36.0m; 95% BCa CI (14.9, 46.6), vs 30m) and an equivalent
increase in the clustering area of elevated disease odds by 44%. What appears a
modest radial bias in the range estimate is more than doubled on the areal
scale, which public health resources are proportional to. This difference could
have important consequences for control.
  Correct practice of hypothesis testing of no clustering and clustering range
estimation of the tau statistic are illustrated in the Graphical abstract. We
advocate proper implementation of this useful statistic, ultimately to reduce
inaccuracies in control policy decisions made during disease clustering
analysis.

The emission
and absorption processes are governed by two fundamental radiative properties:
emissivity and absorptivity.For reciprocal systems, the emissivity and
absorptivity are restricted to be equal by Kirchhoff's law of thermal
radiation. This restriction limits the degree of freedom to control thermal
radiation and contributes to an intrinsic loss mechanism in photonic energy
harvesting systems such assolar cells. Existing approaches to violate
Kirchhoff's law typically utilize conventional magneto-optical effects in the
presence of an external magnetic field. However, these approaches require
either a strong magnetic field (~3T), or narrow-band resonances under a
moderate magnetic field (~0.3T), because the non-reciprocity in conventional
magneto-optical effects isusually weak in the thermal wavelength range. Here,
we show that the axion electrodynamics in magnetic Weyl semimetals can be used
to construct strongly nonreciprocal thermal emitters that near completely
violate Kirchhoff's law over broad angular and frequency ranges, without
requiring any external magnetic field. The non-reciprocity moreover is strongly
temperature tunable, opening new possibilities for active non-reciprocal
devices in controlling thermal radiation.

recent state-of-the-art approaches propose to adopt two-step solutions,
\emph{i.e. } 1) learn to generate pseudo pixel-level masks, and 2) engage FCNs
to train the semantic segmentation networks with the pseudo masks. However, the
two-step solutions usually employ many bells and whistles in producing
high-quality pseudo masks, making this kind of methods complicated and
inelegant. In this work, we harness the image-level labels to produce reliable
pixel-level annotations and design a fully end-to-end network to learn to
predict segmentation maps. Concretely, we firstly leverage an image
classification branch to generate class activation maps for the annotated
categories, which are further pruned into confident yet tiny object/background
regions. Such reliable regions are then directly served as ground-truth labels
for the parallel segmentation branch, where a newly designed dense energy loss

poisoning, an insidious attack where the victim model predicts clean images
correctly but classifies the same images as the target class when a trigger
poison pattern is added. This poison pattern can be embedded in the training

conditions such as a small size of the poison pattern, knowledge about the
ratio of poisoned training samples or when a validated clean dataset is
available. Since a defender may not have such prior knowledge or resources, we
propose a defense against backdoor poisoning that is effective even when those
prerequisites are not met. It is made up of several parts: one to extract a
backdoor poison signal, detect poison target and base classes, and filter out
poisoned from clean samples with proven guarantees. The final part of our
defense involves retraining the poisoned model on a dataset augmented with the
extracted poison signal and corrective relabeling of poisoned samples to
neutralize the backdoor. Our approach has shown to be effective in defending

attractive source of data for learning to rank, it can produce unfair ranking
policies for both exogenous and endogenous reasons. Exogenous reasons typically
manifest themselves as biases in the training data, which then get reflected in
the learned ranking policy and often lead to rich-get-richer dynamics.
Moreover, even after the correction of such biases, reasons endogenous to the
design of the learning algorithm can still lead to ranking policies that do not
allocate exposure among items in a fair way. To address both exogenous and
endogenous sources of unfairness, we present the first learning-to-rank
approach that addresses both presentation bias and merit-based fairness of
exposure simultaneously. Specifically, we define a class of amortized
fairness-of-exposure constraints that can be chosen based on the needs of an
application, and we show how these fairness criteria can be enforced despite
the selection biases in implicit feedback data. The key result is an efficient
and flexible policy-gradient algorithm, called FULTR, which is the first to
enable the use of counterfactual estimators for both utility estimation and
fairness constraints. Beyond the theoretical justification of the framework, we
show empirically that the proposed algorithm can learn accurate and fair
ranking policies from biased and noisy feedback.

flows is critical to understanding various non-linear turbulent processes. The
pressure-Hessian and the viscous-Laplacian govern the evolution of the
velocity-gradients and are known to be non-local in nature. Over the years,
several simplified dynamical models have been proposed that models the
viscous-Laplacian and the pressure-Hessian primarily in terms of local velocity
gradients information. These models can also serve as closure models for the
Lagrangian PDF methods. The recent fluid deformation closure model (RFDM) has
been shown to retrieve excellent one-time statistics of the viscous process.
However, the pressure-Hessian modelled by the RFDM has various physical
limitations. In this work, we first demonstrate the limitations of the RFDM in
estimating the pressure-Hessian. Further, we employ a tensor basis neural
network (TBNN) to model the pressure-Hessian from the velocity gradient tensor
itself. The neural network is trained on high-resolution data obtained from
direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic turbulence at Reynolds number of
433 (JHU turbulence database, JHTD). The predictions made by the TBNN are
tested against two different isotropic turbulence datasets at Reynolds number
of 433 (JHTD) and 315 (UP Madrid turbulence database, UPMTD) and channel flow
dataset at Reynolds number of 1000 (UT Texas and JHTD). The evaluation of the
neural network output is made in terms of the alignment statistics of the
predicted pressure-Hessian eigenvectors with the strain-rate eigenvectors for
turbulent isotropic flow as well as channel flow. Our analysis of the predicted
solution leads to the discovery of ten unique coefficients of the tensor basis
of strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors, the linear combination over which
accurately captures key alignment statistics of the pressure-Hessian tensor.

both types of noise. Considering the retinal capillaries in OCTA are hard to

efficiently separate the retinal tissue and vessels from the noise in this

better representation of the layer edges in OCT and the vasculature in OCTA.
Qualitative and quantitative results show the proposed method outperforms the

present a model that combines a large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a

investigating electron acceleration by a fast-mode termination shock at the

evolves in response to the dynamic flare geometry. We find a concave-downward
magnetic structure located below the flare termination shock, induced by the
fast reconnection downflows. It acts as a magnetic trap to confine the
electrons at the looptop for an extended period of time. The electrons are
energized significantly as they cross the shock front, and eventually build up
a power-law energy spectrum extending to hundreds of keV. We suggest that this
particle acceleration and transport scenario driven by a flare termination

overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat

to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Fuzzy Tiling Activation (FTA) that
provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that
improves discrimination. We first show that FTA is robust under covariate shift

their spectral inhomogeneity currently limits their potential applications.
Here, we apply tensile strain to quantum emitters embedded in few-layer hBN

to 65 meV, a record for any two-dimensional quantum source. We demonstrate
reversible tuning of the emission and related photophysical properties. We also

batteries that can be loaded onto electric trucks and connected to charging
stations to provide various ancillary services for distribution grids. This
paper proposes a new strategy for MESD operation, in which their power outputs
and paths are co-optimally scheduled to minimize the total energy loss in both
power and transportation networks. The distances moved by MESDs and time at
different locations are modeled using a set of linear equations, considering
the time-varying traffic flow. The linear transit model is integrated with
linearized constraints to support the reliable operation of the distribution
grid. In particular, an optimal scheduling problem is formulated considering
the maximum limits on incremental variations in bus voltages and line power
flows for active and reactive power outputs of MESDs. A mixed-integer linear
programming solver can be readily applied to the optimization problem, ensuring
the global optimality of the solution. Simulation case studies are carried out
under various power and transportation network conditions. The results of these
case studies confirm that the proposed strategy using MESDs is effective in
reducing total energy losses, compared to conventional methods using stationary
batteries and plug-in electric vehicles.

since the great success of deep learning based networks. Fixed-point networks,
which represent their data with low bits fixed-point and thus give remarkable
savings on memory usage, are generally preferred. Even though current
fixed-point networks employ relative low bits (e.g. 8-bits), the memory saving
is far from enough for the embedded devices. On the other hand, quantization
deep networks, for example XNOR-Net and HWGQNet, quantize the data into 1 or 2
bits resulting in more significant memory savings but still contain lots of
floatingpoint data. In this paper, we propose a fixed-point network for
embedded vision tasks through converting the floatingpoint data in a
quantization network into fixed-point. Furthermore, to overcome the data loss
caused by the conversion, we propose to compose floating-point data operations
across multiple layers (e.g. convolution, batch normalization and quantization
layers) and convert them into fixedpoint. We name the fixed-point network
obtained through such integrated conversion as Integrated Fixed-point
Quantization Networks (IFQ-Net). We demonstrate that our IFQNet gives 2.16x and
18x more savings on model size and runtime feature map memory respectively with
similar accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, based on YOLOv2, we design
IFQ-Tinier-YOLO face detector which is a fixed-point network with 256x
reduction in model size (246k Bytes) than Tiny-YOLO. We illustrate the

The two
end nodes exchange their packets through relays. While a packet at a relay
might not find its coding pair upon arrival, a transmission cost can be reduced
by waiting for coding with a packet from the other side. To strike a balance
between the reduced transmission cost and the cost incurred by the delay, a
scheduling algorithm determining either to transmit an uncoded packet or to
wait for coding is needed. Because of highly uncertain traffic injections,
scheduling with no assumption of the traffic is critical. This paper proposes a
randomized online scheduling algorithm for a relay in arbitrary traffic, which
can be non-stationary or adversarial. The expected total cost (including a
transmission cost and a delay cost) incurred by the proposed algorithm is at
most e/(e-1) ~ 1.58 times the minimum achievable total cost. In particular, the
proposed algorithm is universal in the sense that the ratio is independent of

evaluating the quality of stylized images. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end two-stream Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) aiming at balancing
the contributions of the content and the style in rendered images. Our proposed
network consists of the encoder and decoder parts. The encoder part utilizes a
FCN for content and a FCN for style where the two FCNs have feature injections
and are independently trained to preserve the semantic content and to learn the
faithful style representation in each. The semantic content feature and the
style representation feature are then concatenated adaptively and fed into the
decoder to generate style-transferred (stylized) images. In order to train our
proposed network, we employ a loss network, the pre-trained VGG-16, to compute
content loss and style loss, both of which are efficiently used for the feature
injection as well as the feature concatenation. Our intensive experiments show

However, the low-rank prior may not be enough to recover the original tensor

completion method by exploiting both the low-rank and sparse prior of tensor.
Specifically, the tensor completion task can be formulated as a low-rank
minimization problem with a sparse regularizer. The low-rank property is
depicted by the tensor truncated nuclear norm based on tensor singular value

tensor nuclear norm. While the sparse regularizer is imposed by a
$\ell_{1}$-norm in a discrete cosine transformation (DCT) domain, which can
better employ the local sparse property of completed data. To solve the
optimization problem, we employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) in which we only need to solve several subproblems which have
closed-form solutions. Substantial experiments on real world images and videos

important unresolved problem concerning the origin of life. A polymer longer
than 40--100 nucleotides is necessary to expect a self-replicating activity,
but the formation of such a long polymer having a correct nucleotide sequence
by random reactions seems statistically unlikely. However, our universe,
created by a single inflation event, likely includes more than $10^{100}$
Sun-like stars. If life can emerge at least once in such a large volume, it is
not in contradiction with our observations of life on Earth, even if the
expected number of abiogenesis events is negligibly small within the observable
universe that contains only $10^{22}$ stars. Here, a quantitative relation is
derived between the minimum RNA length $l_{\min}$ required to be the first
biological polymer, and the universe size necessary to expect the formation of
such a long and active RNA by randomly adding monomers. It is then shown that
an active RNA can indeed be produced somewhere in an inflationary universe,
giving a solution to the abiotic polymerization problem. On the other hand,
$l_{\min}$ must be shorter than $\sim$20 nucleotides for the abiogenesis
probability close to unity on a terrestrial planet, but a self-replicating
activity is not expected for such a short RNA. Therefore, if extraterrestrial
organisms of a different origin from those on Earth are discovered in the
future, it would imply an unknown mechanism at work to polymerize nucleotides
much faster than random statistical processes.

However, these benefits come at the cost of a decrease in accuracy. In this
article, we demonstrate that reconfigurable constant coefficient multipliers
(RCCMs) offer a better alternative for saving the silicon area than utilizing
low-precision arithmetic. RCCMs multiply input values by a restricted choice of
coefficients using only adders, subtractors, bit shifts, and multiplexers
(MUXes), meaning that they can be heavily optimized for FPGAs. We propose a
family of RCCMs tailored to FPGA logic elements to ensure their efficient
utilization. To minimize information loss from quantization, we then develop
novel training techniques that map the possible coefficient representations of
the RCCMs to neural network weight parameter distributions. This enables the
usage of the RCCMs in hardware, while maintaining high accuracy. We demonstrate
the benefits of these techniques using AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50
networks. The resulting implementations achieve up to 50% resource savings over
traditional 8-bit quantized networks, translating to significant speedups and
power savings. Our RCCM with the lowest resource requirements exceeds 6-bit
fixed point accuracy, while all other implementations with RCCMs achieve at
least similar accuracy to an 8-bit uniformly quantized design, while achieving
significant resource savings.

HERN is able to learn global information with feasible GPU memory usage.

(SIO), which is applicable in high-dimensional cases and can be applied to
accomplish the transformations from higher-dimensional states to
lower-dimensional states. Furthermore, a relatively complete process of the
one-shot coherence distillation is experimentally demonstrated for three- and
four-dimensional input states. Experimental data reveal an interesting result:
higher coherence distillation rates (but defective) can be reached by
tolerating a larger error. Our finding paves a fresh way in the experimental
investigation of quantum coherence conversions through various incoherent
operations.

  International Conference on Communications (ICC 2020)",,,,"cs.IT cs.AI cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations
(ABSs) to assist terrestrial infrastructure for keeping wireless connectivity
in various emergency scenarios. To maximize the coverage rate of N ground users
(GUs) by jointly placing multiple ABSs with limited coverage range is known to
be a NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in N. The problem is further
complicated when the coverage range becomes irregular due to site-specific
blockage (e.g., buildings) on the air-ground channel in the 3-dimensional (3D)
space. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper applies the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method by 1) representing the state by a coverage
bitmap to capture the spatial correlation of GUs/ABSs, whose dimension and
associated neural network complexity is invariant with arbitrarily large N; and
2) designing the action and reward for the DRL agent to effectively learn from
the dynamic interactions with the complicated propagation environment
represented by a 3D Terrain Map. Specifically, a novel two-level design
approach is proposed, consisting of a preliminary design based on the dominant
line-of-sight (LoS) channel model, and an advanced design to further refine the
ABS positions based on site-specific LoS/non-LoS channel states. The double
deep Q-network (DQN) with Prioritized Experience Replay (Prioritized Replay
DDQN) algorithm is applied to train the policy of multi-ABS placement decision.
Numerical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the
coverage rate in complex environment, compared to the benchmark DQN and K-means
algorithms.

there are still two open issues. The first problem is how to prune residual
connections. We propose to prune both channels inside and outside the residual
connections via a KL-divergence based criterion. The second issue is pruning
with limited data. We observe an interesting phenomenon: directly pruning on a
small dataset is usually worse than fine-tuning a small model which is pruned
or trained from scratch on the large dataset. Knowledge distillation is an
effective approach to compensate for the weakness of limited data. However, the
logits of a teacher model may be noisy. In order to avoid the influence of
label noise, we propose a label refinement approach to solve this problem.
Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method (CURL,

outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet. More importantly,
when pruning on small datasets, CURL achieves comparable or much better
performance than fine-tuning a pretrained small model.

Absorption Rate (SAR) reduction for T2-FLAIR MRI sequences at 7T by predicting
the required adiabatic pulse power and scaling the amplitude in a slice-wise
fashion. Methods: We used a TR-FOCI adiabatic pulse for spin inversion in a
T2-FLAIR sequence to improve B1+ homogeneity and calculate the pulse power
required for adiabaticity slice-by-slice to minimize the SAR. Drawing on the
implicit B1+ inhomogeneity present in a standard localizer scan, 3D AutoAlign
localizers and SA2RAGE B1+ maps were acquired in eight volunteers. A
convolutional neural network (CNN) was then trained to predict the B1+ profile
from the localizers and scale factors for the pulse power for each slice were
calculated. The ability to predict the B1+ profile as well as how the derived
pulse scale factors affected the FLAIR inversion efficiency were assessed in
transverse, sagittal, and coronal orientations. Results: The predicted B1+ maps
matched the measured B1+ maps with a mean difference of 4.45% across all
slices. The acquisition in the transverse orientation was shown to be most
effective for this method and delivered a 40% reduction in SAR along with 1min
and 30-sec reduction in scan time (28%) without degradation of image quality.
Conclusion: We propose a SAR reduction technique based on the prediction of B1+
profiles from standard localizer scans using a CNN and show that scaling the
inversion pulse power slice-by-slice for FLAIR sequences at 7T reduces SAR and
scan time without compromising image quality.

one-dimensional array of MZM-s on mesoscopic superconducting islands at zero

shape starts with the removal of image outliers, the estimation of the
orientation of the biomolecule that has produced the given 2D image, and the
estimation of camera parameters to correct for intensity defects. Current
techniques performing these tasks are often computationally expensive, while
the dataset sizes keep growing. There is a need for next-generation algorithms
that preserve accuracy while improving speed and scalability. In this paper, we
combine variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks

perform an exploratory analysis of the obtained latent space, that is shown to

the acquisition procedure of cryo-EM images. This analysis leads us to design
an estimation method for orientation and camera parameters of single-particle

opens the door to geometric approaches for unsupervised estimations of

assumes that all voters and candidates are jointly embedded in a common metric
space. Voters rank candidates by non-decreasing distance. The mechanism,
receiving only this ordinal (comparison) information, should select a candidate
approximately minimizing the sum of distances from all voters. It is known that
while the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee distortion at most 5, many
other standard voting rules, such as Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval, have
distortion growing unboundedly in the number $n$ of candidates.
  Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval with small $k$ require less communication
from the voters than all deterministic social choice rules known to achieve
constant distortion. This motivates our study of the tradeoff between the
distortion and the amount of communication in deterministic social choice
rules.
  We show that any one-round deterministic voting mechanism in which each voter
communicates only the candidates she ranks in a given set of $k$ positions must
have distortion at least $\frac{2n-k}{k}$; we give a mechanism achieving an
upper bound of $O(n/k)$, which matches the lower bound up to a constant. For
more general communication-bounded voting mechanisms, in which each voter
communicates $b$ bits of information about her ranking, we show a slightly
weaker lower bound of $\Omega(n/b)$ on the distortion.
  For randomized mechanisms, it is known that Random Dictatorship achieves
expected distortion strictly smaller than 3, almost matching a lower bound of
$3-\frac{2}{n}$ for any randomized mechanism that only receives each voter's
top choice. We close this gap, by giving a simple randomized social choice rule
which only uses each voter's first choice, and achieves expected distortion
$3-\frac{2}{n}$.

investigated. Our main findings are as follows: (1) from a global point of
view, the synodic coronal rotation period with a value of 27.5 days is the only
significant period at the periodic scales shorter than 64 days; (2) the coronal
rotation period exhibit an obviously decreasing trend during the considered
time interval, implying the solar corona accelerates its global rotation rate
in the long run; (3) there exist significant periods of 3.25, 6.13, 9.53, and
11.13 years in the period length of the coronal rotation, providing an evidence
that the coronal rotation should be connected with the quasi-biennial
oscillation, the eleven-year solar cycle, and the 22-year Hale cycle (or the
magnetic activity reversal); and (4) the phase relationship between the coronal
rotation period and the solar magnetic activity is not only time-dependent but
also frequency-dependent. For a small range around the 11- year cycle band,
there is a systematic trend in the phase, and the small mismatch in this band
brings out the phase to drift. The possible mechanism for the above analysis

proposal network) which outputs an object-localizing attention map only with
human poses and action verbs. In the source domain, we fully train an object
detector and the RRPN with full supervision of HOI. With transferred knowledge
about localization map from the trained RRPN, a new object detector can learn
unseen objects with weak verbal supervision of HOI without bounding box
annotations in the target domain. Because the RRPN is designed as an add-on

far, the conversion of LTLf formulas to deterministic finite-state automata
(DFAs) has been identified as the primary bottleneck to the scalabity of
synthesis. Recent investigations have also shown that the size of the DFA state
space plays a critical role in synthesis as well.
  Therefore, effective resolution of the bottleneck for synthesis requires the
conversion to be time and memory performant, and prevent state-space explosion.
Current conversion approaches, however, which are based either on
explicit-state representation or symbolic-state representation, fail to address
these necessities adequately at scale: Explicit-state approaches generate
minimal DFA but are slow due to expensive DFA minimization. Symbolic-state
representations can be succinct, but due to the lack of DFA minimization they
generate such large state spaces that even their symbolic representations
cannot compensate for the blow-up.
  This work proposes a hybrid representation approach for the conversion. Our
approach utilizes both explicit and symbolic representations of the
state-space, and effectively leverages their complementary strengths. In doing
so, we offer an LTLf to DFA conversion technique that addresses all three
necessities, hence resolving the bottleneck. A comprehensive empirical
evaluation on conversion and synthesis benchmarks supports the merits of our

their functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series - an object thus
constrained by construction to belong to the manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices. One of the challenges that naturally arises consists of
finding a lower-dimensional subspace for representing such manifold-valued
data. Traditional techniques, like principal component analysis, are
ill-adapted to tackle non-Euclidean spaces and may fail to achieve a
lower-dimensional representation of the data - thus potentially pointing to the
absence of lower-dimensional representation of the data. However, these
techniques are restricted in that: (i) they do not leverage the assumption that
the connectomes belong on a pre-specified manifold, therefore discarding
information; (ii) they can only fit a linear subspace to the data. In this
paper, we are interested in variants to learn potentially highly curved
submanifolds of manifold-valued data. Motivated by the brain connectomes
example, we investigate a latent variable generative model, which has the added
benefit of providing us with uncertainty estimates - a crucial quantity in the
medical applications we are considering. While latent variable models have been
proposed to learn linear and nonlinear spaces for Euclidean data, or geodesic
subspaces for manifold data, no intrinsic latent variable model exists to learn
nongeodesic subspaces for manifold data. This paper fills this gap and
formulates a Riemannian variational autoencoder with an intrinsic generative
model of manifold-valued data. We evaluate its performances on synthetic and

context information and rich spatial information. In this paper, we
differentiate features for scene segmentation based on dedicated attention
mechanisms (DF-DAM), and two attention modules are proposed to optimize the
high-level and low-level features in the encoder, respectively. Specifically,
we use the high-level and low-level features of ResNet as the source of context
information and spatial information, respectively, and optimize them with
attention fusion module and 2D position attention module, respectively. For
attention fusion module, we adopt dual channel weight to selectively adjust the
channel map for the highest two stage features of ResNet, and fuse them to get
context information. For 2D position attention module, we use the context
information obtained by attention fusion module to assist the selection of the
lowest-stage features of ResNet as supplementary spatial information. Finally,
the two sets of information obtained by the two modules are simply fused to
obtain the prediction. We evaluate our approach on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
2012 datasets. In particular, there aren't complicated and redundant processing
modules in our architecture, which greatly reduces the complexity, and we

the method of privacy amplification against eavesdroppers. First we justify our
proposed protocol by analyzing the physical layer security provided by the
classic wiretap channel model (i.e. one-way protocol). In the Gaussian
channels, the classic one-way protocol requires Eve's channel to be degraded
w.r.t. Bob's channel. However, this channel degradation condition depends on
Eve's location and whether Eve's receiving antenna is more powerful than Bob's.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a two-way protocol inspired in IEEE
TIT (1993) that eliminates the channel degradation condition.
  In the proposed two-way protocol, on a first phase, via Gaussian channel, Bob
sends randomness to Alice, which is partially leaked to Eve. Then, on a second
phase, Alice transmits information to Bob over a public noiseless channel. We
derive the secrecy capacity of the two-way protocol when the channel to Eve is
also Gaussian. We show that the capacity of the two-way protocol is always
positive. We present numerical values of the capacities illustrating the gains
obtained by our proposed protocol. We apply our result to simple yet realistic
models of satellite communication channels.

  Intelligence",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dialogue response generation (DRG) is a critical component of task-oriented
dialogue systems (TDSs). Its purpose is to generate proper natural language
responses given some context, e.g., historical utterances, system states, etc.
State-of-the-art work focuses on how to better tackle DRG in an end-to-end way.
Typically, such studies assume that each token is drawn from a single
distribution over the output vocabulary, which may not always be optimal.
Responses vary greatly with different intents, e.g., domains, system actions.
  We propose a novel mixture-of-generators network (MoGNet) for DRG, where we
assume that each token of a response is drawn from a mixture of distributions.
MoGNet consists of a chair generator and several expert generators. Each expert
is specialized for DRG w.r.t. a particular intent. The chair coordinates
multiple experts and combines the output they have generated to produce more
appropriate responses. We propose two strategies to help the chair make better
decisions, namely, a retrospective mixture-of-generators (RMoG) and prospective
mixture-of-generators (PMoG). The former only considers the historical
expert-generated responses until the current time step while the latter also
considers possible expert-generated responses in the future by encouraging
exploration. In order to differentiate experts, we also devise a
global-and-local (GL) learning scheme that forces each expert to be specialized
towards a particular intent using a local loss and trains the chair and all
experts to coordinate using a global loss.
  We carry out extensive experiments on the MultiWOZ benchmark dataset. MoGNet
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic
and human evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness for DRG.

model is capable of detecting the hardware (HW) failure of the cluster members

model relies on TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid
collision between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed
model aims to keep packets transmitting, isotropic or non-isotropic

Accordingly, it can manage the consequently lost power due to the malicious

quantitatively by evaluating power loss analytically in the thin-filament limit

the helically wound tape behaves more like a cylindrical superconductor as
verified by the formula in the cylinder limit of $w_0/R\rightarrow 2\pi$, and
$P$ decreases further from the value for a loosely twisted tape, reaching $\sim

multivariate analysis and widespread in a number of applications, the problem

the null hypothesis of elliptical symmetry with specified location and actually
addresses location rather than non-elliptical alternatives. In this paper, we
are proposing new classes of testing procedures, both for specified and
unspecified location. The backbone of our construction is Le Cam's asymptotic
theory of statistical experiments, and optimality is to be understood locally
and asymptotically within the family of generalized skew-elliptical
distributions. The tests we are proposing are meeting all the desired
properties of a``good'' test of elliptical symmetry: they have a simple
asymptotic distribution under the entire null hypothesis of elliptical symmetry
with unspecified radial density and shape parameter; they are affine-invariant,
computationally fast, intuitively understandable, and not too demanding in
terms of moments. While achieving optimality against generalized
skew-elliptical alternatives, they remain quite powerful under a much broader
class of non-elliptical distributions and significantly outperform the
available competitors.

last few decades. During this same period, there have been strong cooling
trends observed in the wintertime, near-surface air temperature over central
Eurasia, a phenomenon known as Eurasian cooling. Many studies have suggested
that the loss of sea ice, especially in the Barents and Kara Seas, is related
to the cooling over Eurasia, although this connection and its possible
mechanism is still a source of heated debate. Observations and reanalyses show
a clear pattern of co-variability between Arctic sea ice and Eurasian
wintertime temperatures. However, there is an open question regarding how
robustly this teleconnection pattern is reproduced in the current generation of
climate models.
  This study has examined Eurasian cooling in twenty models from the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), both in terms of temperature
trends and by using singular value decomposition to identify patterns of
co-variability between Arctic sea ice concentrations and near-surface
temperatures over Eurasia. These are compared to trends and patterns of
co-variability found in the ERA-Interim reanalysis. While most of the CMIP5
models have a robust pattern of co-variability that is similar to that found in
the reanalysis, many fail to reproduce the wintertime cooling that has been
observed. An examination of Arctic sea ice extent in the models suggests one
possible explanation is the inability of the models to accurately simulate the
wintertime sea ice changes over critical locations such as the Barents and Kara
Seas.

by both theoretical analysis and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate
that gyromagnetic hyperbolic metamaterials (GHM) are photonic Chern insulators
with superior properties. As a novel mechanism, the simultaneous occurrence of
the hyperbolic and gyromagnetic effects in these metamaterials is shown to open
the large topological band gaps with gap Chern number of one. Importantly,
unlike many other photonic Chern insulators, the GHM Chern insulators possess
non-radiative chiral edge modes on their surfaces, and thus allow to fabricate
unidirectional waveguides without cladding metals which generally incurr
considerable Ohmic loss. Furthermore, the photonic edge states in the proposed
Chern insulators are robust against disorder on a wide range of length scales,
in strong contrast to crystalline topological insulators, and the light flow
direction on the surface of the Chern insulators can be easily flipped by
switching the direction of an applied magnetic field. Fascinatingly, we find
that negative refraction of the topological surface wave occurs at the boundary
between the GHMs with the opposite signs of gyromagnetic parameters. Finally,
we show that compared with other photonic topological materials such as chiral
hyperbolic materials, the present GHM Chern insulators can be much easier to
fabricate.

We determine the monoclinic base-centered magnetic space group of the
antiferromagnetic structure within the deformed crystal which is strongly
influenced by the time-inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The
antiferromagnetic state is evidently stabilized by a nonadiabatic atomic-like
motion of the electrons near the Fermi level. This atomic-like motion is
characterized by the symmetry of the Bloch functions near the Fermi level and
provides in NiO a perfect basis for a Mott insulator.

their own locations lead to a suboptimal segregated distribution of the
population, even though all agents have the same preference for mixed
neighborhoods. One of the main assumptions underlying this general result of
segregation models is that agents rely on comparisons between instantaneous
utilities in order to make their moving decisions. On the contrary and
certainly more reasonably, we assume in this article that agents forecast later
states using a linear extrapolation of past states heuristic in order to make
their decisions. We show that for a relatively small set of parameters,
considering forecasting agents allows to dramatically reduce sub-optimality in
a framework close to Schelling's model.

successfully in a unified manner. Specifically, based on the observed Fisher

disease known as AGel amyloidosis. Four of these mutations are hosted by the
second domain of the protein (G2): D187N/Y, G167R and N184K. The impact of the
latter has been so far evaluated only by studies on the isolated G2. Here we
report the characterization of full-length gelsolin carrying the N184K mutation
and compare the findings with those obtained on the wild type and the other
variants. The crystallographic structure of the N184K variant in the Ca2+-free
conformation shows remarkable similarities with the wild type protein. Only
minimal local rearrangements can be observed and the mutant is as efficient as
the wild type in severing filamentous actin. However, thermal stability of the
pathological variant is compromised in the Ca2+-free conditions. These data
suggest that the N to K substitution causes a local disruption of the H-bond
network in the core of the G2 domain. Such a subtle rearrangement of the
connections does not lead to significant conformational changes but severely
affects the stability of the protein.

In the model, the
defender holds a total defending resource of R, which can be distributed to the
nodes of the network. The defending resource allocated to a node can be shared
by its neighbors. There is a weight associated with every edge that represents
the efficiency defending resources are shared between neighboring nodes. We
consider the setting when each attack can affect not only the target node, but
its neighbors as well. Assuming that nodes in the network have different
treasures to defend and different defending requirements, the defender aims at
allocating the defending resource to the nodes to minimize the loss due to
attack. We give polynomial time exact algorithms for two important special
cases of the network defending problem. For the case when an attack can only
affect the target node, we present an LP-based exact algorithm. For the case
when defending resources cannot be shared, we present a max-flow-based exact
algorithm. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, and we give a
2-approximation algorithm based on LP-rounding. Moreover, by giving a matching
lower bound of 2 on the integrality gap on the LP relaxation, we show that our
rounding is tight.

different query models: (a) each query is an index $i$ for which the oracle
reveals the value of the sample $X_i$, (b) each query is comprised of two
indices $i$ and $j$ for which the oracle reveals if the samples $X_i$ and $X_j$

algorithms which, at each time $t$, either make a query to the corresponding
oracle based on past observations, or decide to stop and output an estimate for
the distribution's mode, required to be correct with a specified confidence. We
analyze the query complexity of these algorithms for any underlying
distribution $\mathcal{P}$, and derive corresponding lower bounds on the
optimal query complexity under the two querying models.

powerful blazars, including 12 BL Lacs and 8 flat spectrum radio quasars,
applying various analysis tools such as flux distribution, symmetry analysis,
and time series analysis on the decade-long Fermi/LAT observations. The results
show that blazars with steeper \gama-ray spectral indexes are found to be more
variable; and the \gama-ray flux distribution closely resembles lognormal
probability distribution function. The statistical variability properties of
the sources as studied by power spectral density analysis are consistent with
\emph{flicker noise} ($P(\nu)\propto1/\nu$) -- an indication of long-memory
processes at work. Statistical analysis of the distribution of flux rise and
decay rates in the light curves of the sources, aimed at distinguishing between
particle acceleration and energy dissipation timescales, counter-intuitively
suggests that both kinds of rates follow a similar distribution and the derived
mean variability timescales are in the order of a few weeks. The corresponding
emission region size is used to constrain location of \gama-ray production
sites in the sources to be a few parsecs. Additionally, using Lomb-Scargle
periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform methods and extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, we detected year timescale quasi-periodic oscillations in the
sources S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, ON +325, PKS 1424-418 and PKS 2155-304. The
detection significance was computed taking proper account of the red-noise and
other artifacts inherent in the observations. We explain the results in the
light of current blazar models with relativistic shocks propagating down the
jet viewed close to the line of sight.

More specifically, this paper first proves the universal best performance
estimator in a practical setting, and then establishes theoretical bounds on
the estimation error, i.e., the difference between the training performance and
the true performance for a parameter configuration, considering finite and

challenges, e.g. regarding the focus on the individuals' welfare, which hence

compute, by not using the raw videos which demand colossal storage capacity.
Existing methods approach this task as a multiple modalities problem. In this
paper we are approaching the task in a completely different way; we are looking
at the data from the compressed stream as a one unit clip and propose that the
residual frames can replace the original RGB frames from the raw domain.
Furthermore, we are using teacher-student method to aid the network in the
compressed domain to mimic the teacher network in the raw domain. We show
experiments on three leading datasets (HMDB51, UCF1, and Kinetics) that
approach state-of-the-art accuracy on raw video data by using compressed data.
Our model MFCD-Net outperforms prior methods in the compressed domain and more
importantly, our model has 11X fewer parameters and 3X fewer Flops,
dramatically improving the efficiency of video recognition inference. This
approach enables applying neural networks exclusively in the compressed domain

mixed phase space with a cylindrical regular region surrounded by a chaotic sea

oscillations superimposed. This slow decay is caused by orbits which spend long
times close to the surface of the regular region. Representing such
long-trapped orbits in frequency space shows clear signatures of partial
barriers and reveals that coupled resonances play an essential role. Using a
small number of the most relevant resonances allows for classifying
long-trapped orbits. From this the Poincar\'e recurrence statistics can be
divided into different exponentially decaying contributions which very
accurately explains the overall power-law behavior including the oscillations.

system is of special interest in the field of quantum information processing
(QIP) and can be realized in electron spin states in quantum dots or Rydberg
atoms in optical cavities and superconducting qubits in linear resonators. We
present an exact analytical solution for the time evolution of the system
starting from any initial state. Utilizing this solution, we show how the
entanglement sudden death (ESD), which represents a major threat to QIP, can be
efficiently controlled by tuning atom-atom coupling and non-zero detuning. We
demonstrate that while one of these two system parameters may not separately
affect the ESD, combining the two can be very effective, as in the case of an
initial correlated Bell state. However in other cases, such as a W-like initial
state, they may have a competing impacts on ESD. Moreover, their combined
effect can be used to create ESD in the system as in the case of an
anti-correlated initial Bell state. A clear synchronization between the
population inversion collapse-revival pattern and the entanglement dynamics is
observed at all system parameter combinations. Nevertheless, only for initial
states that may evolve to ESD, the population inversion revival oscillations,
where exchange of energy between the atoms and the field takes place,
temporally coincide with the entanglement revival peaks, whereas the population
collapse periods match the ESD intervals. The variation of the radiation field
intensity has a clear impact on the duration of the ESD at any combination of

related to the non homogeneous distribution of matter, or effects due to

instruments rely on observations of trans-ionospheric signals. The quality of
these signals can be deteriorated by ionospheric scintillation which can have
detrimental effects on the mentioned applications. Therefore, monitoring of
ionospheric scintillation and quantifying its effect on the ground are of
significant interest. In this work, we develop a methodology which estimates
the scintillation induced ionospheric uncertainties in the sky and translates
their impact to the end-users on the ground. First, by using the risk concept
from decision theory and by exploiting the intensity and duration of
scintillation events (as measured by the S4 index), we estimate ionospheric
risk maps that could readily give an initial impression on the effects of
scintillation on the satellite-receiver communication. However, to better
understand the influence of scintillation on the positioning accuracy on the
ground, we formulate a new weighted dilution of precision (WPDOP) measure that
incorporates the ionospheric scintillation risks as weighting factors for the
given satellite-receiver constellations. These weights depend implicitly on
scintillation intensity and duration thresholds which can be specified by the
end-user based on the sensitivity of the application, for example. We
demonstrate our methodology by using scintillation data from South America, and
produce ionospheric risk maps which illustrate broad scintillation activity,
especially at the equatorial anomaly. Moreover, we construct ground maps of
WPDOP over a grid of hypothetical receivers which reveal that ionospheric
scintillation can also affect such regions of the continent that are not
exactly under the observed ionospheric scintillation structures. Particularly,
this is evident in cases when only the Global Positioning System (GPS) is
available.

current acceleration of the universe) finding, in agreement with other recent
works, that these are strongly disfavoured by the data. We then treat these
models as one-parameter extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, constraining the relative
contribution of torsion to the level of a few percent in appropriate units.

forthcoming low-redshift data and check the robustness of our results by

compression is, in theory, better, because the convergence rate is upper
bounded by that of entire-model compression for a wide range of biased and
unbiased compression methods. However, despite the theoretical bound, our
experimental study of six well-known methods shows that convergence, in

scammer's advertisement, the scammer attempts to persuade them to transfer
money without having seen the property. We were interested in which persuasion
techniques scammers use, and in assessing their skill at the art of persuasion.
During a period of three weeks, we scraped 2112 letting advertisements,
identified the fraudulent advertisements and had 44 conversations of around 4
or 5 emails each with the scammers. Our analysis indicates that Cialdini`s
marketing-based social persuasion strategies, such as liking, appeal to
authority, and the need for commitment and consistency are extensively
implemented by rental scammers. Of Stajano and Wilson's scam-based persuasion
strategies, an appeal to sympathy (i.e., kindness) and need for greed were
commonly used. We identified two further social persuasion strategies:
establishing credibility and removing objections. At a superficial level,
rental scammers seem skilled at their job, because they mimic genuine landlords
and use a range of effective persuasion techniques. However, when examining
their emails more closely, we see they often use pre-scripted emails, their
mimicry is often incompetent, and they have a lack of language skills and
cultural knowledge that may tip people off. They appear to be the criminal
equivalent of a boilerhouse sales operation, a modus operandi that has not

the usual power-law and exponential scale factor behaviors in FLRW universes
exist for various different distributions of matter, along with solutions for
collapsing universes. Using the dynamical system approach, we also show that no
global attractors can exist in the cosmological phase space and that stable
universes can either be described by scale factors that diverge in finite time

trading, e.g. in stock markets to determine stock opening prices, and energy
markets to trade energy in order to balance net demand in smart grids,
involving trillions of dollars in the process. A bidder, participating in such
PDAs, has to plan for bids in the current auction as well as for the future
auctions, which highlights the necessity of good bidding strategies. In this
paper, we perform an equilibrium analysis of single unit single-shot double
auctions with a certain clearing price and payment rule, which we refer to as
ACPR, and find it intractable to analyze as number of participating agents
increase. We further derive the best response for a bidder with complete
information in a single-shot double auction with ACPR. Leveraging the theory
developed for single-shot double auction and taking the PowerTAC wholesale
market PDA as our testbed, we proceed by modeling the PDA of PowerTAC as an
MDP. We propose a novel bidding strategy, namely MDPLCPBS. We empirically show
that MDPLCPBS follows the equilibrium strategy for double auctions that we
previously analyze. In addition, we benchmark our strategy against the baseline
and the state-of-the-art bidding strategies for the PowerTAC wholesale market
PDAs, and show that MDPLCPBS outperforms most of them consistently.

neural network (SNN) using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for object

and compact feature spike representation. We show not only how MuST exploits
spikes to convey information more effectively, but also how it benefits the
recognition using SNN. The recognition process is performed in an unsupervised
manner, which does not need to specify the desired status of every single
neuron of SNN, and thus can be flexibly applied in real-world recognition
tasks. The experiments are performed on five AER datasets including a new one

visualize the training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on 3D
quantitative neuroimaging data. Our application focuses on the detection of
Alzheimer's disease with gray matter probability maps extracted from structural

the coherence of the longitudinal patterns and regions identified by the

visualization-based similarity indexes between different re-runs of the CNN. We
demonstrated that the areas identified by the CNN were consistent with what is
known of Alzheimer's disease and that the visualization approach extract
coherent longitudinal patterns. We also showed that the CNN training is not
stable and that the areas identified mainly depend on the initialization and
the training process. This issue may exist in many other medical studies using
deep learning methods on datasets in which the number of samples is too small

C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.101.054609",,"nucl-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Breakup reactions are often used to probe the nuclear structure
of halo nuclei. The eikonal model diverges for Coulomb breakup since it relies
on the adiabatic approximation. To correct this weakness, a Coulomb-corrected
eikonal method (CCE) using the Coulomb first-order-perturbation approximation
was developed.
  Purpose: Since the CCE mixes two reaction models and treats the Coulomb and
nuclear interactions on different footings, we study here an alternative
approach. We develop a simplification to the dynamical eikonal approximation
(S-DEA) which has a similar numerical cost as the usual eikonal model, and
study its efficiency for both nuclear- and Coulomb-dominated breakup reactions.
  Methods: We compare the energy and parallel-momentum cross sections obtained
with the dynamical eikonal approximation, the usual eikonal approximation, the
CCE and the S-DEA.
  Results: The S-DEA leads to precise energy distributions for both breakup
reactions. The corresponding parallel-momentum distributions obtained with the
S-DEA are improved compared to the ones computed with the eikonal model. It is
more efficient for nuclear-dominated breakup than the CCE since it reproduces
better the shape and magnitude of the distribution. However, for the Coulomb
breakup, the distribution lacks asymmetry.
  Conclusions: The simplification of the DEA developed in this work improves
significantly the eikonal descriptions of breakup energy distribution for both
Coulomb- and nuclear-dominated reactions. The asymmetry of the
parallel-momentum distribution is enhanced for nuclear-dominated breakup. This
study confirms that the asymmetry is due to dynamical effects. A direct
prospect of this work would be to extend this model to two-neutron halo-nucleus
projectiles.

The radio power of the radio-loud quasars is at most weakly correlated with the

correlation between CIV blueshift and radio power linked to higher Eddington
ratios and L(5100A). Under standard assumptions, the BH growth time is longer
than the cosmic age for many CARLA quasars, suggesting that they must have
experienced more efficient growth in the past. If these BHs were growing from
seeds since the epoch of reionization, it is possible that they grew at the
Eddington limit like the quasars at z ~ 6-7, and then continued to grow at the
reduced rates observed until z ~ 2-3. Finally, we study the relation between

function provides qualitatively correct results in the weak-coupling limit. In
DMRG, chains with about $10^3$ sites are large enough to describe the
susceptibilities down to $J_{\rm K}/{\cal D}\approx 0.5$. For smaller Kondo
couplings, only the NRG provides reliable results for a general host-electron

development of the theory of quaternion Hilbert spaces. In order to do this, it
is important to study first its algebraic structure, namely, octonion modules.
In this article, we provide complete classification of left octonion modules.
  In contrast to the quaternionic setting, we encounter some new phenomena.
That is, a submodule generated by one element $m$ may be the whole module and
may be not in the form $\O m$. This motivates us to introduce some new notions
such as associative elements, conjugate associative elements, cyclic elements.
We can characterize octonion modules in terms of these notions.
  It turns out that octonions admit two distinct structures of octonion
modules, and moreover, the direct sum of their several copies exhaust all
octonion modules with finite dimensions.

of certain infrared-active lattice vibrations has been shown to induce
transient features in the reflectivity suggestive of non-equilibrium
superconductivity. Yet, a microscopic mechanism for these observations is still
lacking. Here, we report measurements of time- and scattering-angle-dependent
second-harmonic generation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, taken under the same
excitation conditions that result in superconductor-like terahertz
reflectivity. We discover a three-order-of-magnitude amplification of a
2.5-terahertz electronic mode, which is unique because of its symmetry,
momentum, and temperature dependence. A theory for parametric three-wave
amplification of Josephson plasmons, which are assumed to be well-formed below
T$_c$ but overdamped throughout the pseudogap phase, explains all these

stabilize fluctuating orders in quantum materials.

methods, while $\ell_n$-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box
regression, it is not tailored to the evaluation metric, i.e., Intersection
over Union (IoU). Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been
proposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow
convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU
(DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box
and the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU
losses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding
box regression, \ie, overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio,
based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to
faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU
losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD
and Faster RCNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU
metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into
non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting
performance improvement. The source code and trained models are available at

degeneration, due to the loss discontinuity resulted from the inherent

This problem is further pronounced given the regression inconsistency among

the non-intrusive and adaptive construction of sparse polynomial chaos
expansions (PCEs). Unlike pseudo-spectral projection and regression-based
stochastic collocation methods, the proposed approach results in PCEs featuring
one polynomial term per collocation point. Moreover, the resulting PCEs are
interpolating, i.e., they are exact on the interpolation nodes/collocation
points. Once available, an interpolating PCE can be used as an inexpensive
surrogate model, or be post-processed for the purposes of uncertainty
quantification and sensitivity analysis. The main idea is conceptually simple
and relies on the use of Leja sequence points as interpolation nodes. Using
Newton-like, hierarchical basis polynomials defined upon Leja sequences, a
sparse-grid interpolation can be derived, the basis polynomials of which are
unique in terms of their multivariate degrees. A dimension-adaptive scheme can
be employed for the construction of an anisotropic interpolation. Due to the
degree uniqueness, a one-to-one transform to orthogonal polynomials of the
exact same degrees is possible and shall result in an interpolating PCE.
However, since each Leja node defines a unique Newton basis polynomial, an
implicit one-to-one map between Leja nodes and orthogonal basis polynomials
exists as well. Therefore, the in-between steps of hierarchical interpolation
and basis transform can be discarded altogether, and the interpolating PCE can
be computed directly. For directly computed, adaptive, anisotropic
interpolating PCEs, the dimension-adaptive algorithm is modified accordingly. A
series of numerical experiments verify the suggested approach in both low and
moderately high-dimensional settings, as well as for various input
distributions.

mass) under current constraints, we consider a scenario where $h_2$ is the
SM-like Higgs, $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ is singlino-dominated LSP,
$\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}$ are mass-degenerated, light
and higgsino-dominated NLSPs (next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles). We
investigate the constraints to these NLSPs from searching for SUSY particles at
the LHC Run-I and Run-II, discuss the possibility of discovering these NLSPs in
the future, and come to the following conclusions: (i) With all data of Run I
and up to 36 $\rm fb^{-1}$ data of Run II at the LHC, the search results by
ATLAS and CMS can still not exclude the higgsino-dominated NLSPs of
$100\sim200$ GeV. (ii) When the mass difference with $\tilde{\chi}^0_{1}$ is
smaller than $m_{h_2}$, $\tilde{\chi}^0_{2}$ and $\tilde{\chi}^0_{3}$ have
opposite preference on decaying to $Z/Z^*$ or $h_1$. (iii) When the mass
difference between NLSP and LSP is larger than $m_Z$, most of the samples can
be checked at $5\sigma$ level with future 300 $\rm fb^{-1}$ data at the LHC.
While with 3000 $\rm fb^{-1}$ data at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), nearly
all of the samples can be checked at $5\sigma$ level even if the mass
difference is insufficient. (iv) The $a_1$ funnel and the $h_2/Z$ funnel
mechanisms for the singlino-dominated LSP annihilating can not be distinguished
by searching for NLSPs.

some objective function $\varphi$ subject to these constraints is at most a
given value $k$. We approach this problem using the framework of property
testing where our goal is to distinguish the case $\varphi(S) \le k$ from the
case that at least an $\epsilon$ fraction of the constraints in $S$ need to be
removed for $\varphi(S) \le k$ to hold. We restrict our attention to the case
where $(S, \varphi)$ are LP-Type problems which is a rich family of
combinatorial optimization problems with an inherent geometric structure. By
utilizing a simple sampling procedure which has been used previously to study
these problems, we are able to create property testers for any LP-Type problem
whose query complexities are independent of the number of constraints. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that connects the area of LP-Type
problems and property testing in a systematic way. Among our results is a tight
upper bound on the query complexity of testing clusterability with one cluster
considered by Alon, Dar, Parnas, and Ron (FOCS 2000). We also supply a
corresponding tight lower bound for this problem and other LP-Type problems

establish correspondences between 3D object keypoints and 2D image locations

This two-stage process, however, is suboptimal: First, it is not end-to-end
trainable. Second, training the deep network relies on a surrogate loss that
does not directly reflect the final 6D pose estimation task.
  In this work, we introduce a deep architecture that directly regresses 6D
poses from correspondences. It takes as input a group of candidate
correspondences for each 3D keypoint and accounts for the fact that the order
of the correspondences within each group is irrelevant, while the order of the
groups, that is, of the 3D keypoints, is fixed. Our architecture is generic and
can thus be exploited in conjunction with existing correspondence-extraction
networks so as to yield single-stage 6D pose estimation frameworks. Our
experiments demonstrate that these single-stage frameworks consistently
outperform their two-stage counterparts in terms of both accuracy and speed.

experimentally investigated at a freestream supersonic Mach number of 2.0 at
0$^\circ$ angle of attack. Three different forebody configurations mounted with
a sharp spike-tip ranging from blunt to streamlined (flat-face, hemispherical,
and elliptical) are considered. Steady and unsteady pressure measurements,
short-exposure high-speed shadowgraphy, shock footprint analysis from $x-t$
plots, and identification of dominant spatiotemporal modes through modal
analysis are carried out to explain the unsteady flow physics. The present
investigation tools are validated against the well-known events of `pulsation'
associated with the flat-face case. The hemispherical case is characterized by
the formation of a separated free shear layer and associated localized shock
oscillations. The cycle of charging and ejection of fluid mass from the
recirculation zone, confined between the separated shear layer and the spiked
body, is identified to drive the flow unsteadiness. Such an event triggers the
out-of-phase motion between the separated and reattachment shocks. In the
elliptical case, the overall flow field resembles that of the hemispherical
case, except with dampened unsteadiness. The value of the cone angle
($\lambda$) associated with the recirculation region is found to be responsible
for the fluctuations from the charging and ejection of fluid mass. Thereby it
controls the extent of out-of-shock phase motion. In the elliptical case,
$\lambda$ is observed to be smaller and exhibits a reduction in shock
unsteadiness. \hlt{Based on the gathered results and understanding, the
reduction in unsteadiness associated with the aerodisk mounted on the
hemispherical forebody is explained via the almost complete elimination of the
out-of-phase shock motion.

well. In this case, the feature extraction and pattern matching stages of our

Dynamic Observatory (SDO) mission make this domain particularly interesting for
the development and testing of deep learning systems. The currently available
labeled solar data is generated by the SDO mission's Feature Finding Team's

that detection and labeling is performed with a cadence of every 4 to 12 hours,
depending on the module. Since SDO image data products are created every 10
seconds, there is a considerable gap between labeled observations and the
continuous data stream. In order to address this shortcoming, we trained a deep
regression network to track the movement of two solar phenomena: Active Region

attempt of solar event tracking using a deep learning approach. Since it is
impossible to fully evaluate the performance of the suggested event tracks with

observed redshifts, breaking the translational invariance of galaxy clustering
down to a rotational invariance around the observer. This becomes important
when the line-of-sight direction varies significantly across a survey, leading
to what are known as `wide angle' effects in redshift space distortions.
Wide-angle effects will also be present in measurements of the momentum field,
i.e. the galaxy density-weighted velocity field, in upcoming peculiar velocity
surveys. In this work we study how wide-angle effects modify the predicted
correlation function and power spectrum for momentum statistics, both in
auto-correlation and in cross-correlation with the density field. Using both
linear theory and the Zeldovich approximation, we find that deviations from the
plane-parallel limit are large and could become important in data analysis for
low redshift surveys. We point out that even multipoles in the
cross-correlation between density and momentum are non-zero regardless of the
choice of line of sight, and therefore contain new cosmological information
that could be exploited. We discuss configuration-space, Fourier-space and
spherical analyses, providing exact expressions in each case rather than
relying on an expansion in small angles. We hope these expressions will be of
use in the analysis of upcoming surveys for redshift-space distortions and

needed in a cluster to achieve the same performance. The utilization increase
to almost 100% in leads to a 2x energy efficiency improvement in a multi-core
cluster. The extension reduces instruction fetches by up to 3.5x and
instruction cache power consumption by up to 5.6x. Compilers can automatically

two player, zero-sum games on graphs. The game proceeds as follows. We place a
token on some vertex in the graph and assign budgets to the two players. Each
turn, each player submits a sealed legal bid (non-negative and below their
remaining budget), which is deducted from their budget and the highest bidder
moves the token onto an adjacent vertex. The game ends once a sink is reached,
and \PO pays \PT the outcome that is associated with the sink. The players
attempt to maximize their expected outcome. Our games model settings where
effort (of no inherent value) needs to be invested in an ongoing and stateful
manner. On the negative side, we show that even in simple games on DAGs,
optimal strategies may require a distribution over bids with infinite support.
A central quantity in bidding games is the {\em ratio} of the players budgets.
On the positive side, we show a simple FPTAS for DAGs, that, for each budget
ratio, outputs an approximation for the optimal strategy for that ratio. We
also implement it, show that it performs well, and suggests interesting
properties of these games. Then, given an outcome $c$, we show an algorithm for
finding the necessary and sufficient initial ratio for guaranteeing outcome $c$
with probability~$1$ and a strategy ensuring such. Finally, while the general
case has not previously been studied, solving the specific game in which \PO
wins iff he wins the first two auctions, has been long stated as an open

Predicting future overweight or obesity early in the childhood reliably could

predictive modeling, in particular, remain mainly unexplored. In predictive
modeling models are validated with previously unseen examples, giving a more
accurate estimate of their performance and generalization ability in real-life
scenarios.
  Objective: To find and review existing overweight or obesity research from
the perspective of employing childhood data and predictive modeling methods.
  Methods: The initial phase included bibliographic searches using relevant
search terms in PubMed, IEEE database and Google Scholar. The second phase
consisted of iteratively searching references of potential studies and recent
research that cite the potential studies.
  Results: Eight research articles and three review articles were identified as
relevant for this review.
  Conclusions: Prediction models with high performance either have a relatively
short time period to predict or/and are based on late childhood data. Logistic
regression is currently the most often used method in forming the prediction
models. In addition to child's own weight and height information, maternal
weight status or body mass index was often used as predictors in the models.

efficiency and generalisation to unseen visuals such as distractors
(task-independent aspects of the observation space). Visual domain
randomisation encourages transfer by training over visual factors of variation
that may be encountered in the target domain. This increases learning
complexity, can negatively impact learning rate and performance, and requires
knowledge of potential variations during deployment. In this paper, we
introduce Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning (APRiL) which uses a
self-supervised attention mechanism to significantly alleviate these drawbacks:
by focusing on task-relevant aspects of the observations, attention provides
robustness to distractors as well as significantly increased learning
efficiency. APRiL trains two attention-augmented actor-critic agents: one
purely based on image observations, available across training and transfer
domains; and one with access to privileged information (such as environment
states) available only during training. Experience is shared between both
agents and their attention mechanisms are aligned. The image-based policy can
then be deployed without access to privileged information. We experimentally
demonstrate accelerated and more robust learning on a diverse set of domains,
leading to improved final performance for environments both within and outside
the training distribution.

vast criminal organisations. Among these forms of malware, ransomware has
experienced a significant recent rise as it offers the perpetrators great
financial incentive. Ransomware variants operate by removing system access from
the user by either locking the system or encrypting some or all of the data,
and subsequently demanding payment or ransom in exchange for returning system
access or providing a decryption key to the victim. Due to the ubiquity of
sensitive data in many aspects of modern life, many victims of such attacks, be
they an individual home user or operators of a business, are forced to pay the
ransom to regain access to their data, which in many cases does not happen as

the underlying forces driving and facilitating such attacks in order to create
preventative measures. As such, in this paper, we discuss and provide further

for linear and parametric drive, but generic for all higher-order resonances.
Here, we focus at zero temperature on the relaxation dynamics towards a
stationary state starting initially from a domain around a classical fixed
point in phase space. Beyond a certain threshold for the driving strength, the
long-time dynamics is governed by a single time constant that sets the rate for
switching between different states with broken time translation symmetry. By
analyzing the lowest eigenvalues of the corresponding time evolution generator
for the dissipative dynamics, we find that near the threshold the gap between
these eigenvalues nearly closes. The closing becomes complete for a vanishing
quantum parameter. We demonstrate that this behavior, reminiscent of a quantum
phase transition, is associated with a transition from a stationary state which
is localized in phase space to a delocalized one. We further show, that
switching between domains of classical fixed points happens via quantum
activation, however, with rates that differ from those obtained by a standard
semiclassical treatment. As period tripling has been explored with
superconducting circuits mainly in the quasi-classical regime recently, our
findings may trigger new activities towards the deep quantum realm.

an opaque abstraction of RAM, backed by demand paging. However, most systems
today (from phones to data-centers) do not page, and indeed may require the
performance benefits of non-paged physical memory, precise NUMA allocation,
etc. Moreover, MMU hardware is now useful for other purposes, such as detecting
page access or providing large page translation. Accordingly, the venerable VM
abstraction in OSes like Windows and Linux has acquired a plethora of extra
APIs to poke at the policy behind the illusion of a virtual address space.
  Instead, we present Cichlid, a memory system which inverts this model.
Applications explicitly manage their physical RAM of different types, and
directly (though safely) program the translation hardware. Cichlid is
implemented in Barrelfish, requires no virtualization support, and outperforms
VMM-based approaches for all but the smallest working sets. We show that
Cichlid enables use-cases for virtual memory not possible in Linux today, and
other use-cases are simple to program and significantly faster.

in order to grasp what a community cares about. To that end, an excellent
source of information on what occurs in a community is the news, especially in
recent years, when mass media giants use social networks to communicate and
interact with their audience. In this work, we use a method to discover latent
topics in tweets from Colombian Twitter news accounts in order to identify the
most prominent events in the country. We pay particular attention to security,
violence and crime-related tweets because of the violent environment that
surrounds Colombian society. The latent topic discovery method that we use
builds vector representations of the tweets by using FastText and finds
clusters of tweets through the K-means clustering algorithm. The number of
clusters is found by measuring the $C_V$ coherence for a range of number of
topics of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. We finally use Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction to
visualise the tweets vectors. Once the clusters related to security, violence
and crime are identified, we proceed to apply the same method within each
cluster to perform a fine-grained analysis in which specific events mentioned
in the news are grouped together. Our method is able to discover event-specific
sets of news, which is the baseline to perform an extensive analysis of how
people engage in Twitter threads on the different types of news, with an
emphasis on security, violence and crime-related tweets.

that contains images on Wikipedia, for which how to represent multimodal data
is the critical component. Most deep multimodal learning methods typically
involve two steps to construct the joint representations: 1) learning of
multiple intermediate features, with each intermediate feature corresponding to
a modality, using separate and independent deep models; 2) merging the
intermediate features into a joint representation using a fusion strategy.
However, in the first step, these intermediate features do not have previous
knowledge of each other and cannot fully exploit the information contained in
the other modalities. In this paper, we present a modal-aware operation as a
generic building block to capture the non-linear dependences among the
heterogeneous intermediate features that can learn the underlying correlation
structures in other multimodal data as soon as possible. The modal-aware
operation consists of a kernel network and an attention network. The kernel
network is utilized to learn the non-linear relationships with other
modalities. Then, to learn better representations for binary hash codes, we
present an attention network that finds the informative regions of these
modal-aware features that are favorable for retrieval. Experiments conducted on
three public benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in the
performance of our method relative to state-of-the-art methods.

employing this definition, a measurement procedure is developed which defines
uniquely the property entropy in a broad domain of states, which could include
\textit{in principle}, even some non-equilibrium states of few-particle
systems, provided they are separable and uncorrelated. Finally, the domain of
validity of the definition is extended, possibly to every state of every

offers a comprehensive collection of nodes for sophisticated visualization

AViS uses physically-based rendering techniques, improving the 3D perception of
molecular structures for interactive visualization. By performing two case

small energy deposits within their volume via their supernova instability. In
this paper, we consider the ways a galactic abundance of
$\mathcal{O}(1)$-charged massive relics (i.e., CHAMPs) could trigger this
instability, thereby destroying old WD. The dense central core structure formed
inside the WD when heavy CHAMPs sink to its center can trigger a supernova via
injection of energy during collapse phases, via direct density-enhanced
(pycnonuclear) fusion processes of carbon nuclei dragged into the core by the
CHAMPs, or via the formation of a black hole (BH) at the center of the WD. In
the latter scenario, Hawking radiation from the BH can ignite the star if the
BH forms with a sufficiently small mass; if the BH instead forms at large
enough mass, heating of carbon nuclei that accrete onto the BH as it grows in
size may be able to achieve the same outcome (with the conservative alternative
being simply that the WD is devoured by the BH). The known existence of old WD
that have not been destroyed by these mechanisms allows us to improve by many
orders of magnitude on the existing CHAMP abundance constraints in the regime
of large CHAMP mass, $m_X \sim 10^{11}$-$10^{18}\,$GeV. Additionally, in
certain regions of parameter space, we speculate that this setup could provide
a trigger mechanism for the calcium-rich gap transients: a class of anomalous,
sub-luminous supernova events that occur far outside of a host galaxy.

using an improved computational method. Specifically, the Hermite transform is
employed for transforming Wick-type stochastic nonlinear partial differential
equations into deterministic nonlinear partial differential equations with

shock fronts induced by galaxy cluster mergers. The actual particle
acceleration mechanism at the shock fronts is still under debate. The galaxy
cluster 1RXS J0603.3+4214 hosts one of the most intriguing examples of radio
relics, known as the Toothbrush. We present new wideband radio continuum
observations made with uGMRT and VLA. Our new observations, in combination with
previously published data, allowed us to carry out a detailed high spatial
resolution spectral and curvature analysis of the known diffuse radio emission
sources, over a broad range of frequencies. The integrated spectrum of the
Toothbrush follows closely a power law over close to 2 decades in frequency,
with a spectral index of $-1.16\pm0.02$. We do not find any evidence of
spectral steepening below 8 GHz. The subregions of the Toothbrush show an
identical spectral slopes, suggesting that observed spectral index is rather
set by the distribution of Mach numbers which may have a similar shape at
different parts of the shock front. Indeed, numerical simulations show an
intriguing similar spectral index, indicating that the radio spectrum is
dominated by the average over the inhomogeneities within the shock, with most
of the emission coming from the tail of the Mach number distribution. In
contrast to the Toothbrush, the spectrum of the fainter relics show a high
frequency steepening. The integrated spectrum of the halo follows a power law
from 150 MHz to 3 GHz with a spectral index of $-1.16\pm0.04$. We do not find
any evidence for spectral curvature, not even in subareas of the halo. This
suggest a homogeneous acceleration throughout the cluster volume. Between the
brush region of the Toothbrush and the halo, the color-color analysis revealed
emission that was consistent with an overlap between the two different spectral
regions.

cannot provide a comprehensive support for CNN development in popular

propose the FeCaffe, i.e. FPGA-enabled Caffe, a hierarchical software and
hardware design methodology based on the Caffe to enable FPGA to support
mainline deep learning development features, e.g. training and inference with
Caffe. Furthermore, we provide some benchmarks with FeCaffe by taking some
classical CNN networks as examples, and further analysis of kernel execution
time in details accordingly. Finally, some optimization directions including
FPGA kernel design, system pipeline, network architecture, user case
application and heterogeneous platform levels, have been proposed gradually to
improve FeCaffe performance and efficiency. The result demonstrates the
proposed FeCaffe is capable of supporting almost full features during CNN
network training and inference respectively with high degree of design
flexibility, expansibility and reusability for deep learning development.
Compared to prior studies, our architecture can support more network and
training settings, and current configuration can achieve 6.4x and 8.4x average
execution time improvement for forward and backward respectively for LeNet.

three-dimensional (3D) isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations is
considered. First, when viscosity coefficients are given as a constant multiple
of density's power ($(\rho^\epsilon)^\delta$ with $\delta>1$), for regular
solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem, via introducing one
""quasi-symmetric hyperbolic""--""degenerate elliptic"" coupled structure to
control the behavior of the velocity near the vacuum, we establish the uniform
energy estimates for the local sound speed in $H^3$ and
$(\rho^\epsilon)^{\frac{\delta-1}{2}}$ in $H^2$ with respect to the viscosity
coefficients for arbitrarily large time under some smallness assumption on the
initial density. Second, by making full use of this structure's quasi-symmetric
property and the weak smooth effect on solutions, we prove the strong
convergence of the regular solutions of the degenerate viscous flow to that of
the inviscid flow with vacuum in $H^2$ for arbitrarily large time. The result
here applies to a class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients,
is independent of the B-D relation for viscosities, and seems to be the first
on the global-in-time inviscid limit of smooth solutions which have large
velocities and contain vacuum state for compressible flow in three space
dimensions without any symmetric assumption.

large strategy space, it remains an open question how one can efficiently learn
in these games. In this work, we show that the online CB and HS games can be
cast as path planning problems with side-observations (SOPPP): at each stage, a
learner chooses a path on a directed acyclic graph and suffers the sum of
losses that are adversarially assigned to the corresponding edges; and she then
receives semi-bandit feedback with side-observations (i.e., she observes the
losses on the chosen edges plus some others). We propose a novel algorithm,
EXP3-OE, the first-of-its-kind with guaranteed efficient running time for SOPPP
without requiring any auxiliary oracle. We provide an expected-regret bound of
EXP3-OE in SOPPP matching the order of the best benchmark in the literature.
Moreover, we introduce additional assumptions on the observability model under
which we can further improve the regret bounds of EXP3-OE. We illustrate the
benefit of using EXP3-OE in SOPPP by applying it to the online CB and HS games.

from the motion of the embedded fuel tank. Comparing the free motion of the
airfoil without sloshing tank to the free motion of the airfoil with a
partially-filled fuel tank shows that the effects of sloshing on the
aeroelastic motion of the aero-structural system. The effectiveness of the
predictions from RNN are then assessed by comparing with the results from the
high-fidelity coupled aero-structural-fuel tank sloshing simulations. It is
demonstrated that the surrogate models can accurately and economically predict

simple but effective way that improves the performance of generative
adversarial network (GAN) without imposing the training overhead or modifying
the network architectures of existing methods. The proposed method employs a
novel cascading rejection (CR) module for discriminator, which extracts
multiple non-overlapped features in an iterative manner using the vector
rejection operation. Since the extracted diverse features prevent the
discriminator from concentrating on non-meaningful features, the discriminator
can guide the generator effectively to produce the images that are more similar
to the real images. In addition, since the proposed CR module requires only a
few simple vector operations, it can be readily applied to existing frameworks
with marginal training overheads. Quantitative evaluations on various datasets

is revolutionising many aspects of scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM). The widespread adoption of these new technologies is impeded by the
technical challenges associated with them. These include issues related to
hardware control, and the acquisition, real-time processing and visualisation,
and storage of data from such detectors. We discuss these problems and present
software solutions for them, with a view to making the benefits of new
detectors in the context of STEM more accessible. Throughout, we provide
examples of the application of the technologies presented, using data from a
Medipix3 direct electron detector. Most of our software is available under an
open source licence, permitting transparency of the implemented algorithms, and
allowing the community to freely use and further improve upon them.

  in Firefighters from Heart-rate Variability (HRV) Data",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we perform a study of various unsupervised methods to identify
mental stress in firefighter trainees based on unlabeled heart rate variability
data. We collect RR interval time series data from nearly 100 firefighter
trainees that participated in a drill. We explore and compare three methods in
order to perform unsupervised stress detection: 1) traditional K-Means
clustering with engineered time and frequency domain features 2) convolutional
autoencoders and 3) long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders, both trained on
the raw RRI measurements combined with DBSCAN clustering and
K-Nearest-Neighbors classification. We demonstrate that K-Means combined with
engineered features is unable to capture meaningful structure within the data.
On the other hand, convolutional and LSTM autoencoders tend to extract varying
structure from the data pointing to different clusters with different sizes of
clusters. We attempt at identifying the true stressed and normal clusters using
the HRV markers of mental stress reported in the literature. We demonstrate
that the clusters produced by the convolutional autoencoders consistently and
successfully stratify stressed versus normal samples, as validated by several
established physiological stress markers such as RMSSD, Max-HR, Mean-HR and
LF-HF ratio.

technologies is a growing priority in HCI and other fields. One idea gaining
prominence centers on ""data dividends"", or sharing the profits of AI
technologies with the people who generated the data on which these technologies
rely. Despite the rapidly growing discussion around data dividends - including
backing by prominent politicians - there exists little guidance about how data
dividends might be designed and little information about if they will work. In
this paper, we begin the process of developing a concrete design space for data
dividends. We additionally simulate the effects of a variety of important
design decisions using well-known datasets and algorithms. We find that
seemingly innocuous decisions can create counterproductive effects, e.g.
severely concentrated dividends and demographic disparities. Overall, the
outcomes we observe -- both desirable and undesirable -- highlight the need for
dividend implementers to make design decisions cautiously.

knowledge and research work in the area of managing IT projects successfully.
The office of Government commerce of the UK Government in conjunction with the
National Audit came out with a guideline in 2007 which list out eight causes of
project failures. Six out of the eight causes were attributed to governance
issues (Aon, 2011). This shows clearly that governance activities in project
management are really important, and failure to place premium on them can
result in failure of projects. The research work was therefore intended to come
out with IT governance frameworks that can help resolve the problem of failure
of IT projects resulting from governance issues. Four IT program managers and
eight IT project managers were talked to on a variety of IT project governance
issues. The frameworks were developed based on a combination of literature,
experts (IT project and program managers of the telecom industry in Ghana)
input, observation, and so on. The governance frameworks depicts project
management processes, project activities, project governance activities, roles
and responsibilities of key stakeholders, key milestones, approval bodies,
signatures, and so on, to ensure successful delivery of IT projects.

electromechanical and magnetomechanical coupling effects observed in solid
continua. Using a space-time pseudo-Riemannian metric in a finite-deformation
setup and exploiting the local conformal symmetry of the Lagrangian, we derive
Cauchy-Maxwell (CM) equations that seamlessly combine, for the first time,
Cauchy's elasto-dynamic equations with Maxwell's equations for
electromagnetism. Maxwell's equations for vacuum are recoverable from our
model, which in itself also constitutes a new derivation of these equations.
With deformation gradient and material velocity coupled in the Lagrange
density, various pseudo-forces appear in the Euler-Lagrange equations. These
forces, not identifiable through classical continuum mechanics, may have
significance under specific geometric or loading conditions. As a limited
illustration on how the CM equations work, we carry out semi-analytical
studies, viz. on an infinite body subject to isochoric deformation and a finite
membrane under both tensile and transverse loading, considering
piezoelectricity and piezomagnetism. Our results show that under specific
loading frequencies and tension, electric and magnetic potentials may increase
rapidly in some regions of the membrane. This may have significance in future
studies on efficient energy harvesting.

electrodeposition of alginate membrane with trapped CuO nanoparticles on top of
the electrodes. The electrodes are fabricated at a thin polyimide support and
the soft nature of the membrane can withstand mechanical stress far beyond the
requirements for skin monitoring. We further show the efficient detection of
ascorbic acid at the micromolar levels in both, a neutral buffer and acidic
artificial sweat, at ultra-low applied potential (-5 mV). The effect of
possible interfering species present in sweat is minimized, with no observable
cross-reaction, thus maintaining a high degree of selectivity despite absence
of enzymes in the fabrication scheme. This sensor is envisioned as a promising
component of a wearable device for e.g. non-invasive monitoring of
micronutrient loss through sweat.
