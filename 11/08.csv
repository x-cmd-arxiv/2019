points drawn from a topological space with higher homology groups on its
filtration. The technique is based on Voronoi tessellation, which induces a
natural dual map to the Delaunay triangulation. Advantage is taken from this
fact calculating the persistent homology on it after each iteration to capture
the changing topology of the data. The boundary points are identified as
critical. The Bottleneck and Wasserstein distance serve as a measure of quality
between the original point set and the interpolation. If the norm of two
distances exceeds a heuristically determined threshold, the algorithm
terminates. We give the theoretical basis for this approach and justify its
validity with numerical experiments.

polarized manifold, we give a general big Picard theorem for a holomorphic
curve on a log-smooth pair $(X,D)$ such that $W=X\setminus D$ admits a Finsler
pseudometric that is strongly negatively curved when pulled back to the curve.
We show, by some refinements of the classical Viehweg-Zuo construction, that
this latter condition holds for the base space $W$, if nonsingular, of any
algebraic family of polarized complex projective manifolds with semi-ample
canonical bundles whose induced moduli map $\phi$ to the moduli space of such
manifolds is generically finite and any $\phi$-horizontal holomorphic curve in
$W$. This yields the big Picard theorem for any holomorphic curves in the base
space $U$ of such an algebraic family by allowing this base space to be
singular but with generically finite moduli map. An immediate and useful
corollary is that any holomorphic map from an algebraic variety to such a base
space $U$ must be algebraic, i.e., the corresponding holomorphic family must be
algebraic. We also show the related algebraic hyperbolicity property of such a
base space $U$, which generalizes previous Arakelov inequalities and weak
boundedness results for moduli stacks and offers, in addition to the Picard
theorem above, another evidence in favor of the hyperbolic embeddability of
such an $U$.

\ll k = |G|^{o(1)}$). A conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985) asserts, for
$k\gg\log|G|$, that the random walk on this graph exhibits cutoff.
  When $\log k \lesssim \log\log|G|$ (ie $k = (\log |G|)^{\mathcal O(1)}$), the
only example of a non-Abelian group for which cutoff has been established is
the dihedral group. We establish cutoff (as $p\to infty$) for the group of $d
\times d$ unit upper triangular matrices with integer entries modulo $p$
(prime), which we denote $U_{p,d}$, for fixed $d$ or $d$ diverging sufficiently
slowly. We allow $1 \ll k \lesssim \log |U_{p,d}|$ as well as
$k\gg\log|U_{p,d}|$. The cutoff time is $\max\{\log_k |U_{p,d}|, \: s_0 k\}$,
where $s_0$ is the time at which the entropy of the random walk on $\mathbb Z$
reaches $(\log |U_{p,d}^\mathrm{ab}|)/k$, where $U_{p,d}^\mathrm{ab} \cong
\mathbb Z_p^{d-1}$ is the Abelianisation of $U_{p,d}$. When $1 \ll k \ll \log
|U_{p,d}^\mathrm{ab}|$ and $d \asymp 1$, we find the limit profile. We also
prove highly related results for the $d$-dimensional Heisenberg group over
$\mathbb Z_p$.
  The Aldous--Diaconis conjecture also asserts, for $k gg\log |G|$, that the
cutoff time should depend only on $k$ and $|G|$. This was verified for all
Abelian groups. Our result shows that this is not the case for $U_{p,d}$: the
cutoff time depends on $k$, $|U_{p,d}| = p^{d(d-1)/2}$ and
$|U_{p,d}^\mathrm{ab}|=p^{d-1}$.
  We also show that all but $o(|U_{p,d}|)$ of the elements of $U_{p,d}$ lie at
graph distance $M \pm o(M)$ from the identity, where $M$ is the minimal radius
of a ball in $\mathbb Z^k$ of cardinality $|U_{p,d}^\mathrm{ab}| = p^{d-1}$.
Finally, we show that the diameter is also asymptotically $M$ when $k \gtrsim

independent, luminosity dependent indicators to probe the relaxedness of their
groups; the magnitude gap between the two most luminous galaxies ($\Delta
M_{12}$), and offset between BGG and the luminosity center ($D_{offset}$) of
the group. Combined, these two indicators were previously found useful for
identifying relaxed and unrelaxed groups. We find that the BGGs of unrelaxed
groups have significantly bluer NUV-r colours than in relaxed groups. This is
also true at the fixed sersic index. We find the bluer colours cannot be
explained away by differing dust fraction, suggesting there are real
differences in their stellar populations. SFRs derived from SED-fitting tend to
be higher in unrelaxed systems. This is in part because of a greater fraction
of BGGs with non-elliptical morphology, but also because unrelaxed systems have
larger numbers of mergers, some of which may bring fuel for star formation. The
SED-fitted stellar metallicities of BGGs in unrelaxed systems also tend to be
higher by around 0.05 dex, perhaps because their building blocks were more
massive. We find that the $\Delta M_{12}$ parameter is the most important
parameter behind the observed differences in the relaxed/unrelaxed groups, in
contrast with the previous study of Trevisan et al. (2017). We also find that
groups selected to be unrelaxed using our criteria tend to have higher velocity
offsets between the BGG and their group.

meteor in-atmosphere trajectory estimation methods may be less accurate than
others, particularly when applied to high precision optical measurements. The
comparative performance of trajectory solution methods has previously only been
examined for a small number of cases. Besides the radiant, orbital accuracy
depends on the estimation of pre-atmosphere velocities, which have both random
and systematic biases. Thus it is critical to understand the uncertainty in
velocity measurement inherent to each trajectory estimation method.
  In this first of a series of two papers, we introduce a novel meteor
trajectory estimation method which uses the observed dynamics of meteors across
stations as a global optimization function and which does not require either a
theoretical or empirical flight model to solve for velocity. We also develop a
3D observational meteor trajectory simulator that uses a meteor ablation model
to replicate the dynamics of meteoroid flight, as a means to validate different
trajectory solvers.
  We both test this new method and compare it to other methods, using synthetic
meteors from three major showers spanning a wide range of velocities and
geometries (Draconids, Geminids, Perseids). We determine which meteor
trajectory solving algorithm performs better for: all-sky, moderate field of
view, and high-precision narrow-field optical meteor detection systems. The
results are presented in the second paper in this series. Finally, we give
detailed equations for estimating meteor trajectories and analytically
computing meteoroid orbits, and provide the Python code of the methodology as
open source software.

decay of small-amplitude perturbations around a steady-state solution of a
dynamical system. In fluid flows, exponentially growing perturbations can
initiate departure from laminar flow and trigger transition to turbulence.
Although flow of a Newtonian fluid through a pipe is linearly stable for very
large values of the Reynolds number ($Re \sim 10^7$), a transition to
turbulence often occurs for $Re$ as low as $1500$. When a dilute polymer
solution is used in the place of a Newtonian fluid, the transitional value of
the Reynolds number decreases even further. Using the spectral collocation
method and Oldroyd-B constitutive equation, Garg et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett.
121:024502, 2018) claimed that such a transition in viscoelastic fluids is
related to linear instability. Since differential matrices in the collocation
method become ill-conditioned when a large number of basis functions is used,
we revisit this problem using the well-conditioned spectral integration method.
We show modal stability of viscoelastic pipe flow for a broad range of fluid
elasticities and polymer concentrations, including cases considered by Garg et
al. Similarly, we find that plane Poiseuille flow is linearly stable for cases
where Garg et al. report instability. In both channel and pipe flows, we
establish the existence of spurious modes that diverge slowly with finer
discretization and demonstrate that these can be mistaken for grid-independent
modes if the discretization is not fine enough.

intelligence in health care. In particular, deep learning approaches have been
successfully applied for automated and assisted disease diagnosis and prognosis
based on complex and high-dimensional data. However, despite all justified
enthusiasm, overoptimistic assessments of predictive performance are still
common. Automated medical testing devices based on machine-learned prediction
models should thus undergo a throughout evaluation before being implemented
into clinical practice. In this work, we propose a multiple testing framework
for (comparative) phase III diagnostic accuracy studies with sensitivity and
specificity as co-primary endpoints. Our approach challenges the frequent
recommendation to strictly separate model selection and evaluation, i.e. to
only assess a single diagnostic model in the evaluation study. We show that our
parametric simultaneous test procedure asymptotically allows strong control of
the family-wise error rate. Moreover, we demonstrate in extensive simulation
studies that our multiple testing strategy on average leads to a better final
diagnostic model and increased statistical power. To plan such studies, we
propose a Bayesian approach to determine the optimal number of models to
evaluate. For this purpose, our algorithm optimizes the expected final model
performance given previous (hold-out) data from the model development phase. We
conclude that an assessment of multiple promising diagnostic models in the same

zone (HZ) boundaries for terrestrial planets of masses 0.1 M$_{E}$ and 5
M$_{E}$ around circumbinary stars of various spectral type combinations.
Specifically, we consider binary systems with host spectral types F-F, F-G,
F-K, F-M, G-G, G-K, G-M, K-K, K-M and M-M. Scaling the background N2
atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, we find that the inner edge
of the HZ moves inwards towards the star for 5ME compared to 0.1ME planets for
all spectral types. This is because the water-vapor column depth is smaller for
larger planets and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely
dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. The outer edge of the HZ changes
little due to competing effects of the albedo and greenhouse effect. While
these results are broadly consistent with the trend of single star HZ results
for different mass planets, there are significant differences between single
star and binary star systems for the inner edge of the HZ. Interesting
combinations of stellar pairs from our 1-D model results can be used to explore
for in-depth climate studies with 3-D climate models. We identify a common HZ
stellar flux domain for all circumbinary spectral types

from the automated customer support domain. First, it contains actual questions

600 training, 310 dev, and 490 evaluation question/answer pairs -- thus
reflecting the cost of creating large labeled datasets with actual data.
Consequently, TechQA is meant to stimulate research in domain adaptation rather
than being a resource to build QA systems from scratch. The dataset was
obtained by crawling the IBM Developer and IBM DeveloperWorks forums for
questions with accepted answers that appear in a published IBM Technote---a
technical document that addresses a specific technical issue. We also release a

were conducted using aerodynamic and ultrasonic haptics. Moreover, the

Although these fields cause no direct interference, the system enables the

  Intermediary Constraints",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a brand with a given budget that wants to promote a product over
multiple rounds of influencer marketing. In each round, it commissions an
influencer to promote the product over a social network, and then observes the
subsequent diffusion of the product before adaptively choosing the next
influencer to commission. This process terminates when the budget is exhausted.
We assume that the diffusion process follows the popular Independent Cascade
model. We also consider an online learning setting, where the brand initially
does not know the diffusion parameters associated with the model, and has to
gradually learn the parameters over time.
  Unlike in existing models, the rounds in our model are correlated through an
intermediary constraint: each user can be commissioned for an unlimited number
of times. However, each user will spread influence without commission at most
once. Due to this added constraint, the order in which the influencers are
chosen can change the influence spread, making obsolete existing analysis
techniques that based on the notion of adaptive submodularity. We devise a
sample path analysis to prove that a greedy policy that knows the diffusion
parameters achieves at least $1-1/e - \epsilon$ times the expected reward of
the optimal policy.
  In the online-learning setting, we are the first to consider a truly adaptive
decision making framework, rather than assuming independent epochs, and
adaptivity only within epochs. Under mild assumptions, we derive a regret bound
for our algorithm. In our numerical experiments, we simulate information
diffusions on four Twitter sub-networks, and compare our UCB-based learning
algorithms with several baseline adaptive seeding strategies. Our learning
algorithm consistently outperforms the baselines and achieves rewards close to
the greedy policy that knows the true diffusion parameters.

improvements in deep learning (DL). Both industry and academia only focus on
throughput when evaluating these AI accelerators, which usually are custom
ASICs deployed in datacenter to speed up the inference phase of DL workloads.
Pursuing higher hardware throughput such as OPS (Operation Per Second) using
various optimizations seems to be their main design target. However, they
ignore the importance of accuracy in the DL nature. Motivated by this, this
paper argue that a single throughput metric can not comprehensively reflect the
real-world performance of AI accelerators. To reveal this pitfall, we evaluates
several frequently-used optimizations on a typical AI accelerator and
quantifies their impact on accuracy and throughout under representative DL
inference workloads. Based on our experimental results, we find that some
optimizations cause significant loss on accuracy in some workloads, although it
can improves the throughout. Furthermore, our results show the importance of
end-to-end evaluation in DL.

multiple centers around the world are collecting tissue specimens from a
diverse population that varies in age, race, sex, and body size. A challenge
will be combining these heterogeneous tissue samples into a 3D reference map

the human body. Key to making alignment of tissue samples work is identifying

examine the concept of a CCF based on the vasculature and describe why it would

realistic polariton topological insulators built from small-size honeycomb

science mechanisms. Among the different correlation branches, this paper
focuses on the neural network learning models. Some of the considered models
are shallow and they get some user-defined features and learn the relationship,
while deep models extract the necessary features before learning by themselves.
Both of these paradigms are utilized in the recent intelligent transportation
systems (ITS) to support decision-making by the aid of different operations
such as frequent patterns mining, regression, clustering, and classification.
When these learners cannot generalize the results and just memorize the
training samples, they fail to support the necessities. In these cases, the
testing error is bigger than the training error. This phenomenon is addressed
as overfitting in the literature. Because, this issue decreases the reliability
of learning systems, in ITS applications, we cannot use such over-fitted
machine learning models for different tasks such as traffic prediction, the
signal controlling, safety applications, emergency responses, mode detection,
driving evaluation, etc. Besides, deep learning models use a great number of
hyper-parameters, the overfitting in deep models is more attention. To solve
this problem, the regularized learning models can be followed. The aim of this
paper is to review the approaches presented to regularize the overfitting in

dimensional datasets. The bottleneck of the SVM training often lies in the
kernel value computation. In many real-world problems, the same kernel values
are used in many iterations during the training, which makes the caching of
kernel values potentially useful. The majority of the existing studies simply
adopt the LRU (least recently used) replacement strategy for caching kernel
values. However, as we analyze in this paper, the LRU strategy generally
achieves high hit ratio near the final stage of the training, but does not work
well in the whole training process. Therefore, we propose a new caching
strategy called EFU (less frequently used) which replaces the less frequently
used kernel values that enhances LFU (least frequently used). Our experimental
results show that EFU often has 20\% higher hit ratio than LRU in the training
with the Gaussian kernel. To further optimize the strategy, we propose a
caching strategy called HCST (hybrid caching for the SVM training), which has a
novel mechanism to automatically adapt the better caching strategy in the
different stages of the training. We have integrated the caching strategy into
ThunderSVM, a recent SVM library on many-core processors. Our experiments show
that HCST adaptively achieves high hit ratios with little runtime overhead
among different problems including multi-label classification, multiclass
classification and regression problems. Compared with other existing caching
strategies, HCST achieves 20\% more reduction in training time on average.

derive a general result that a nonzero $CP$-asymmetry can be generated via at
least two sets of interfering tree-level diagrams involving either
$2\rightarrow2$ or $1\rightarrow n$ (with $n\geq3$) processes. We illustrate
this point in a simple TeV-scale extension of the Standard Model with an inert
Higgs doublet and right-handed neutrinos, along with an electroweak-triplet
scalar field, where small Majorana neutrino masses are generated via a
combination of radiative type-I and tree-level type-II seesaw mechanisms. The
imaginary part needed for the required $CP$-asymmetry comes from the trilinear
coupling of the inert doublet with the triplet scalar, along with the width of
the triplet scalar mediator. The real part of the neutral component of the
inert doublet serves as a cold dark matter candidate. The evolutions of the

where the current neural encoder-decoder framework is inadequate. However, it
has so far not been explored in the neural encoder-decoder system for text
generation. In this work, we define diminishing attentions with submodular
functions and in turn, prove the submodularity of the effective neural
coverage. The greedy algorithm approximating the solution to the submodular
maximization problem is not suited to attention score optimization in
auto-regressive generation. Therefore instead of following how submodular
function has been widely used, we propose a simplified yet principled solution.
The resulting attention module offers an architecturally simple and empirically
effective method to improve the coverage of neural text generation. We run
experiments on three directed text generation tasks with different levels of
recovering rate, across two modalities, three different neural model
architectures and two training strategy variations. The results and analyses
demonstrate that our method generalizes well across these settings, produces
texts of good quality and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Improvement in the statistical and systematic uncertainties is possible with
more efficient use of molecules from the source and better magnetometry in the

is long enough that its decay during the time of flight in the ACME beam

lens that increases the fraction of molecules detected downstream. The measured
magnetic moment of the $Q$ state is also large enough to be used as a sensitive
co-magnetometer in ACME. Finally, we show that the $Q$ state has a large
transition dipole moment to the $C~(^1\Pi_1)$ state, which allows for efficient
population transfer between the ground state $X~(^1\Sigma^+)$ and the $Q$ state

generalize the multivariate normal by randomizing (or mixing) the covariance
matrix via multiplication by a non-negative random variable W. The multivariate
t distribution is an example of such mixture, where W has an inverse-gamma
distribution. Algorithms to compute the joint distribution function and perform
parameter estimation for the multivariate normal and t (with integer degrees of
freedom) can be found in the literature and are implemented in, e.g., the R
package mvtnorm. In this paper, efficient algorithms to perform these tasks in
the general case of a normal variance mixture are proposed. In addition to the
above two tasks, the evaluation of the joint (logarithmic) density function of
a general normal variance mixture is tackled as well, as it is needed for
parameter estimation and does not always exist in closed form in this more
general setup. For the evaluation of the joint distribution function, the
proposed algorithms apply randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in a way
that improves upon existing methods proposed for the multivariate normal and t
distributions. An adaptive RQMC algorithm that similarly exploits the superior
convergence properties of RQMC methods is presented for the task of evaluating
the joint log-density function. This allows the parameter estimation task to be
accomplished via an EM-like algorithm where all weights and log-densities are
numerically estimated. It is demonstrated through numerical examples that the
suggested algorithms are quite fast; even for high dimensions around 1000 the
distribution function can be estimated with moderate accuracy using only a few
seconds of run time. Even log-densities around -100 can be estimated accurately

Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for solving distributed DC

under varying load, the method trains a recurrent neural network (RNN) to
predict the converged values of dual and consensus variables. Given a new
realization of system load, a small number of initial ADMM iterations is taken

The proposed method has several advantages: it maintains the security of

improve time to convergence but, by construction, can never result in
infeasible ADMM subproblems; it can be easily integrated into existing software

the thermodynamic arrow of time; the latter is related to the wormhole and

slices and the temporal information is contained either in second-post contrast

  Sub-quadratic Time and Space","Accepted by NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quadratic regression involves modeling the response as a (generalized) linear
function of not only the features $x^{j_1}$ but also of quadratic terms
$x^{j_1}x^{j_2}$. The inclusion of such higher-order ""interaction terms"" in
regression often provides an easy way to increase accuracy in
already-high-dimensional problems. However, this explodes the problem dimension
from linear $O(p)$ to quadratic $O(p^2)$, and it is common to look for sparse
interactions (typically via heuristics). In this paper, we provide a new
algorithm - Interaction Hard Thresholding (IntHT) which is the first one to
provably accurately solve this problem in sub-quadratic time and space. It is a
variant of Iterative Hard Thresholding; one that uses the special quadratic
structure to devise a new way to (approx.) extract the top elements of a $p^2$
size gradient in sub-$p^2$ time and space. Our main result is to theoretically
prove that, in spite of the many speedup-related approximations, IntHT linearly
converges to a consistent estimate under standard high-dimensional sparse
recovery assumptions. We also demonstrate its value via synthetic experiments.
Moreover, we numerically show that IntHT can be extended to higher-order
regression problems, and also theoretically analyze an SVRG variant of IntHT.

compression and indexing. First introduced in 1994, it went on to provide the
backbone for the first encoding of the classic suffix tree data structure in
space close to the entropy-based lower bound. Recently, there has been the
development of compact suffix trees in space proportional to ""$r$"", the number
of runs in the BWT, as well as the appearance of $r$ in the time complexity of
new algorithms. Unlike other popular measures of compression, the parameter $r$
is sensitive to the lexicographic ordering given to the text's alphabet.
Despite several past attempts to exploit this, a provably efficient algorithm
for finding, or approximating, an alphabet ordering which minimizes $r$ has
been open for years.
  We present the first set of results on the computational complexity of
minimizing BWT-runs via alphabet reordering. We prove that the decision version
of this problem is NP-complete and cannot be solved in time $2^{o(\sigma +
\sqrt{n})}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, where $\sigma$ is the
size of the alphabet and $n$ is the length of the text. We also show that the
optimization problem is APX-hard. In doing so, we relate two previously
disparate topics: the optimal traveling salesperson path and the number of runs
in the BWT of a text, providing a surprising connection between problems on
graphs and text compression. Also, by relating recent results in the field of
dictionary compression, we illustrate that an arbitrary alphabet ordering
provides a $O(\log^2 n)$-approximation.
  We provide an optimal linear-time algorithm for the problem of finding a run
minimizing ordering on a subset of symbols (occurring only once) under ordering
constraints, and prove a generalization of this problem to a class of graphs
with BWT like properties called Wheeler graphs is NP-complete.

unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Part II (the

disclosing a context for coordinating QUBO solutions through a model we call
the Asset Exchange Problem (AEP). Solutions to the AEP enable individuals or
institutions to take fuller advantage of solutions to their QUBO models by
exchanges of assets that benefit all participants. Such exchanges are generated
by a combination of two optimization technologies, one grounded in network
optimization and one based on a new metaheuristic optimization approach called
combinatorial chaining. This combination provides a flexibility to solve AEP
variants that open the door to additional links to quantum computing

Here, the emphasis is on accurately approximating the shape of such

evaluated on a set of grid points instead is relatively straightforward.
However, the number of grid points needed increases exponentially with $s$. LDS
are known to be increasingly more efficient at integrating $s$-dimensional

fold into their functional structure by destabilizing misfolded configurations

RNA chaperoning is challenging, mostly due to inherent disorder of the
chaperones and the transient nature of their interactions with RNA. In
particular, it is unclear how specific the interactions are and what role is
played by amino acid charge and polarity patterns. Here, we address these
questions in the RNA chaperone StpA. We adapted direct coupling analysis (DCA)
into the $\alpha\beta$DCA method that can treat in tandem sequences written in
two alphabets, nucleotides and amino acids. With $\alpha\beta$DCA, we could
analyze StpA-RNA interactions and show consistency with a previously proposed
two-pronged mechanism: StpA disrupts specific positions in the group I intron
while globally and loosely binding to the entire structure. Moreover, the
interactions are strongly associated with the charge pattern: negatively
charged regions in the destabilizing StpA N-terminal affect a few specific
positions in the RNA, located in stems and in the pseudoknot. In contrast,
positive regions in the C-terminal contain strongly coupled amino acids that
promote non-specific or weakly-specific binding to the RNA. The present study
opens new avenues to examine the functions of disordered proteins and to design
disruptive proteins based on their charge patterns.

Multi-Source Coordinated Question Generator (MSCQG), a novel framework that
includes a supervised learning (SL) stage and a reinforcement learning (RL)

RL stage, a coordinator model is trained to find optimal attention weights to
align multiple single-document generators, by optimizing a reward designed to

  MasterPrint Generation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial fingerprint recognition is a method to recognize an individual when
the sensor size has a small form factor in accepting a full fingerprint. It is
also used in forensic research to identify the partial fingerprints collected
from the crime scenes. But the distinguishing features in the partial
fingerprint are relatively low due to small fingerprint captured by the sensor.
Hence, the uniqueness of a partial fingerprint cannot be guaranteed, leading to
a possibility that a single partial fingerprint may identify multiple subjects.
A MasterPrint is a partial fingerprint that identifies at least 4% different
individuals from the enrolled template database. A fingerprint identification
system with such a flaw can play a significant role in convicting an innocent
in a criminal case. We propose a partial fingerprint identification approach
that aims to mitigate MasterPrint generation. The proposed method, when applied
to partial fingerprint dataset cropped from standard FVC 2002 DB1(A) dataset
showed significant improvement in reducing the count of MasterPrints. The
experimental result demonstrates improved results on other parameters, such as
True match Rate (TMR) and Equal Error Rate (EER), generally used to evaluate
the performance of a fingerprint biometric system.

Their performance is typically measured in terms of classification accuracy.
While the classification error rate and the like are important, they do not
address a fundamental question: Is the classification method underfitted? To
our best knowledge, there is no existing method that can assess the
goodness-of-fit of a general classification procedure. Indeed, the lack of a
parametric assumption makes it challenging to construct proper tests. To
overcome this difficulty, we propose a methodology called BAGofT that splits
the data into a training set and a validation set. First, the classification
procedure to assess is applied to the training set, which is also used to
adaptively find a data grouping that reveals the most severe regions of
underfitting. Then, based on this grouping, we calculate a test statistic by
comparing the estimated success probabilities and the actual observed responses
from the validation set. The data splitting guarantees that the size of the
test is controlled under the null hypothesis, and the power of the test goes to
one as the sample size increases under the alternative hypothesis. For testing
parametric classification models, the BAGofT has a broader scope than the
existing methods since it is not restricted to specific parametric models
(e.g., logistic regression). Extensive simulation studies show the utility of
the BAGofT when assessing general classification procedures and its strengths
over some existing methods when testing parametric classification models.

However, only nine of them are considered as secure blazar candidates, while

blazar candidates possess infrequently sampled optical light curves (LCs) in I
filter provided by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment group. The LCs
were analysed with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the Hurst exponent $H$, and
the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane, to look for blazar-like characteristic
features and to study the long-term behaviour of the optical fluxes.
  The power law (PL) indices of the Lomb-Scargle power spectral density (PSD)
of the FSRQ blazar candidates mostly lie in the range (1,2). In case of the BL
Lacs they are located in the range (1,1.8). The PL PSD is indicative of a
self-affine stochastic process characterised by $H$, underlying the observed
variability. We find that the majority of analysed objects have $H\leq 0.5$,
indicating short-term memory, whereas four BL Lacs and two FSRQs have $H>0.5$,
implying long-term memory. 41 blazar candidates are located in the
$\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane in the region available to PL plus Poisson
noise processes. Interestingly, one FSRQ is located marginally below this
region, while two FSRQs lie above the line $\mathcal{T}=2/3$, i.e. they are
even more noisy than white noise. The BL Lac candidates are characterised by
higher $\mathcal{A}$ values than FSRQs, i.e. $0.71\pm 0.06$ and $0.29\pm 0.05$,

the group is just a single narrow or slightly broadened peak. In about 30
percent, it consists of a multiple, closely spaced peaks. These groups can be
interpreted as non-coherent variations most likely associated with photospheric
gas clouds. Approximate rotational frequencies for about 75 percent of the
stars can be derived. Comparison with the projected rotational velocities shows
that the photometric frequency is consistent with rotation. The first harmonic
plays a prominent role in many Be stars and manifests itself in either
single-wave or double-wave light curves. The reduction in amplitude of beta Cep
pulsations in a few Be stars during an outburst and their subsequent recovery

Subject to the experimenter's desired level of robustness, the design aims to
simultaneously balance all linear functions of potentially many covariates. The
achieved level of balance is better than previously known possible and
considerably better than what a fully random assignment would produce. We show
that the mean squared error of the estimator is bounded by the minimum of the
loss function of an implicit ridge regression of the potential outcomes on the
covariates. The estimator does not itself conduct covariate adjustment, so one
can interpret the approach as regression adjustment by design. Finally, we
provide both a central limit theorem and non-asymptotic tail bounds for the
estimator, which facilitate the construction of confidence intervals.

polarization. Valley asymmetric transmission inevitably occurs because of the
low symmetry of the total Hamiltonian and when total external reflection occurs
the transmission is 100% valley polarized in BLG and 100% spin and valley
polarized in TMDs, except for exponentially small corrections. By adjusting the
potential, 100% polarization can be obtained regardless of the crystallographic
orientation of the barrier. A valley polarizer can be realized by arranging for
a collimated beam of carriers to be incident on a barrier within the range of
angles for total external reflection. The transmission coefficients of barriers
with a relative rotation of $\pm\pi/3$ are related by symmetry. This allows two
barriers to be used to demonstrate that the current is valley polarized. A
soft-walled potential is used to model the barrier and the method used to find
the transmission coefficients is explained. In the case of monolayer TMDs, a
4-band k.p Hamiltonian is used and the k.p parameters are obtained by fitting

it requires that both share the same latent space dimensions. In this work, we
focus instead on relative knowledge distillation (RKD), which considers the

the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for
achieving the passive beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable
overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current
beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel
coefficients should be estimated if the passive IRS cannot estimate its
channels with the base station (BS) and users due to its lack of radio
frequency (RF) chains, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the number of users,
reflecting elements of the IRS, and antennas at the BS, respectively. This
number can be extremely large in practice considering the current trend of
massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), i.e., a large $M$, and massive
connectivity, i.e., a large $K$. To accurately estimate such a large number of
channel coefficients within a short time interval, we devote our endeavour in
this paper to investigating the efficient pilot-based channel estimation method
in IRS-assisted uplink communications. Building upon the observation that the
IRS reflects the signals from all the users to the BS via the same channels, we
analytically verify that a time duration consisting of $K+N+\max(K-1,\lceil
(K-1)N/M \rceil)$ pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover
all the $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients in the case without noise. In contrast to
the conventional uplink communications without IRS in which the minimum pilot
sequence length for channel estimation is independent with the number of
receive antennas, our study reveals the significant role of massive MIMO in
reducing the channel training time for IRS-assisted communication systems.

across countless tasks in natural language processing. These models are highly
expressive, comprising at least a hundred million parameters and a dozen
layers. Recent evidence suggests that only a few of the final layers need to be
fine-tuned for high quality on downstream tasks. Naturally, a subsequent
research question is, ""how many of the last layers do we need to fine-tune?"" In
this paper, we precisely answer this question. We examine two recent pretrained
language models, BERT and RoBERTa, across standard tasks in textual entailment,
semantic similarity, sentiment analysis, and linguistic acceptability. We vary
the number of final layers that are fine-tuned, then study the resulting change
in task-specific effectiveness. We show that only a fourth of the final layers
need to be fine-tuned to achieve 90% of the original quality. Surprisingly, we
also find that fine-tuning all layers does not always help.

Graphs by filling in missing connections via link prediction or relation
extraction. One of the main difficulties for KGC is a low resource problem.
Previous approaches assume sufficient training triples to learn versatile
vectors for entities and relations, or a satisfactory number of labeled
sentences to train a competent relation extraction model. However, low resource
relations are very common in KGs, and those newly added relations often do not
have many known samples for training. In this work, we aim at predicting new
facts under a challenging setting where only limited training instances are
available. We propose a general framework called Weighted Relation Adversarial
Network, which utilizes an adversarial procedure to help adapt
knowledge/features learned from high resource relations to different but
related low resource relations. Specifically, the framework takes advantage of
a relation discriminator to distinguish between samples from different
relations, and help learn relation-invariant features more transferable from
source relations to target relations. Experimental results show that the
proposed approach outperforms previous methods regarding low resource settings
for both link prediction and relation extraction.

provides control over the error and convergence; iii) capable of handling
intermittent distributed generation as well as load uncertainties, and iv)
applicable to both balanced and unbalanced power flow with different type and

between the cosmological constraints obtained from the analyses of the CMB
primary anisotropies and those from cluster abundance in SZ surveys for a fixed
mass bias parameter. We study the cosmological implications of a modification
of the mean pressure profile through the analysis of the SZ power spectrum
measured by $Planck$. We define two mean pressure profiles on either side of
the one obtained from the observation of nearby clusters by $Planck$. The
parameters of these profiles are chosen to ensure their compatibility with the
distributions of pressure and gas mass fraction profiles observed at low
redshift. We find significant differences between the cosmological parameters
obtained by using these two profiles to fit the $Planck$ SZ power spectrum and
those found in previous analyses. We conclude that a ${\sim}15\%$ decrease of

alleviate the discrepancy observed between the constraints of $\sigma_8$ and
$\Omega_m$ from the CMB and cluster analyses.

in the heliosphere. The lithium spectrum appears somewhat flatter at high
energies compared to other secondary species that may imply a primary lithium
component. Two propagation packages, GALPROP and HelMod, are combined to
provide a single framework that is run to reproduce direct measurements of CR
species at different modulation levels, and at both polarities of the solar
magnetic field. An iterative maximum-likelihood method is developed that uses
GALPROP-predicted LIS as input to HelMod, which provides the modulated spectra
for specific time periods of the selected experiments for the model-data
comparison. The proposed LIS accommodate the low-energy interstellar spectra
measured by Voyager 1, HEAO-3, and ACE/CRIS as well as the high-energy
observations by PAMELA, AMS-02, and earlier experiments that are made deep in
the heliosphere. The interstellar and heliospheric propagation parameters
derived in this study are consistent with our earlier results for propagation
of CR protons, helium, carbon, oxygen, antiprotons, and electrons.

for machine translation. Domain robustness---the generalization of models to
unseen test domains---is low for both statistical (SMT) and neural machine
translation (NMT). In this paper, we study the performance of SMT and NMT
models on out-of-domain test sets. We find that in unknown domains, SMT and NMT
suffer from very different problems: SMT systems are mostly adequate but not
fluent, while NMT systems are mostly fluent, but not adequate. For NMT, we
identify such hallucinations (translations that are fluent but unrelated to the
source) as a key reason for low domain robustness. To mitigate this problem, we
empirically compare methods that are reported to improve adequacy or in-domain
robustness in terms of their effectiveness at improving domain robustness. In
experiments on German to English OPUS data, and German to Romansh (a
low-resource setting) we find that several methods improve domain robustness.
While those methods do lead to higher BLEU scores overall, they only slightly
increase the adequacy of translations compared to SMT.

optimisation problems with interacting components. TTP combines the knapsack
problem (KP) and the travelling salesman problem (TSP). A thief performs a
cyclic tour through a set of cities, and pursuant to a collection plan,
collects a subset of items into a rented knapsack with finite capacity. The aim
is to maximise profit while minimising renting cost. Existing TTP solvers
typically solve the KP and TSP components in an interleaved manner: the
solution of one component is kept fixed while the solution of the other
component is modified. This suggests low coordination between solving the two
components, possibly leading to low quality TTP solutions. The 2-OPT heuristic
is often used for solving the TSP component, which reverses a segment in the
tour. Within TTP, 2-OPT does not take into account the collection plan, which
can result in a lower objective value. This in turn can result in the tour
modification to be rejected by a solver. We propose an expanded form of 2-OPT
to change the collection plan in coordination with tour modification. Items
regarded as less profitable and collected in cities located earlier in the
reversed segment are substituted by items that tend to be more profitable and
not collected in cities located later in the reversed segment. The collection
plan is further changed through a modified form of the hill-climbing bit-flip
search, where changes in the collection state are only permitted for boundary
items, which are defined as lowest profitable collected items or highest
profitable uncollected items. This restriction reduces the time spent on the KP
component, allowing more tours to be evaluated by the TSP component within a
time budget. The proposed approaches form the basis of a new cooperative
coordination solver, which is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art TTP
solvers.

faster than $\propto \log^{-1} l$ for the critical ground state. In particular,

unitarity; the question is at what scale. For spin-$1$ the strong coupling
scale (at which perturbative unitarity is lost) cannot be raised by any finite
tuning of the interactions, while for spin-$2$ there exists a special tuning of
the Wilson coefficients which can raise this scale (and enjoys numerous special
properties such as ghost-freedom). Here, we fill in the missing piece by
describing how the self-interactions of a massive spin-$3/2$ field, or ""massive
gravitino"", become strongly coupled at high energies. We show that while
several different structures appear in the leading order potential, the strong
coupling scale cannot be raised (in the absence of additional fields). At the
level of the off-shell Lagrangian, it is always the non-linear symmetries of
the longitudinal Stuckelberg mode that dictate the strong coupling, and we show
that in general it is only possible to parametrically raise the strong coupling
scale if Wess-Zumino structures exist. We complement this off-shell approach
with a first analysis of positivity bounds for a massive spin-$3/2$ particle,
showing that any potential self-interaction which contributes to an on-shell
2-to-2 elastic process at tree level must vanish if this low-energy theory is
to have a standard UV completion. We identify the mixing between the
longitudinal mode and the transverse modes as the main obstacle to positivity,
and clarify how the non-Abelian nature of non-linear (dRGT) massive gravity
allows it to satisfy positivity where all known spin $\geq 3/2$ Abelian
theories fail. Our results imply that a massive gravitino cannot appear alone
in a controlled EFT---it must be accompanied by other particles, e.g.~as part
of a supermultiplet. Together with the spin-$1$ and spin-$2$ cases, we suggest
features which will persist in even higher spin massive theories.

successfully in several recent works. However, this algorithm suffers from two
drawbacks, which we address in this paper. First, it has originally been
introduced in a heuristic fashion: we propose here a rigorous optimization
framework in which MISI is derived, thus proving the convergence of this
algorithm. Besides, while MISI operates offline, we propose here an online
version of MISI called oMISI, which is suitable for low-latency source
separation, an important requirement for e.g., hearing aids applications. oMISI
also allows one to use alternative phase initialization schemes exploiting the
temporal structure of audio signals. Experiments conducted on a speech
separation task show that oMISI performs as well as its offline counterpart,
thus demonstrating its potential for real-time source separation.

information-sensing devices to exchange information for intelligent

IoT. Most of the previous methods of detecting Sybil attacks in IoT mainly
focus on static IoT while there are very rare methods applicable to mobile IoT.
In this paper, a novel, lightweight, and distributive detection scheme based on
edge computing is proposed for detecting Sybil attacks in mobile IoT. In the
proposed scheme, a detection consists of two rounds. In each round, member
nodes are required to send packets to edge nodes. Edge nodes calculate a
possible interval of the received signal strength indication (RSSI) from the
first round and check whether the RSSI from the second round is in the interval
to detect Sybil attack. Extensive experimental studies are included to show
that the presented approach outperforms many existing approaches in terms of
true detection and false detection rates. Moreover, experimental results show
that the fault tolerance design in the proposed approach greatly enhances the
detection scheme.

nonexpansive operator under time-varying communication graphs in real Hilbert

of local nonexpansive operators. Each local operator is only privately
accessible to each agent, and all agents constitute a network. To seek a fixed
point of the global operator, it is indispensable for agents to exchange local
information and update their solution cooperatively. To solve the problem, two
algorithms are developed, called distributed Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}-Mann (D-KM)

for which the D-BKM iteration is a block-coordinate version of the D-KM
iteration in the sense of randomly choosing and computing only one
block-coordinate of local operators at each time for each agent. It is shown
that the proposed two algorithms can both converge weakly to a fixed point of
the global operator. Meanwhile, the designed algorithms are applied to recover
the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, devise a new
block-coordinate DGD algorithm, handle a distributed shortest distance problem

electrochemical sensors for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) deployed within a
hierarchical network of low-cost and regulatory-grade instruments. The
framework is founded on the idea that it is possible in a suitably configured
network to identify a source of reliable proxy data for each sensor site that
has a similar probability distribution of measurement values over a suitable
time period. Previous work successfully applied these ideas to a sensor system
with a simple linear 2-parameter (slope and offset) response. Applying these
ideas to electrochemical sensors for NO2 presents significant additional
difficulties for which we demonstrate solutions. The three NO2 sensor response
parameters (offset, ozone (O3) response slope, and NO2 response slope) are
known to vary significantly as a consequence of ambient humidity and
temperature variations. Here we demonstrate that these response parameters can
be estimated by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
sensor-estimated and proxy NO2 distributions over a 3-day window. We then
estimate an additional offset term by using co-location data. This offset term
is dependent on climate and spatially correlated and can thus be projected
across the network. Co-location data also estimates the time-, space- and
concentration-dependent error distribution between sensors and regulatory-grade
instruments. We show how the parameter variations can be used to indicate both
sensor failure and failure of the proxy assumption. We apply the procedures to
a network of 56 sensors distributed across the Inland Empire and Los Angeles
County regions, demonstrating the need for reliable data from dense networks of
monitors to supplement the existing regulatory networks.

for ozone at neighbourhood scales. Key to this framework is the concept of a
proxy: a reliable (regulatory) data source whose results have sufficient
statistical similarity over some period of time to those from any given
low-cost measurement site. This enables the low-cost instruments to be
calibrated remotely, avoiding the need for costly on-site calibration of dense
networks. This paper assesses the suitability of this method for local air
pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide which show large temporal and spatial
variability in concentration. The proxy technique is evaluated using the data
from the network of regulatory air monitoring stations measuring nitrogen
dioxide in Southern California to avoid errors introduced by low-cost
instrument performance. Proxies chosen based on land use similarity signalled
typically less than 0.1 percent false alarms. Although poor proxy performance
was observed when the local geography was unusual (a semi-enclosed valley) in
this instance the closest neighbour station proved to be an appropriate
alternative. The method also struggled when wind speeds were low and very local
sources presumably dominated the concentration patterns. Overall, we
demonstrate that the technique can be applied to nitrogen dioxide, and that
appropriate proxies can be found even within a spatially sparse network of
stations in a region with large spatio-temporal variation in concentration.

characterization in scattering media. The experimental proof-of-concept is
performed with ultrasonic waves, but this approach can be applied to any field

that focused beamforming enables the synthesis, in transmit and receive, of an
array of virtual transducers which map the entire medium to be imaged. The
inter-element responses of this virtual array form a focused reflection matrix
from which spatial maps of various characteristics of the propagating wave can
be retrieved. Here we demonstrate: (i) a local focusing criterion that enables
the image quality and the wave velocity to be evaluated everywhere inside the
medium, including in random speckle, and (ii) an highly resolved spatial
mapping of the prevalence of multiple scattering, which constitutes a new and
unique contrast for ultrasonic imaging. The approach is demonstrated for a
controllable phantom system, and for in vivo imaging of the human abdomen. More
generally, this matrix approach opens an original and powerful route for
quantitative imaging in wave physics.

regularization is emerging as an alternative to the conventional on-the-grid
sparse regularization for the compressed sensing (CS) due to its ability to
alleviate the basis mismatch between the true support of the shape in the
continuous domain and the discrete grid. In this paper, we propose a new
off-the-grid regularization for the CS-MRI reconstruction. Following the recent
works on two dimensional FRI, we assume that the discontinuities/edges of the
image are localized in the zero level set of a band-limited periodic function.
This assumption induces the linear dependencies among the Fourier samples of
the gradient of the image, which leads to a low rank two-fold Hankel matrix. We
further observe that the singular value decomposition of a low rank Hankel
matrix corresponds to an adaptive tight frame system which can represent the
image with sparse canonical coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose
a data driven tight frame based off-the-grid regularization model for the
CS-MRI reconstruction. To solve the nonconvex and nonsmooth model, a proximal
alternating minimization algorithm with a guaranteed global convergence is
adopted. Finally, the numerical experiments show that our proposed data driven
tight frame based approach outperforms the existing approaches.

from local ($z \lesssim 0.1$) scales and from scales of the sound horizon is a
crucial problem in modern cosmology. Peculiar velocities ($v_{pec}$) of
standard candle distance indicators can systematically affect local $H_0$
measurements. We here use 2MRS galaxies to measure the local galaxy density
field, finding a notable $z$ < 0.05 under-density in the SGC-6dFGS region of 27
$\pm$ 2 %. However, no strong evidence for a 'Local Void' pertaining to the
full 2MRS sky coverage is found. Galaxy densities are used to measure a density
parameter, $\Delta \phi_{+-}$, which we introduce as a proxy for $v_{pec}$
which quantifies density gradients along a SN line-of-sight. $\Delta \phi_{+-}$
is found to correlate with local $H_0$ estimates from 88 Pantheon SNeIa (0.02 <
$z$ < 0.05). Density structures on scales of $\sim$ 50 Mpc are found to
correlate strongest with $H_0$ estimates in both the observational data and in
mock data from the MDPL2-Galacticus simulation. Using trends of $H_0$ with
$\Delta \phi_{+-}$, we can correct for the effects of density structure on
local $H_0$ estimates, even in the presence of biased $v_{pec}$. However, the
difference in the inferred $H_0$ estimate with and without the peculiar
velocity correction is limited to < 0.1 %. We conclude that accounting for
environmentally-induced peculiar velocities of SNIa host galaxies does not
resolve the tension between local and CMB-derived $H_0$ estimates.

moderate attractive interaction, the model has the same phases as the
non-interacting chain, a trivial and a topological phase. For repulsive
interactions, the phase diagram is more interesting. Apart from the previously
observed topological, incommensurate and charge density wave phases, we
identify the `excited state charge density wave' phase. In this phase, the
ground state resembles an excited state of an ordinary charge density phase,
but is lower in energy due to the frustrated nature of the model. We find that
the dynamical critical exponent takes the value $z\simeq 1.8$. Interestingly,
this phase only appears for even system sizes, and is sensitive to the chemical
potential on the edges of the chain. For the topological phase, we present an
argument that excludes the presence of a strong zero mode for a large part of
the topological phase. For the remaining region, we study the time dependence
of the edge magnetization (using the bosonic incarnation of the model). These
results further expand the region where a strong zero mode does not occur.

defect networks requires a combination of analytic modeling and numerical
simulations. The canonical analytic model for defect network evolution is the
Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model. For the case of cosmic strings, this
has so far been calibrated using small numbers of Goto-Nambu and field theory
simulations, in the radiation and matter eras, as well as in Minkowski
spacetime. But the model is only as good as the available simulations, and it
should be extended as further simulations become available. In previous work we
presented a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit implementation of the
evolution of cosmological domain wall networks, and used it to obtain an
improved VOS model for domain walls. Here we continue this effort, exploiting a
more recent analogous code for local Abelian-Higgs string networks. The
significant gains in speed afforded by this code enabled us to carry out 1032
field theory simulations of $512^3$ size, with 43 different expansion rates.
This detailed exploration of the effects of the expansion rate on the network
properties in turn enables a statistical separation of various dynamical
processes affecting the evolution of the network. We thus extend and accurately
calibrate the VOS model for cosmic strings, including separate terms for energy
losses due to loop production and scalar/gauge radiation. By comparing this
newly calibrated VOS model with the analogous one for domain walls we
quantitatively show that energy loss mechanisms are different for the two types
of defects.

to, for example, the complexity of building shapes. Semantic segmentation is an
efficient approach for this task. The latest development in deep convolutional

Deep architectures generally fail to produce fine-grained segmentation with
accurate boundaries due to their progressive down-sampling. Hence, we introduce
a generic framework to overcome the issue, integrating the graph convolutional
network (GCN) and deep structured feature embedding (DSFE) into an end-to-end

network, we propose a gated graph convolutional network, which enables the

enables a user to share their virtual avatar with another entity (e.g., another
user, robot, or autonomous agent). We describe a proof-of-concept in which two
users can be immersed from a first-person perspective in a virtual environment
and can have complementary levels of control (total, partial, or none) over a
shared avatar. In addition, we conducted an experiment to investigate the
influence of users' level of control over the shared avatar and prior knowledge
of their actions on the users' sense of agency and motor actions. The results
showed that participants are good at estimating their real level of control but
significantly overestimate their sense of agency when they can anticipate the
motion of the avatar. Moreover, participants performed similar body motions
regardless of their real control over the avatar. The results also revealed
that the internal dimension of the locus of control, which is a personality
trait, is negatively correlated with the user's perceived level of control. The
combined results unfold a new range of applications in the fields of
virtual-reality-based training and collaborative teleoperation, where users
would be able to share their virtual body.

first results of GASTON, the Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2 large programme
on the IRAM 30m telescope, that aims to identify new populations of
low-brightness sources to tackle the question of stellar mass determination
across all masses. In this paper, we focus on the high-mass star formation part
of the project, for which we map a $\sim2$ deg$^2$ region of the Galactic plane
around $l=24^\circ$ in both 1.2 mm and 2.0 mm continuum. Half-way through the
project, we reach a sensitivity of 3.7 mJy/beam at 1.2mm. Even though larger
than our target sensitivity of 2 mJy, the current sensitivity already allows
the identification of a new population of cold, compact sources that remained
undetected in any (sub-)mm Galactic plane survey so far. In fact, about 25% of
the $\sim 1600$ compact sources identified in the 1.2 mm GASTON image are new
detections. We present a preliminary analysis of the physical properties of the
GASTON sources as a function of their evolutionary stage, arguing for a
potential evolution of the mass distribution of these sources with time.

classical massive vector field associated with a charge crossing the event
horizon. This implies that, from the point of view of an external observer, the
Proca field of the charge is screened with the strength gradually increasing as
the charge adiabatically approaches the event horizon. In this paper we reject
the adiabaticity constraint and calculate analytically the field evolution with
respect to a distant observer in the frame of the simplest model of a
contracting charged spherical shell concentrically surrounding a Schwarzschild
black hole. We show that a time scale of the screening is determined by a mass
of the black hole and, moreover, loss of Proca hair during the collapse of
charged matter has the same temporal character. The latter conclusion disproves
results of a number of papers. Due to existence of the event horizon, there is
discontinuous jump between massive and massless electrodynamics. This means
that presence of an arbitrarily small mass of the photon gives rise to
experimentally observed effects including generation of electric asymmetry of
the Universe and galactic magnetic fields.

convergence. In contrast to findings in previous research we further
demonstrate that with Lipschitz parameter initialization, deep Transformers

ubiquitous result of simulations of hot Jupiters, and a theory explaining how
this zonally coherent flow reaches an equilibrium has been developed in the
literature. However, this understanding relies on the existence of either an
initial superrotating or a sheared flow, coupled with a slow evolution such
that a linear steady state can be reached. Aims. A consistent physical
understanding of superrotation is needed for arbitrary drag and radiative
timescales, and the relevance of considering linear steady states needs to be
assessed. Methods. We obtain an analytical expression for the structure,
frequency and decay rate of propagating waves in hot Jupiter atmospheres around
a state at rest in the 2D shallow water beta plane limit. We solve this
expression numerically and confirm the robustness of our results with a 3D
linear wave algorithm. We then compare with 3D simulations of hot Jupiter
atmospheres and study the non linear momentum fluxes. Results. We show that
under strong day night heating the dynamics does not transit through a linear
steady state when starting from an initial atmosphere in solid body rotation.
We further show that non linear effects favour the initial spin up of
superrotation and that the acceleration due to the vertical component of the
eddy momentum flux is critical to the initial development of superrotation.
Conclusions. Overall, we describe the initial phases of the acceleration of
superrotation, including consideration of differing radiative and drag
timescales, and conclude that eddy-momentum driven superrotating equatorial
jets are robust, physical phenomena in simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres.

present a novel approach for privacy-preserving generalized linear models, a
fundamental and powerful framework underlying many prediction and

small number of galaxies regime ($N_{gal} \leq 75$), both for the determination
of the velocity dispersion and the dynamical mass of the clusters via the

approximatively solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs).
In particular, most of the numerical approximation schemes studied in the
scientific literature suffer under the curse of dimensionality in the sense
that the number of computational operations needed to compute an approximation
with an error of size at most $ \varepsilon > 0 $ grows at least exponentially
in the PDE dimension $ d \in \mathbb{N} $ or in the reciprocal of $ \varepsilon
$. Recently, so-called full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP)
approximation methods have been introduced to tackle the problem of
approximately solving high-dimensional PDEs. MLP approximation methods
currently are, to the best of our knowledge, the only methods for parabolic
semi-linear PDEs with general time horizons and general initial conditions for
which there is a rigorous proof that they are indeed able to beat the curse of
dimensionality. The main purpose of this work is to investigate MLP
approximation methods in more depth, to reveal more clearly how these methods
can overcome the curse of dimensionality, and to propose a generalised class of
MLP approximation schemes, which covers previously analysed MLP approximation
schemes as special cases. In particular, we develop an abstract framework in
which this class of generalised MLP approximations can be formulated and
analysed and, thereafter, apply this abstract framework to derive a
computational complexity result for suitable MLP approximations for semi-linear
heat equations. These resulting MLP approximations for semi-linear heat
equations essentially are generalisations of previously introduced MLP

to DM. In the case of R-parity violating models, the axino can decay into a
neutrino-photon pair with a lifetime much longer than the age of the Universe,
yielding a potentially detectable signal. Interestingly, a gravitino
next-to-LSP (NLSP) can live enough as to contribute to the relic density. We
study both scenarios, only axino LSP as DM, and axino LSP with gravitino NLSP
as DM. We carry out the analysis in the context of the $\mu\nu$SSM, which
solves the $\mu$ problem and reproduces neutrino data, only adding couplings
involving right-handed neutrinos. In particular, we perform a complete analysis
of the relevant parameter space of the model considering constraints from
neutrino physics, cosmological observations, and $\gamma$-ray detection. We
find that the axino or the gravitino can produce a signal detectable by future

several solar datasets. Most of these approaches employ supervised machine
learning algorithms which are, in general, very data hungry. This hampers the
attempts to forecast some of these data series, particularly the ones that
depend on (relatively) recent space observations. Here we focus on an attempt
to forecast the solar surface longitudinally averaged radial magnetic field
distribution using a form of spatial-temporal neural networks. Given that the
recording of these spatial-temporal datasets only started in 1975 and are
therefore quite short, the forecasts are predictably quite modest. However,
given that there is a potential physical relationship between sunspots and the
magnetic field, we employ another machine learning technique called transfer
learning which has recently received considerable attention in the literature.
Here, this approach consists in first training the source spatial-temporal
neural network on the much longer time/latitude sunspot area dataset, which
starts in 1874, then transferring the trained set of layers to a target
network, and continue training the latter on the magnetic field dataset. The
employment of transfer learning in the field of computer vision is known to
obtain a generalized set of feature filters that can be reused for other
datasets and tasks. Here we obtain a similar result, whereby we first train the
network on the spatial-temporal sunspot area data, then the first few layers of
the neural network are able to identify the two main features of the solar
cycle, i.e. the amplitude variation and the migration to the equator, and
therefore can be used to train on the magnetic field dataset and forecast
better than a prediction based only on the historical magnetic field data.

(URLLC) communication systems. Simplified SC algorithm recognizes some special
nodes in the SC decoding tree, corresponding to the specific subcodes in the
polar code construction, and efficiently prunes the SC decoding tree, without
traversing the sub-trees and computing log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each
child node. However, this decoding process still suffers from the latency
associated with the serial nature of SC decoding. We propose some new
algorithms to process new types of node patterns that appear within multiple
levels of pruned sub-trees and it enables to process of certain nodes in
parallel. In short blocklength polar codes, our proposed algorithm can achieve
up to $13\%$ latency reduction from fast-simplified SC \cite{Sarkis2013}
without any performance degradation. Furthermore, it can achieve up to $27\%$
latency reduction if small error-correcting performance degradation is allowed.

a particle number density at all times in the evolution with the correct

processes. Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit a beam of
electromagnetic radiations. Any sudden release of the energy stored in the
magnetic multipole field will trigger outbursts similar to the giant flares of
magnetars. Here we show that the relativistic outflow from the outbursts of a
nearby pulsar interacting with the interstellar medium generates a shock, which
accelerates electrons to trillions of electron volts. The high-energy photons
from synchrotron emission of the shock interact with Earth's atmosphere,
producing the cosmogenic nuclide $^{14}$C, which can cause the rapid $^{14}$C
increases discovered in tree rings. These same relativistic electrons can
account for a significant fraction of the cosmic electron spectrum in the

monitoring nearby pulsars for such outbursts may be important in the future.

C^{\infty}(\mathbb{H} \, \setminus \, \{0\})$ be a kernel which is either odd
or horizontally odd, and satisfies $$|\nabla_{\mathbb{H}}^{n}k(p)| \leq

by Chousionis and Mattila, and the horizontally odd kernel $k(p) =
\nabla_{\mathbb{H}} \log \|p\|$. We prove that convolution with $k$, as above,
yields an $L^{2}$-bounded operator on regular curves in $\mathbb{H}$. This
extends a theorem of G. David to the Heisenberg group.
  As a corollary of our main result, we infer that all $3$-dimensional
horizontally odd kernels yield $L^{2}$ bounded operators on Lipschitz flags in
$\mathbb{H}$. This was known earlier for only one specific operator, the
$3$-dimensional Riesz transform. Finally, our technique yields new results on
certain non-negative kernels, introduced by Chousionis and Li.

at a stage of initiation of localized corrosion preceding metastable pitting at

results show that Cl-ions enter the bilayer structure of the surface oxide

concentrations below the detection limit of XPS (< 0.5 at%), mostly in the

barely in the oxide inner layer enriched in Cr(III). Their main effect is to
produce a less resistive passive state by poisoning dehydroxylation and further
Cr(III) and Mo(IV,VI) enrichments obtained in the absence of chlorides. This
detrimental effect can be suppressed by pre-passivation in a Cl-free
electrolyte, which blocks the entry of chlorides in the passive film, including
in the outer exchange layer, and enables the beneficial aging-induced
variations of the composition to take place despite the presence of chlorides
in the environment.

(multi-dimensionally consistent) quad-equations on bipartite isoradial
quad-graphs in $\mathbb C$, enjoying natural symmetries and the property that
the restriction of their solutions to the black vertices satisfies a Laplace
type equation. The classification reduces to solving a functional equation.
Under certain restriction, we give a complete solution of the functional
equation, which is expressed in terms of elliptic functions. We find two real
analytic reductions, corresponding to the cases when the underlying complex
torus is of a rectangular type or of a rhombic type. The solution corresponding
to the rectangular type was previously found by Boutillier, de Tili\`ere and
Raschel. Using the multi-dimensional consistency, we construct the discrete

linear variational problems. We consider discrete pluri-harmonic functions,
corresponding to a discrete 2-form with a quadratic dependence on the fields at
black vertices only. In an important particular case, we show that the problem
reduces to a two-field generalization of the classical star-triangle map. We
prove the integrability of this novel 3D system by showing its
multi-dimensional consistency. The Laplacians from the first part come as a

valuable design principles of decomposition of robotics software into

experimenting with highly uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems. In this study, a
nonlinear estimator is developed by adopting a particle filter algorithm that
takes advantage of measured signals. This approach is shown to significantly
improve the ability to estimate states. To illustrate this approach, a model
for a nonlinear device coupled with a hydraulic actuator plays the role of an
actual plant and a nonlinear algebraic function is considered as an
approximation of the nonlinear device, thus generating non-parametric and
parametric uncertainties. Then we use displacement and force signals to improve
the distribution of the states by resampling the set of particles. Finally, all
of the states are estimated from these posterior density functions. A set of
simulations considering three different noise levels demonstrates that the
performance of the particle filter approach is superior to the Kalman filter,
yielding substantially better performance when estimating nonlinear physical
systems in the presence of modeling uncertainties.

field on the ground-state structures and spin textures of the system are
systematically analyzed and discussed. For fixed SOC and DDI strengths, the
system shows a quadrupole stripe phase with a half-quantum vortex, or a
quadrupole Thomas-Fermi phase with a half-quantum antivortex for small
quadrupole field strength, depending on the ratio between inter- and
intraspecies interaction. As the quadrupole field strength enhances, the system
realizes a ring mixed phase with a hidden vortex-antivortex cluster rather than
an ordinary giant vortex in each component. Of particular interest, when the
strengths of DDI and quadrupole field are fixed, strong SOC leads to the
formation of criss-crossed vortex string structure. For given SOC and

or a special delaminated structure with a prolate antivortex in the spin-up
component. In addition, typical spin textures for the ground states of the

  Negative Influence",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Problem definition: Corporate brands, grassroots activists, and ordinary
citizens all routinely employ Word-of-mouth (WoM) diffusion to promote products
and instigate social change. Our work models the formation and spread of
negative attitudes via WoM on a social network represented by a directed graph.
In an online learning setting, we examine how an agent could simultaneously
learn diffusion parameters and choose sets of seed users to initiate diffusions
and maximize positive influence. In contrast to edge-level feedback, in which
an agent observes the relationship (edge) through which a user (node) is
influenced, we more realistically assume node-level feedback, where an agent
only observes when a user is influenced and whether that influence is positive
or negative. Methodology/results: We propose a new class of negativity-aware
Linear Threshold Models. We show that in these models, the expected positive
influence spread is a monotone submodular function of the seed set. Therefore,
when maximizing positive influence by selecting a seed set of fixed size, a
greedy algorithm can guarantee a solution with a constant approximation ratio.
For the online learning setting, we propose an algorithm that runs in epochs of
growing lengths, each consisting of a fixed number of exploration rounds
followed by an increasing number of exploitation rounds controlled by a
hyperparameter. Under mild assumptions, we show that our algorithm achieves
asymptotic expected average scaled regret that is inversely related to any
fractional constant power of the number of rounds. Managerial implications:
During seed selection, our negativity-aware models and algorithms allow WoM
campaigns to discover and best account for characteristics of local users and
propagated content. We also give the first algorithms with regret guarantees
for influence maximization under node-level feedback.

This structure is verified by analyzing two empirical networks from ecology and

from $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ with their inter- and intra-layer links and measure the
impact on the size of the largest connected component, $F_{2}$, in
$\mathcal{L}_{2}$, which we take as a robustness measure. We test different
attack scenarios by preferably removing peripheral or core nodes. We also vary
the intra-layer coupling between generalists and specialists, to study their

combinations of attack scenario and intra-layer coupling lead to very low

light on the robustness of bipartite networks, which consider only inter-layer,

necessary conservation task. The soundscape is a critical habitat component for
acoustically communicating organisms, but the use of the soundscape as a tool
for assessing disturbance impacts has been relatively unexplored until
recently. Here we present a broad modeling framework for assessing disturbance
impacts on soundscapes, which we apply to quantify the influence of a
shelterwood logging on soundscapes in northern Michigan. Our modeling approach
can be broadly applied to assess anthropogenic disturbance impacts on
soundscapes. The approach accommodates inherent differences in control and
treatment sites to improve inference about treatment effects, while also
accounting for extraneous variables (e.g., rain) that influence acoustic
indices.
  Recordings were obtained at 13 sites before and after a shelterwood logging.
Four sites were in the logging region and nine sites served as control
recordings outside the logging region. We quantify the soundscapes using common
acoustic indices (Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), Acoustic
Entropy (H), Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI),
Welch Power Spectral Density (PSD)) and build two hierarchical Bayesian models
to quantify the changes in the soundscape over the study period.
  Our analysis reveals no long-lasting effects of the shelterwood logging on
the soundscape diversity as measured by the NDSI, but analysis of H, AEI, and
PSD suggest changes in the evenness of sounds across the frequency spectrum,
indicating a potential shift in the avian species communicating in the
soundscapes as a result of the logging. Acoustic recordings, in conjunction
with this modeling framework, can deliver cost efficient assessment of
disturbance impacts on the landscape and underlying biodiversity as represented
through the soundscape.

complicates its use for diagnostics concerning the star-formation rate and
physical conditions in photodissociation regions (PDRs). We observed the giant
HII region N11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud with SOFIA/GREAT in order to
investigate the origin of [CII] to obtain the total H2 gas content, the
fraction of CO-dark H2 gas, and the influence of environmental effects such as
stellar feedback. We present an innovative spectral decomposition method that
allows statistical trends to be derived. The [CII] line is resolved in velocity
and compared to HI and CO, using a Bayesian approach to decompose the profiles.
A simple model accounting for collisions in the neutral atomic and molecular
gas was used in order to derive the H2 column density traced by C+. The profile
of [CII] most closely resembles that of CO, but the integrated [CII] line width
lies between that of CO and that of HI. Using various methods, we find that
[CII] mostly originates from the neutral gas. We show that [CII] mostly traces
the CO-dark H2 gas but there is evidence of a weak contribution from neutral
atomic gas preferentially in the faintest components. Most of the molecular gas
is CO-dark. The fraction of CO-dark H2 gas decreases with increasing CO column
density, with a slope that seems to depend on the impinging radiation field
from nearby massive stars. Finally we extend previous measurements of the
photoelectric-effect heating efficiency, which we find is constant across
regions probed with Herschel, with [CII] and [OI] being the main coolants in
faint and diffuse, and bright and compact regions, respectively, and with PAH
emission tracing the CO-dark H2 gas heating where [CII] and [OI] emit. Our
study highlights the importance of velocity-resolved PDR diagnostics and higher
spatial resolution for HI observations.

How to assign the weight of each task is a critical issue in the multi-task

spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC), which are confined in a two-dimensional (2D)

relatively small isotropic 2D RD-SOC leads to the generation of ghost vortices
for initially miscible BECs, while it gives rise to the creation of rectangular
vortex-antivortex lattices for initially immiscible BECs. As the strength of
the 2D RD-SOC enhances, the visible vortices or the 2D vortex-antivortex chains
are created for the former case, whereas the rectangular vortex-antivortex
lattices are transformed into vortex-antivortex rings for the later case. For
the initially immiscible BECs with fixed 2D RD-SOC strength, the increase of
rotation frequency can result in the structural phase transition from square
vortex lattice to irregular triangular vortex lattice and the system transition
from initial phase separation to phase mixing. In addition, we analyze the
combined effects of 1D RD-SOC and rotation on the vortex configurations of the
ground states for the case of initial phase separation. The increase of 1D SOC
strength, rotation frequency or both of them may result in the formation of
vortex chain and phase mixing. Furthermore, the typical spin textures for both
the cases of 2D RD-SOC and 1D RD-SOC are discussed. It is shown that the system
favors novel spin textures and skyrmion configurations including an exotic
skyrmion-half-skyrmion lattice (skyrmion-meron lattice), a complicated meron

model (BSM) of elementary particles together with necessity of its existence to
provide solutions of internal problems of the Standard model (SM) as well as of
physical nature of the basic elements of the modern cosmology demonstrates the
conspiracy of BSM physics. Simultaneously the data of precision cosmology only
tighten the constraints on the deviations from the now standard LambdaCDM model
and thus exhibit conspiracy of the nonstandard cosmological scenarios. We show
that studying new physics in combination of its physical, astrophysical and
cosmological probes, can not only unveil the conspiracy of BSM physics but will
also inevitably reveal nonstandard features in the cosmological scenario.

gained much popularity in the computer vision community. Applications can be
found in areas such as motion segmentation and face clustering. It assumes that
data originate from a union of subspaces, and clusters the data depending on
the corresponding subspace. In practice, it is reasonable to assume that a
limited amount of labels can be obtained, potentially at a cost. Therefore,
algorithms that can effectively and efficiently incorporate this information to
improve the clustering model are desirable. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for subspace clustering that sequentially queries
informative points and updates the subspace model. The query stage of the
proposed framework relies on results from the perturbation theory of principal
component analysis, to identify influential and potentially misclassified
points. A constrained subspace clustering algorithm is proposed that
monotonically decreases the objective function subject to the constraints
imposed by the labelled data. We show that our proposed framework is suitable
for subspace clustering algorithms including iterative methods and spectral
methods. Experiments on synthetic data sets, motion segmentation data sets, and
Yale Faces data sets demonstrate the advantage of our proposed active strategy

two-jet phenomenon is jointly controlled by the droplet-pool viscosity ratio,
the droplet Weber number, and the droplet-pool miscibility. The mechanism of
the surface-climbing jet is completely different from that of the Worthington
jet: the liquid in the pool climbs along the surface of the droplet and forms a
liquid layer which converges at the droplet apex and produces the
surface-climbing jet. This surface-climbing jet has a very high speed, i.e., an
order of magnitude higher than the droplet impact speed. The effects of the
impact speed, droplet viscosity, droplet size, and surface tension on the

fast-merging or low-kick binaries, which would coalesce in denser environments.
Nonetheless, present astronomical data are largely inconclusive on the

  Inference at the Edge of the Internet of Things",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The growing number of low-power smart devices in the Internet of Things is
coupled with the concept of ""Edge Computing"", that is moving some of the
intelligence, especially machine learning, towards the edge of the network.
Enabling machine learning algorithms to run on resource-constrained hardware,
typically on low-power smart devices, is challenging in terms of hardware
(optimized and energy-efficient integrated circuits), algorithmic and firmware
implementations. This paper presents FANN-on-MCU, an open-source toolkit built
upon the Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) library to run lightweight and
energy-efficient neural networks on microcontrollers based on both the ARM
Cortex-M series and the novel RISC-V-based Parallel Ultra-Low-Power (PULP)
platform. The toolkit takes multi-layer perceptrons trained with FANN and
generates code targeted at execution on low-power microcontrollers either with
a floating-point unit (i.e., ARM Cortex-M4F and M7F) or without (i.e., ARM
Cortex M0-M3 or PULP-based processors). This paper also provides an
architectural performance evaluation of neural networks on the most popular ARM
Cortex-M family and the parallel RISC-V processor called Mr. Wolf. The
evaluation includes experimental results for three different applications using
a self-sustainable wearable multi-sensor bracelet. Experimental results show a
measured latency in the order of only a few microseconds and a power
consumption of few milliwatts while keeping the memory requirements below the
limitations of the targeted microcontrollers. In particular, the parallel
implementation on the octa-core RISC-V platform reaches a speedup of 22x and a
69% reduction in energy consumption with respect to a single-core
implementation on Cortex-M4 for continuous real-time classification.

  International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control",,"10.1002/rnc.5361",,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model predictive control allows to provide high performance and safety
guarantees in the form of constraint satisfaction. These properties, however,
can be satisfied only if the underlying model, used for prediction, of the
controlled process is sufficiently accurate. One way to address this challenge
is by data-driven and machine learning approaches, such as Gaussian processes,
that allow to refine the model online during operation. We present a
combination of an output feedback model predictive control scheme and a
Gaussian process-based prediction model that is capable of efficient online
learning. To this end, the concept of evolving Gaussian processes is combined
with recursive posterior prediction updates. The presented approach guarantees
recursive constraint satisfaction and input-to-state stability with respect to
the model-plant mismatch. Simulation studies underline that the Gaussian
process prediction model can be successfully and efficiently learned online.
The resulting computational load is significantly reduced via the combination
of the recursive update procedure and by limiting the number of training data
points while maintaining good performance.

ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which can significantly
affect the control and maintenance strategies. Due to the uniqueness of each
specific building, traditional thermal dynamics modeling approaches heavily
depending on physics knowledge cannot generalize well. This study proposes a
deep supervised domain adaptation (DSDA) method for thermal dynamics modeling
of building indoor temperature evolution and energy consumption. A long short
term memory network based Sequence to Sequence scheme is pre-trained based on a
large amount of data collected from a building and then adapted to another
building which has a limited amount of data by applying the model fine-tuning.
We use four publicly available datasets: SML and AHU for temperature evolution,
long-term datasets from two different commercial buildings, termed as Building
1 and Building 2 for energy consumption. We show that the deep supervised
domain adaptation is effective to adapt the pre-trained model from one building
to another building and has better predictive performance than learning from
scratch with only a limited amount of data.

replenishable hyperpolarization of nuclear spins, boosting their NMR/MRI
signature by orders of magnitude. Nanodiamond powder rich in negatively charged
Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) defect centers has recently emerged as one such promising
platform, wherein 13C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped
defects completely at room temperature and at low magnetic fields. Given the
compelling possibility of relaying this 13C polarization to nuclei in external
liquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered production of highly
""hyperpolarizable"" diamond particles. In this paper, we report on a systematic
study of various material dimensions affecting optical 13C hyperpolarization in
diamond particles -- especially electron irradiation and annealing conditions
that drive NV center formation. We discover surprisingly that diamond annealing
at elevated temperatures close to 1720C have remarkable effects on the
hyperpolarization levels, enhancing them by upto 36-fold over materials
annealed through conventional means. We unravel the intriguing material origins
of these gains, and demonstrate they arise from a simultaneous improvement in
NV electron relaxation time and coherence time, as well as the reduction of
paramagnetic content, and an increase in 13C relaxation lifetimes. Overall this
points to significant recovery of the diamond lattice from radiation damage as
a result of the high-temperature annealing. Our work suggests methods for the
guided materials production of fluorescent, 13C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds
and pathways for their use as multi-modal (optical and MRI) imaging and
hyperpolarization agents.

bilayers fabricated by sputtering. Two methods have been employed to study SCC
in BSG(tBSG=6-16nm)/CoFeB(5nm) bilayers with different BSG thicknesses.
Firstly, spin pumping is used to generate a spin current in CoFeB and to detect
SCC by inverse Edelstein effect (IEE). The maximum SCC efficiency (SCE) is
measured as large as 0.035nm (IEE length {\lambda}IEE) in a 6nm thick BSG
sample, which shows a strong decay when tBSG increases due to the increase of
BSG surface roughness. The second method is the THz time-domain spectroscopy,
which reveals a small tBSG dependence of SCE, validating the occurrence of a
pure interface state related SCC. Furthermore, our angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy data shows a dispersive two-dimensional surface state that crosses
the bulk gap until to the Fermi level, proving the origin of SCC due to the
amorphous TI states. Our studies provide a new experimental direction towards
the search for topological systems in amorphous solids beyond crystalline
solids.

pre-trained on WIKIREF has already achieved reasonable performance. After
fine-tuning on the specific benchmark datasets, the model with data

$2.0\,fb^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment, the production of the
$\eta_c(1S)$ state in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s}=13 \text{ TeV}$ is studied in the rapidity range ${2.0 < y < 4.5}$
and in the transverse momentum range ${6.5 < p_{T} < 14.0\text{ GeV}}$. The
cross-section for prompt production of $\eta_c(1S)$ mesons relative to that of
the $J/\psi$ meson is measured using the ${p\bar{p}}$ decay mode and is found
to be ${\sigma_{\eta_c(1S)}/\sigma_{J/\psi} = 1.69 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.10 \pm
0.18}$. The quoted uncertainties are, in order, statistical, systematic and due
to uncertainties on the branching fractions of the ${J/\psi\to p \bar{p}}$ and
${\eta_c\to p \bar{p}}$ decays. The prompt $\eta_c(1S)$ production
cross-section is determined to be ${\sigma_{\eta_c(1S)} = 1.26 \pm 0.11\pm 0.08
\pm 0.14 \,\mu b}$, where the last uncertainty includes that on the ${J/\psi}$
meson cross-section. The ratio of the branching fractions of $b$-hadron decays
to the $\eta_c(1S)$ and ${J/\psi}$ states is measured to be
${\mathcal{B}_{b\to\eta_c X}/\mathcal{B}_{b\to J/\psi X} = 0.48 \pm 0.03 \pm
0.03 \pm 0.05}$, where the last uncertainty is due to those on the branching
fractions of the ${J/\psi \to p \bar{p}}$ and ${\eta_c\to p \bar{p}}$ decays.
The difference between the ${J/\psi}$ and $\eta_c(1S)$ masses is also
determined to be ${113.0 \pm 0.7 \pm 0.1\text{ MeV}}$, which is the most
precise single measurement of this quantity to date.

  black holes","Version published in PLB",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2021.136289",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The enhancement of the spectrum of primordial comoving curvature perturbation
$\R$ can induce the production of primordial black holes (PBH) which could
account for part of present day dark matter. As an example of the effects of
the modification of gravity on the production of PBHs, we investigate the
effects on the spectrum of $\R$ produced by the modification of gravity in the
case of G-inflation, deriving the relation between the unitary gauge curvature
perturbation $\zeta$ and the comoving curvature perturbation $\R$, and
identifying a background dependent enhancement function $\E$ which can induce
large differences between the two gauge invariant variables. We use this
relation to derive an equation for $\R$, showing for the presence of a momentum
dependent effective sound speed (MESS), associated to the intrinsic entropy
which can arise in modified gravity theories, in agreement with the model
independent MESS approach to cosmological perturbations.
  When $\zeta$ is not constant in time it is different from $\R$, for example
on sub-horizon scales, or in models exhibiting an anomalous super-horizon
growth of $\zeta$, but since this growth cannot last indefinitely, eventually
they will coincide. We derive the general condition for super-horizon growth of
$\zeta$, showing that slow-roll violation is not necessary. Since the abundance
of PBHs depends on the statistics of the peaks of the comoving density
contrast, which is related to the spectrum of $\R$, it is important to take
into account these effects on the PBHs abundance in modified gravity theories.

periodic trees. We prove that if the contact process survives weakly then it

of infected sites grows exponentially fast. As a consequence we conclude that
the contact process dies out at the critical value $\lambda_1$ for weak
survival, and the survival probability $p(\lambda)$ is continuous with respect
to the infection rate $\lambda$. Applying this fact, we show the contact
process on a general periodic tree experiences two phase transitions in the
sense that $\lambda_1<\lambda_2$, which confirms a conjecture of Stacey's
\cite{Stacey}. We also prove that if the contact process survives strongly at
$\lambda$ then it survives strongly at a $\lambda'<\lambda$, which implies that
the process does not survive strongly at the critical value $\lambda_2$ for
strong survival.

and capillarity forces in a porous medium. The main interest is the
stabilization of the fluid in Rayleigh-Taylor unstable situations where the
fluid lays on top of a dry region. An important feature considered here is that
the layer of fluid is under an impervious wall. This physical situation have
been widely study by mean of thin film approximations in the case of small
characteristic high of the fluid considering its strong interaction with the
fixed boundary. Here, instead of considering any simplification leading to
asymptotic models, we deal with the complete free boundary problem. We prove
that, if the fluid interface is smaller than an explicit constant, the solution
is global in time and it becomes instantly analytic. In particular, the fluid
does not form drops in finite time. Our results are stated in terms of Wiener
spaces for the interface together with some non-standard Wiener-Sobolev
anisotropic spaces required to describe the regularity of the fluid pressure
and velocity. These Wiener-Sobolev spaces are of independent interest as they
can be useful in other problems. Finally, let us remark that our techniques do
not rely on the irrotational character of the fluid in the bulk and they can be
applied to other free boundary problems.

computes the discriminative power of features, and then discretises them using

as to educate the eye to capture the dominating elastic modes. Special
distortions are studied, which have everywhere either the same octupolar

simulation on a quantum computer. As quantum computers use real-time evolution
we did not use the imaginary time methods popular on classical algorithms.
Instead, we implemented a real-time thermo field dynamics formalism, which has
the added benefit of being able to compute quantities that are both time- and
temperature-dependent. To implement thermo field dynamics we apply a unitary
transformation to discrete quantum mechanical operators to make new
Hamiltonians with encoded temperature dependence. The method works normally for
fermions, which have a finite representation, but needs some modification to
work with bosons. These Hamiltonians are then processed into a Pauli matrix
representation in order to be used as input for IBM's Qiskit package. We then
use IBM's quantum simulator to calculate an approximation to the Hamiltonaian's
ground state energy via the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm.
This approximation is then compared to a classically calculated value for the
exact energy. The thermo field dynamics quantum algorithm has general
applications to material science, high-energy physics and nuclear physics,
particularly in those situations involving real-time evolution at high

on a set of ""dissimilarity"" measures computed over different features: quantile
auto-covariances, and simple and partial autocorrelations. The main advantage
is that they allow summarizing each time series in a few representative
features so that they are computationally efficient, robust against outliers,
easy to automatize, and scalable to hundreds of thousands of smart meters
series. We evaluate the performance of each clustering model in a real-world
smart meter dataset with thousands of half-hourly time series. The results show
how the obtained clusters identify relevant consumption behaviors of households
and capture part of their geo-demographic segmentation. Moreover, we apply a
supervised classification procedure to explore which features are more relevant
to define each cluster.

were used to provide a diverse set of energy functions each containing many
local valleys (LVs) with different energies, widths, escape barrier heights,

D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) to find potentially important LVs in the energy
functions of Ising spin glasses that may be missed by classical searches. For
classical search, extensive simulated annealing (SA) was conducted to find as
many LVs as possible regardless of the computational cost. SA was conducted
long enough to ensure that the number of SA-found LVs approaches that and
eventually significantly exceeds the number of the LVs found by a single call
submitted to the D-Wave. Even after a prohibitively long SA search, as many as
30-50% of the D-Wave-found LVs remained not found by the SA. In order to
establish if LVs found only by the D-Wave represent potentially important
regions of the configuration space, they were compared to those that were found
by both techniques. While the LVs found by the D-Wave but missed by SA
predominantly had higher energies and lower escape barriers, there was a
significant fraction having intermediate values of the energy and barrier
height. With respect to most other important LV parameters, the LVs found only
by the D-Wave were distributed in a wide range of the parameters' values. It
was established that for large or small, shallow or deep, wide or narrow LVs,
the LVs found only by the D-Wave are distinguished by a few-times smaller size
of the LV basin of attraction (BoA). Apparently, the size of the BoA is not or
at least is less important for QA search compared to the classical search,
allowing QA to easily find many potentially important (e.g., wide and deep) LVs
missed by even prohibitively lengthy classical searches.

about the history and various general properties of these solutions, though
mainly focusing on the small but nonzero classical scalar field radiation
emitted by them. The radiation for higher amplitude states can be calculated by
a spectral numerical method. For small and moderately large amplitudes an
analytical approach based on complex extension, asymptotic matching and Borel

development of image Super-Resolution(SR) have witnessed a lot of impressive
results. Depending on our observation, although more layers and connections
could always improve performance, the increase of model parameters is not
conducive to launch application of SR algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms
supervised by L1/L2 loss can achieve considerable performance on traditional
metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, yet resulting in blurry and over-smoothed
outputs without sufficient high-frequency details, namely low perceptual
index(PI). Regarding the issues, this paper develops a perception-oriented
single image SR algorithm via dual relativistic average generative adversarial
networks. In the generator part, a novel residual channel attention block is
proposed to recalibrate significance of specific channels, further increasing
feature expression capabilities. Parameters of convolutional layers within each
block are shared to expand receptive fields while maintain the amount of
tunable parameters unchanged. The feature maps are subsampled using sub-pixel
convolution to obtain reconstructed high-resolution images. The discriminator
part consists of two relativistic average discriminators that work in pixel
domain and feature domain, respectively, fully exploiting the prior that half
of data in a mini-batch are fake. Different weighted combinations of perceptual
loss and adversarial loss are utilized to supervise the generator to
equilibrate perceptual quality and objective results. Experimental results and
ablation studies show that our proposed algorithm can rival state-of-the-art SR
algorithms, both perceptually(PI-minimization) and
objectively(PSNR-maximization) with fewer parameters.

between disorder and electronic interaction using mean field approximation of

nullify each other is corroborated by the fact that honeycomb lattice needs
more strength of electronic correlation owing to its less co-ordination number
which enhances the effect of disorder. The extent of revival of the butterfly
is better in square than honeycomb lattice due to higher coordination number.
The effect of disorder and interaction is also investigated to study
entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. It has been observed that for
the square lattice, area law of entanglement entropy is violated for
intermediate strength magnetic and magnitude of such departure from area law
depends on disorder and interaction as well. However such departure from area
law is absence for honeycomb lattice. Moreover the entanglement spectrum for
square lattice does have the symmetry of original Hofstadter butterfly and this
symmetry is destroyed in the presence of disorder. The interaction opens up a
gap in the entanglement spectrum as well. For the honeycomb lattice, the
entanglement spectrum forms a continuous band without any symmetry and its
feature is mostly unchanged in the presence of disorder as well as interaction.

available transfer capabilities (ATCs) via autonomous topology control
considering various practical constraints and uncertainties. Several AI
techniques including supervised learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
are adopted and improved to train effective AI agents for achieving the desired
performance. First, imitation learning (IL) is used to provide a good initial
policy for the AI agent. Then, the agent is trained by DRL algorithms with a
novel guided exploration technique, which significantly improves the training
efficiency. Finally, an Early Warning (EW) mechanism is designed to help the
agent find good topology control strategies for long testing periods, which
helps the agent to determine action timing using power system domain knowledge;
thus, effectively increases the system error-tolerance and robustness.
Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the ""2019 Learn to
Run a Power Network (L2RPN)"" global competition, where the developed AI agents
can continuously and safely control a power grid to maximize ATCs without
operator's intervention for up to 1-month's operation data and eventually won
the first place in both development and final phases of the competition. The
winning agent has been open-sourced on GitHub.

preserving measurements that did not require correction in MS patient data. We
show that image descriptors can be used as input to a machine learning

active-cell approximation to analyse the saddle-node bifurcation and
stabilities of the corresponding solutions along the snaking curves. Numerical
simulations show that the active-cell approximation gives good agreement for
all of the lattice types when the coupling is weak. We also consider planar

load modeling with ZIP and induction motors (ZIP + IM) is no longer adequate to
address the current load characteristic transitions. In recent years, the WECC
composite load model (WECC CLM) has shown to effectively capture the dynamic
load responses over traditional load models in various stability studies and
contingency analyses. However, a detailed WECC CLM model typically has a high
degree of complexity, with over one hundred parameters, and no systematic
approach to identifying and calibrating these parameters. Enabled by the wide
deployment of PMUs and advanced deep learning algorithms, proposed here is a
double deep Q-learning network (DDQN)-based, two-stage load modeling framework
for the WECC CLM. This two-stage method decomposes the complicated WECC CLM for
more efficient identification and does not require explicit model details. In
the first stage, the DDQN agent determines an accurate load composition. In the
second stage, the parameters of the WECC CLM are selected from a group of
Monte-Carlo simulations. The set of selected load parameters is expected to

  reports with machine learning","8 pages, first version",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rapid growth of text data has motivated the development of
machine-learning based automatic text summarization strategies that concisely
capture the essential ideas in a larger text. This study aimed to devise an
extractive summarization method for A-133 Single Audits, which assess if
recipients of federal grants are compliant with program requirements for use of
federal funding. Currently, these voluminous audits must be manually analyzed
by officials for oversight, risk management, and prioritization purposes.
Automated summarization has the potential to streamline these processes.
Analysis focused on the ""Findings"" section of ~20,000 Single Audits spanning
2016-2018. Following text preprocessing and GloVe embedding, sentence-level
k-means clustering was performed to partition sentences by topic and to
establish the importance of each sentence. For each audit, key summary
sentences were extracted by proximity to cluster centroids. Summaries were
judged by non-expert human evaluation and compared to human-generated summaries
using the ROUGE metric. Though the goal was to fully automate summarization of
A-133 audits, human input was required at various stages due to large
variability in audit writing style, content, and context. Examples of human
inputs include the number of clusters, the choice to keep or discard certain
clusters based on their content relevance, and the definition of a top
sentence. Overall, this approach made progress towards automated extractive
summaries of A-133 audits, with future work to focus on full automation and
improving summary consistency. This work highlights the inherent difficulty and
subjective nature of automated summarization in a real-world application.

supply chain have each created their own version of the metadata for a musical
work, often by manually re-entering the same information or through scraping

the information becomes manually laborious and error-prone. Furthermore,
confidential information regarding the legal ownership of the musical work is
often commingled in the same metadata, making the entire database proprietary

metadata following the open access paradigm found in other industries, such as
in book publishing, library systems and in the automotive parts supply chain.
The vision is to create a new music metadata layer for creation metadata that
is open, scalable and provides an authoritative source of information that is

mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and
Bell's inequality, enforced by the recent loophole-free experimental tests,
reject a realist view that any observable has its own value at any time
consistent with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, and favor a
skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the
value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning.
However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a
quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Suppose that two observers
simultaneously measure the same observable. We ask whether they always obtain
the same outcomes, or their probability distributions are the same but the
outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the
second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case
occurs. This suggests the existence of a correlation between the measurement
outcome and the pre-existing value of the measured observable as a common cause
for the coincidence of the outcomes. In fact, we shall show that any
measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be
measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like
entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also argue that our
conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called ""generalized""
observables, suggesting a demand for more careful analysis on the notion of
observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.
