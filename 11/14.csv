and pose 117 new conjectural series for powers of $\pi$ via looking for

We derive some error bounds for the prediction error in terms of non-asymptotic
probability under the uniform metric and $L_p$ metrics when the spectral
densities of both the true and the imposed correlation functions decay
algebraically. The Mat\'ern family is a prominent class of correlation
functions of this kind. Our analysis shows that, when the smoothness of the
imposed correlation function exceeds that of the true correlation function, the
prediction error becomes more sensitive to the space-filling property of the
design points. In particular, the kriging predictor can still reach the optimal
rate of convergence, if the experimental design scheme is quasi-uniform. Lower
bounds of the kriging prediction error are also derived under the uniform
metric and $L_p$ metrics. An accurate characterization of this error is
obtained, when an oversmoothed correlation function and a space-filling design
is used.

galaxy formation and evolution as they provide direct information about the

detailed analysis of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies taken from the KINGFISH
survey. The photometric parameters of the morphological components are obtained
from bulge-disk decompositions using GALFIT data analysis algorithm, with
surface photometry of the sample done beforehand. Dust opacities are determined
using a previously discovered correlation between the central face-on dust
opacity of the disk and the stellar mass surface density. The method and the
library of numerical results previously obtained are used to correct the
measured photometric and structural parameteres for projection (inclination),
dust and decomposition effects in order to derive their intrinsic values.
Galaxy disk scaling relations are then presented, both the measured (observed)
and the intrinsic (corrected) ones, in the optical regime, to show the scale of
the biases introduced by the aforementioned effects. The slopes of the
size-luminosity relations and the dust vs stellar mass are in agreement with
values found in other works. We derive mean dust optical depth and dust/stellar
mass ratios of the sample, which we find to be consistent with previous studies
of nearby spiral galaxies. While our sample is rather small, it is sufficient
to quantify the influence of galaxy environment (dust, in this case) when
deriving scaling relations.

calculate the extent to which this effect can drive changes in surface

with large ocean fractions should experience only modest warming and cooling of
only a few degrees, which suggests that habitability cannot be precluded for
such circumbinary planets. Planets with large land fractions that experience
extreme periodic forcing could be prone to changes in temperature of tens of
degrees or more, which could drive more extreme climate changes that inhibit

strategy $\sigma'$, if the probability of reaching the target state within
horizon $t$ is larger under $\sigma$ than under $\sigma'$, for all sufficiently

optimal strategy, does not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for

proven for reachability objective extend to this model. We finally discuss

differentiation matrix is skew-symmetric and highly structured. Such systems,
where the differentiation matrix is skew-symmetric, tridiagonal and

further, imposing the extra requirement of fast computation: specifically, that
the first $N$ coefficients {of the expansion} can be computed to high accuracy
in $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$ operations. We consider two settings, one
approximating a function $f$ directly in $(-\infty,\infty)$ and the other

can be computed using fast sine and cosine transforms. Banded,
Toeplitz-plus-Hankel multiplication operators are also possible for

The document has 9 pages and 16 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  5G will enable the growing demand for Internet of Things (IoT),
high-resolution video streaming, and low latency wireless services. Demand for
such services is expected to growth rapid, which will require a search for
Beyond 5G technological advancements in wireless communications. Part of these
advancements is the need for additional spectrum, namely moving toward the
terahertz (THz) range. To compensate for the high path loss in THz, narrow
beamwidths are used to improve antenna gains. However, with narrow beamwidths,
even minor fluctuations in device location (such as through body movement) can
cause frequent link failures due to beam misalignment. In this paper, we
provide a solution to these small-scale indoor movement that result in
mobility-induced outages. Like a moth randomly flutters about, Mobility-induced
Outages in THz (MOTH) can be ephemeral in nature and hard to avoid. To deal
with MOTH we propose two methods to predict these outage scenarios: (i)
Align-After-Failure (AAF), which predicts based on fixed time margins, and (ii)
Align-Before-Failure (ABF), which learns the time margins through user mobility
patterns. In this paper, two different online classifiers were used to train
the ABF model to predicate if a mobility-induced outage is going to occur;
thereby, significantly reducing the time spent in outage scenarios. Simulation
results demonstrate a relationship between optimal beamwidth and human mobility
patterns. Additionally, to cater to a future with dense deployment of Wireless
Personal Area Network (WPAN), it is necessary that we have efficient deployment
of resources (e.g., THz-APs). One solution is to maximize the user coverage for
a single AP, which might be dependent on multiple parameters. We identify these
parameters and observe their tradeoffs for improving user coverage through a
single THz-AP.

structure of complex materials via Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) over their full First Brillouin Zone is pushing the
development of schemes to efficiently generate ultrashort photon pulses in the
VUV-range of photon energies. At present, the critical aspect is to combine a
high photon energy with high photoemission count rates and a small
pulse-bandwidth, necessary to achieve high energy resolution in ARPES, while
preserving a good time resolution and mitigating space-charge effects. Here we
describe a novel approach to produce light pulses at 10.8 eV, combining high
repetition rate operation (1-4 MHz), high energy resolution ($\sim26$ meV) and
space-charge free operation, with a time-resolution of $\sim$700 fs. These
results have been achieved by generating the 9th harmonic of a Yb fiber laser,
through a phase-matched process of third harmonic generation in Xenon of the
laser third harmonic. The full up-conversion process is driven by a seed pulse
energy as low as 10 $\mu$J, hence is easily scalable to multi-MHz operation.
This source opens the way to TR-ARPES experiments for the investigation of the
electron dynamics over the full first Brillouin zone of most complex materials,
with unprecedented energy and momentum resolutions and high count rates. The
performances of our setup are tested in a number of experiments on WTe$_2$ and
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, of which we measure the electronic band structure in energy,
two-dimensional momentum and time.

develop a robust hierarchical modelling approach to leverage animal data into

potentially heterogeneous patient subgroups. Translation parameters are used to
bring both historical and contemporary data onto a common dosing scale. This
leads to feasible exchangeability assumptions that the parameter vectors, which
underpin the dose-toxicity relationship per study, are assumed to be drawn from
a common distribution. Moreover, human dose-toxicity parameter vectors are
assumed to be exchangeable either with the standardised, animal study-specific
parameter vectors, or between themselves. Possibility of non-exchangeability
for each parameter vector is considered to avoid inferences for extreme
subgroups being overly influenced by the other. We illustrate the proposed
approach with several trial data examples, and evaluate the operating
characteristics of our model compared with several alternatives in a simulation

atmosphere. Despite over fifty years of robotic exploration, including thirteen
successful atmosphere probes and landers, our knowledge of N2, the
second-most-abundant compound in the atmosphere, is highly uncertain (von Zahn
et al., 1983). We report the first measurement of the nitrogen content of
Venus' atmosphere at altitudes between 60 and 100 km. Our result, 5.0 +/- 0.4
v% N2, is significantly higher than the value of 3.5 v% N2 reported for the
lower atmosphere (<50 km altitude). We conclude that Venus' atmosphere contains
two chemically-distinct regions, contrasting sharply with the expectation that
it should be uniform across these altitude due to turbulent mixing (e.g. Oyama
et al., 1980). That the lower-mass component is more concentrated at high
altitudes suggests that the chemical profile of the atmosphere above 50-km
altitude reflects mass segregation of CO2 and N2. A similar boundary between
well-mixed and mass-segregated materials exists for Earth, however it is
located at a substantially higher altitude of ~100 km. That Venus' upper and
lower atmosphere are not in chemical equilibrium complicates efforts to use
remote sensing measurements to infer the properties of the lower atmosphere and
surface, a lesson that also applied to the growing field of exoplanet
astronomy. The observation of periodic increases in SO2 concentrations in
Venus' upper atmosphere, which has been cited as evidence for active volcanic
eruptions at the surface (Esposito et al., 1984), may instead be attributable
to atmosphere processes that periodically inject SO2 from the lower atmosphere
into the upper atmosphere.

molecular outflows in 13 local galaxies with high FIR surface brightness, and
combine with results from the literature. CO line ratios and outflow structure
provide some constraints on the conversion from observables to quantities such
as molecular mass outflow rates. Ratios between outflow emission in higher J CO
transitions and in CO(1-0) typically are consistent with excitation Ri1<~1. For
IRAS 13120-5453, however, R31=2.10 indicates optically thin CO in the outflow.
Like much of the outflow literature, we use alpha(CO) = 0.8, and we present
arguments for using C=1 in deriving molecular mass outflow rates Mdot =
C*M*v/R. We compare the two main methods for molecular outflow detection: CO mm
interferometry and Herschel OH spectroscopy. For 26 sources studied with both
methods, we find 80% agreement in detecting vout>~150km/s outflows, and
non-matches can be plausibly ascribed to outflow geometry and SNR. For 12
bright ULIRGs with detailed OH-based outflow modeling, CO outflows are detected
in all but one. Outflow masses, velocities, and sizes for these 11 sources
agree well between the two methods, and modest remaining differences may relate
to the different but overlapping regions sampled by CO emission and OH
absorption. Outflow properties correlate better with AGN luminosity and with
bolometric luminosity than with FIR surface brightness. The most massive
outflows are found for systems with current AGN activity, but significant
outflows in non-AGN systems must relate to star formation or to AGN activity in
the recent past. We report scaling relations for the increase of outflow mass,
rate, momentum rate, and kinetic power with bolometric luminosity. Short
~10^6yr flow times and some sources with resolved multiple outflow episodes
support a role of intermittent driving, likely by AGN. (abridged)

tokamak transport heat and particle fluxes. QLKNN is a surrogate model based on
a database of 300 million flux calculations of the quasilinear gyrokinetic
transport model QuaLiKiz. The database covers a wide range of realistic tokamak
core parameters. Physical features such as the existence of a critical gradient
for the onset of turbulent transport were integrated into the neural network
training methodology. We have coupled QLKNN to the tokamak modelling framework
JINTRAC and rapid control-oriented tokamak transport solver RAPTOR. The coupled
frameworks are demonstrated and validated through application to three JET
shots covering a representative spread of H-mode operating space, predicting
turbulent transport of energy and particles in the plasma core. JINTRAC-QLKNN
and RAPTOR-QLKNN are able to accurately reproduce JINTRAC-QuaLiKiz T i,e and n
e profiles, but 3 to 5 orders of magnitude faster. Simulations which take hours
are reduced down to only a few tens of seconds. The discrepancy in the final
source-driven predicted profiles between QLKNN and QuaLiKiz is on the order
1%-15%. Also the dynamic behaviour was well captured by QLKNN, with differences
of only 4%-10% compared to JINTRAC-QuaLiKiz observed at mid-radius, for a study
of density buildup following the L-H transition. Deployment of neural network
surrogate models in multi-physics integrated tokamak modelling is a promising
route towards enabling accurate and fast tokamak scenario optimization,
Uncertainty Quantification, and control applications.

with poor prognosis. The mechanisms of its pathogenesis and prognosis require
urgent elucidation. This study was performed to screen potential biomarkers
related to the occurrence, development and prognosis of LUSC to reveal unknown
physiological and pathological processes. Materials and Methods Using
bioinformatics analysis, the lung squamous cell carcinoma microarray datasets
from the GEO and TCGA databases were analyzed to identify differentially
expressed genes(DEGs). Furthermore, PPI and WGCNA network analysis were
integrated to identify the key genes closely related to the process of LUSC
development. In addition, survival analysis was performed to achieve a
prognostic model that accomplished a high level of prediction accuracy. Results
and Conclusion Eighty-five up-regulated and 39 down-regulated genes were
identified, on which functional and pathway enrichment analysis was conducted.
GO analysis demonstrated that up-regulated genes were principally enriched in
epidermal development and DNA unwinding in DNA replication. Down-regulated
genes were mainly involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction and positive
regulation of inflammatory response. After PPI and WGCNA network analysis,
eight genes, including AURKA, RAD51, TTK, AURKB, CCNA2, TPX2, KPNA2 and KIF23,
have been found to play a vital role in LUSC development. The prognostic model
contained 20 genes, 18 of which were detrimental to prognosis. The AUC of the
established prognostic model for predicting the survival of patients at 1, 3,
and 5 years was 0.828, 0.826 and 0.824, respectively. To conclude, this study
identified a number of biomarkers of significant interest for additional
investigation of the therapies and methods of prognosis of lung squamous cell
carcinoma.

u}$ are replaced by a hyper-viscous term $-\nu_p(-\nabla^2)^{p}{\bf u}$ in
order to suppress the effect of viscosity at the large scales. In this work we
examine the effect of hyper-viscosity on decaying turbulence for values of $p$
ranging from $p=1$ (regular viscosity) up to $p=100$. Our study is based on
direct numerical simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex for resolutions from
$512^3$ to $2048^3$. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of the total
energy $E$ and the energy dissipation $\epsilon$ remain almost unaffected by
the order of the hyper-viscosity used. However, as the order of the
hyper-viscosity is increased ,the energy spectrum develops a more pronounced
bottleneck that contaminates the inertial range. At the largest values of $p$
examined, the spectrum at the bottleneck range has a positive power-law
behavior $E(k)\propto k^\alpha$ with the power-law exponent $\alpha$
approaching the value obtained in flows at thermal equilibrium $\alpha=2$. This
agrees with the prediction of Frisch et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 144501
(2008)] who suggested that at high values of $p$, the flow should behave like
the truncated Euler equations (TEE). Nonetheless, despite the thermalization of
the spectrum, the flow retains a finite dissipation rate up to the examined
order, which disagrees with the predictions of the TEE system implying
suppression of energy dissipation. We reconcile the two apparently
contradictory results, predicting the value of $p$ for which the hyper-viscous
Navier-Stokes goes over to the TEE system and we discuss why thermalization
appears at smaller values of $p$.

the neighborhood area is a circular region with the post office located at its

boundary. We propose a trajectory process such that if according to which the
drones move, a uniform coverage can be achieved while the delivery efficiency
is still preserved. We then consider a more practical scenario in which the
delivery destinations are arbitrarily distributed in an arbitrarily-shaped
region. We also do not assume any restrictions on the package arrivals. We show
that simultaneous uniform coverage and efficient package delivery is possible
for such realistic scenarios. This is shown using both rigorous analyses as

  Pham","Extracting 2D weak labels from volume labels using multiple instance
  learning in CT hemorrhage detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a supervised learning methodology that
aims to allow models to learn instance class labels from bag class labels,
where a bag is defined to contain multiple instances. MIL is gaining traction
for learning from weak labels but has not been widely applied to 3D medical
imaging. MIL is well-suited to clinical CT acquisitions since (1) the highly
anisotropic voxels hinder application of traditional 3D networks and (2)
patch-based networks have limited ability to learn whole volume labels. In this
work, we apply MIL with a deep convolutional neural network to identify whether
clinical CT head image volumes possess one or more large hemorrhages (>
20cm$^3$), resulting in a learned 2D model without the need for 2D slice
annotations. Individual image volumes are considered separate bags, and the
slices in each volume are instances. Such a framework sets the stage for
incorporating information obtained in clinical reports to help train a 2D
segmentation approach. Within this context, we evaluate the data requirements
to enable generalization of MIL by varying the amount of training data. Our
results show that a training size of at least 400 patient image volumes was
needed to achieve accurate per-slice hemorrhage detection. Over a five-fold
cross-validation, the leading model, which made use of the maximum number of
training volumes, had an average true positive rate of 98.10%, an average true
negative rate of 99.36%, and an average precision of 0.9698. The models have
been made available along with source code to enabled continued exploration and
adaption of MIL in CT neuroimaging.

generate a dc photocurrent, i.e. the Berry curvature, the quantum metric, and
the diabatic motion. All three effects can be understood intuitively from the
anomalous acceleration. The first two terms are respectively the antisymmetric
and symmetric parts of the quantum geometric tensor. The last term is due to
the dynamical antilocalization that appears from the phase accumulation between
time-reversed fermion loops. Additionally, we derive the semiclassical
conductivity that includes both intra- and interband effects. We find that
$\mathcal{T}$-breaking can lead to a greatly enhanced non-linear anomalous Hall
effect that is beyond the contribution by the Berry curvature dipole.

we explain in detail. In our exact quantum model, we solve the time-dependent

frequency, averaged over the initial thermal COM momentum distribution of the

on commodity computers. Our analysis reveals that some of these devices feature
secret-dependent execution times during signature generation based on elliptic
curves. In particular, we discovered timing leakage on an Intel firmware-based
TPM as well as a hardware TPM. We show how this information allows an attacker
to apply lattice techniques to recover 256-bit private keys for ECDSA and
ECSchnorr signatures. On Intel fTPM, our key recovery succeeds after about
1,300 observations and in less than two minutes. Similarly, we extract the
private ECDSA key from a hardware TPM manufactured by STMicroelectronics, which
is certified at Common Criteria (CC) EAL 4+, after fewer than 40,000
observations. We further highlight the impact of these vulnerabilities by
demonstrating a remote attack against a StrongSwan IPsec VPN that uses a TPM to
generate the digital signatures for authentication. In this attack, the remote
client recovers the server's private authentication key by timing only 45,000
authentication handshakes via a network connection.
  The vulnerabilities we have uncovered emphasize the difficulty of correctly
implementing known constant-time techniques, and show the importance of
evolutionary testing and transparent evaluation of cryptographic

character, confirming the presence of an indirect- to direct-gap transition.
The importance of alloy disorder is highlighted by investigating the impact on
the electronic structure of the formation of a nearest-neighbour Pb-Pb pair.
Having established the importance of short-range disorder, we analyse the
electronic structure evolution as a function of $x$ using a series of 128-atom
special quasi-random structures (SQSs). Our calculations reveal a strong
reduction (increase) of the band gap (spin-orbit splitting energy), by $\approx
100$ meV ($\approx 40$ meV) per % Pb replacing Ge. We find an indirect- to
direct-gap transition occurring in a narrow composition range centred about $x
\approx 7$%, close to which composition we calculate that the alloy becomes
semimetallic. Further analysis suggests that long-range order introduced by
Born von Karman (supercell) boundary conditions leads to overestimated energy
splitting of the Ge L$_{6c}$-derived CB states in the 128-atom SQSs. Accounting
for these finite-size effects, we expect a direct band gap to emerge in
Ge$_{1-x}$Pb$_{x}$ for $x \gtrsim 3 - 4$%.

In this paper, we use the Axelrod model of cultural dissemination to represent
opinion-based groups. In the Axelrod model, each agent has a set of features
which each holds one of a set of nominally related traits. Survey data, for
example, has a similar structure, where each participant answers each of a set
of items with responses from a fixed list. We present an alternative method of
displaying the Axelrod model by representing it as a bipartite graph, i.e.,
participants and their responses as separate nodes. This allows us to see which
feature-trait combinations are selected in the final state. This visualisation
is particularly useful when representing survey data as it illustrates the
co-evolution of cultures and opinion-based groups in Axelrod's model of
cultural diffusion. We also present a modification to the Axelrod model. A
standard finding of the Axelrod model with many features is for all agents to
fully agree in one cluster. We introduce an agreement threshold and allow nodes
to interact only with those neighbours who are within this threshold (i.e.,
those with similar opinions) rather than those with any opinion. This method
reliably yields a large number of clusters for small agreement thresholds and,
importantly, does not limit to single cluster when the number of features grows
large. This potentially provides a method for modelling opinion-based groups
where as opinions are added, the number of clusters increase.

typical covering map of large degree to a fixed, regular graph has its new
adjacency eigenvalues within the bound conjectured by Alon for random regular
graphs. Many of the techniques we develop hold whether or not the base graph is
regular.
  Our first main theorem in this series of articles is that if the base graph
is $d$-regular, then for any $\epsilon>0$, as the degree, $n$, of the covering
map tends to infinity, some new adjacency eigenvalue of the map is larger in
absolute value that $2(d-1)^{1/2}+\epsilon$ with probability at most order
$1/n$. Our second main theorem is that if, in addition, the base graph is
Ramanujan, then this probability is bounded above and below by $1/n$ to the
power of a positive integer that we call the {\em tangle power} of the model,
i.e., of the probability spaces of random covering maps of degree $n$.
  The tangle power is fairly easy to bound from below, and at times to compute
exactly; it measures the probability that certain {\em tangles} appear in the
random covering graph, where a {\em tangle} is a local event that forces the
covering graph to have a new eigenvalue strictly larger than $2(d-1)^{1/2}$.
  Our main theorems are relativizations of Alon's conjecture on the second
eigenvalue of random regular graphs of large degree.

constellation of sub-populations with ages in the range 10 to 50 Myr. Such
populations might represent the best example of the outcome of clustered star
formation in Giant Molecular clouds (GMC). We use Gaia DR2 data over an area of
40 deg radius around the open cluster Collinder 135 to extend the study of the
stellar populations of the Vela OB2 region over an area of several hundreds of
parsecs on sky. Detailed clustering algorithms combined with the exquisite
astrometric quality of the GAIA catalogue allow us to detect a new cluster
named BBJ 1 that shows the same age as NGC 2547 (30 to 35 Myr), but located at
a distance of 260 pc from it. Deeper investigation of the region via clustering
in 5D parameter space and in the colour-magnitude diagram allows us to detect a
filamentary structure of stars that bridges the two clusters. Given the extent
in space of such structure (260 pc) and the young age (~35 Myr), we exclude
that such population originates by the same mechanism responsible to create
tidal streams around older clusters. Even if we miss a complete picture of the
3D motion of the studied stellar structure because of the lack of accurate
radial velocity measurements, we propose that such structure represent the
detection of a 35 Myr old outcome of a mechanism of filamentary star formation
in a GMC.

  In this paper we consider random graphs that are random covering graphs of

expansion in $1/n$ for the expected value of the number of strictly
non-backtracking closed walks of length $k$ times the indicator function that
the graph is free of certain {\em tangles}; moreover, we prove that the
coefficients of these expansions are ""nice functions"" of $k$, namely
approximately equal to a sum of polynomials in $k$ times exponential functions
of $k$.
  Our results use the methods of Friedman used to resolve Alon's original
conjecture, combined with the results of Article~II in this series of articles.
One simplification in this article over the previous methods of Friedman is
that the ""regularlized traces"" used in this article, which we call {\em
certified traces}, are far easier to define and work with than the previously

covering map of large degree to a fixed, regular graph has its new adjacency
eigenvalues within the bound conjectured by Alon for random regular graphs.
  In this paper we prove a {\em Sidestepping Theorem} that is more general and
easier to use than earlier theorems of this kind. Such theorems concerns a
family probability spaces $\{{\mathcal{M}}_n\}$ of $n\times n$ matrices, where
$n$ varies over some infinite set, $N$, of natural numbers. Many trace methods
use simple ""Markov bounds"" to bound the expected spectral radius of elements of
${\mathcal{M}}_n$: this consists of choosing one value, $k=k(n)$, for each
$n\in N$, and proving expected spectral radius bounds based on the expected
value of the trace of the $k=k(n)$-power of elements of ${\mathcal{M}}_n$. {\em
Sidestepping} refers to bypassing such simple Markov bounds, obtaining improved
results using a number of values of $k$ for each fixed $n\in N$.
  In more detail, if the $M\in {\mathcal{M}}_n$ expected value of ${\rm
Trace}(M^k)$ has an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/n$, whose coefficients
are ""well behaved"" functions of $k$, then one can get improved bounds on the
spectral radius of elements of ${\mathcal{M}}_n$ that hold with high
probability. Such asymptotic expansions are shown to exist in the third article
in this series for the families of matrices that interest us; in the fifth and
sixth article in this series we will apply the Sidestepping Theorem in this
article to prove the main results in this series of articles.
  This article is independent of all other articles in this series; it can be
viewed as a theorem purely in probability theory, concerning random matrices
or, equivalently, the $n$ random variables that are the eigenvalues of the
elements of ${\mathcal{M}}_n$.

$k$ connected subgraphs that have similar weights, for a fixed integer $k\geq
2$. This problem, known as the \emph{balanced connected $k$-partition problem}
($BCP_k$), is defined as follows. Given a connected graph $G$ with nonnegative
weights on the vertices, find a partition $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^k$ of $V(G)$ such that
each class $V_i$ induces a connected subgraph of $G$, and the weight of a class
with the minimum weight is as large as possible. It is known that $BCP_k$ is
$NP$-hard even on bipartite graphs and on interval graphs. It has been largely
investigated under different approaches and perspectives. On the practical
side, $BCP_k$ is used to model many applications arising in police patrolling,
image processing, cluster analysis, operating systems and robotics. We propose
three integer linear programming formulations for the balanced connected
$k$-partition problem. The first one contains only binary variables and a
potentially large number of constraints that are separable in polynomial time.
Some polyhedral results on this formulation, when all vertices have unit
weight, are also presented. The other formulations are based on flows and have
a polynomial number of constraints and variables. Preliminary computational
experiments have shown that the proposed formulations outperform the other

electron differs from the classical macroscopic field imprint of a bar magnet.
It resembles more like an eight figure or else joint double quantum-dots
instead of the classical, spherical more uniform field of a bar magnet. This
actual subatomic quantum magnetic field of an electron at rest, is called
Quantum Magnet or else a Magneton. Normally, a macroscale bar magnet should
behave like a relative giant Quantum Magnet with identical magnetic dipole
field imprint since all of its individual magnetons collectively inside the
material, dipole moments are uniformly aligned forming the total net field of
the magnet. However due to Quantum Decoherence (QDE) phenomenon at the
macroscale and macroscopic magnetic field imaging sensors limitations which
cannot pickup these rapid quantum magnetization fluctuations, this field is
masked and not visible at the macroscale. By using the relative inexpensive
submicron resolution Ferrolens quantum magnetic optical sensor and method, we
can actually make this net magneton field visible on macroscale magnets. We
call this net total field herein, Quantum Field of Magnet (QFM) differentiating
it therefore from the field of the single subatomic magneton thus quantum
magnet. Additionally, the unique potential of the Ferrolens device to display
also the magnetic flux lines of this macroscopically projected giant Magenton
gives us the unique opportunity to study the individual magnetic flux lines
geometrical pattern that of a single subatomic magneton. We describe this
particular magnetic flux of the magneton observed, quantum magnetic flux.
Therefore a novel observation has been made that the QFM of the Magnet-Magneton
consists of a dipole vortex shaped magnetic flux geometrical pattern
responsible for creating the classical macroscopic N-S field of the magnet.

can be distorted by small microlenses along the line of sight. Microlenses with

the lens plane, can introduce a time delay of a few millisecond. Such time
delay would result in distinctive interference patterns in the gravitational
wave that can be measured with current experiments such as LIGO/Virgo. We
consider the particular case of primordial black holes with masses between 5
and 50 solar masses acting as microlenses. We study the effect of a population
of primordial black holes constituting a fraction of the dark matter, and
contained in a macrolens (galaxy or cluster), over gravitational waves that are
being lensed by the combined effect of the macrolens plus microlenses. We find
that at the typical magnifications expected for observed GW events, the
fraction of dark matter in the form of compact microlenses, such as primordial
black holes, can be constrained to percent level. Similarly, if a small
percentage of the dark matter is in the form of microlenses with a few tens of
solar masses, at sufficiently large magnification factors, all gravitational
waves will show interference effects. These effects could have an impact on the
inferred parameters. The effect is more important for macroimages with negative

axion and raise the cosmological bound on the axion decay constant. The QCD
axion receives a contribution from small UV instantons during inflation, which
raises its mass to the inflationary Hubble scale. This makes the axion start
rolling down its potential early on. In the scenario, the standard model Yukawa
couplings of quarks are dynamical, being of order one during the inflationary
era and reducing to their standard model values once it ends. This means that
after inflation the contribution of the small instantons is suppressed, and the
axion potential reduces to the standard one from the usual IR instantons. As a
result, when the axion starts to oscillate again after inflation, the initial
misalignment angle is suppressed due to the dynamics during inflation. While
the general idea of dynamical axion misalignment has been discussed in the
literature before, we present in detail the major bottleneck on the mismatching
between the minima of the axion potentials during and after inflation, and how
it is circumvented in our scenario via the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Taking
into account of all the constraints, we find that the axion decay constant
could be raised to the GUT scale, $10^{15}$ GeV, in our scenario.

SCFT placed on $S^3\times S^1$: by sending the radius of $S^1$ to zero, we

quotient $\mathcal{A}_H = {\rm Zhu}_{s}(V)/N$, where ${\rm Zhu}_{s}(V)$ is the
non-commutative Zhu algebra of the VOA $V$ (for ${s}\in{\rm Aut}(V)$), and $N$

therefore equips $\mathcal{A}_H$ with a non-degenerate (twisted) trace, leading
to a short star-product according to the recent results of Etingof and Stryker.
The map $T_{s}$ is easy to determine for unitary VOAs, but has a much subtler
structure for non-unitary and non-$C_2$-cofinite VOAs of our interest. We

dominated by the coherent motion of a dilute gas of monopoles. The hopping
amplitude of a monopole is sensitive to the configuration of its surrounding
spins, taken to be quasi-static on the relevant timescales. This leads to
well-known blocked directions in the monopole motion; we find that these are
sufficient to reduce the coherent propagation of monopoles to quantum
diffusion. This result is robust against disorder, as a direct consequence of
the ground-state degeneracy, which disrupts the quantum interference processes
needed for weak localization. Moreover, recent work [Tomasello et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 123, 067204 (2019)] has shown that the monopole hopping amplitudes
are roughly bimodal: for $\approx 1/3$ of the flippable spins surrounding a
monopole, these amplitudes are extremely small. We exploit this structure to
construct a theory of quantum monopole motion in spin ice. In the limit where
the slow hopping terms are set to zero, the monopole wavefunctions appear to be
fractal; we explain this observation via a mapping to quantum percolation on
trees. The fractal, non-ergodic nature of monopole wavefunctions manifests
itself in the low-frequency behavior of monopole spectral functions, and is
consistent with experimental observations.

enabled our study of K2-25b's transmission spectrum. We combined and fit each
dataset at a common wavelength within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework,
yielding consistent planet parameters. The resulting transit depths ruled out a
solar-composition atmosphere for K2-25b for the range of expected planetary
masses and equilibrium temperature at a $>4\sigma$ confidence level, and are
consistent with a flat transmission spectrum. Mass constraints and transit
observations at a finer grid of wavelengths (e.g., from the Hubble Space

of K2-25b's transit duration also enabled new constraints on the eccentricity
of K2-25's orbit. We find K2-25b's orbit to be eccentric ($e>0.20$) for all
reasonable stellar densities and independent of the observation wavelength or
instrument. The high eccentricity is suggestive of a complex dynamical history
and motivates future searches for additional planets or stellar companions.

known powerful cosmological probe, which relies on underlying modelling
assumptions on the mass-observable relations (MOR). Some of the MOR parameters
can be constrained directly from multi-wavelength observations, as the
normalization at some reference cosmology, the mass-slope, the redshift
evolution and the intrinsic scatter. However, the cosmology dependence of MORs
cannot be tested with multi-wavelength observations alone. We use {\tt
Magneticum} simulations to explore the cosmology dependence of galaxy cluster
scaling relations. We run fifteen hydro-dynamical cosmological simulations
varying $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h_0$ and $\sigma_8$ (around a reference
cosmological model). The MORs considered are gas mass, baryonic mass, gas
temperature, $Y$ and velocity dispersion as a function of virial mass. We
verify that the mass and redshift slopes and the intrinsic scatter of the MORs
are nearly independent of cosmology with variations significantly smaller than
current observational uncertainties. We show that the gas mass and baryonic
mass sensitively depends only on the baryon fraction, velocity dispersion and
gas temperature on $h_0$, and $Y$ on both baryon fraction and $h_0$. We
investigate the cosmological implications of our MOR parameterization on a mock
catalog created for an idealized eROSITA-like experiment. We show that our
parametrization introduces a strong degeneracy between the cosmological
parameters and the normalization of the MOR. Finally, the parameter constraints
derived at different overdensity ($\Delta_{500c}$), for X-ray bolometric gas
luminosity, and for different subgrid physics prescriptions are shown in the
appendix.

in extracting information from noisy data sets or performing forward prediction
in time for a dynamic system. The broad utilization of the associated
algorithms makes them attractive targets for similar problems in the quantum
domain. To date, however, the construction of adaptive filters for quantum
systems has typically been carried out in terms of stochastic differential
equations for weak, continuous quantum measurements, as used in linear quantum
systems such as optical cavities. Discretized measurement models are not as
easily treated in this framework, but are frequently employed in quantum
information systems leveraging projective measurements. This paper presents a
detailed analysis of several technical innovations that enable classical
filtering of discrete projective measurements, useful for adaptively learning
system-dynamics, noise properties, or hardware performance variations in
classically correlated measurement data from quantum devices. In previous work
we studied a specific case of this framework, in which noise and calibration
errors on qubit arrays could be efficiently characterized in space; here, we
present a generalized analysis of filtering in quantum systems and demonstrate
that the traditional convergence properties of nonlinear classical filtering
hold using single-shot projective measurements. These results are important
early demonstrations indicating that a range of concepts and techniques from
classical nonlinear filtering theory may be applied to the characterization of
quantum systems involving discretized projective measurements, paving the way
for broader adoption of control theoretic techniques in quantum technology.

detailed treatment of the physics of the cold molecular ISM, and an analytical
galactic gravitational potential for computational efficiency. The simulations
have nested levels of resolution, with the lowest layer tied to tracer
particles injected into individual cloud complexes. These tracer refinement
regions are embedded in the larger simulation so continue to experience forces
from outside the cloud. This allows the simulations to act as a laboratory for
testing the effect of galactic environment on star formation. Here we introduce
our method and investigate the effect of galactic environment on filamentary
clouds. We find that cloud complexes formed after a clustered burst of
feedback, have shorter lengths and are less likely to fragment compared to
quiescent clouds (e.g. the Musca filament) or those dominated by the galactic
potential (e.g. Nessie). Spiral arms and differential rotation preferentially
align filaments, but strong feedback randomises them. Long filaments formed
within the cloud complexes are necessarily coherent with low internal velocity
gradients, which has implications for the formation of filamentary
star-clusters. Cloud complexes formed in regions dominated by supernova
feedback have fewer star-forming cores, and these are more widely distributed.
These differences show galactic-scale forces can have a significant impact on
star formation within molecular clouds.

significant computational cost of evaluating the bispectrum signal and the

proposed in the literature, which partially or fully capture the information in
the bispectrum, while being computationally less expensive than the bispectrum.
One such statistics are {\it weighted skew-spectra}, which are cross-spectra of
the density field and appropriately weighted quadratic fields. Using Fisher
forecasts, we show that the information in these skew-spectra is equivalent to
that in the bispectrum for parameters that appear as amplitudes in the

radiation from ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks generated as flare ejecta
from a central engine collide with an effectively stationary external medium.
Downward drifting of the burst frequency structure naturally arises from
deceleration of the blast-wave. The data are consistent with FRBs being
produced by flares of energy $E_{\rm flare} \sim
10^{43}-10^{46}(f_{\xi}/10^{-3})^{-4/5}$ erg, where $f_{\xi}$ is the maser
efficiency, and minimum bulk Lorentz factors $\Gamma \approx 10^2-10^3$, which
generate the observed FRBs at shock radii $r_{\rm sh} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ cm.
We infer upstream densities $n_{\rm ext}(r_{\rm sh}) \sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$
cm$^{-3}$ and radial profiles $n_{\rm ext} \propto r^{-k}$ showing a range of
slopes $k \approx [-2,1]$ (which are seen to evolve between bursts), broadly
consistent with the upstream medium being the inner edge of an ion-loaded shell
released by a recent energetic flare. The burst timescales, energetics, rates,
and external medium properties are consistent with repeating FRBs arising from
young, hyper-active flaring magnetars, but the methodology presented is
generally applicable to any central engine which injects energy impulsively
into a dense magnetized medium. Uncertainties and variations of the model are
discussed, including the effects of the strong electric field of the FRB wave

techniques can help improve the security of the IIoT systems as well. In this
paper, we first present common IIoT protocols and their associated
vulnerabilities. Then, we run a cyber-vulnerability assessment and discuss the
utilization of machine learning in countering these susceptibilities. Following
that, a literature review of the available intrusion detection solutions using
machine learning models is presented. Finally, we discuss our case study, which
includes details of a real-world testbed that we have built to conduct
cyber-attacks and to design an intrusion detection system (IDS). We deploy
backdoor, command injection, and Structured Query Language (SQL) injection
attacks against the system and demonstrate how a machine learning based anomaly
detection system can perform well in detecting these attacks. We have evaluated
the performance through representative metrics to have a fair point of view on
the effectiveness of the methods.

These nonconvex regularizers are sharper than the nuclear norm; indeed, we show
they are related to Schatten-$p$ norms with arbitrarily small $0 < p \leq 1$.
Moreover, these factor group-sparse regularizers can be written in a factored
form that enables efficient and effective nonconvex optimization; notably, the
method does not use singular value decomposition. We provide generalization
error bounds for low-rank matrix completion which show improved upper bounds
for Schatten-$p$ norm reglarization as $p$ decreases. Compared to the max norm

Automatic Passenger Count (APC) technologies by transit agencies, a massive
amount of time-stamped and location-based passenger boarding and alighting
count data can be collected on a continuous basis. The availability of such
large-scale transit data offers new opportunities to produce estimates for
Origin-Destination (O-D) flows, helping inform transportation planning and
transit management. However, the state-of-the-art methodologies for AVL/APC
data analysis mostly tackle the O-D flow estimation problem within routes and
barely infer the transfer activities across the entire transit network. This
paper proposes three optimization models to identify transfers and approximate
network-level O-D flows by minimizing the deviations between estimated and
observed proportions or counts of transferring passengers: A Quadratic Integer
Program (QIP), a feasible rounding procedure for the Quadratic Convex
Programming (QCP) relaxation of the QIP, and an Integer Program (IP). The
inputs of the models are readily available by applying the various route-level
flow estimation algorithms to the automatically collected AVL/APC data and the
output of the models is a network O-D estimation at varying geographical
resolutions. The optimization models were evaluated on a case study for Ann
Arbor-Ypsilanti area in Michigan. The IP model outperforms the QCP approach in
terms of accuracy and remains tractable from an efficiency standpoint, contrary
to the QIP. Its estimated O-D matrix achieves an R-Squared metric of 95.57% at
the Traffic Analysis Zone level and 92.39% at the stop level, compared to the
ground-truth estimates inferred from the state-of-practice trip-chaining

biasing of a learner's hypothesis space so that it is small enough to ensure
good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it
contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism
for {\em automatically} learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is
introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate {\em internal
representation} for a learning environment and then using that representation
to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn
from the same environment.
  An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from {\em many similar
tasks}, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is
proved that the number of examples $m$ {\em per task} required to ensure good
generalisation from a representation learner obeys $m = O(a+b/n)$ where $n$ is
the number of tasks being learnt and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks
are learnt independently ({\em i.e.} without a common representation) then
$m=O(a+b)$. It is argued that for learning environments such as speech and
character recognition $b\gg a$ and hence representation learning in these
environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of
examples required per task. It is also proved that if $n = O(b)$ (with
$m=O(a+b/n)$) then the representation learnt will be good for learning novel
tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to
generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to $O(a)$ (as opposed to
$O(a+b)$ if no representation is used).
  It is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network
representations and experiment results are reported providing strong
qualitative support for the theoretical results.

its layers $i$, $i=1,2, \ldots M$, consists of a regular cycle graph where any
node has $2J_i$ neighbors. In a process that does not affect the cyclic
topology, it is assumed that, before the multiplex is assembled, the nodes are
labeled differently in each individual layer. As the setup requires that all
representations of the same node in the different $M$ layers must be linked by
inter-layers connections, the resulting multiplex pattern can be highly
complex. This can be better visualized if one assumes that in one layer the
nodes are labeled in the sequentially ascending order and that the nodes with
the same label are drawn on the top of the other, so that all inter-layer
connections are represented by vertical lines. In such cases, the other $M-1$
layers are characterized by long distance shortcuts. As a consequence, in spite
of sharing the same internal topological structure, the multiplex ends up with
very dissimilar layers. For prime number of nodes, a regular star geometry
arises by requiring that the neighbor labels of the $M-1$ layers differ by a
constant value $p_i>1$. For $M=2$, we use analytical and numerical approaches
to provide a thorough characterization of the multiplex topological properties,
of the inter layer dissimilarity, and of the diffusive dynamical processes
taking place on them. For the sake of definitiveness, it is considered that
each node in the sequentially labeled layer is characterized by $J_1\geq1$. In
the other layer, we fix $J_2\equiv1$, while $p>1$ becomes a proxy of layer
dissimilarity.

neutron star (NS) accretor. In NS LMXBs with non-degenerate donors, the mass
transfer is mainly driven by magnetic braking. The discrepancies between the
observed mass transfer (MT) rates and the theoretical models were known for a
while. Theory predictions of the MT rates are too weak and differ by an order
of magnitude or more. Recently, we showed that with the standard magnetic
braking, it is not possible to find progenitor binary systems such that they
could reproduce -- at any time of their evolution -- most of the observed
persistent NS LMXBs. In this ${\it Letter}$ we present a modified magnetic
braking prescription, CARB (Convection And Rotation Boosted). CARB magnetic
braking combines two recent improvements in understanding stellar magnetic
fields and magnetized winds -- the dependence of the magnetic field strength on
the outer convective zone and the dependence of the Alfv\`en radius on the
donor's rotation. Using this new magnetic braking prescription, we can
reproduce the observed mass transfer rates at the detected mass ratio and
orbital period for all well-observed to-the-date Galactic persistent NS LMXBs.
For the systems where the effective temperature of the donor stars is known,
theory agrees with observations as well.

the first billion year of the universe has stimulated numerous ideas for the
prompt formation and rapid growth of BHs in the early universe. Here we review
ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first assembled, how they may
have subsequently grown as massive as $\approx$10^9 Msun, and how
multi-messenger observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly
scenarios. We conclude the following: (1) The ultra-rare $\approx$10^9 Msun
SMBHs represent only the tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely fill a continuum
from stellar-mass (approx. 10 Msun) to the super-massive ($\approx$10^9 Msun)
regime, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. (2)
Stellar-mass BHs were likely left behind by the first generation of stars at
redshifts as high as z=30, but their initial growth was typically stunted due
to the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. (3) Conditions in some
larger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and
growth of massive `seed' holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense
stellar clusters. (4) BH masses depend on the environment (such as the number
and properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic streaming
velocity), and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy.
(5) Distinguishing between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a
combination of observations by LISA (probing massive BH growth via mergers) and
by deep multi-wavelength electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas
accretion) is particularly promising.

underlying anisotropic Bianchi geometry that nevertheless expands isotropically
and can be mapped onto a reference FLRW model with the same expansion history.
In order to investigate the stability and naturalness of such models in a
dynamical systems context, we consider spatially homogeneous models that
contain a massless scalar field $\varphi$ and a non-tilted perfect fluid
obeying an equation of state $p=w\rho$. Remarkably, we find that matter
anisotropies and geometrical anisotropies tend to cancel out dynamically.
Hence, the expansion is asymptotically isotropic under rather general
conditions. Although extended FLRW models require a special matter sector with
anisotropies that are 'fine-tuned"" relative to geometrical anisotropies, our
analysis shows that such solutions are dynamically preferred attractors in
general relativity. Specifically, we prove that all locally rotationally
symmetric Bianchi type III universes with space-like $\nabla_\mu\varphi$ are
asymptotically shear-free, for all $w\in[-1,1]$. Moreover, all shear-free
equilibrium sets with anisotropic spatial curvature are proved to be stable
with respect to all homogeneous perturbations for $w\geq -1/3$.

twice the driving period, are localized, and can have exponentially long

translationally invariant systems, we show that disorder can be engineered to
stabilize the subharmonic response of Majorana modes. A viable observation of
this phenomenon can be achieved using modern multiqubit hardware, such as
superconducting circuits and cold atomic systems.

well-established technique for the characterization of special nuclear
materials (SNM). Delayed neutrons have isotope-characteristic spectral and
temporal signatures, which provide the basis for isotope identification.
However, in bulk materials that contain an appreciable fissile (e.g., $^{235}$U
or $^{233}$U) fraction, such as highly-enriched uranium (HEU), delayed neutrons
have a high probability of inducing additional fissions. As a result, the
overall delayed neutron signature consists of two distinct components: the
""primary"" delayed neutrons (emitted directly by fission fragments), and the
""secondary prompt"" fission neutrons produced in fission induced by primary
delayed neutrons. These prompt products differ from ""primary"" delayed neutrons
both in their energy spectra and in the presence of coincident radiation
released by the parent fission event. The presence and relative quantity of
prompt products from delayed fission depend on the cross-section of the
material in the energy range of delayed neutrons, which may differ
significantly between isotopes, thus providing an exploitable means for isotope
differentiation. In this work, we demonstrate two experimental approaches for
discriminating between $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U isotopes based on the
measurement of delayed neutron-induced fission products. First, HEU and
depleted uranium objects are differentiated through the detection of
high-energy prompt neutrons from delayed fission using both recoil-based
organic liquid scintillators and thermalization spectra from a custom-built
capture-gated composite detector. Secondly, coincident radiation measurements
are used as the basis for discrimination by comparing the overall rates and
time evolution of fission events when delayed neutrons are present.

(D$\sim$44 Mpc) 12$\mu$m-selected Seyfert 2 galaxy, enshrouded within
Compton-thick layers of obscuring gas. We find no evidence of variability
between the Chandra and NuSTAR observations (separated by 2 years), and between
the two NuSTAR observations (separated by 10 months). Using self-consistent
X-ray models, we rule out the scenario where the obscuring medium is nearly
spherical and uniform, contradicting the results implied by the $<$10 keV
Chandra spectrum. The line-of-sight column density, from intervening matter
between the source and observer that intercepts the intrinsic AGN X-ray
emission, is well within the Compton-thick regime, with a minimum column
density of $2\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The average global column density is
high ($> 3\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), with both Compton-thick and Compton-thin
solutions permitted depending on the X-ray spectral model. The spectral models
provide a range of intrinsic AGN continuum parameters and implied 2-10 keV
luminosities ($L_{\rm 2-10keV,intrinsic}$), where the higher end of $L_{\rm
2-10keV,intrinsic}$ is consistent with expectations from the 12$\mu$m

Compared with Compton-thick AGN previously observed by {\it NuSTAR}, NGC 4968
is among the most intrinsically X-ray luminous. However, despite its close
proximity and relatively high intrinsic X-ray luminosity, it is undetected by
the 105 month Swift-BAT survey, underscoring the importance of multi-wavelength
selection for obtaining the most complete census of the most hidden black

unresolved by previous authors. For instance, we provide the first complete and
justified list of identity bases for the varieties generated by a semigroup of
order up to~$4$, and the website contains the list of varieties generated by a
semigroup of order up to~$5$.
  The website also provides identity bases for several types of semigroups or
groups, such as bands, commutative groups, and metabelian groups. On the
inherently non-finitely based finite semigroups side, the website can decide if
a given finite semigroup possesses this property or not.
  We provide some other functionalities such as a tool that outputs the
multiplication table of a semigroup given by a $C$-presentation, where~$C$ is
any class of algebras defined by a set of first order formulas.

The classifier is obtained by running gradient descent (GD) on logistic loss.
For this model, we investigate the dependence of the classification error on
the overparameterization ratio $\kappa=p/n$. First, building on known
deterministic results on the implicit bias of GD, we uncover a phase-transition
phenomenon for the case of Gaussian features: the classification error of GD is
the same as that of the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution when
$\kappa<\kappa_\star$, and that of the max-margin (SVM) solution when
$\kappa>\kappa_\star$. Next, using the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT),
we sharply characterize the performance of both the ML and the SVM solutions.
Combining these results, we obtain curves that explicitly characterize the
classification error for varying values of $\kappa$. The numerical results
validate the theoretical predictions and unveil double-descent phenomena that
complement similar recent findings in linear regression settings as well as
empirical observations in more complex learning scenarios.

measurement offset between the two sets. We find that hot Jupiters
preferentially orbit metal rich stars. However, we find the correlation
consistent, though marginally weaker, for hot Jupiters
($\beta=0.71^{+0.56}_{-0.34}$) than it is for other longer period gas giant
planets from radial velocity surveys. This suggests that the population of hot
Jupiters probably formed in a similar process to other gas giant planets, and
differ only in their migration histories.

  2020;36(6):1418-1445","10.1002/num.22480",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a least-squares finite element method for scalar nonlinear
hyperbolic balance laws is proposed and studied. The approach is based on a
formulation that utilizes an appropriate Helmholtz decomposition of the flux
vector and is related to the standard notion of a weak solution. This
relationship, together with a corresponding connection to negative-norm
least-squares, is described in detail. As a consequence, an important numerical
conservation theorem is obtained, similar to the famous Lax-Wendroff theorem.
The numerical conservation properties of the method in this paper do not fall
precisely in the framework introduced by Lax and Wendroff, but they are similar
in spirit as they guarantee that when $L^2$ convergence holds, the resulting
approximations approach a weak solution to the hyperbolic problem. The
least-squares functional is continuous and coercive in an $H^{-1}$-type norm,
but not $L^2$-coercive. Nevertheless, the $L^2$ convergence properties of the
method are discussed. Convergence can be obtained either by an explicit
regularization of the functional, that provides control of the $L^2$ norm, or
by properly choosing the finite element spaces, providing implicit control of
the $L^2$ norm. Numerical results for the inviscid Burgers equation with
discontinuous source terms are shown, demonstrating the $L^2$ convergence of
the obtained approximations to the physically admissible solution. The
numerical method utilizes a least-squares functional, minimized on finite
element spaces, and a Gauss-Newton technique with nested iteration. We believe
that the linear systems encountered with this formulation are amenable to
multigrid techniques and combining the method with adaptive mesh refinement
would make this approach an efficient tool for solving balance laws (this is
the focus of a future study).

dark matter models. In Paper 1 of this series, we obtained high-resolution
integral field H$\alpha$ observations for 26 dwarf galaxies with
$M_*=10^{8.1}-10^{9.7}\textrm{M}_\odot$. We derived rotation curves from our
observations, which we use here to construct mass models. We model the total
mass distribution as the sum of a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark
matter halo and the stellar and gaseous components. Our analysis of the slope
of the dark matter density profile focuses on the inner 300-800 pc, chosen
based on the resolution of our data and the region resolved by modern
hydrodynamical simulations. The inner slope measured using ionized and
molecular gas tracers is consistent, and it is additionally robust to the
choice of stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find a range of dark matter profiles,
including both cored and cuspy slopes, with an average of $\rho_{\rm DM}\sim
r^{-0.74\pm 0.07}$, shallower than the NFW profile, but steeper than those
typically observed for lower-mass galaxies with $M_*\sim
10^{7.5}\textrm{M}_\odot$. Simulations that reproduce the observed slopes in
those lower-mass galaxies also produce slopes that are too shallow for galaxies
in our mass range. We therefore conclude that supernova feedback models do not
yet provide a fully satisfactory explanation for the observed trend in dark
matter slopes.

tolerance when the erasure probability ($\epsilon$) is in the regime $\epsilon

These data were then analyzed using spectrograms. Both at the altitude of the

minutes before and after totality. This signal was coherent over a scale
greater than 10 cm and detected in four separate balloon photodiodes and 16
ground photodiodes. At higher frequencies, up to at least 30 Hz, brief chaotic
signals that were disorganized as a function of time were detected on the
ground, but not at the altitude of the balloon and appeared mostly uncorrelated
over a length scale of 10 cm. Some of our ground arrays utilized red and blue
filters, but neither the sustained 4.5 Hz signal nor the higher frequency
signals showed a strong dependence on filter color. On the ground we made a
video of the shadow bands on a scaled white screen. We judged that the bands
were roughly parallel to the orientation of the bright thin crescent Sun before
and after totality and inferred that their propagation velocity was about v ~
59 cm /s. Shadow band signals other than the sustained signal at ~ 4.5 Hz are
consistent with atmospheric scintillation theory.
  These results are surprising. Based on accounts in the literature we expected
to confirm the atmospheric scintillation theory of eclipse shadow bands, but
instead we detected a sustained ~ 4.5 Hz signal at both high altitude and on
the ground. This signal cannot be due to atmospheric scintillation and we ran a
check to make sure this signal is not an artifact of our electronics. We
recommend that additional searches for eclipse shadow bands be made at high

patient groups (e.g., heart failure group and diabetes group) and identifying
the temporal evolution of patients in those groups. Tensor factorization has
been an effective tool for phenotyping. Most of the existing works assume
either a static patient representation with aggregate data or only model
temporal data. However, real EHR data contain both temporal (e.g., longitudinal
clinical visits) and static information (e.g., patient demographics), which are
difficult to model simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Temporal And
Static TEnsor factorization (TASTE) that jointly models both static and
temporal information to extract phenotypes. TASTE combines the PARAFAC2 model
with non-negative matrix factorization to model a temporal and a static tensor.
To fit the proposed model, we transform the original problem into simpler ones
which are optimally solved in an alternating fashion. For each of the
sub-problems, our proposed mathematical reformulations lead to efficient
sub-problem solvers. Comprehensive experiments on large EHR data from a heart
failure (HF) study confirmed that TASTE is up to 14x faster than several
baselines and the resulting phenotypes were confirmed to be clinically
meaningful by a cardiologist. Using 80 phenotypes extracted by TASTE, a simple
logistic regression can achieve the same level of area under the curve (AUC)

evaluated through the execution of a computer program seen as a blackbox. It
can be noisy, in the sense that its outputs are contaminated by random errors.
Sometimes, the source of these errors is identified and controllable, in the
sense that it is possible to reduce the standard deviation of the stochastic
noise it generates. A common strategy to deal with such a situation is to
monotonically diminish this standard deviation, to asymptotically make it
converge to zero and ensure convergence of algorithms because the noise is
dismantled. This work presents MpMads, an algorithm which follows this
approach. However, in practice a reduction of the standard deviation increases
the computation time, and makes the optimization process long. Therefore, a
second algorithm called DpMads is introduced to explore another strategy, which
does not force the standard deviation to monotonically diminish. Although these
strategies are proved to be theoretically equivalents, tests on analytical
problems and an industrial blackbox are presented to illustrate practical
differences.

walks (ISAWs) on the honeycomb lattice and on the square lattice. This is the
first such investigation of ISAWs on the honeycomb lattice. We have generated
data for ISAWs up to 75 steps on this lattice, and 55 steps on the square
lattice. For the hexagonal lattice we find the $\theta$-point to be at
$u_\mathrm{c} = 2.767 \pm 0.002.$ The honeycomb lattice is unique among the
regular two-dimensional lattices in that the exact growth constant is known for
non-interacting walks, and is $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$, while for half-plane walks
interacting with a surface, the critical fugacity, again for the honeycomb
lattice, is $1+\sqrt{2}$. We could not help but notice that $\sqrt{2+4\sqrt{2}}
= 2.767\ldots .$ We discuss the difficulties of trying to prove, or disprove,
this possibility.
  For square lattice ISAWs we find $u_\mathrm{c}=1.9474 \pm 0.001,$ which is
consistent with the best Monte Carlo analysis.
  We also study bridges and terminally-attached walks (TAWs) on the square
lattice at the $\theta$-point. We estimate the exponents to be $\gamma_b=0.00

coupling are some of the most important functional materials with applications
ranging from ultrasound imaging to actuators and sensors in
microelectromechanical devices. Since their discovery nearly 60 years ago, the
complexity of nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in these systems
has made understanding the origins of their unique electromechanical properties
a seemingly intractable problem. A full accounting of the mechanisms that
connect local structure and chemistry with nanoscale fluctuations in
polarization has, however, remained a need and a challenge. Here, we employ
aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to
quantify various types of nanoscale heterogeneity and their connection to local
polarization in the prototypical relaxor ferroelectric system
Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT). We identify three main
contributions that each depend on Ti content: chemical order, oxygen octahedral
tilt, and oxygen octahedral distortion. These heterogeneities are found to be
spatially correlated with low angle polar domain walls, indicating their role
in disrupting long-range polarization. Specifically, these heterogeneities lead
to nanoscale domain formation and the relaxor response. We further locate
nanoscale regions of monoclinic distortion that correlate directly with Ti
content and the electromechanical performance. Through this approach, the
elusive connection between chemical heterogeneity, structural heterogeneity and
local polarization is revealed, and the results validate models needed to
develop the next generation of relaxor ferroelectric materials.

First, we provide a rigorous problem formulation for optimal real-time

that, in the case of a homogeneous network (where all sensors have the same

influences from the extratropics plausibly constrain the subtropical-mean
static stability in terrestrial atmospheres. Because mean descent acting on
this static stability is a leading-order term in the thermodynamic balance, a
state-invariant static stability would impose constraints on the Hadley cells,
which this paper explores in simulations of varying planetary rotation rate. If
downdraft-averaged effective heating (the sum of diabatic heating and eddy heat
flux convergence) too is invariant, so must be vertical velocity -- an ""omega
governor."" In that case, the Hadley circulation overturning strength and
downdraft width must scale identically -- the cell can strengthen only by
widening or weaken only by narrowing. Simulations in two idealized, dry GCMs
with a wide range of planetary rotation rates exhibit nearly unchanging
downdraft-averaged static stability, effective heating, and vertical velocity,
as well as nearly identical scalings of the Hadley cell downdraft width and
strength. In one, eddy stresses set this scaling directly (the Rossby number
remains small); in the other, eddy stress and bulk Rossby number changes
compensate to yield the same, ({\sim}\Omega^{-1/3}) scaling. The consistency of
this power law for cell width and strength variations may indicate a common
driver, and we speculate that Ekman pumping could be the mechanism responsible
for this behavior. Extending to moist atmospheres, in an idealized aquaplanet
GCM the subtropical static stability is also insensitive to rotation rate but
the effective heating and vertical velocity are not.

remedied using polynomial covariances; however one loses control over the

serial clock high by a few volts, suggesting the existence of a small
structural trap at the parallel-serial interface. Tails above blooming stars
are suppressed using an inverted clocking during readout and a positive
clocking during exposure to maintain sharpness of the PTC. We show that
integrating under three parallel phases, instead of the two recommended,

temporal dependence characteristics of precipitation. When extreme
precipitation possesses strong spatial dependence, the risk of flooding is
amplified due to catchment factors that cause runoff accumulation such as
topography. Temporal dependence can also increase flood risk as storm water
drainage systems operating at capacity can be overwhelmed by heavy
precipitation occurring over multiple days. While transformed Gaussian
processes are common choices for modeling precipitation, their weak tail
dependence may lead to underestimation of flood risk. Extreme value models such
as the generalized Pareto processes for threshold exceedances and max-stable
models are attractive alternatives, but are difficult to fit when the number of
observation sites is large, and are of little use for modeling the bulk of the
distribution, which may also be of interest to water management planners. While
the atmospheric dynamics governing precipitation are complex and difficult to
fully incorporate into a parsimonious statistical model, non-mechanistic
analogue methods that approximate those dynamics have proven to be promising
approaches to capturing the temporal dependence of precipitation. In this
paper, we present a Bayesian analogue method that leverages large,
synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns to make precipitation forecasts. Changing
spatial dependence across varying intensities is modeled as a mixture of
spatial Student-t processes that can accommodate both strong and weak tail
dependence. The proposed model demonstrates improved performance at capturing
the distribution of extreme precipitation over Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)

two observing runs (O1 and O2). Analysis of these events found strong evidence
for a dearth of BBHs with component masses greater than $\sim45 \ M_\odot$, as
would be expected from a pair-instability mass gap. Meanwhile, a standalone
analysis of the merger GW170729 found its primary mass $m_1 =
{51.2^{+16.2}_{-11.0} \ M_\odot}$, with the majority of its posterior support
at $m_1 > 45 \ M_\odot$. Although this appears to be in contradiction with the
existence of a limit at $\sim45\ M_\odot$, we argue that individual events
cannot be evaluated without reference to the entire population. When GW170729
is analyzed jointly with the rest of the detections, as part of a full
hierarchical population analysis, its inferred primary mass tightens
considerably, to $m_1 = {38.9^{+7.3}_{-4.5} \ M_\odot}$. For a large sample of
events in the presence of noise, apparent outliers in the detected distribution
are inevitable, even if the underlying population forbids outliers. We discuss
methods of distinguishing between statistical fluctuations and population
outliers using posterior predictive tests. Applying these tests to the primary
mass distribution in O1 and O2, we find that the ten detections are consistent
with even the simplest power-law plus maximum-mass model considered by the LVC.
This supports the claim that GW170729 is not a population outlier. We also
provide non-parametric constraints on the rate of high-mass mergers and
conservatively bound the rate of mergers with $m_1 > 45 \ M_\odot$ at
$2.8^{+5.4}_{-2.0}\%$ of the total merger rate. After 100 detections like those
of O1 and O2 from a population with a maximum primary mass of $45 \, M_\odot$,
it would be common for the most massive system to have an observed
maximum-likelihood mass $m_1 \gtrsim 70 \, M_\odot$.

for static fields, can be made more useful by simplifying its geometry. Instead
of Feynman's disk with charged balls on its surface, use a hollow

calculated in closed form and shown to be equal. The methods used in the

  This simplified geometry also provides a test for the current idea that
electromagnetic field energy can be considered a form of inertial mass. The
mass motion in the simplified Feynman example can be modeled as the static,
circular, incompressible flow of a fluid, with distributed nonzero vorticity.
But such motion requires a centripetal force or pressure that has yet to be

discovered in August 2019 at $\sim3$ au from the Sun on its inbound leg. No
pre-discovery detection beyond 3 au has yet been reported, mostly due to the
comet's proximity to the Sun as seen from the Earth. Here we present a search
for pre-discovery detections of comet Borisov using images taken by the
Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), Pan-STARRS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with
a further comprehensive follow-up campaign being presented in
\citet{Bolin2019}. We identified comet Borisov in ZTF images taken in May 2019
and use these data to update its orbit. This allowed us to identify the comet
in images acquired as far back as December 2018, when it was 7.8 au from the
Sun. The comet was not detected in November 2018 when it was 8.6 au from the
Sun, possibly implying an onset of activity around this time. This suggests
that the activity of the comet is either driven by a more volatile species
other than H$_2$O, such as CO or CO$_2$, or by exothermic crystallization of
amorphous ice. We derive the radius of the nucleus to be $<7$ km using the
non-detection in November 2018, and estimate an area of $\sim0.5$---$10

this number is model-dependent and is highly uncertain. The behavior of comet
Borisov during its inbound leg is observationally consistent with dynamically
new comets observed in our solar system, suggesting some similarities between
the two.

covariance matrix, the FBS information covariance matrix and the time splitting
factor are jointly optimized aiming for perfect secrecy rate maximization. Upon
assuming the imperfect FBS-EVE CSI, the worst-case and outage-constrained SRM
problems corresponding to deterministic and statistical CSI errors are
investigated, respectively. Furthermore, considering the more realistic case of
unknown FBS-EVE CSI, the artificial noise (AN) aided secrecy beamforming design
is studied. Our analysis reveals that for all the above cases both the optimal
PB energy and FBS information secrecy beamformings are of rank-1. Moreover, for
all considered cases of FBS-EVE CSI, the closed-form PB energy beamforming
solutions are available when the cross-tier interference constraint is
inactive. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the secrecy performance
advantages of all proposed secrecy beamforming designs compared to the adopted

various weighted mean-square-error minimization (WMMSE) based hybrid
transceiver designs over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference
channels at both millimeter wave (mmWave) and microwave frequencies. Firstly, a
heuristic joint design of hybrid precoder and combiner using alternating
optimization is proposed, in which the majorization-minimization (MM) method is
utilized to design the analog precoder and combiner with unit-modulus
constraints. It is validated that this scheme achieves the comparable
performance to the WMMSE fully-digital solution. To further reduce the
complexity, a phase projection-based two-stage scheme is proposed to decouple
the designs of analog and digital precoder combiner. Secondly, inspired by the
fully-digital solutions based on the block-diagonalization zero-forcing (BD-ZF)
and signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) criteria, low-complexity MMbased
BD-ZF and SLNR hybrid designs are proposed to well approximate the

attributes affect the prediction is critical to users. However, most, if not
all, existing ordinal regression models simplify such explanation in the form
of constant coefficients for the main and interaction effects of individual
attributes. Such explanation cannot characterize the contributions of
attributes at different value scales. To address this challenge, we propose a
new explainable ordinal regression model, namely, the Explainable Ordinal
Factorization Model (XOFM). XOFM uses the piece-wise linear functions to
approximate the actual contributions of individual attributes and their
interactions. Moreover, XOFM introduces a novel ordinal transformation process
to assign each object the probabilities of belonging to multiple relevant
classes, instead of fixing boundaries to differentiate classes. XOFM is based
on the Factorization Machines to handle the potential sparsity problem as a
result of discretizing the attribute scales. Comprehensive experiments with

which each row, column and symbol is represented at most once. A partial
transversal is maximal if it is not contained in a larger partial transversal.
Any maximal partial transversal of a Latin square of order $n$ has size at
least $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ and at most $n$. We say that a Latin square is
omniversal if it possesses a maximal partial transversal of all feasible sizes
and is near-omniversal if it possesses a maximal partial transversal of all
feasible sizes except one.
  Evans showed that omniversal Latin squares of order $n$ exist for any odd $n
\neq 3$. By extending this result, we show that an omniversal Latin square of
order $n$ exists if and only if $n\notin\{3,4\}$ and $n \not\equiv 2 \mod 4$.
Furthermore, we show that near-omniversal Latin squares exist for all orders $n
\equiv 2 \mod 4$.
  Finally, we show that no non-trivial group has an omniversal Cayley table,
and only 15 groups have a near-omniversal Cayley table. In fact, as $n$ grows,
Cayley tables of groups of order $n$ miss a constant fraction of the feasible
sizes of maximal partial transversals. In the course of proving this, we are
led to consider the following interesting problem in combinatorial group
theory. Suppose that we have two subsets $R,C\subseteq G$ of a finite group $G$
such that $|\{rc:r\in R,c\in C\}|=m$. How large do $|R|$ and $|C|$ need to be
(in terms of $m$) to be certain that $R\subseteq xH$ and $C\subseteq Hy$ for
some subgroup $H$ of order $m$ in $G$, and $x,y\in G$.

adversarial examples-maliciously generated images which seem perceptually
similar to the natural ones but are actually formed to fool learning models,
which means the models have problem generalizing to unseen data with certain

DNNs comprehensively and attempt to improve it from a geometric point of view.
We propose adversarial margin maximization (AMM), a learning-based
regularization which exploits an adversarial perturbation as a proxy. It
encourages a large margin in the input space, just like the support vector

weight normalization family have drawn increasing attention in recent years.
These methods use standardization or normalization that changes the weight
$\boldsymbol{W}$ to $\boldsymbol{W}'$, which makes $\boldsymbol{W}'$
independent to the magnitude of $\boldsymbol{W}$. Surprisingly,
$\boldsymbol{W}$ must be decayed during gradient descent, otherwise we will
observe a severe under-fitting problem, which is very counter-intuitive since
weight decay is widely known to prevent deep networks from over-fitting. In
this paper, we \emph{theoretically} prove that the weight decay term
$\frac{1}{2}\lambda||{\boldsymbol{W}}||^2$ merely modulates the effective
learning rate for improving objective optimization, and has no influence on
generalization when the weight normalization family is compositely employed.
Furthermore, we also expose several critical problems when introducing weight
decay term to weight normalization family, including the missing of global
minimum and training instability. To address these problems, we propose an
$\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$ regularizer, which shifts the $L_2$ objective by a
positive constant $\epsilon$. Such a simple operation can theoretically
guarantee the existence of global minimum, while preventing the network weights
from being too small and thus avoiding gradient float overflow. It
significantly improves the training stability and can achieve slightly better
performance in our practice. The effectiveness of $\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$
regularizer is comprehensively validated on the ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and COCO

that practical blinding is achieved without significant perturbation of

Training DNNs is power-, time-, and memory- intensive; however, embedded

low operating power; however, due to its limited memory and different

Although many types of approximate inference schemes have been proposed for
hierarchical Bayesian models of the brain, the questions of how these distinct
inference procedures can be realized by hierarchical networks of spiking
neurons remains largely unresolved. Based on a previously proposed
multi-compartment neuron model in which dendrites perform logarithmic
compression, and stochastic spiking winner-take-all (WTA) circuits in which
firing probability of each neuron is normalized by activities of other neurons,
here we construct Spiking Neural Networks that perform \emph{structured}
mean-field variational inference and learning, on hierarchical directed
probabilistic graphical models with discrete random variables. In these models,
we do away with symmetric synaptic weights previously assumed for
\emph{unstructured} mean-field variational inference by learning both the
feedback and feedforward weights separately. The resulting online learning
rules take the form of an error-modulated local Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity rule. Importantly, we consider two types of WTA circuits in which
only one neuron is allowed to fire at a time (hard WTA) or neurons can fire
independently (soft WTA), which makes neurons in these circuits operate in
regimes of temporal and rate coding respectively. We show how the hard WTA
circuits can be used to perform Gibbs sampling whereas the soft WTA circuits
can be used to implement a message passing algorithm that computes the
marginals approximately. Notably, a simple change in the amount of lateral
inhibition realizes switching between the hard and soft WTA spiking regimes.
Hence the proposed network provides a unified view of the two previously
disparate modes of inference and coding by spiking neurons.

Freeman","Electron spin mediated distortion in metallic systems",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The deviation of positions of atoms from their ideal lattice sites in
crystalline solid state systems causes distortion and can lead to variation in
structural [1] and functional properties [2]. Distortion in molecular systems
has been traditionally understood in the term of Jahn-Teller distortion [3],
while for the one-dimensional chain of metals, the Peierls distortion mechanism
has been proposed [4]. In a real three dimensional metallic systems, a
fundamental description of the distortion is missing, which we need to design
alloys with attractive structural properties. The present investigation
presents the evolution of distortion in metallic systems in terms of
magnetovolume effects arising due to magnetic ground-state of the system.
Particularly the significant distortion in the case of Cr due to presence of
other transition metals is seen. Cr alloyed with transition metals as a
candidate system to study the correlation between charge disproportion,
spin-flip, magnetovolume effects and Fermi surface nesting. This study provides
a novel explanation of strengthening effect of Cr observed in alloys due to its
unique magnetic properties.

$V=\{1,\dotsc,n\}$. The classical distance $d_{ij}$ between any two vertices
$i$ and $j$ in $G$ is the minimum length of all the directed paths joining $i$
and $j$. The resistance distance (or, simply the resistance) between any two
vertices $i$ and $j$ in $V$ is defined by
$r_{ij}:=l_{ii}^{\dag}+l_{jj}^{\dag}-2l_{ij}^{\dag}$, where $l_{pq}^{\dagger}$
is the $(p,q)^{\rm th}$ entry of the Moore-Penrose inverse of $L$ which is the
Laplacian matrix of $G$. In practice, the resistance $r_{ij}$ is more
significant than the classical distance. One reason for this is, numerical
examples show that the resistance distance between $i$ and $j$ is always less
than or equal to the classical distance, i.e. $r_{ij} \leq d_{ij}$. However, no
proof for this inequality is known. In this paper, we show that this inequality
holds for all directed cactus graphs.

financial markets rendering them vulnerable to financial contagion. Research
has focused on network analysis techniques to understand the extent and nature
of such information flow. It is now an established fact that a stock market
crash in one country can have a serious impact on other markets across the
globe. It follows that such crashes or critical regimes will affect the network
dynamics of the global financial markets. In this paper, we use sequential
change point detection in dynamic networks to detect changes in the network
characteristics of thirteen stock markets across the globe. Our method helps us
to detect changes in network behavior across all known stock market crashes
during the period of study. In most of the cases, we can detect a change in the
network characteristics prior to crash. Our work thus opens the possibility of
using this technique to create a warning bell for critical regimes in financial
markets.

transactions has skyrocketed, causing an explosive increase of its data size.
As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap
as a full node, but rely on other full nodes such as the miners to run or
verify transactions. This may affect the security of ethereum, so light
bootstrapping techniques such as fast sync has been proposed to download only
parts of full data, yet the space overhead is still too high. One of the
biggest space overhead that cannot easily be reduced is caused by saving the
state of all accounts in the block's state trie. Fortunately, we found that
more than 90% of accounts are inactive and old transactions are hard to be
manipulated. Based on these observations, this paper propose a novel
optimization technique called ethanos that can reduce bootstrapping cost by
sweeping inactive accounts periodically and by not downloading old
transactions. If an inactive account becomes active, ethanos restore its state
by running a restoration transaction. Also, ethanos gives incentives for
archive nodes to maintain the old transactions for possible re-verification. We
implemented ethanos by instrumenting the go-ethereum (geth) client and
evaluated with the real 113 million transactions from 14 million accounts
between 7M-th and 8M-th blocks in ethereum. Our experimental result shows that
ethanos can reduce the size of the account state by half, which, if combined
with removing old transactions, may reduce the storage size for bootstrapping
to around 1GB. This would be reasonable enough for ordinary clients to
bootstrap on their personal devices.

  https://github.com/cszhangzhen/HGP-SL",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize deep neural networks to
graph-structured data, have drawn considerable attention and achieved
state-of-the-art performance in numerous graph related tasks. However, existing
GNN models mainly focus on designing graph convolution operations. The graph
pooling (or downsampling) operations, that play an important role in learning
hierarchical representations, are usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose
a novel graph pooling operator, called Hierarchical Graph Pooling with
Structure Learning (HGP-SL), which can be integrated into various graph neural
network architectures. HGP-SL incorporates graph pooling and structure learning
into a unified module to generate hierarchical representations of graphs. More
specifically, the graph pooling operation adaptively selects a subset of nodes
to form an induced subgraph for the subsequent layers. To preserve the
integrity of graph's topological information, we further introduce a structure
learning mechanism to learn a refined graph structure for the pooled graph at
each layer. By combining HGP-SL operator with graph neural networks, we perform
graph level representation learning with focus on graph classification task.
Experimental results on six widely used benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed model.

electron accelerators, especially where the beam emittance is of a great
concern in future ultra-low emittance light source. ""Conventionally"", the beam
instability due to beam-ion interaction is attributed to two types of effects:
ion trapping effect and fast ion effect, which emphasize the beam-ion dynamics
in different time scales. Whereas, in accelerators, the beam suffers from a
mixture of ion trapping effect and fast ion effect, leading to a more
complicated process and requiring a self-consistent treatment. To evaluate the
beam characteristics, as emittance growth under the influence from beam-ion
effect, a new numerical simulation code based on the ""quasi-strong-strong""
model has been developed, including modules of ionization, beam-ion
interaction, synchrotron radiation damping, quantum excitation, bunch-by-bunch
feedback, etc. In the study, we do not regularly distinguish the ion trapping
effect and the fast ion effect, but treat beam-ion interaction more generally
and consistently. The lattice of High Energy Photon Source, a diffraction limit
ring under construction in Beijing, is used as an example to show the beam-ion
effect. It is found that in this low emittance ring, the beam-ion instability
is not a dominant mechanism in operation mode with a high beam current, but
seriously occurs in a lower beam current region. When the beam-ion instability
were significantly driven and can not be damped by the synchrotron radiation
damping, the simulations show the bunch-by-bunch feedback system based on the
Finite Impulse Response filter technique can be adopted to mitigate it
effectively.

are used to send data of $K$ users to a two-way relay, $R$, whereas FSO link is
mainly used to exchange data between a base station $S$ and $R$. We propose to
have a backup RF link between the relay $R$ and the node $S$ to improve
reliability under certain conditions. All uplink RF channels follow Rayleigh
fading model while $\alpha$-$\mu$ is adopted to model both backup RF and FSO
links. We approximate the widely used Gamma-Gamma fading model using the
$\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution based on moments-based estimator technique assuming
perfect alignment between transmitter and receiver antennas. This approximation
shows good agreement under certain atmospheric turbulence conditions. Then, we
derive exact closed-form expressions for the outage and average symbol error
probabilities and derive approximations at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We
corroborate our analytical expressions with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations
and demonstrate exact match. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of number of
nodes, opportunistic scheduling among $K$ nodes, and $\alpha$-$\mu$ parameters
on the overall performance of mixed RF/FSO and backup RF systems. Our numerical
results illustrate an achievable coding gain when increasing $K$; however,
performance degradation occurs as the relay applies selection that favors the

processes occur both coherently and incoherently, was theoretically and
experimentally investigated in driven open quantum spin systems. In the
semi-classical approach, the quantum coherence effect was regarded as a process
in which two consecutive atoms are involved in the excitation of a neighboring
atom from the inactive (ground) state to the active state (excited $s$ state).
In this case, both second-order and first-order transitions occur. Therefore, a
tricritical point exists at which the transition belongs to the tricritical
directed percolation (TDP) class. On the other hand, when an atom is excited to
the $d$ state, long-range interaction is induced. Here, to account for this
long-range interaction, we extend the TDP model to one with long-range
interaction in the form of $\sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ (denoted as LTDP), where $r$

parameter. In particular, we investigate the properties of the LTDP class below

engineering due to the rigid trade-off between absorption and ventilation
performances. Although ongoing advances in acoustic metamaterials have unlocked
unprecedented possibilities and various metamaterial absorbers have been
proposed, most of them only work adequately in the condition of no sound
transmissions. Unfortunately, such condition requires a complete block of fluid
channels due to longitudinal nature of sounds, which allows them to penetrate
any small holes. Otherwise, their absorption performance could be drastically
degraded and often cannot exceed 50%. This basic trade-off between absorption
and ventilation performances definitely constrains their applications in daily
scenarios where free air flows are necessary. Though some ventilated sound
barriers with large transmission loss have been demonstrated, they essentially
only reflect sounds, which are still there and even may be reflected back.
Here, to overcome this general difficulty, we propose and demonstrate an
ultra-open ventilated metamaterial absorber. The absorber, aiming at
low-frequency sounds, simultaneously ensures high-performance absorption and
ventilation, confirmed in experiments. Their mechanism is understood from an
effective model of coupled lossy oscillators. Furthermore, the absorbers can be
simply stacked to work in a customized broadband, while maintaining a good

corresponding to images and text. The main challenge lies in mapping images and
text to a shared latent space where the embeddings corresponding to a similar
semantic concept lie closer to each other than the embeddings corresponding to
different semantic concepts, irrespective of the modality. Ranking losses are
commonly used to create such shared latent space -- however, they do not impose
any constraints on inter-class relationships resulting in neighboring clusters
to be completely unrelated. The works in the domain of visual semantic
embeddings address this problem by first constructing a semantic embedding
space based on some external knowledge and projecting image embeddings onto
this fixed semantic embedding space. These works are confined only to image
domain and constraining the embeddings to a fixed space adds additional burden
on learning. This paper proposes a novel method, HUSE, to learn cross-modal
representation with semantic information. HUSE learns a shared latent space
where the distance between any two universal embeddings is similar to the
distance between their corresponding class embeddings in the semantic embedding
space. HUSE also uses a classification objective with a shared classification
layer to make sure that the image and text embeddings are in the same shared
latent space. Experiments on UPMC Food-101 show our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art on retrieval, hierarchical precision and classification

assists each agent to locally track the global dual variable more accurately.
This new scheme in conjunction with smoothness of the objective ensures that
the accumulation of consensus error over time caused by incomplete global

simultaneously certify any pure entangled state and Bell state measurement

interpret the dual form of this game as a source-independent
bounded-dimensional entanglement swapping protocol and show the whole process,

shortest-path distances in an input graph. The notion of approximation can be
additive, multiplicative, or both, and many variants of this problem have been
extensively studied. We study the problem of computing a graph spanner when the
edges of the input graph are distributed across two or more sites in an
arbitrary, possibly worst-case partition, and the goal is for the sites to
minimize the communication used to output a spanner. We assume the
message-passing model of communication, for which there is a point-to-point
link between all pairs of sites as well as a coordinator who is responsible for
producing the output. We stress that the subset of edges that each site has is
not related to the network topology, which is fixed to be point-to-point. While
this model has been extensively studied for related problems such as graph
connectivity, it has not been systematically studied for graph spanners. We
present the first tradeoffs for total communication versus the quality of the
spanners computed, for two or more sites, as well as for additive and
multiplicative notions of distortion. We show separations in the communication
complexity when edges are allowed to occur on multiple sites, versus when each
edge occurs on at most one site. We obtain nearly tight bounds (up to polylog
factors) for the communication of additive $2$-spanners in both the with and
without duplication models, multiplicative $(2k-1)$-spanners in the with
duplication model, and multiplicative $3$ and $5$-spanners in the without

mechanical and transport properties of materials. In ordinary liquids, a
nonzero value of ${\tilde C}_{\rm T}(k,0)$ is inevitably associated with
viscous material flows. Curiously, even in solids where significant material
flows are precluded due to frozen positional degrees of freedom, molecular
dynamics simulations reveal that ${\tilde C}_{\rm T}(k,0)$ certainly takes a
nonzero value, and in consequence, the time integration of the velocity field
shows definite diffusive behavior with diffusivity ${\tilde C}_{\rm T}(k,0)/3$.
We demonstrate that this diffusive behavior can be attributed to a
solid-specific viscous transport. The resultant viscosity is interpreted as the
renormalized viscosity accounting for the nonlinear inertia effect.

partons at high energies. Comparing jet production in pp and nucleus-nucleus
collisions will allow us to study the jet-quenching effect caused by the hot
and dense QCD medium produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions when energetic
partons traverse the medium. In particular, systematic studies of jet
production in different multiplicity environments will provide in-depth
understanding of the medium properties and their evolution from small to large
systems. In small systems and high multiplicity events, the bulk properties
extracted by the low transverse momentum particle production behaves as if a
hot QCD medium was created, but such behaviour is not observed with hard
probes. Study of jet production in different multiplicity proton-proton
collisions then helps to explore the QGP existence in small systems.
  In this proceeding, the jet cross section measurements in different collision
systems using the data taken by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 are presented. The
nuclear modification factor of jets are presented to characterize the
jet-quenching effect. We observe that more jets are produced in high
multiplicity bins compared to the inclusive one, while the jet production
enhancement in high multiplicity environments has weaker jet $p_{\rm T}$ or
resolution parameter dependences. In order to study the jet collimation
properties, the jet cross section ratios for different jet resolution
parameters are also measured and compared to theoretical models. As expected,
the jets get more collimated at high $p_{\rm T}$ in numerous multiplicity bins,
with no collision energy or multiplicity dependence when compared to earlier
results.

model format for ray tracing has been that the octree data structure is
inherently static. Due to traversal algorithms' dependence on the strict
hierarchical structure of octrees, it has been challenging to achieve real-time
performance of SVO model animation in ray tracing since the octree data
structure would typically have to be regenerated every frame. Presented in this
article is a novel method for animation of models specified on the SVO format.
The method distinguishes itself by permitting model transformations such as
rotation, translation, and anisotropic scaling, while preserving the
hierarchical structure of SVO models so that they may be efficiently traversed.
Due to its modest memory footprint and straightforward arithmetic operations,
the method is well-suited for implementation in hardware. A software ray
tracing implementation of animated SVO models demonstrates real-time

theoretical physics since Hawking's discovery. The emergence of a temperature
in spacetimes with an event horizon has unveiled the existence of a fertile
territory, where gravity, thermal and quantum effects are non-trivially
connected. Although black holes are the best arena to explore this interplay,
evidences for their existence are lacking, suggesting to address less exotic
contexts. In this sense, a promising stage is the QFT in curved space:
specifically, the Unruh effect (UE) provides the first step toward unifying the
quantum and gravity worlds via the EP. Waiting for a successful theory of
quantum gravity, a careful investigation of UE, and, in particular, of any
deviations of Unruh spectrum from its thermal behavior, may thus offer a window
to new physics in the limbo between GR and QFT. Here we study the connection
between geometric features of spacetime and ensuing thermal quantum phenomena
from a non-traditional perspective, based on the analysis of perturbative
effects that affect the standard scenarios. As a test bench, we consider the
UE. After a discussion on the origin of UE, we examine to what extent its
distinctive profile is spoilt i) for mixed neutrinos; ii) in presence of a
minimal length arising from gravity at Planck scale. On one side, we show that
the UE loses its thermality. Implications of this are analyzed in the context
of the inverse beta-decay, also in view of the debate on a possible violation
of the General Covariance of QFT. On the other, we focus on the effects induced
by deformations of HUP, exploring the possibility to constrain the
GUP-parameter via UE. The question is addressed of whether these unrelated
frameworks have common roots. Along this line, we provide a unifying
perspective of these effects, which still relies on a geometric interpretation
of their origin.

sizes of the BD population are inferred from continuum flux and modeling of the
observations. Only one source is marginally resolved, allowing for the
determination of its disk characteristic size. We conduct a demographic
comparison between the properties of disks around BDs and stars in Lupus. Due
to the small sample size, we cannot confirm or disprove if the disk mass over
stellar mass ratio drops for BDs, as suggested for Ophiuchus. Nevertheless, we
find that all detected BD disks have an estimated dust mass between 0.2 and 3.2
$M_{\bigoplus}$; these results suggest that the measured solid masses in BD
disks can not explain the observed exoplanet population, analogous to earlier
findings on disks around more massive stars. Combined with the low estimated
accretion rates, and assuming that the mm-continuum emission is a reliable
proxy for the total disk mass, we derive ratios of $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}} /
M_{\mathrm{disk}}$ significantly lower than in disks around more massive stars.
If confirmed with more accurate measurements of disk gas masses, this result
could imply a qualitatively different relationship between disk masses and

projectivity of scattering forms and existence of kinematic space associahedron

In order to deal efficiently with the complicated constraints we consider a
dual formulation of this problem. We prove that the corresponding dual function
satisfies a quadratic growth property on any sublevel set, provided that the
objective function is smooth and strongly convex and the sets verify the
Slater's condition. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first

more conservative assumptions, e.g., the sets need to be either polyhedral or

composite structure, we propose random (accelerated) coordinate descent
algorithms. However, with the existing theory one can prove that such methods
converge only sublinearly. Based on our new quadratic growth property derived
for the dual, we now show that such methods have faster convergence, that is
the dual random (accelerated) coordinate descent algorithms converge linearly.
Besides providing a general dual framework for the analysis of randomized
coordinate descent schemes, our results resolve an open problem in the
literature related to the convergence of Dykstra algorithm on the best
feasibility problem for a collection of convex sets. That is, we establish
linear convergence rate for the randomized Dykstra algorithm when the convex
sets satisfy the Slater's condition and derive also a new accelerated variant
for the Dykstra algorithm.

recent years, with the identification of periodic patterns being one important
aspect. Many of the methods for identifying periodic patterns require time
series' season length as input parameter. There exist only a few algorithms for
automatic season length approximation. Many of these rely on simplifications
such as data discretization and user defined parameters. This paper presents an
algorithm for season length detection that is designed to be sufficiently
reliable to be used in practical applications and does not require any input
other than the time series to be analyzed. The algorithm estimates a time
series' season length by interpolating, filtering and detrending the data. This
is followed by analyzing the distances between zeros in the directly
corresponding autocorrelation function. Our algorithm was tested against a
comparable algorithm and outperformed it by passing 122 out of 165 tests, while
the existing algorithm passed 83 tests. The robustness of our method can be
jointly attributed to both the algorithmic approach and also to design

integration of evolution equations set as Cauchy problems of ODEs or PDEs. The
systematic design of these methods mixes the Runge-Kutta collocation formalism
with collocation techniques, in such a way that the methods are linearly
implicit and have high order. The fact that these methods are implicit allows
to avoid CFL conditions when the large systems to integrate come from the space
discretization of evolution PDEs. Moreover, these methods are expected to be
efficient since they only require to solve one linear system of equations at
each time step, and efficient techniques from the literature can be used to do
so. After the introduction of the methods, we set suitable definitions of
consistency and stability for these methods. This allows for a proof that
arbitrarily high order linearly implicit methods exist and converge when
applied to ODEs. Eventually, we perform numerical experiments on ODEs and PDEs
that illustrate our theoretical results for ODEs, and compare our methods with
standard methods for several evolution PDEs.

states underpin a plethora of prospects and applications for disorder-robust
routing of light. One of the cornerstone ideas to realize such states is to
exploit uniform bianisotropic response in periodic structures with appropriate
lattice symmetries, which together enable the topological bandgaps. Here, it is
demonstrated that staggered bianisotropic response gives rise to the
topological states even in a simple lattice geometry whose counterpart with
uniform bianisotropy is topologically trivial. The reason behind this
intriguing behavior is in the difference of the effective coupling between the
resonant elements with the same and with the opposite signs of bianisotropy.
Based on this insight, a one-dimensional equidistant array is designed, which
consists of high-index all-dielectric particles with alternating signs of
bianisotropic response. The array possesses chiral symmetry and hosts
topologically protected edge states pinned to the frequencies of hybrid
magneto-electric modes. These results pave a way towards flexible engineering
of topologically robust light localization and propagation by encoding
spatially varying bianisotropy patterns in photonic structures.

demonstrates novel universal scaling laws granted by a system-environment

includes the effects of the first-order post-Newtonian perturbation and
additionally provides a simple fit to account for the Newtonian self-consistent
evolution of the eccentricity. The revised time-scale is found by multiplying
Peters' estimate by two factors, $R(e_0)= 8^{1-\sqrt{1-e_0}}$ and $Q_{\rm
f}(p_0) = \exp \left(2.5 (r_{\rm S}/p_0) \right)$, where $e_0$ and $p_0$ are
the initial eccentricity and periapsis, respectively, and $r_{\rm S}$ the
Schwarzschild radius of the system. Their use can correct errors of a factor of
1-10 that arise from using the original Peters' formula. We apply the revised
time-scales to a set of typical sources for existing ground-based laser
interferometers and for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),
at the onset of their GW driven decay. We argue that our more accurate model
for the orbital evolution will affect current event- and detection-rate
estimates for mergers of compact object binaries, with stronger deviations for
eccentric LISA sources, such as extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals.
We propose the correction factors $R$ and $Q_{\rm f}$ as a simple prescription
to quantify decay time-scales more accurately in future population synthesis
models. We also suggest that the corrected time-scale may be used as a
computationally efficient alternative to numerical integration in other
applications that include the modelling of radiation reaction for eccentric

mathematical model and bifurcation analysis, we have determined the theoretical
conditions for stability of nine identified equilibria and provided biological
interpretation in terms of the infection rates for the viral specialist and
generalist strains. By means of a stability diagram we identified stable fixed
points and stable periodic orbits, as well as regions of bistability. For
arbitrary biologically feasible initial population sizes, the probability of
evolving towards stable solutions is obtained for each point of the analyzed
parameter space. This probability map shows combinations of infection rates of
the generalist and specialist strains that might lead to equal chances for each
type becoming the dominant strategy. Furthermore, we have identified infection
rates for which the model predicts the onset of chaotic dynamics. Several
degenerate Bogdanov-Takens and zero-Hopf bifurcations are detected along with
generalized Hopf and zero-Hopf bifurcations. This manuscript provides
additional insights into the dynamical complexity of host-pathogen evolution

that, in comparison to suspensions of free magnetic nanoparticles, where the
self-assembly is already observed if the interparticle interaction strength
exceeds the thermal fluctuations by approximately a factor of three,
self-assembly of magnetic nanogels only takes place by increasing such ratio
above six. This magnetic nanogel self-assembly is realised by means of
favourable close contacts between magnetic nanoparticles from different

corresponding to the formation of internal rings in isolated nanogels, in their
suspensions larger magnetic particle clusters with lower elastic penalty can be
formed by involving different nanogels. Finally, we show that when the

characterize electron precipitation from the radiation belts and to observe
energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating from the Sun during the strongest
solar flares. For that purpose, the 3-unit CubeSat carries a particle telescope
that measures energetic electrons in the nominal energy range of 80--800 keV in
seven energy channels and energetic protons at 0.3--10 MeV in ten channels. In
addition, particles penetrating the whole telescope at higher energies will be
measured in three channels: one $>$800 keV electron channel, two integral
proton channels at $>$10 MeV energies. The instrument contains two telescopes
at right angles to each other, one measuring along the spin axis of the
spacecraft and one perpendicular to it. During a spin period (nominally 15 s),
the rotating telescope will, thus, deliver angular distributions of protons and
electrons, at 11.25-degree clock-angle resolution, which enables one to
accurately determine the pitch-angle distribution and separate the trapped and
precipitating particles. During the last part of the mission, the rotation axis
will be accurately pointed toward the Sun, enabling the measurement of the
energetic hydrogen from that direction. Using the geomagnetic field as a filter

factors that play a role on the measurement of spatial squeezing with an
electron-multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera in the limit of
bright quantum states of light generated with a four-wave mixing process in an
atomic vapor cell. We detect a total number of photons per beam of the order
10$^8$ in 1 $\mu$s pulses, which corresponds to a photon flux per beam of the
order of 10$^{14}$ photons per second. We then investigate the role of
different parameters, such as cell temperature, pump power, laser detunings,
scattered pump background noise, and timing sequences for the image acquisition
with the EMCCD camera, on the level of spatial squeezing. We identify critical
parameters to obtain an optimum squeezing level and demonstrate that for bright

  The goal of this paper is to show that slice Fueter-regular functions are
standard (complex) slice functions, whose stem functions satisfy a Vekua system

Fueter-regular functions is able to reveal their `holomorphic nature': slice
Fueter-regular functions have Cauchy integral formulas, Taylor and Laurent

these properties is global in the sense that it is true on genuine
$8$-dimesional domains of $\mathbb{O}$. Slice Fueter-regular functions are real
analytic. Furthermore, we introduce the global concepts of spherical Dirac
operator $\Gamma$ and of slice Fueter operator $\bar{\vartheta}_F$ over

$\mathscr{C}^2$-functions in the kernel of $\bar{\vartheta}_F$ satisfying a

singularities and avoid other physical pathologies such as ghost and gradient
instabilities has turned out to be a rather difficult task. The concept of
limiting curvature, where one bounds a finite number of curvature-invariant
functions thanks to constraint equations, is a promising avenue in that
direction, but its implementation has only led to mixed results. Cuscuton
gravity, which can be defined as a special subclass of $k$-essence theory for
instance, is a minimal modification of gravity since it does not introduce any
new degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Importantly, it naturally
incorporates the idea of limiting curvature. Accordingly, models of cuscuton
gravity are shown to possess non-singular cosmological solutions and those
appear stable at first sight. Yet, various subtleties arise in the
perturbations such as apparent divergences, e.g., when the Hubble parameter
crosses zero. We revisit the cosmological perturbations in various gauges and
demonstrate that the stability results are robust even at those crossing
points, although certain gauges are better suited to analyze the perturbations.
In particular, the spatially-flat gauge is found to be ill defined when $H=0$.
Otherwise, the sound speed is confirmed to be generally close to unity in the
ultraviolet, and curvature perturbations are shown to remain essentially
constant in the infrared throughout a bounce phase. Perturbations for a model
of extended cuscuton (as a subclass of Horndeski theory) are also studied and
similar conclusions are recovered.

results in identification, retrieval and recognition. Existing methods often do
not consider different granularity in visual similarity. However, in many
domain applications, images exhibit similarity at multiple granularities with
visual semantic concepts, e.g. fashion demonstrates similarity ranging from
clothing of the exact same instance to similar looks/design or a common
category. Therefore, training image triplets/pairs used for metric learning
inherently possess different degree of information. However, the existing
methods often treats them with equal importance during training. This hinders
capturing the underlying granularities in feature similarity required for
effective visual search.
  In view of this, we propose a new deep semantic granularity metric learning
(SGML) that develops a novel idea of leveraging attribute semantic space to
capture different granularity of similarity, and then integrate this
information into deep metric learning. The proposed method simultaneously
learns image attributes and embeddings using multitask CNNs. The two tasks are
not only jointly optimized but are further linked by the semantic granularity
similarity mappings to leverage the correlations between the tasks. To this
end, we propose a new soft-binomial deviance loss that effectively integrates
the degree of information in training samples, which helps to capture visual
similarity at multiple granularities. Compared to recent ensemble-based
methods, our framework is conceptually elegant, computationally simple and
provides better performance. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark

is a combination of the higher-multipole non-precessing model {\tt PhenomHM}
and the spin-precessing model {\tt PhenomPv3} that includes two-spin precession
via a dynamical rotation of the GW multipoles. We validate the new model by
comparing to a large set of precessing numerical-relativity simulations and
find excellent agreement across the majority of the parameter space they cover.
For mass ratios $<5$ the mismatch improves, on average, from $\sim6\%$ to $\sim

understanding the dynamics of sheared granular fault systems. Here, a
two-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method
(FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element
method (DEM), is used to explicitly to simulate a sheared granular fault
system. We focus on investigating the influence of normal load, driving shear
velocity and plate stiffness on the velocities and displacements measured at
locations on the upper and lower plates just adjacent to the gouge in the
direction parallel to the shear direction (x direction). The simulations show
that at slips the plate velocities are proportional to the normal load and may
be inversely proportional to the square root of the plate's Young's modulus;
whereas the driving shear velocity does not show distinct influence on the
plate velocities. During stick phases, the velocities of the upper and lower
plates are respectively slightly greater and slightly smaller than the half of
the driving shear velocity, and are both in the same direction of shear. The
shear strain rate of the gouge is calculated from this velocity difference
between the upper and lower plate during stick phases and thus the gouge
effective shear modulus can be calculated. The results show that the gouge
effective shear modulus increases proportionally with normal load, while the
influence of shear velocity and plate stiffness on gouge effective shear
modulus is minor. The simulations address the dynamics of a laboratory scale
fault gouge system and may help reveal the complexities of earthquake
frictional dynamics.

direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulent flow between two
infinitely wide, two-dimensional sinusoidally wavy surfaces at a friction
Reynolds number, $Re_{\tau}=180$, with different mean surface slopes, $\zeta$
(and fixed inner-scaled undulation height, $a^+=13$) corresponding to the
`waviness' regime. The increase in wave slope enhances near surface turbulent
mixing resulting in increased total drag, higher fraction of form drag, faster
approach to isotropy and thereby, modulation of the buffer layer. The primary
near-surface streamwise and vertical turbulence generation occurs in the
leeward and windward side of the wave. In contrast, the spanwise variance is
produced through pressure-rate-of-strain mechanism, primarily, along the
windward side of the wave for flows with very little flow separation. We also
observe significant dispersion effects in the production structure.

checks and come under the umbrella of topological codes. While decoding
algorithms have been proposed for the 3D toric code on a cubic lattice, there
have been very few studies on the decoding of 3D toric codes over arbitrary
lattices. Color codes in 3D can be mapped to toric codes. However, the
resulting toric codes are not defined on cubic lattice. They are arbitrary
lattices with triangular faces. Decoding toric codes over an arbitrary lattice
will help in studying the performance of color codes. Furthermore, gauge color
codes can also be decoded via 3D toric codes. Motivated by this, we propose an
efficient algorithm to decode 3D toric codes on arbitrary lattices (with and

outlines the methodology for measuring the ionized gas kinematics, which we
will use in subsequent papers of this survey. We also show how the maps can be
used to study the kinematics of diffuse ionized gas for galaxies of various
inclinations and masses. Using two different methods to identify the diffuse
ionized gas, we measure rotation velocities of this gas for a subsample of 6
galaxies. We find that the diffuse ionized gas rotates on average slower than
the star forming gas with lags of 0-10 km/s while also having higher velocity
dispersion. The magnitude of these lags is on average 5 km/s lower than
observed velocity lags between ionized and molecular gas. Using Jeans models to
interpret the lags in rotation velocity and the increase in velocity dispersion
we show that most of the diffuse ionized gas kinematics are consistent with its
emission originating from a somewhat thicker layer than the star forming gas,
with a scale height that is lower than that of the stellar disk.

of computer vision algorithms to analyze the information captured from their
on-board camera. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to use
single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detection algorithms that
process the input image to detect various objects of interest. To keep the
computational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small
image sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is
further emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the
viewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore,
explores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects
of interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image
and processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an
attention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and
a memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not
processed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show
that by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve
the detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that

based on the PACF module, we propose a 3D multi-sensor multi-task network
called Pointcloud-Image RCNN(PI-RCNN as brief), which handles the image
segmentation and 3D object detection tasks. PI-RCNN employs a segmentation
sub-network to extract full-resolution semantic feature maps from images and
then fuses the multi-sensor features via powerful PACF module. Beneficial from
the effectiveness of the PACF module and the expressive semantic features from
the segmentation module, PI-RCNN can improve much in 3D object detection. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the PACF module and PI-RCNN on the KITTI 3D

high energy resolution by means of the (p,t) reaction using the Q3D
spectrograph facility at the Munich Tandem accelerator. The angular
distributions of tritons were measured for more than 200 excited states seen in
the triton spectra up to 4.3 MeV. A number of 36 excited 0+ states (five
tentative), have been assigned by comparison of experimental angular
distributions with the calculated ones using the CHUCK code. Assignments for
levels with higher spins are the following: 95 for 2+ states, 64 for 4+ states,
14 for 6+ states and about 20 for negative parity states. Sequences of states
which can be treated as rotational bands are selected. The analysis of the
moments of inertia defined for these bands is carried out. This high number of
excited states in a deformed nucleus, close to a complete level scheme,
constitutes a very good ground to check models of nuclear structure. The large
ensembles of states with the same spin-parity offer unique opportunities for
statistical analysis. Such an analysis for the 0+, 2+ and 4+ states sequences,
for all K-values and for well-determined projections K of the angular momentum
is performed. The obtained data may indicate on a K symmetry breaking.
Experimental data are compared with interacting boson model (IBM) calculations
using the spdf version of the model. The energies of the low-lying levels, the
transition probabilities in the first bands and the distribution in transfer
intensity of the 0+ states are calculated and compared with experiment.

behaviors of the individual building blocks. In this paper, we present a full
theoretical description of the collective resonance in superstructures. We use
the gold nanorods as individual building blocks and arrange them helically
along an axis in an end-to-end fashion. Numerical simulations on single-unit
cells reveal that the plasmonic coupling between the nanorods produces
hybridized resonances, whose intensity is strongly dependent on the excitation
light with left- or right-handed circular polarizations (LCP or RCP). A
node-mode criterion is proposed on the basis of the microscopic mechanism,
which successfully explains the difference between LCP and RCP. We further
demonstrate, by repeating the unit cell from 1 to infinity along the helical
axis, the multiple hybridized resonances gradually evolve and merge into a
single collective resonance, whose energy is also dependent on LCP and RCP. An
analytical description is provided for the collective resonance of the helical
superstructure on the basis of the coupled dipole approximation method. Our
theory shows that n collective resonance modes are present in the helical
superstructure with the unit cell consisting of $n$ nanorods. Strikingly, only
one resonance can be excited by the incident light with certain circular
polarization. We propose a universal selection rule for such selective
excitation of the collective resonances by analyzing the symmetry of the

impact flashes based on simultaneous observations in two wavelength bands are
used to estimate the distributions of the masses, sizes and frequency of the
impactors. These statistics can be used both in space engineering and science.
The photometric fluxes of the flashes are measured using aperture photometry
and their apparent magnitudes are calculated using standard stars. Assuming
that the flashes follow a black body law of irradiation, the temperatures can
be derived analytically, while the parameters of the projectiles are estimated
using fair assumptions on their velocity and luminous efficiency of the
impacts. 79 lunar impact flashes have been observed with the 1.2 m Kryoneri
telescope in Greece. The masses of the meteoroids range between 0.7 g and 8 kg
and their respective sizes between 1-20 cm depending on their assumed density,
impact velocity, and luminous efficiency. We find a strong correlation between
the observed magnitudes of the flashes and the masses of the meteoroids.
Moreover, an empirical relation between the emitted energies of each band has
been derived allowing the estimation of the physical parameters of the
meteoroids that produce low energy impact flashes. The NELIOTA project has so
far the highest detection rate and the faintest limiting magnitude for lunar
impacts compared to other ongoing programs. Based on the impact frequency
distribution on Moon, we estimate that sporadic meteoroids with typical masses
less than 100 g and sizes less than 5 cm enter the mesosphere of the Earth with
a rate ~108 meteoroids/hr and also impact Moon with a rate of ~8 meteoroids/hr.

observing the two-dimensional stellar kinematics allows us to uncover their
formation process. Slow rotators, which have stellar orbits dominated by random
motions, are thought to be the fossil relics of a sequence of multiple gas-poor
mergers, in an environment where the cold gas required to form new stars is
nearly absent. Indeed, observations of a handful of nearby galaxy clusters have
indicated that slow rotators are preferentially found in the gas-poor, dense
cores of clusters, which themselves must form by merging of smaller groups.
However, the generality of this result and connection between kinematics and
environment is currently unclear, as recent studies have suggested that, at
given stellar mass, the environment does not influence the formation of slow
rotators. Here we address this issue by combining a careful quality-assessed
sample selection with two-dimensional stellar kinematics from a large galaxy
survey and a novel photometric classification approach where kinematics are
unavailable. We obtain the first complete census of the location of massive
slow rotators in ten large clusters: in all cases, slow rotators are extremely
rare and generally trace the clusters density peaks. This result unambiguously
establishes that massive slow rotators are the relics of violent hierarchical
cluster formation.

related tasks is examined from a Bayesian perspective. The environment of
related tasks is shown to be naturally modelled by the concept of an {\em
objective} prior distribution. Sampling from the objective prior corresponds to
sampling different learning tasks from the environment. It is argued that for
many common machine learning problems, although we don't know the true
(objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible
priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these
circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by
sampling from the objective prior. Bounds are given on the amount of
information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with
several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge
of the true prior, and the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then
sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous.

paths (APSP) on a directed graph whose edge weights are all from $\{-1,0,1\}$.
In the (min,max)-product problem the input is two $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and
$B$, and the goal is to output the (min,max)-product of $A$ and $B$.
  This paper provides a new algorithm for the $\{-1,0,1\}$-APSP problem via a
simple reduction to the target-(min,max)-product problem where the input is
three $n\times n$ matrices $A,B$, and $T$, and the goal is to output a Boolean
$n\times n$ matrix $C$ such that the $(i,j)$ entry of $C$ is 1 if and only if
the $(i,j)$ entry of the (min,max)-product of $A$ and $B$ is exactly the
$(i,j)$ entry of the target matrix $T$. If (min,max)-product can be solved in
$T_{MM}(n) = \Omega(n^2)$ time then it is straightforward to solve
target-(min,max)-product in $O(T_{MM}(n))$ time. Thus, given the recent result
of Bringmann, K\""unnemann, and Wegrzycki [STOC 2019], the $\{-1,0,1\}$-APSP
problem can be solved in the same time needed for solving approximate APSP on
graphs with positive weights.
  Moreover, we design a simple algorithm for target-(min,max)-product when the
inputs are restricted to the family of inputs generated by our reduction. Using
fast rectangular matrix multiplication, the new algorithm is faster than the
current best known algorithm for (min,max)-product.

proposal, which mirrors the holographic bulk cutoff picture. We emphasize the
role of the massive gravity \stu fields which describe the diffeomorphism
between the two metrics. For a general field theory, the dynamics of the \stu
fields is non-trivial, however for a CFT it trivializes and becomes equivalent
to an additional pair of target space dimensions with associated curved target
space geometry and dynamical worldsheet metric. That is, the $T \bar T$
deformation of a CFT on curved spacetime is equivalent to a non-critical string
theory in Polyakov form, with a non-zero $B$-field. We give a direct proof of
the equivalence classically without relying on gauge fixing, and determine the
explicit form for the classical Hamiltonian of the $T\bar T$ deformation of an
arbitrary CFT on a curved spacetime. When the QFT action is a sum of a CFT plus
an operator of fixed scaling dimension, as for example in the sine-Gordon

the identity matrix, the all-one matrix; it is closed with respect to
\correction{matrix transposition}, Schur-Hadamard (entrywise) multiplication

  The suggested axiomatics (with some natural additional requirements) implies
an equivalent reformulation in terms of symmetric binary relations on a vertex
set of cardinality $n$. The appearing graph-theoretical structure is called a
Jordan scheme of order $n$ and rank $r$. A significant source of Jordan schemes
stems from the symmetrization of association schemes. Each such structure is
called a non-proper Jordan scheme. The question about the existence of proper
Jordan schemes was posed a few times by Peter J. Cameron.
  In the current text an affirmative answer to this question is given. The
first small examples presented here have orders $n=15,24,40$. Infinite classes
of proper Jordan schemes of rank 5 and larger are introduced. A prolific
construction for schemes of rank 5 and order $n=\binom{3^d+1}{2}$, $d\in

  The text is written in the style of an essay. The long exposition relies on
initial computer experiments, a large amount of diagrams, and finally is
supported by a number of patterns of general theoretical reasonings. The essay

supernova explosions and a high gas density suggests that cosmic rays can be
efficiently produced, and that most of them lose their energy before escaping
these regions, resulting in a large flux of secondary products, including
neutrinos. Although the flux inferred from an individual starburst region is
expected to be well below the sensitivity of current neutrino telescopes, such
sources may provide a substantial contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux
measured by IceCube. Here we compute the gamma-ray and neutrino flux due to
starburst galaxies based on a physical model of cosmic ray transport in a
starburst nucleus, and accounting for the redshift evolution of the number
density of starburst sources as inferred from recent measurements of the star
formation rate. The model accounts for gamma-ray absorption both inside the
sources and in the intergalactic medium. The latter process is responsible for
electromagnetic cascades, which also contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray
background at lower energies. The conditions for acceleration of cosmic ray
protons up to energies exceeding $ \sim 10 \, \rm PeV$ in starburst regions,
necessary for the production of PeV neutrinos, are investigated in a critical
way. We show that starburst nuclei can account for the diffuse neutrino flux
above $\sim 200 \, \rm TeV$, thereby producing $\lesssim 40 \%$ of the
extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. Below $\sim 200 \, \rm TeV$, the
flux from starburst appears to be somewhat lower than the observed one, where
both the Galactic contribution and the flux of atmospheric neutrinos may
account for the difference.

NLU, the power of unsupervised pre-training is only partially excavated when it

intractable to design a universal architecture for pre-training as in NLU

time-domain CNN models can classify Type-I signals with high accuracy but
reduced performance in Type-II signals because of their high signal feature

influence parameter reproduces the surface tension as predicted from DFT. All

the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China was used to train the nowcasting

highly-mismatched dilute carbide group-IV alloy Ge$_{1-x}$C$_{x}$. For ordered
alloy supercells, we demonstrate that C incorporation strongly perturbs the
conduction band (CB) structure by driving hybridisation of $A_{1}$-symmetric
linear combinations of Ge states lying close in energy to the CB edge. This
leads, in the ultra-dilute limit, to the alloy CB edge being formed primarily
of an $A_{1}$-symmetric linear combination of the L-point CB edge states of the
Ge host matrix semiconductor. Our calculations describe the emergence of a
""quasi-direct"" alloy band gap, which retains a significant admixture of
indirect Ge L-point CB edge character. We then analyse the evolution of the
electronic structure of realistic (large, disordered) Ge$_{1-x}$C$_{x}$ alloy
supercells for C compositions up to $x = 2$%. We show that short-range alloy
disorder introduces a distribution of localised states at energies below the Ge
CB edge, with these states acquiring minimal direct ($\Gamma$) character. Our
calculations demonstrate strong intrinsic inhomogeneous energy broadening of
the CB edge Bloch character, driven by hybridisation between Ge host matrix and
C-related localised states. The trends identified by our calculations are
markedly different to those expected based on a recently proposed
interpretation of the CB structure based on the band anti-crossing model. The
implications of our findings for device applications are discussed.

Former methods have proposed various ways of target state estimation, yet few

consideration. After a careful analysis, we propose a set of practical
guidelines of target state estimation for high-performance generic object
tracker design. Following these guidelines, we design our Fully Convolutional
Siamese tracker++ (SiamFC++) by introducing both classification and target
state estimation branch(G1), classification score without ambiguity(G2),
tracking without prior knowledge(G3), and estimation quality score(G4).
Extensive analysis and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, our SiamFC++ tracker achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks(OTB2015, VOT2018,
LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet), which proves both the tracking and generalization
ability of the tracker. Particularly, on the large-scale TrackingNet dataset,
SiamFC++ achieves a previously unseen AUC score of 75.4 while running at over
90 FPS, which is far above the real-time requirement. Code and models are

measurements are correlated and censored. The case of interval censoring, i.e.,
the case of measurements which belong to some interval with given censoring
limits, is considered. Two improvements of the standard TKF process are
proposed, in order to estimate the hidden state vectors. Firstly, the exact
covariance matrix of the censored measurements is calculated by taking into
account the censoring limits. Secondly, the probability of a latent (normally
distributed) measurement to belong in or out of the uncensored region is
calculated by taking into account the Kalman residual. The designed algorithm
is tested using both synthetic and real data sets. The real data set includes
human skeleton joints' coordinates captured by the Microsoft Kinect II sensor.
In order to cope with certain real-life situations that cause problems in human
skeleton tracking, such as (self)-occlusions, closely interacting persons etc.,
adaptive censoring limits are used in the proposed TKF process. Experiments
show that the proposed method outperforms other filtering processes in
minimizing the overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for synthetic and real

a manipulator exploits a social network to make her most preferred candidate
win an election. Influence is due to information in favor of and/or against one

according to the independent cascade model. We provide a comprehensive study of
the election control problem, investigating two forms of manipulations: seeding
to buy influencers given a social network, and removing or adding edges in the
social network given the seeds and the information sent. In particular, we
study a wide range of cases distinguishing for the number of candidates or the
kind of information spread over the network. Our main result is positive for
democracy, and it shows that the election manipulation problem is not
affordable in the worst-case except for trivial classes of instances, even when
one accepts to approximate the margin of victory. In the case of seeding, we
also show that the manipulation is hard even if the graph is a line and that a
large class of algorithms, including most of the approaches recently adopted
for social-influence problems, fail to compute a bounded approximation even on
elementary networks, as undirected graphs with every node having a degree at
most two or directed trees. In the case of edge removal or addition, our
hardness results also apply to the basic case of social influence
maximization/minimization. In contrast, the hardness of election manipulation
holds even when the manipulator has an unlimited budget, being allowed to
remove or add an arbitrary number of edges.

corrections to the redshifts and magnitudes of the supernovae to account for
the motion of the heliocentric frame relative to the `CMB rest frame', as well
as corrections for the directionally coherent bulk motion of local galaxies
with respect to this frame. The latter is done employing modelling of peculiar

provide evidence for residual bulk flows which are discordant with this model
(implying that the observed Universe is in fact anisotropic). Until recently
such peculiar velocity corrections in the Pantheon catalogue were made at
redshifts exceeding 0.2 although there is no data on which to base such
corrections. We study the impact of these vexed issues on the 4.4 $\sigma$
discrepancy between the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc
inferred from observations of CMB anisotropies by Planck assuming $\Lambda$CDM,
and the measurement of $H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc by the SH0ES project which
extended the local distance ladder using Type Ia supernovae. Using the same
methodology as the latter study we find that for supernovae whose redshifts are
discrepant between Pantheon and JLA with $\Delta z_\mathrm{hel} > 0.0025$, the
Pantheon redshifts favour $H_0 \simeq 72$ km/s/Mpc, while the JLA redshifts
favour $H_0 \simeq 68$ km/s/Mpc. Thus the discrepancies between SNe Ia datasets
are sufficient to undermine the claimed `Hubble tension'. We further note the
systematic variation of $H_0$ by $\sim$ 6-9 km/s/Mpc across the sky seen in
multiple datasets, implying that it cannot be measured locally to better than

fields, the former state-of-the-art methods are getting replaced by them in
speaker recognition too. It seems that DL becomes the now state-of-the-art
solution for both speaker verification and identification. The standard
x-vectors, additional to i-vectors, are used as baseline in most of the novel
works. The increasing amount of gathered data opens up the territory to DL,
where they are the most effective.

aimed at understanding the superwind production by an evolved AGB star and the
consecutive formation of a dense circumstellar envelope around it. We know
henceforth from various observations that a large scale magnetic field,
probably toroidal in shape, is duly attested within these envelopes. Where does
this large scale coherent field come from ? The apparent antinomy between the
quasi-round dense circumstellar envelopes and their likely descendants, i.e.
the elongated or bipolar Planetary Nebulae is also questioned. How is the
spherical symmetry broken ? We suggest in the present model that the nebula
must effectively appear round during the superwind phase from the point of view
of a distant observer. By contrast anisotropic structures are already appearing
at the same time, but these ones remain hidden in the innermost regions. We
predict thus the existence of a large bipolar cavity above the AGB star during
the slow superwind phase. We then conjecture that the PPNe phase begins when
the fast wind emitted by the core engulfs this cavity and increases the
anisotropy of the distribution of gas. Thus even though paradoxically enough a
beautiful evolved PNe can eventually emerge from a quasi-round dense
circumstellar envelope.

covering map of large degree to a fixed, regular graph has its new adjacency
eigenvalues within the bound conjectured by Alon for random regular graphs.
  In this article we use the results of Articles~III and IV in this series to
prove that if the base graph is regular, then as the degree, $n$, of the
covering map tends to infinity, some new adjacency eigenvalue has absolute
value outside the Alon bound with probability bounded by $O(1/n)$. In addition,
we give upper and lower bounds on this probability that are tight to within a
multiplicative constant times the degree of the covering map. These bounds
depend on two positive integers, the \emph{algebraic power} (which can also be
$+\infty$) and the \emph{tangle power} of the model of random covering map.
  We conjecture that the algebraic power of the models we study is always
$+\infty$, and in Article~VI we prove this when the base graph is regular and
\emph{Ramanujan}. When the algebraic power of the model is $+\infty$, then the
results in this article imply stronger results, such as (1) the upper and lower
bounds mentioned above are matching to within a multiplicative constant, and
(2) with probability smaller than any negative power of the degree, the some
new eigenvalue fails to be within the Alon bound only if the covering map

  Abstract",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and
blood pressure, are critical in the clinical decision making process. Effective
early prediction of vital signs help to alert medical practitioner ahead of
time and may prevent adverse health outcomes. In this paper, we suggest a new
approach called generative boosting, in order to effectively perform early
prediction of vital signs. Generative boosting consists of a generative model,
to generate synthetic data for next few time steps, and several predictive
models, to directly make long-range predictions based on observed and generated
data. We explore generative boosting via long short-term memory (LSTM) for both
the predictive and generative models, leading to a scheme called generative
LSTM (GLSTM). Our experiments indicate that GLSTM outperforms a diverse range
of strong benchmark models, with and without generative boosting. Finally, we
use a mutual information based clustering algorithm to select a more
representative dataset to train the generative model of GLSTM. This
significantly improves the long-range predictive performance of high variation
vital signs such as heart rate and systolic blood pressure.

diversity of writing styles, inks, and paper materials. It is even more
difficult for historical manuscripts due to the aging and degradation of the
documents over time. One of such manuscripts is the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)

techniques. This article proposes a new binarization technique for the DSS
images using the deep encoder-decoder networks. Although the artificial neural
network proposed here is primarily designed to binarize the DSS images, it can
be trained on different manuscript collections as well. Additionally, the use
of transfer learning makes the network already utilizable for a wide range of
handwritten documents, making it a unique multi-purpose tool for binarization.
Qualitative results and several quantitative comparisons using both historical
manuscripts and datasets from handwritten document image binarization

the system. The best performing network architecture proposed here is a variant

more used in various aspects of our life, including unmanned vehicles, speech

dependence on manual labeling data, DNNs often fail to detect their erroneous
behaviors, which may lead to serious problems. Several approaches have been
proposed to enhance the input examples for testing DL systems. However, they
have the following limitations. First, they design and generate adversarial
examples from the perspective of model, which may cause low generalization
ability when they are applied to other models. Second, they only use surface
feature constraints to judge the difference between the adversarial example
generated and the original example. The deep feature constraints, which contain
high-level semantic information, such as image object category and scene
semantics are completely neglected. To address these two problems, in this
paper, we propose CAGFuzz, a Coverage-guided Adversarial Generative Fuzzing
testing approach, which generates adversarial examples for a targeted DNN to
discover its potential defects. First, we train an adversarial case generator
(AEG) from the perspective of general data set. Second, we extract the depth
features of the original and adversarial examples, and constrain the
adversarial examples by cosine similarity to ensure that the semantic
information of adversarial examples remains unchanged. Finally, we retrain
effective adversarial examples to improve neuron testing coverage rate. Based
on several popular data sets, we design a set of dedicated experiments to
evaluate CAGFuzz. The experimental results show that CAGFuzz can improve the
neuron coverage rate, detect hidden errors, and also improve the accuracy of
the target DNN.

  anharmonic oscillator described by cubic quartic potential","31 pages,9 Tables",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The improved formulations of the Lindstedt Poincare perturbation method, the
harmonic balance method and its modifications using the rational functions, the
energy balance method and the two terms Fourier series expansion have been
employed to find approximate solution to the equation of motion for the cubic
quartic potential AHO and its special cases (the cubic, the quartic, and the
purely cubic quartic potential AHOs), to assess the relative merits and
demerits of these techniques. Two new rational functions as approximate
solution for the harmonic balance method have been proposed and the rational
functions have been used as trial functions in the energy balance method for
the first time. The time periods T+ (for q(t) > 0), T- (for q(t) < 0) and the
total period T so determined have been compared with the corresponding exact
values for an extensive range of the AHO parameter values. The results have
been thoroughly analysed in terms of their percentage difference from the
relevant exact time period. It is concluded that the methods based on the
Lindstedt Poincare perturbation approach do not lead to reliable results for T+
and T-, which makes their applicability for the asymmetric potential AHOs
doubtful. The harmonic balance technique together with its different variants
is the most successful, while the Fourier series approach also yields
commendably accurate results. The outcome of the third-order energy balance
method is reasonably good though the usage of the rational functions for this
has not been encouraging.

performing simultaneous imaging of the off-limb solar corona in both visible
and UV light. The observations obtained with Metis aboard the Solar Orbiter
ESA-NASA observatory will enable us to diagnose, with unprecedented temporal
coverage and spatial resolution, the structures and dynamics of the full corona
from 1.7 $R_\odot$ to about 9 $R_\odot$. Due to the uniqueness of the Solar
Orbiter mission profile, Metis will be able to observe the solar corona from a
close vantage point (down to 0.28 AU), achieving out-of-ecliptic views with the
increase of the orbit inclination over time. Moreover, observations near
perihelion, during the phase of lower rotational velocity of the solar surface
relative to the spacecraft, will allow longer-term studies of the coronal
features. Thanks to a novel occultation design and a combination of a UV
interference coating of the mirrors and a spectral bandpass filter, Metis
images the solar corona simultaneously in the visible light band, between 580
and 640 nm, and in the UV H I Lyman-{\alpha} line at 121.6 nm. The coronal
images in both the UV Lyman-{\alpha} and polarised visible light are obtained
at high spatial resolution with a spatial scale down to about 2000 km and 15000
km at perihelion, in the cases of the visible and UV light, respectively. A
temporal resolution down to 1 second can be achieved when observing coronal
fluctuations in visible light. The Metis measurements will allow for complete
characterisation of the main physical parameters and dynamics of the electron
and neutral hydrogen/proton plasma components of the corona in the region where
the solar wind undergoes acceleration and where the onset and initial
propagation of coronal mass ejections take place, thus significantly improving
our understanding of the region connecting the Sun to the heliosphere.

  bound states of the nuclei","43 pages",,,,"nucl-th math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider nuclei composed of nucleons which interact via two-body
potentials decreasing exponentially at infinity. Protons and neutrons are not
distinguished in order to simplify notations. The basic result is the rigorous
mathematical proof that the bound eigenstates of the nuclei belong to the
subspace $P \mathscr{H}$ spanned by the states of a single hole in the ground
state $\psi_{0}$ of the parent nucleus with an extra nucleon, as in the
uncorrelated models. This follows from the exponential decay of $\psi_{0}$ when
a nucleon is very far apart from the residual nucleus. We prove that the real
difference from the uncorrelated models is that $P \mathscr{H}$ has an infinite
dimension and contains generalized single hole states, distinguishable from the
usual ones by the fact that one cannot assign a wave function to the hole. The
bound eigenstates of the nuclei are just states of this kind. Some physical
consequences are discussed, in particular the unexpected fact that the
dynamical part of the single-hole Hamiltonian, although nonnull, does not
affect the single-hole overlaps with the bound eigenstates. The decay of
$\psi_{0}$ provides the asymptotic behaviours of many single-hole quantities,
in particular the nuclear density matrix. Thus a by product of this paper is
the rigorous proof of the method developed by Van Neck, Waroquier and Heyde to
calculate overlaps and separation energies.

for ionized gas dynamics at high temperature where the gas is a mixture of two
kinds of monatomic gas. In addition to the mass density, pressure, temperature
and particle velocity, degrees of ionization of both gases are also involved.
By assuming that the local thermal equilibrium is attained, Saha's ionization
equations are added. Thus the equations are supplemented by the first and
second law of thermodynamics, a single equation of state and, in addition, a
set of thermodynamic equations. The equations constitute a strictly hyperbolic
system, which guarantees that the initial value problem is well-posed locally
in time for sufficiently smooth initial data. However the geometric properties
of the system are rather complicated: in particular, we prove the existence of
a region where convexity (genuine nonlinearity) fails for forward and backward
characteristic fields. Also we study thermodynamic properties of shock waves by
a detailed analysis of the Hugoniot locus, which is used in a mathematical
study of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the shock tube problem.

  and Related Application to Electromyogram Classification",,,,,"eess.SP cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electromyogram (EMG) classification is a key technique in EMG-based control
systems. The existing EMG classification methods do not consider the
characteristics of EMG features that the distribution has skewness and
kurtosis, causing drawbacks such as the requirement of hyperparameter tuning.
In this paper, we propose a neural network based on the Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$
translation system that is capable of representing distributions with skewness
and kurtosis. The Johnson system is a normalizing translation that transforms
non-normal data to a normal distribution, thereby enabling the representation
of a wide range of distributions. In this study, a discriminative model based
on the multivariate Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$ translation system is transformed
into a linear combination of coefficients and input vectors using
log-linearization. This is then incorporated into a neural network structure,
thereby allowing the calculation of the posterior probability of the input
vectors for each class and the determination of model parameters as weight
coefficients of the network. The uniqueness of convergence of the network
learning is theoretically guaranteed. In the experiments, the suitability of
the proposed network for distributions including skewness and kurtosis is
evaluated using artificially generated data. Its applicability for real
biological data is also evaluated via an EMG classification experiment. The
results show that the proposed network achieves high classification performance
without the need for hyperparameter optimization.

improve road usage on freeways and city roads alike. We study platoon formation
in the context of same-day delivery in urban environments. Multiple
self-interested logistic service providers (LSP) carry out same-day deliveries
by deploying autonomous electric vehicles that are capable of forming and
traveling in platoons. The novel aspect that we consider in our research is
heterogeneity of platoons in the sense that vehicles are equipped with
different capabilities and constraints, and belong to different providers. Our
aim is to examine how these platoons can form and their potential properties
and benefits. We present a platoon forming and routing algorithm, called PFaRA,
that finds longest common routes for multiple vehicles, while also respecting
vehicle preferences and constraints. PFaRA consists of two parts, a speed
clustering step and a linear optimisation step. To test the approach, a
simulation was used, working with realistic urban network data and background
traffic models. Our results showed that the performance of our approach is
comparable to a simple route-matching one, but it leads to better utility
values for vehicles and by extension the LSPs. We show that the grouping
provided is viable and provides benefits to all vehicles participating in the
platoon.

low-structural symmetry leads to various phonon modes and multiple Reststrahlen

controlling the direction of swift electrons. These findings provide new
