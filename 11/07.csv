the past five years, with a majority focusing on high-level language frameworks
targeting remote REST library APIs. As quantum computing architectures advance
and become more widely available, lower-level, system software infrastructures
will be needed to enable tighter, co-processor programming and access models.
Here we present XACC, a system-level software infrastructure for
quantum-classical computing that promotes a service-oriented architecture to
expose interfaces for core quantum programming, compilation, and execution
tasks. We detail XACC's interfaces, their interactions, and its implementation
as a hardware-agnostic framework for both near-term and future
quantum-classical architectures. We provide concrete examples demonstrating the
utility of this framework with paradigmatic tasks. Our approach lays the
foundation for the development of compilers, associated runtimes, and low-level
system tools tightly integrating quantum and classical workflows.

common approximations for TSP, to parameterized approximations for ATSP. The
parameters we consider for the respective parameterizations are upper bounded
by the number of asymmetric distances in the given instance, which yields
algorithms to efficiently compute constant factor approximations also for
moderately asymmetric TSP instances. As generalization of the Christofides
algorithm, we derive a parameterized 2.5-approximation, where the parameter is
the size of a vertex cover for the subgraph induced by the asymmetric edges.
Our generalization of the tree doubling algorithm gives a parameterized
3-approximation, where the parameter is the number of asymmetric edges in a
given minimum spanning arborescence. Both algorithms are also stated in the
form of additive lossy kernelizations, which allows to combine them with known
polynomial time approximations for ATSP. Further, we combine them with a notion
of symmetry relaxation which allows to trade approximation guarantee for
runtime. We complement our results by experimental evaluations, which show that
generalized tree-doubling frequently outperforms generalized Christofides with

challenging problem. As a resolution, we present a new surrogate optimization
approach by addressing two gaps in prior research -- unimportant input
variables and inefficient treatment of uncertainty associated with the
black-box output. We first design a new flexible non-interpolating parsimonious
surrogate model using a partitioning-based multivariate adaptive regression
splines approach, Tree Knot MARS (TK-MARS). The proposed model is specifically
designed for optimization by capturing the structure of the function, bending
at near-optimal locations, and is capable of screening unimportant input
variables. Furthermore, we develop a novel replication approach called
\emph{Smart-Replication}, to overcome the uncertainty associated with the
black-box output. The Smart-Replication approach identifies promising input
points to replicate and avoids unnecessary evaluations of other data points.
Smart-Replication is agnostic to the choice of a surrogate and can adapt itself
to an unknown noise level. Finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approaches we consider different complex global optimization test
functions from the surrogate optimization literature. The results indicate that
TK-MARS outperforms original MARS within a surrogate optimization algorithm and
successfully detects important variables. The results also show that although
non-interpolating surrogates can mitigate uncertainty, replication is still
beneficial for optimizing highly complex black-box functions. The robustness
and the quality of the final optimum solution found through Smart-Replication
are competitive with that using no replications in environments with low levels
of noise and using a fixed number of replications in highly noisy environments.

make up for these limitations by employing multiple low-power low-complexity
devices that can monitor the same signal, possibly with different quality
observations and different energy costs, to create diversity against the
limitations of individual nodes. We investigate policies to minimize the

We assume that each source offers a different trade-off between the AoI and the
energy cost. The monitoring node is equipped with a finite size battery and
harvests ambient energy. For this setup, we formulate the scheduling of status
updates from the two sources as a Markov decision process (MDP), and obtain a
policy that decides on the optimal action to take (i.e., which source to query
or remain idle) depending on the current energy level and AoI. The performance
of the obtained policy is compared with an aggressive policy for different
system parameters. We identify few types of optimal solution structures and

superposition of far-field approximations for each particle's signature, which
are only valid asymptotically in the dilute suspension limit. A systematic and
unified analytical framework based on the classical Method of Reflections (MoR)

assumption by pursuing an approach that exploits human color perception, and
more specifically, minimizing perturbation size with respect to perceptual
color distance. Our first approach, Perceptual Color distance C&W (PerC-C&W),
extends the widely-used C&W approach and produces larger RGB perturbations.
PerC-C&W is able to maintain adversarial strength, while contributing to
imperceptibility. Our second approach, Perceptual Color distance Alternating

alternating between the classification loss and perceptual color difference

outperform conventional $L_p$ approaches in terms of robustness and

Unexpectedly, we prove that the ELBO objective for the linear VAE does not

We show further that training a linear VAE with exact variational inference
recovers an identifiable global maximum corresponding to the principal

of $\| G_r \|$. We relate this invariant to the stable commutator length
$\textrm{scl}_S(r)$ of the element $r \in F(S)$. We show that often (though not
always) the linear relationship $\| G_r \| = 4 \cdot \textrm{scl}_S(r) - 2$
holds and that every rational number modulo $1$ is the simplicial volume of a
one-relator group. Moreover, we show that this relationship holds approximately
for proper powers and for elements satisfying the small cancellation condition
$C'(1/N)$, with a multiplicative error of $O(1/N)$. This allows us to prove for
random elements of $F(S)'$ of length $n$ that $\| G_r \|$ is $2 \log(2 |S| -
1)/3 \cdot n / \log(n) + o(n/\log(n))$ with high probability, using an
analogous result of Calegari-Walker for stable commutator length.

and for 2I/Borisov, though the latter's higher speed means it is unlikely to be
young. First, their past trajectories are modelled under gravitational
scattering by galactic components ('disk heating') to assess how far back one
can trace them. The stochastic nature of disk heating means that a
back-integration can only expect to be accurate to within 15 pc and 2
kms$^{-1}$ at -10 Myr, dropping steeply to 400 pc and 10 kms$^{-1}$ at -100
Myr, sharply limiting our ability to determine a precise origin. Nevertheless,
we show `Oumuamua's origin system is likely currently within 1 kpc of Earth, in
the local Orion Arm. Second, we back-integrate 'Oumuamua's trajectory to assess
source regions, emphasizing young systems and moving groups. Though disk
heating allows for only a statistical link to source regions, `Oumuamua passed
through a considerable subset of the Carina and Columba moving groups when
those groups were forming. This makes them perhaps the most plausible source
region, if 'Oumuamua was ejected during planet formation or via intra-cluster

seven other stars to have plausible encounters with 2I/Borisov, within 2 pc and

geographical networks. Central to many networks of this kind, when considering
their growth in time, is the attachment rule, i.e. the probability that a new
node is attached to one (or more) preexistent nodes. In order to be more
realistic, a fitness parameter $\eta_i \in [0,1]$ for each node $i$ of the
network is also taken into account to reflect the ability of the nodes to
attract new ones. Our d-dimensional model takes into account the geographical
distances between nodes, with different probability distribution for $\eta$
which sensibly modifies the growth dynamics. The preferential attachment rule
is assumed to be $\Pi_i\propto k_i \eta_i r_{ij}^{-\alpha_A} $ where $k_i$ is
the connectivity of the $i$th pre-existing site and $\alpha_A$ characterizes
the importance of the euclidean distance r for the network growth. For special
values of the parameters, this model recovers respectively the
Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si and the Barab\'{a}si-Albert ones. The present generalised
model is asymptotically scale-free in all cases, and its degree distribution is
very well fitted with q-exponential distributions, which optimise the
nonadditive entropy $S_q$, given by $p(k) \propto e_q^{-k/\kappa} \equiv
1/[1+(q-1)k/\kappa]^{1/(q-1)}$, with $(q,\kappa)$ depending uniquely only on
the ratio $\alpha_A/d$ and the fitness distribution. Hence this model
constitutes a realization of asymptotically-scale-free geographical networks
within nonextensive statistical mechanics, where $k$ plays the role of energy
and $\kappa$ plays the role of temperature. General scaling laws are also found
for q as a function of the parameters of the model.

shear that is unbiased for isolated galaxy images. In this work we test
metacalibration with overlapping, or ``blended'' galaxy images. Using standard
metacalibration, we find a few percent shear measurement bias for galaxy
densities relevant for current surveys, and that this bias increases with
increasing galaxy number density. We show that this bias is not due to blending
itself, but rather to shear-dependent object detection. If object detection is
shear independent, no deblending of images is needed, in principle. We
demonstrate that detection biases are accurately removed when including object
detection in the metacalibration process, a technique we call metadetection.
This process involves applying an artificial shear to images of small regions
of sky and performing detection on the sheared images, as well as measurements
that are used to calculate a shear response. We demonstrate that the method can
accurately recover weak shear signals even in highly blended scenes. In the
metacalibration process, the space between objects is sheared coherently, which
does not perfectly match the real universe in which some, but not all, galaxy
images are sheared coherently. We find that even for the worst case scenario,
in which the space between objects is completely unsheared, the resulting shear
bias is at most a few tenths of a percent for future surveys. We discuss
additional technical challenges that must be met in order to implement
metadetection for real surveys.

$\textsf{$k$-TSP}$ problem is to find a tour originating at the $\textsf{root}$
of minimum length that visits at least $k$ nodes in $V$. In this work,
motivated by applications where the input to an optimization problem is
uncertain, we study two stochastic versions of $\textsf{$k$-TSP}$.
  In Stoch-Reward $k$-TSP, originally defined by Ene-Nagarajan-Saket [ENS17],
each vertex $v$ in the given metric $(V,d)$ contains a stochastic reward $R_v$.
The goal is to adaptively find a tour of minimum expected length that collects
at least reward $k$; here ""adaptively"" means our next decision may depend on
previous outcomes. Ene et al. give an $O(\log k)$-approximation adaptive
algorithm for this problem, and left open if there is an $O(1)$-approximation
algorithm. We totally resolve their open question and even give an
$O(1)$-approximation \emph{non-adaptive} algorithm for this problem.
  We also introduce and obtain similar results for the Stoch-Cost $k$-TSP
problem. In this problem each vertex $v$ has a stochastic cost $C_v$, and the
goal is to visit and select at least $k$ vertices to minimize the expected
\emph{sum} of tour length and cost of selected vertices. This problem
generalizes the Price of Information framework [Singla18] from deterministic
probing costs to metric probing costs.
  Our techniques are based on two crucial ideas: ""repetitions"" and ""critical
scaling"". We show using Freedman's and Jogdeo-Samuels' inequalities that for
our problems, if we truncate the random variables at an ideal threshold and
repeat, then their expected values form a good surrogate. Unfortunately, this
ideal threshold is adaptive as it depends on how far we are from achieving our
target $k$, so we truncate at various different scales and identify a
""critical"" scale.

is given as an orbit closure and the ambient space is the set of all 3-tensors.
The first variety that we consider is the slice rank variety, which consists of
all 3-tensors of slice rank at most $r$. We show that the membership testing
problem for the slice rank variety is $\NP$-hard. While the slice rank variety
is a union of orbit closures, we define another variety, the minrank variety,
expressible as a single orbit closure. Our next result is the $\NP$-hardness of
membership testing in the minrank variety, hence we establish the
$\NP$-hardness of the orbit closure containment problem for 3-tensors.
  Algebraic natural proofs were recently introduced by Forbes, Shpilka and Volk
and independently by Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf. Bl\""aser et al. gave a
version of an algebraic natural proof barrier for the matrix completion problem
which relies on $\coNP \subseteq \exists \BPP$. It implied that constructing
equations for the corresponding variety should be hard. We generalize their
approach to work with any family of varieties for which the membership problem
is $\NP$-hard and for which we can efficiently generate a dense subset.
Therefore, a similar barrier holds for the slice rank and the minrank
varieties, too. This allows us to set up the slice rank and the minrank
varieties as a test-bed for geometric complexity theory (GCT). We determine the
stabilizers of the tensors that generate the orbit closures of the two
varieties and prove that these tensors are almost characterized by their
symmetries. We prove several nontrivial equations for both the varieties using
different GCT methods. Many equations also work in the regime where membership
testing in the slice rank or minrank varieties is $\NP$-hard. We view this as a
promising sign that the GCT approach might indeed be successful.

also show that this bound is tight by constructing a family of sparse support
whose expected number of real zeros is lower bounded by $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$. Our
main technique is an alternative formulation of the Kac integral by
Edelman-Kostlan which allows us to bound the expected number of zeros of $f$ in
terms of the expected number of zeros of polynomials of lower sparsity. Using
our technique, we also recover the $O(\log n)$ bound on the expected number of
real zeros of a dense polynomial of degree $n$ with coefficients coming from
independent standard normal distributions.

demonstrates a quantum advantage for shallow circuits: constant-depth quantum
circuits can perform a task which constant-depth classical (i.e., AC$^0$)
circuits cannot. Their results have the advantage that the quantum circuit is
fairly practical, and their proofs are free of hardness assumptions (e.g.,
factoring is classically hard, etc.). Unfortunately, constant-depth classical
circuits are too weak to yield a convincing real-world demonstration of quantum
advantage. We attempt to hold on to the advantages of the above results, while
increasing the power of the classical model.
  Our main result is a two-round interactive task which is solved by a
constant-depth quantum circuit (using only Clifford gates, between neighboring
qubits of a 2D grid, with Pauli measurements), but such that any classical
solution would necessarily solve $\oplus$L-hard problems. This implies a more
powerful class of constant-depth classical circuits (e.g., AC$^0[p]$ for any
prime $p$) unconditionally cannot perform the task. Furthermore, under standard
complexity-theoretic conjectures, log-depth circuits and log-space Turing
machines cannot perform the task either.
  Using the same techniques, we prove hardness results for weaker complexity
classes under more restrictive circuit topologies. Specifically, we give
QNC$^0$ interactive tasks on $2 \times n$ and $1 \times n$ grids which require
classical simulations of power NC$^1$ and AC$^{0}[6]$, respectively. Moreover,
these hardness results are robust to a small constant fraction of error in the
classical simulation.
  We use ideas and techniques from the theory of branching programs, quantum
contextuality, measurement-based quantum computation, and Kilian randomization.

annotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively

user-system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any
manual annotation. Users here tend to modify a previous query in hopes of
fixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These
reformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by
errors in ASR, NLU, ER or the application. In some cases, users may not
properly formulate their requests (e.g. providing partial title of a song), but
gleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying
recurrent patterns. Our proposed self-learning system automatically detects the
errors, generate reformulations and deploys fixes to the runtime system to
correct different types of errors occurring in different components of the
system. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as
a collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns.
We show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations

commonly applied indicator of the galaxy star formation timescale (SFT) since
the two groups of elements are mainly produced by different types of supernovae
that explode over different timescales. However, it is insufficient to consider
only [Mg/Fe] when estimating the SFT. The [Mg/Fe] yield of a stellar population
depends on its metallicity. Therefore, it is possible for galaxies with
different SFTs and at the same time different total metallicity to have the
same [Mg/Fe]. This effect has not been properly taken into consideration in
previous studies. In this study, we assume the galaxy-wide stellar initial mass
function (gwIMF) to be canonical and invariant. We demonstrate that our
computation code reproduces the SFT estimations of previous studies where only
the [Mg/Fe] observational constraint is applied. We then demonstrate that once
both metallicity and [Mg/Fe] observations are considered, a more severe
""downsizing relation"" is required. This means that either low-mass ellipticals
have longer SFTs (> 4 Gyr for galaxies with mass below $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) or
massive ellipticals have shorter SFTs ($\approx 200$ Myr for galaxies more
massive than $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) than previously thought. This modification
increases the difficulty in reconciling such SFTs with other observational
constraints. We show that applying different stellar yield modifications does
not relieve this formation timescale problem. The quite unrealistically short
SFT required by [Mg/Fe] and total metallicity would be prolonged if a variable
stellar gwIMF were assumed. Since a systematically varying gwIMF has been
suggested by various observations this could present a natural solution to this
problem.

overcome these challenges, machine learning algorithms are being investigated
as alternative approaches. Using the 4FGL catalog, a sample of 3137 Fermi

supervised machine learning algorithms (random forests (RFs), support vector

predictive models to classify the BCUs. We analyze the results for all of the
different combinations of parameters. Interestingly, a previously reported
trend the use of more parameters leading to higher accuracy is not found.
Considering the least number of parameters used, combinations of eight, 12 or
10 parameters in the SVM, ANN, or RF generated models achieve the highest

accretion from cold gas with high angular momentum); $(iii)$ how different
models of gas accretion and coupling of AGN feedback energy affect the
coevolution of supermassive BHs and their host galaxy. We find that at least a
share of the AGN feedback energy has to couple with the diffuse gas, in order
to avoid an excessive growth of the BH mass. When the BH only accretes cold
gas, it experiences a growth that is faster than in the case in which both cold
and hot gas are accreted. If the accretion of cold gas with high angular
momentum is reduced, the BH mass growth is delayed, the BH mass at $z=0$ is
reduced by up to an order of magnitude, and the BH is prevented from accreting
below $z \lesssim 2$, when the galaxy disc forms.

  Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/psz121",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new observing method for single-dish millimeter and
submillimeter spectroscopy using a heterodyne receiver equipped with a
frequency-modulating local oscillator (FMLO). Unlike conventional switching
methods, which extract astronomical signals by subtracting the reference
spectra of off-sources from those of on-sources, the FMLO method does not need
to obtain any off-source spectra; rather, it estimates them from the on-source
spectra themselves. The principle is a high dump-rate (10 Hz) spectroscopy with
radio frequency modulation (FM) achieved by fast sweeping of a local oscillator
(LO) of a heterodyne receiver: Because sky emission (i.e., off-source)
fluctuates as $1/f$-type and is spectrally correlated, it can be estimated and
subtracted from time-series spectra (a timestream) by principal component
analysis. Meanwhile astronomical signals remain in the timestream since they
are modulated to a higher time-frequency domain. The FMLO method therefore
achieves (1) a remarkably high observation efficiency, (2) reduced spectral
baseline wiggles, and (3) software-based sideband separation. We developed an
FMLO system for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and a data reduction procedure for
it. Frequency modulation was realized by a tunable and programmable first local
oscillator. With observations of Galactic sources, we demonstrate that the
observation efficiency of the FMLO method is dramatically improved compared to
conventional switching methods. Specifically, we find that the time to achieve
the same noise level is reduced by a factor of 3.0 in single-pointed
observations and by a factor of 1.2 in mapping observations. The FMLO method
can be applied to observations of fainter ($\sim$mK) spectral lines and larger
($\sim$deg$^{2}$) mapping. It would offer much more efficient and
baseline-stable observations compared to conventional switching methods.

criticality in the three-dimensional quantum spherical model, both as a
function of temperature $T$ and of the quantum parameter $g$, which measures
the strength of quantum fluctuations. While the von Neumann and the R\'enyi
entropies exhibit the volume-law for any $g$ and $T$, the mutual information
obeys an area law. The prefactors of the volume-law and of the area-law are
regular across the transition, reflecting that universal singular terms vanish
at the transition. This implies that the mutual information is dominated by
nonuniversal contributions. This hampers its use as a witness of criticality,
at least in the spherical model. We also study the logarithmic negativity. For
any value of $g,T$, the negativity exhibits an area-law. The negativity
vanishes deep in the paramagnetic phase, it is larger at small temperature, and
it decreases upon increasing the temperature. For any $g$, it exhibits the
so-called sudden death, i.e., it is exactly zero for large enough $T$. The
vanishing of the negativity defines a ""death line"", which we characterise
analytically at small $g$. Importantly, for any finite $T$ the area-law
prefactor is regular across the transition, whereas it develops a cusp-like
singularity in the limit $T\to 0$. Finally, we consider the single-particle
entanglement and negativity spectra. The vast majority of the levels are
regular across the transition. Only the larger ones exhibit singularities.
These are related to the presence of a zero mode, which reflects the symmetry
breaking. This implies the presence of sub-leading singular terms in the
entanglement entropies. Interestingly, since the larger levels do not
contribute to the negativity, sub-leading singular corrections are expected to
be suppressed for the negativity.

Milky Way, survey parameters, and selection effects. We use this model to
derive the star formation histories of the thin disk, thick disk, and stellar

0.5) Gyr ago, with a peak rate of (8.8 $\pm$ 1.4) M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at (9.8
$\pm$ 0.4) Gyr, before a slow decline to a constant rate until the present day
--- consistent with recent results suggesting a merging event with a satellite
galaxy. Studying the residuals between the data and best-fit model shows
evidence for a slight increase in star formation over the past 3 Gyr. We fit
the local fraction of helium-atmosphere white dwarfs to be (21 $\pm$ 3) %.
Incorporating this methodology with data from future wide-field surveys such as
LSST, Euclid, CASTOR, and WFIRST should provide an unprecedented view into the

The latter leads to a systematic underestimation of the source sizes by 50 per

numerical analyses of a time-domain Ramsey-type protocol for noisy
Majorana-based qubits that is designed to validate this coveted topological
protection in near-term devices such as the so-called `tetron' design. By
assessing dependence of dephasing times on tunable parameters, e.g., magnetic
field, our proposed protocol can clearly distinguish a bona fide Majorana qubit
from one constructed from semilocal Andreev bound states, which can otherwise
closely mimic the true topological scenario in local probes. In addition, we
analyze leakage of the qubit out of its low-energy manifold due to
classical-noise-induced generation of quasiparticle excitations; leakage limits
the qubit lifetime when the bulk gap collapses, and hence our protocol further
reveals the onset of a topological phase transition. This experiment requires
measurement of two nearby Majorana modes for both initialization and
readout---achievable, for example, by tunnel coupling to a nearby quantum

conclude that the regions of galaxies facing the centre are bluer, consistent

colour asymmetry show the largest amounts of dust towards the external regions

mass of a single star (the lens) with an accuracy of a few percent. To do so,
precise measurements of the angular separations between lens and background
star with an accuracy below 1 milli-arcsecond at different epochs are needed.

Aims. We want to show how accurately Gaia can determine the mass of the lensing

also fit the motion of all background sources and the lens simultaneously.

H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission line maps for individual galaxies. We also
derive resolved stellar mass, SFR and dust maps using pixel-by-pixel SED
fitting on high resolution multi-band HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 data from the
CANDELS survey. By combining these, we analyze the radial profile of various
physical parameters across these galaxies. We observe a radial dependence in
both stellar and nebular color excess profiles peaking at the inner regions of
galaxies. We also find the color excess profiles to most strongly correlate
with the integrated sSFRs of galaxies. The median sSFR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}$
radial profiles of galaxies in our sample show a 0.8 dex increase from the
central regions outward. This increase compared to the almost flat median
radial profile of sSFR$_{\mathrm{SED}}$, which traces longer timescales of star
formation, is in favor of the inside-out quenching of star formation. We bring
further evidence for this quenching scenario from the locus of different
subregions of galaxies on the SFR-M$_{*}$ and sSFR-M$_{*}$ relations.

of the Lyman-break at 912{\AA}, in what we call `2-D Lyman-Break Imaging'. The
images used are in the rest-frame optical at $z < 3$ and progressively bluer
bands at $z > 3$. They are therefore subject to K-correction and cosmological
dimming effects which are tested and corrected for. We separately consider a
mass-selected sample (with masses in the range
10$^9$M$_{\odot}$$\leq$M$_*$$\leq$10$^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) and a number density
selected sample (using a constant number density of $n =
1\times10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-3}$). Instead of utilising the commonly used, but
potentially biased, effective radii for size measurements, we measure the
redshift-independent Petrosian radius, defined by the parameter $\eta$, for
each galaxy for three values of $\eta$ and use this as a proxy for size. The
evolution of the measured radii can be described by a power-law of the form
$R_{Petr} = \alpha(1+z)^\beta$kpc where $\beta < 0$. We find that the outer
radius increases more rapidly, suggesting that as a galaxy grows mass is added
to its outer regions via an inside-out growth. This growth is stronger for the
number density selected sample, with a growth rate of nearly three in the outer
radii compared to the inner. We test and confirm these results using a series

strontium (Sr), as representative $\alpha$, iron-peak, and s-process elements,
respectively. To this end, we develop the Versatile Integrator for Chemical
Evolution (VICE), a python package. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of
gas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak
in the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a
temporary boost of star formation efficiency have a similar effect, and they
also produce a population of $\alpha$-deficient stars during the depressed star
formation phase that follows the burst. This $\alpha$-deficient population is
more prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation
rate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr
production predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) star yields, though comparison to data suggests an
additional source that is nearly metallicity-independent. Evolution of [Sr/Fe]
and [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of the yield metallicity
dependence and the multiple timescales in play. Moderate amplitude (10-20\%)
sinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and
multiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, which could be one source of intrinsic
scatter in observed sequences. We investigate models that have a factor of ~2
enhancement of SFR at t = 12 Gyr, as suggest by some recent Milky Way
observations. A late episode of enhanced star formation could help explain the
existence of young stars with moderate $\alpha$-enhancements and the
surprisingly young median age found for solar metallicity stars in the solar
neighborhood, while also raising the possibility that this starburst has not
fully decayed.

PBS to explore communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks. We show
that brain communication dynamics can be divided into three main 'communication
regimes' of information transfer: absent communication (no communication
happening); relay communication (information is being transferred almost
intact); transducted communication (the information is being transformed). We
use PBS to categorize brain regions based on the way they broadcast
information. Subcortical regions are mainly direct broadcasters to multiple
receivers; Temporal and frontal nodes mainly operate as broadcast relay brain
stations; Visual and somato-motor cortices act as multi-channel transducted

the phenomenology of dark matter (DM). Although the capture into bound states
via emission of a vector is known to be significant, the capture via scalar
emission suffers from cancellations that render it important only within narrow
parameter space. While this is true for neutral scalar mediators, here we show
that bound-state formation via emission of a charged scalar can be extremely
significant. To this end, we consider DM charged under a dark $U(1)$ force and
coupled also to a light complex scalar that is charged under the same gauge
symmetry. We compute the cross-sections for bound-state formation via emission
of the charged scalar, and show that they can exceed those for capture via
vector emission, as well as annihilation, by orders of magnitude. This holds
even for very small values of the DM coupling to the charged scalar, and
remains true in the limit of global symmetry. We then compute the DM thermal
freeze-out, and find that the capture into meta-stable bound states via
emission of a charged scalar can cause a late period of significant DM
depletion. Our results include analytical expressions in the Coulomb limit, and
are readily generalisable to non-Abelian interactions. We expect them to have
implications for Higgs-portal scenarios of multi-TeV WIMP DM, as well as
scenarios that feature dark Higgses or (darkly-)charged inert scalars,

nodes and help the source in data dissemination. In this network, we study two
scenarios; i) the transmitting nodes do not need an incentive for transmission
and ii) they do need an incentive and are paid by their corresponding receiving
nodes by virtual tokens. We investigate two problems; P1) network power
minimization for the first scenario and P2) social cost minimization for the
second scenario, defined as the total cost paid by the nodes of the network for
receiving data. In this paper, to address P1 and P2, we propose centralized and
decentralized approaches that determine which of the nodes of the network
should act as transmitting nodes, find their transmit powers and their
corresponding receiving nodes. For the sake of energy efficiency, in our model,
we employ maximal-ratio combining (MRC) at the receivers so that a receiver can
be served by multiple transmitters. The proposed decentralized approach is
based on a non-cooperative cost-sharing game (CSG). In our proposed game, every
receiving node chooses its respective transmitting nodes and consequently, a
cost is assigned to it according to the power imposed on its chosen
transmitting nodes. We discuss how the network is formed in a decentralized
way, find the action of the nodes in the game and show that, despite being
decentralized, the proposed game converges to a stable solution. To find the
centralized global optimum, which is a benchmark to our decentralized approach,
we use a mixed-integer-liner-program (MILP). Simulation results show that our
proposed decentralized approach outperforms the conventional algorithms in
terms of energy efficiency and social cost while it can address the need for an

neurons introduced by Ferrari et al. in an article entitled Phase transition
forinfinite systems of spiking neurons. In this model we have a countable
number of neurons linked together in a network, each of them having a membrane
potential taking value in the integers, and each of them spiking over time at a
rate which depends on the membrane potential through some rate function $\phi$.
Beside being affected by a spike each neuron can also be affected by leaking.
At each of these leak times, which occurs for a given neuron at a fixed rate
$\gamma$, the membrane potential of the neuron concerned is spontaneously reset
to $0$. A wide variety of versions of this model can be considered by choosing
different graph structures for the network and different activation functions.
It was rigorously shown that when the graph structure of the network is the
one-dimensional lattice with a hard threshold for the activation function, this
model presents a phase transition with respect to $\gamma$, and that it also
presents a metastable behavior. By the latter we mean that in the sub-critical
regime the re-normalized time of extinction converges to an exponential random
variable of mean 1. It has also been proven that in the super-critical regime
the renormalized time of extinction converges in probability to 1. Here, we
investigate numerically a richer class of graph structures and activation
functions. Namely we investigate the case of the two dimensional and the three
dimensional lattices, as well as the case of a linear function and a sigmoid
function for the activation function. We present numerical evidence that the
result of metastability in the sub-critical regime holds for these graphs and
activation functions as well as the convergence in probability to $1$ in the
super-critical regime.

predicted by the standard (``basic'') HOD model, we find that, on average, the
``basic'' HOD model underpredicts the real-space correlation function in the
TNG300 box by $\sim$ 15\% on scales of $1 \ {\rm Mpc}/h < r < 20 \ {\rm

galaxy redshift surveys. We perform several tests to establish the robustness
of our findings to systematic effects, including the effect of finite box size
and the choice of halo finder. In our exploration of ``secondary'' parameters
with which to augment the ``basic'' HOD, we find that the local environment of
the halo, the velocity dispersion anisotropy, $\beta$, and the product of the
half-mass radius and the velocity dispersion, $\sigma^2 R_{\rm halfmass}$, are
the three most effective measures of assembly bias that help reconcile the
``basic'' HOD-predicted clustering with that in TNG300. In addition, we test
other halo properties such as halo spin, formation epoch and halo
concentration. We also find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies in one type of

more complete model of the galaxy-halo connection can be constructed if we
combine both mass and local environment information about the halo.

experimental measurements of W sputtering during ELMs, conducted via fast WI
spectroscopy. Good agreement is observed using a variety of controlling
techniques, including gas puffing, neutral beam heating, and plasma shaping to
modify the pedestal stability boundary and thus the ELM behavior. ELM
mitigation by pellet pacing was observed to strongly reduce W sputtering by
flushing C impurities from the pedestal and reducing the divertor target
electron temperature. No reduction of W sputtering was observed during the
application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs), in contrast to the
prediction of the FSRM. Potential sources of this discrepancy are discussed.
Finally, the framework of the FSRM is utilized to predict intra-ELM W
sputtering rates in ITER. It is concluded that W erosion during ELMs in ITER
will be caused mainly by free-streaming fuel ions, but free-streaming seeded
impurities (N or Ne) may increase the erosion rate significantly if present in
the pedestal at even the 1% level. Impurity recycling is not expected to cause
significant W erosion in ITER due to the very low target electron temperature.

level, this degeneracy can be formally understood in terms of a unified dark
sector Equation of State (EoS) that depends both on the dynamical nature of the
dark energy (DE) as well as on its interaction with the pressureless dark
matter. For linear perturbations, the degeneracy arises for specified DE
pressure perturbations (or sound speed, equivalently) and DE anisotropic
stress. Specializing to the degeneracy between non-interacting dynamical DE and
interacting vacuum DE models, we perform a parameter estimation analysis for a
range of dynamical DE parametrizations, where for illustration we explicitly
break the degeneracy at the linear level by adopting a luminal sound speed for
both scenarios. We conduct this analysis using cosmological background data
alone and in combination with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave
background radiation. We find that although the overall phenomenology between
the dynamical DE and interacting approaches is similar, there are some
intriguing differences. In particular, there is an ambiguity in the strength of
constraints on $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\sigma_8$, which are considerably weakened
for interacting vacuum DE, indicating that the dark degeneracy can change the

tunes the Fermi level of CNT by EDL charging, and causes lowering of a barrier

performance by raising mostly two parameters: Isc and FF, resulting in PCE

increasing strongly PCE. Surprisingly Voc is not sensitive in PS-PV to external

applications in network security such as malware detection, intrusion

space vs feature space dimensional classification model. We then analyze the
various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network
security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk grid map
and evaluating several existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in
network security using the risk grid map. We also identify where each attack
classification resides within the adversarial risk grid map.

method. The results are consistent, provided that a large smearing-size
interpolation operator is included in the variational calculation to have
better overlap with the lowest radial excitation. Similar calculations carried
out for an anisotropic clover lattice with similar parameters find the Roper

prediction of the Roper state by overlap fermions is consistently lower than
those of clover fermions, chirally improved fermions, and twisted-mass fermions

  To understand the origin of this difference, we study the hairpin $Z$-diagram
in the isovector scalar meson ($a_0$) correlator in the quenched approximation.
Comparing the $a_0$ correlators for clover and overlap fermions, at a pion mass
of 290 MeV, we find that the spectral weight of the ghost state with clover
fermions is smaller than that of the overlap at $a = 0.12$ fm and $0.09$ fm,
whereas the whole $a_0$ correlators of clover and overlap at $a = 0.06$ fm
coincide within errors. This suggests that chiral symmetry is restored for
clover at $a \le 0.06$ fm and that the Roper should come down at and below this
$a$.
  We conclude that this work supports a resolution of the ""Roper puzzle"" due to
$Z$-graph type chiral dynamics. This entails coupling to higher components in
the Fock space (e.g. $N\pi$, $N\pi\pi$ states) to induce the effective
flavor-spin interaction between quarks as prescribed in the chiral quark model,
resulting in the parity-reversal pattern as observed in the experimental

words that are used by neural network models across a constantly growing
multitude of NLP tasks. As such, it is imperative for NLP practitioners to
understand how their word representations are produced, and why they are so
impactful.
  The present work presents the Simple Embedder framework, generalizing the
state-of-the-art existing word embedding algorithms (including Word2vec (SGNS)
and GloVe) under the umbrella of generalized low rank models. We derive that
both of these algorithms attempt to produce embedding inner products that
approximate pointwise mutual information (PMI) statistics in the corpus. Once
cast as Simple Embedders, comparison of these models reveals that these
successful embedders all resemble a straightforward maximum likelihood estimate
(MLE) of the PMI parametrized by the inner product (between embeddings). This
MLE induces our proposed novel word embedding model, Hilbert-MLE, as the
canonical representative of the Simple Embedder framework.
  We empirically compare these algorithms with evaluations on 17 different
datasets. Hilbert-MLE consistently observes second-best performance on every
extrinsic evaluation (news classification, sentiment analysis, POS-tagging, and
supersense tagging), while the first-best model depends varying on the task.
Moreover, Hilbert-MLE consistently observes the least variance in results with
respect to the random initialization of the weights in bidirectional LSTMs. Our
empirical results demonstrate that Hilbert-MLE is a very consistent word
embedding algorithm that can be reliably integrated into existing NLP systems
to obtain high-quality results.

technique (SIT), is the most promising one. SIT control generally consists of
massive releases of sterile insects in the targeted area in order to reach
elimination or to lower the pest population under a certain threshold. The
models presented here are minimalistic with respect to the number of parameters
and variables. The first model deals with the dynamics of the vector population
while the second model, the SIT model, tackles the interaction between treated
males and wild female vectors. For the vector population model, the elimination
equilibrium $\mathbb{0}$ is globally asymptotically stable when the basic
offspring number, $\mathcal{R}$, is lower or equal to one, whereas $\mathbb{0}$
becomes unstable and one stable positive equilibrium exists, with
well-determined basins of attraction, when $\mathcal{R}>1$. For the SIT model,
we obtain a threshold number of treated male vectors above which the control of
wild female vectors is effective: the massive release control. When the amount
of treated male vectors is lower than the aforementioned threshold number, the
SIT model experiences a bistable situation involving the elimination
equilibrium and a positive equilibrium. However, practically, massive releases
of sterile males are only possible for a short period of time. That is why,
using the bistability property, we develop a new strategy to maintain the wild
population under a certain threshold, for a permanent and sustainable low level
of SIT control. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical
simulations, in the case of SIT mosquito control.

theory are great co-dimension one spheres in the context of DS/dS
correspondence, we study some information theoretic quantities of the field
theory dual intensively using holographic proposals. We will focus on
entanglement entropy (EE), entanglement of purification (EoP) and complexity.
Several fundamental observations and analysis are provided. For EE, we focus on
its scaling behavior, which indicates the nature of the relevant degrees of
freedom. Moreover, we find that EE provides us with important information of
the energy spectrum in pure dS and it also leads us to the speculation that the
field theory dual is chaotic or non-integrable. For EoP, an interesting
phenomenon we call ""Entanglement of Purification Jump"" is observed according to
which we propose two puzzles regarding EoP and EE in the context of dS
holography. For complexity, we find that the Complexity=Volume proposal does
not provide a well-defined way to compute complexity for pure dS. However, it
does provide a well-defined way to compute complexity in the
$T\bar{T}+\Lambda_{2}$ deformed case. At the end, we will use the surface/state
correspondence to resolve all the puzzles and hence reach a consistent
information theoretic picture of dS holography. Moreover, we will provide
evidence for our former proposal that the $T\bar{T}+\cdots$ deformations are
operating quantum circuits and study the non-locality of the field theory
algebra suggested by the surface/state correspondence.

search products. While most current systems have focused on answering questions
against structured databases or curated knowledge graphs, on-line community
forums or frequently asked questions (FAQ) lists offer an alternative source of
information for question answering systems. Automatic duplicate question
detection (DQD) is the key technology need for question answering systems to
utilize existing online forums like StackExchange. Existing annotations of
duplicate questions in such forums are community-driven, making them sparse or
even completely missing for many domains. Therefore, it is important to
transfer knowledge from related domains and tasks. Recently, contextual
embedding models such as BERT have been outperforming many baselines by
transferring self-supervised information to downstream tasks. In this paper, we
apply BERT to DQD and advance it by unsupervised adaptation to StackExchange
domains using self-supervised learning. We show the effectiveness of this
adaptation for low-resource settings, where little or no training data is
available from the target domain. Our analysis reveals that unsupervised BERT
domain adaptation on even small amounts of data boosts the performance of BERT.

approximation and develop the mathematical machinery for its analysis. Our
algorithms improve the best known running times of parameterized approximation
algorithms for Vertex Cover and $3$-Hitting Set for a wide range of
approximation ratios. One notable example is a simple parameterized random
$1.5$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover, whose running time of
$O^*(1.01657^k)$ substantially improves the best known runnning time of
$O^*(1.0883^k)$ [Brankovic and Fernau, 2013]. For $3$-Hitting Set we present a
parameterized random $2$-approximation algorithm with running time of
$O^*(1.0659^k)$, improving the best known $O^*(1.29^k)$ algorithm of [Brankovic
and Fernau, 2012].
  The running times of our algorithms are derived from an asymptotic analysis
of a wide class of two-variable recurrence relations of the form: $$p(b,k) =
\min_{1\leq j \leq N} \sum_{i=1}^{r_j} \bar{\gamma}_i^j \cdot p(b-\bar{b}^j_i,
k-\bar{k}_i^j),$$ where $\bar{b}^j$ and $\bar{k}^j$ are vectors of natural

elements, for $1\leq j \leq N$. Our main theorem asserts that for any
$\alpha>0$, $$\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty } \frac{1}{k} \log p(\alpha k,k) =
-\max_{1\leq j \leq N} M_j,$$
  where $M_j$ depends only on $\alpha$, $\bar{\gamma}^j$, $\bar{b}^j$ and
$\bar{k}^j$, and can be efficiently calculated by solving a simple numerical
optimization problem. To this end, we show an equivalence between the
recurrence and a stochastic process. We analyze this process using the Method
of Types, by introducing an adaptation of Sanov's theorem to our setting. We
believe our novel analysis of recurrence relations which is of independent

defined for a team of agents on a set of nodes (targets) interconnected

minimize a measure of overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite

has been proposed in prior work to control agent dwell times at nodes and
next-node destinations by enforcing thresholds on the respective node states.
Under such a Threshold Control Policy (TCP), an on-line gradient technique was
used to determine optimal threshold values. However, due to the non-convexity
of the problem, this approach often leads to a poor local optima highly
dependent on the initial thresholds used. To overcome this initialization
challenge, we develop a computationally efficient off-line greedy technique
based on the asymptotic analysis of the network system. This analysis is then
used to generate a high-performing set of initial thresholds. Extensive
numerical results show that such initial thresholds are almost immediately
(locally) optimal or quickly lead to optimal values. In all cases, they perform
significantly better than the locally optimal solutions known to date.

mixed-finite element methods, constrained optimization problems, or the
implicit or steady state treatment of any system of PDEs with multiple
dependent variables. Often, these systems are solved iteratively using Krylov
methods and some form of block preconditioner. Under the assumption that one
diagonal block is inverted exactly, this paper proves a direct equivalence
between convergence of $2\times2$ block preconditioned Krylov or fixed-point
iterations to a given tolerance, with convergence of the underlying
preconditioned Schur-complement problem. In particular, results indicate that
an effective Schur-complement preconditioner is a necessary and sufficient
condition for rapid convergence of $2\times 2$ block-preconditioned GMRES, for
arbitrary relative-residual stopping tolerances. A number of corollaries and
related results give new insight into block preconditioning, such as the fact
that approximate block-LDU or symmetric block-triangular preconditioners offer
minimal reduction in iteration over block-triangular preconditioners, despite
the additional computational cost. Theoretical results are verified numerically
on a nonsymmetric steady linearized Navier-Stokes discretization, which also
demonstrate that theory based on the assumption of an exact inverse of one
diagonal block extends well to the more practical setting of inexact inverses.

achieved by recursively applying the basic second-order leap-frog scheme
(considering the single evaluation of the EoM) in a combination of even numbers
of forward time integration steps with a single intermediate backward step.
This largely reduces the number of evaluations and random gradient
computations, as required in the usual second-order case for high-dimensional
cases. We restrict this study to the lognormal-Poisson model, applied to a full
volume halo catalogue in real space on a cubical mesh of 1250 $h^{-1}$ Mpc side
and 256$^3$ cells. Hence, we neglect selection effects, redshift space
distortions, and displacements. We note that those observational and cosmic
evolution effects can be accounted for in subsequent Gibbs-sampling steps
within the COSMIC BIRTH algorithm. We find that going from the usual second to
fourth-order in the leap-frog scheme shortens the burn-in phase by a factor of
at least $\sim30$. This implies that 75-90 independent samples are obtained
while the fastest second-order method converges. After convergence, the
correlation lengths indicate an improvement factor of about 3.0 fewer gradient
computations for meshes of 256$^3$ cells. In the considered cosmological
scenario, the traditional leap-frog scheme turns out to outperform higher order
integration schemes only at lower dimensional problems, e.g. meshes with 64$^3$
cells. This gain in computational efficiency can help to go towards a full
Bayesian analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure for upcoming galaxy
surveys.

several precise fits and the respective cosmological consequences. As a matter
of completeness, we also analyzed cosmological scenarios where this new version
of $f(R,T)$ is coupled with a real scalar field. In order to find analytical
cosmological parameters, we used a slow-roll approximation for the evolution of
the scalar field. This approximation allowed us to derived the Hubble and the

Therefore, the analytical parameters unveil the viability of this proposal for

structure deduced from diffraction experiments; when modeled by the minimal
unit cell this often produces a spatially averaged model. The present study
illustrates that this is not always a safe practice unless one examines if the
intrinsic bonding mechanism is capable of benefiting from the formation of a
distribution of lower symmetry local environments that differ from the
macroscopically averaged structure. This can happen either due to positional,
or due to magnetic symmetry breaking. By removing the constraint of a small
crystallographic cell, the energy minimization in the density functional theory
finds atomic and spin symmetry breaking, not evident in conventional
diffraction experiments but being found by local probes such as pair
distribution function analysis. Here we report that large atomic and electronic
anomalies in bulk tetragonal FeSe emerge from the existence of distributions of
local positional and magnetic moment motifs. The found symmetry-broken motifs
obtained by minimization of the internal energy represent what chemical bonding
in tetragonal phase prefers as an intrinsic energy lowering static distortions.
This explains observations of band renormalization, predicts orbital order and
enhanced nematicity, and provides unprecedented close agreement with spectral
function measured by photoemission and local atomic environment revealed by
pair distribution function. While the symmetry-restricted strong correlation
approach has been argued previously to be the exclusive theory needed for
describing the main peculiarities of FeSe, we show here that the
symmetry-broken mean-field approach addresses numerous aspects of the problem,
provides intuitive insight into the electronic structure, and opens the door
for large-scale mean-field calculations for similar d-electron quantum
materials.

number of $G$, $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$, and $\omega(G)$ is the
clique number of $G$. As evidence for his conjecture, he proved an ""epsilon
version"" of it, i.e. that there exists some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that
$\chi(G) \leq (1 - \varepsilon)(\Delta(G) + 1) + \varepsilon\omega(G)$. It is
natural to ask if Reed's conjecture or an epsilon version of it is true for the
list-chromatic number. In this paper we consider a ""local version"" of the
list-coloring version of Reed's conjecture. Namely, we conjecture that if $G$
is a graph with list-assignment $L$ such that for each vertex $v$ of $G$,
$|L(v)| \geq \lceil \frac{1}{2}(d(v) + 1 + \omega(v))\rceil$, where $d(v)$ is
the degree of $v$ and $\omega(v)$ is the size of the largest clique containing
$v$, then $G$ is $L$-colorable. Our main result is that an ""epsilon version"" of
this conjecture is true, under some mild assumptions.
  Using this result, we also prove a significantly improved lower bound on the
density of $k$-critical graphs with clique number less than $k/2$, as follows.
For every $\alpha > 0$, if $\varepsilon \leq \frac{\alpha^2}{1350}$, then if
$G$ is an $L$-critical graph for some $k$-list-assignment $L$ such that
$\omega(G) < (\frac{1}{2} - \alpha)k$ and $k$ is sufficiently large, then $G$
has average degree at least $(1 + \varepsilon)k$. This implies that for every
$\alpha > 0$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that if $G$ is a graph with
$\omega(G)\leq (\frac{1}{2} - \alpha)\mathrm{mad}(G)$, where $\mathrm{mad}(G)$
is the maximum average degree of $G$, then $\chi_\ell(G) \leq \left\lceil (1 -

overdetermined least-squares problems, where the preconditioners are based on a
random embedding of the data matrix. We consider two distinct approaches: the
sketch is either computed once (fixed preconditioner), or, the random
projection is refreshed at each iteration, i.e., sampled independently of
previous ones (varying preconditioners). Although fixed sketching-based
preconditioners have received considerable attention in the recent literature,
little is known about the performance of refreshed sketches. For a fixed
sketch, we characterize the optimal iterative method, that is, the
preconditioned conjugate gradient as well as its rate of convergence in terms
of the subspace embedding properties of the random embedding. For refreshed
sketches, we provide a closed-form formula for the expected error of the
iterative Hessian sketch (IHS), a.k.a. preconditioned steepest descent. In
contrast to the guarantees and analysis for fixed preconditioners based on
subspace embedding properties, our formula is exact and it involves the
expected inverse moments of the random projection. Our main technical
contribution is to show that this convergence rate is, surprisingly,
unimprovable with heavy-ball momentum. Additionally, we construct the locally
optimal first-order method whose convergence rate is bounded by that of the
IHS. Based on these theoretical and numerical investigations, we do not observe
that the additional randomness of refreshed sketches provides a clear advantage
over a fixed preconditioner. Therefore, we prescribe PCG as the method of
choice along with an optimized sketch size according to our analysis. Our
prescribed sketch size yields state-of-the-art computational complexity for
solving highly overdetermined linear systems. Lastly, we illustrate the
numerical benefits of our algorithms.

software requirement structural invariants, with entities and their
relationships. Those invariants can then have their consistency evaluated by
the Alloy Analyzer, based on a mapping semantics we provide for transforming
GIRL models into Alloy specifications with no user intervention. With a
prototypical language editor and transformations implemented into an Eclipse
plugin, we carried out a qualitative study with requirement analysts working
for a government software company in Brazil, to evaluate usability and
effectiveness of the GIRL-based analysis of real software requirements. The
participants were able to effectively use the underlying formal analysis, since
79 out of 80 assigned invariants were correctly modeled. While participants
perceived as low the complexity of learning and using GIRL's simplest,
set-based structures and relationships, the most complex logical structures,
such as quantification and implication, were challenging. Furthermore, almost
all post-study evaluations from the participants were positive, especially as a
tool for discovering requirement inconsistencies.

target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related

application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising
area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and
impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in
a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning.
Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary
and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey
attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches,
as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of
transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better
understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous
surveys, this survey paper reviews more than forty representative transfer
learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from
the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are
also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer
learning models, over twenty representative transfer learning models are used
for experiments. The models are performed on three different datasets, i.e.,
Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. And the experimental results
demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models

is possible to separate the influence of geometry, as expressed by the
curvatures and torsions of the field line of a dislocation on the fault

allows us to shed new light on the mechanical effects of geometrical
complexities on the fault surface, with the key parameters being the curvatures

effects sorted by impact groups (GATES) for non-randomised experiments. The
groups can be understood as a broader aggregation of the conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) where the number of groups is set in advance. In
economics, this approach is similar to pre-analysis plans. Observational
studies are standard in policy evaluation from labour markets, educational
surveys and other empirical studies. To control for a potential selection-bias,
we implement a doubly-robust estimator in the first stage. We use machine
learning methods to learn the conditional mean functions as well as the
propensity score. The group average treatment effect is then estimated via a
linear projection model. The linear model is easy to interpret, provides
p-values and confidence intervals, and limits the danger of finding spurious
heterogeneity due to small subgroups in the CATE. To control for confounding in
the linear model, we use Neyman-orthogonal moments to partial out the effect
that covariates have on both, the treatment assignment and the outcome. The
result is a best linear predictor for effect heterogeneity based on impact
groups. We find that our proposed method has lower absolute errors as well as
smaller bias than the benchmark doubly-robust estimator. We further introduce a
bagging type averaging for the CATE function for each observation to avoid
biases through sample splitting. The advantage of the proposed method is a
robust linear estimation of heterogeneous group treatment effects in
observational studies.

mixing. We first observe that words in a sentence are often related to multiple
domains. Hence, we assume each word has a domain proportion, which indicates
its domain preference. Then word representations are obtained by mixing their
embedding in individual domains based on their domain proportions. We show this
can be achieved by carefully designing multi-head dot-product attention modules
for different domains, and eventually taking weighted averages of their
parameters by word-level layer-wise domain proportions. Through this, we can
achieve effective domain knowledge sharing, and capture fine-grained
domain-specific knowledge as well. Our experiments show that our proposed model

show that for such systems the higher mode content will be important for
interpreting coalescing binary black holes, reducing systematic bias, and
computing properties of the remnant object. Even for comparable-mass binaries
and at low signal amplitude, the omission of higher modes can influence
posterior probability distributions. We discuss the impact of our results on

This effect suggests that CMEs tend to propagate within a small cone about the

necessary for scientific impact and hence prefer to fund novel instead of
incremental projects. Evidence linking novelty and the eventual impact of a

920,000 publications funded by 170,000 grants from the National Science
Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 2008 and
2016. We use machine learning to quantify grant novelty at the time of funding

results show that grant novelty leads to robust increases in citations while
controlling for the principal investigator's grant experience, award amount,
year of publication, prestige of the journal, and team size. All else held
constant, an article resulting from a fully-novel grant would on average double
the citations of a fully-incremental grant. We also find that novel grants
produce as many articles as incremental grants while publishing in higher
prestige journals. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence
supporting NSF, NIH, and many other funding agencies' emphases on novelty.

linear traffic model is augmented with a novel non-local boundary condition
representing car influx due to the use of routing apps such as Google Maps and
Waze. The routing apps act as real-time previews for highway traffic,
introducing potentially destabilizing feedback in the app-based navigation
decision process, necessitating the development of a feedback controller. We
first study small-time H^1 solutions of the linearized model with the addition
of the app-routing for sufficiently small initial data. We introduce an
extended, multi-tiered boundary control design based upon the method of
infinite-dimensional backstepping. Using an intermediate decoupling
transformation, we account for the non-local boundary condition arising from
routing app feedback. We study the existence of the extended backstepping
method by characterizing the existence of the companion kernels associated with
the backstepping method. Finally, we study the linear ARZ model with the
app-routing extension under the designed feedback, and show that for
sufficiently small H^1 data, the equilibrium congestion solution is
exponentially stable and guarantees the existence of closed-loop solutions on

implementations. We propose a novel forward-backward scan algorithm that
reduces the computation costs to $O(n)$. The proposed method applies to both
unpenalized and penalized estimation for the PSH model and has exhibited
drastic speedups over current implementations. Finally, combining the two
algorithms can yields $>1,000$ fold speedups over the original BAR algorithm.

diameter) moon Enceladus are concentrated along a series of lineaments known as
the `tiger stripes', thought to be partially open fissures that connect to the
liquid water ocean beneath the ice shell. Whereas aspects of the tiger stripes
have been addressed in previous work, no study to date simultaneously explains
why they should be located only at the south pole, why there are multiple
approximately parallel and regularly spaced fractures, and what accounts for
their spacing of ~35 km. Here we propose that secular cooling and the resulting
ice shell thickening and global tensile stresses cause the first fracture to
form at one of the poles, where the ice shell is thinnest due to tidal heating.
The tensile stresses are thereby partially relieved, preventing a similar
failure at the opposite pole. We propose that subsequent activity then
concentrates in the vicinity of the first fracture as the steadily erupted
water ice loads the flanks of the open fissure, causing bending in the
surrounding elastic plate and further tensile failure in bands parallel to the
first fracture, leading to a cascading sequence of parallel fissures until the
conditions no longer permit through-going fractures.

variations due to external factors and Gaussian noise is added to reflect
random noise in the environment. After evaluating the localization error on

range of machine learning and computer vision tasks (i.e., classification,

methods yet to achieve domain adaptation directly on 3D point cloud data. The
unique challenge of point cloud data lies in its abundant spatial geometric
information, and the semantics of the whole object is contributed by including
regional geometric structures. Specifically, most general-purpose DA methods
that struggle for global feature alignment and ignore local geometric
information are not suitable for 3D domain alignment. In this paper, we propose
a novel 3D Domain Adaptation Network for point cloud data (PointDAN). PointDAN
jointly aligns the global and local features in multi-level. For local
alignment, we propose Self-Adaptive (SA) node module with an adjusted receptive
field to model the discriminative local structures for aligning domains. To
represent hierarchically scaled features, node-attention module is further
introduced to weight the relationship of SA nodes across objects and domains.
For global alignment, an adversarial-training strategy is employed to learn and
align global features across domains. Since there is no common evaluation
benchmark for 3D point cloud DA scenario, we build a general benchmark (i.e.,
PointDA-10) extracted from three popular 3D object/scene datasets (i.e.,
ModelNet, ShapeNet and ScanNet) for cross-domain 3D objects classification
fashion. Extensive experiments on PointDA-10 illustrate the superiority of our
model over the state-of-the-art general-purpose DA methods.

systems, the available categorical features (e.g., product type) are often of

Factorization Machines (FMs) are capable of modelling high-order interactions
among features for effective sparse predictive analytics. As the volume of
web-scale data grows exponentially over time, sparse predictive analytics
inevitably involves dynamic and sequential features. However, existing FM-based
models assume no temporal orders in the data, and are unable to capture the
sequential dependencies or patterns within the dynamic features, impeding the
performance and adaptivity of these methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose a
novel Sequence-Aware Factorization Machine (SeqFM) for temporal predictive
analytics, which models feature interactions by fully investigating the effect
of sequential dependencies. As static features (e.g., user gender) and dynamic
features (e.g., user interacted items) express different semantics, we
innovatively devise a multi-view self-attention scheme that separately models
the effect of static features, dynamic features and the mutual interactions
between static and dynamic features in three different views. In SeqFM, we
further map the learned representations of feature interactions to the desired
output with a shared residual network. To showcase the versatility and
generalizability of SeqFM, we test SeqFM in three popular application scenarios
for FM-based models, namely ranking, classification and regression tasks.
Extensive experimental results on six large-scale datasets demonstrate the
superior effectiveness and efficiency of SeqFM.

particularly when the data are multivariate. The main idea is to pre-calculate
the optimal projection directions given the variable dimension, and to project
multidimensional variables onto these pre-specified projection directions; by
subsequently utilizing the fast algorithm that is developed in Huo and
Sz\'ekely [2016] for the univariate variables, the computational complexity can
be improved from $O(m^2)$ to $O(n m \cdot \mbox{log}(m))$, where $n$ is the
number of projection directions and $m$ is the sample size. When $n \ll
m/\log(m)$, computational savings can be achieved. The key challenge is how to
find the optimal pre-specified projection directions. This can be obtained by
minimizing the worse-case difference between the true distance and the
approximated distance, which can be formulated as a nonconvex optimization
problem in a general setting. In this paper, we show that the exact solution of
the nonconvex optimization problem can be derived in two special cases: the
dimension of the data is equal to either $2$ or the number of projection
directions. In the generic settings, we propose an algorithm to find some
approximate solutions. Simulations confirm the advantage of our method, in
comparison with the pure Monte Carlo approach, in which the directions are

various radiative cooling processes, namely bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and
Comtonization processes, respectively. To account for the magnetic contribution
inside the disc, we consider the toroidal magnetic fields which are assumed to
be dominant over other components. Moreover, we adopt the relativistic equation
of state to describe the thermal characteristics of the flow. With this, we
calculate the global transonic accretion solutions around the rotating black

harbor shock wave provided the standing shock conditions are satisfied.
Further, we investigate the shock properties, such as shock location ($x_s$)

polaritons (TPPs) to temperature sensing for the first time. Based on an
analogy of the topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, TPPs
are realized in a one-dimensional intrinsic indium antimonide (InSb)
microsphere chain. The existence of TPPs is demonstrated by analyzing the
topology of the photonic band structures and the eigenmode distribution. By
exploiting the temperature dependence of the permittivity of InSb in the
terahertz range, the resonance frequency of the TPPs can be largely tuned by
the temperature. Moreover, it is shown that the temperature sensitivity of the
TPP resonance frequency can be as high as $0.0264~\mathrm{THz/K}$ at room
temperature, leading to a figure of merit over 150. By calculating the LDOS
near the chain, we further demonstrate that the temperature sensitivity of TPPs
is experimentally detectable via near-field probing techniques. This
sensitivity is robust since TPPs are highly protected modes immune to disorder
and can achieve a strong confinement of radiation. We envisage these TPPs can
be utilized as promising candidates for robust and enhanced temperature
sensing.

investigating the accuracy of each subnuclear group while using receptive

signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is known to be limited by the presence of certain
sub-graphs that exist in the Tanner graph representation of the code, for
example trapping sets and absorbing sets. This paper derives a lower bound on
the frame error rate (FER) of any LDPC code containing a given problematic
sub-graph, assuming a particular message passing decoder and decoder
quantization. A crucial aspect of the lower bound is that it is
code-independent, in the sense that it can be derived based only on a
problematic sub-graph and then applied to any code containing it. Due to the
complexity of evaluating the exact bound, assumptions are proposed to
approximate it, from which we can estimate decoder performance. Simulated
results obtained for both the quantized sum-product algorithm (SPA) and the
quantized min-sum algorithm (MSA) are shown to be consistent with the
approximate bound and the corresponding performance estimates. Different
classes of LDPC codes, including both structured and randomly constructed

in randomized trials, but they also complicate statistical inference. For
example, it is now well known that the sample mean is biased in adaptive
trials. Inferential challenges are exacerbated when our parameter of interest
differs from the parameter the trial was designed to target, such as when we
are interested in estimating the value of a sub-optimal treatment after running
a trial to determine the optimal treatment using a stochastic bandit design. In
this context, typical estimators that use inverse propensity weighting to
eliminate sampling bias can be problematic: their distributions become skewed
and heavy-tailed as the propensity scores decay to zero. In this paper, we
present a class of estimators that overcome these issues. Our approach is to
adaptively reweight the terms of an augmented inverse propensity weighting
estimator to control the contribution of each term to the estimator's variance.
This adaptive weighting scheme prevents estimates from becoming heavy-tailed,
ensuring asymptotically correct coverage. It also reduces variance, allowing us
to test hypotheses with greater power - especially hypotheses that were not
targeted by the experimental design. We validate the accuracy of the resulting
estimates and their confidence intervals in numerical experiments and show our
methods compare favorably to existing alternatives in terms of RMSE and
coverage.

  Usually, $m\ll n$. The problem is also known as the constrained eigenvalue
problem in the literature because it becomes an eigenvalue problem if the
linear constraint $C^{T}x=b$ is removed. We start by equivalently transforming
CRQopt into an optimization problem, called LGopt, of minimizing the Lagrangian
multiplier of CRQopt, and then an problem, called QEPmin, of finding the
smallest eigenvalue of a quadratic eigenvalue problem. Although such
equivalences has been discussed in the literature, it appears to be the first
time that these equivalences are rigorously justified. Then we propose to
numerically solve LGopt and QEPmin by the Krylov subspace projection method via
the Lanczos process. The basic idea, as the Lanczos method for the symmetric
eigenvalue problem, is to first reduce LGopt and QEPmin by projecting them onto
Krylov subspaces to yield problems of the same types but of much smaller sizes,
and then solve the reduced problems by some direct methods, which is either a
secular equation solver (in the case of LGopt) or an eigensolver (in the case
of QEPmin). The resulting algorithm is called the Lanczos algorithm. We perform
convergence analysis for the proposed method and obtain error bounds. The
sharpness of the error bound is demonstrated by artificial examples, although
in applications the method often converges much faster than the bounds suggest.

the resonant argument, and a decrease in time of temporary capture due to the
Lorentz force. Variations in the orbital planes of dust grain orbits are found

Mining communities that are bursting in a
period of time is essential to seek emergency events in temporal graphs.
Unfortunately, most previous studies for community mining in temporal networks
ignore the bursting patterns of communities. In this paper, we are the first to
study a problem of seeking bursting communities in a temporal graph. We propose
a novel model, called (l, {\delta})-maximal dense core, to represent a bursting
community in a temporal graph. Specifically, an (l, {\delta})-maximal dense
core is a temporal subgraph in which each node has average degree no less than
{\delta} in a time segment with length no less than l. To compute the (l,
{\delta})-maximal dense core, we first develop a novel dynamic programming
algorithm which can calculate the segment density efficiently. Then, we propose
an improved algorithm with several novel pruning techniques to further improve
the efficiency. In addition, we also develop an efficient algorithm to
enumerate all (l, {\delta})-maximal dense cores that are not dominated by the
others in terms of the parameters l and {\delta}. The results of extensive
experiments on 9 real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency
and scalability of our algorithms.

the superlens based on the plasmonic effect can resonantly amplify evanescent

have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the arbitrary

dispersion-induced effective plasmons in a bounded waveguide structure. Based
on this, we constructed the hyperbolic metamaterials and experimentally
verified its validity in the microwave range by the directional propagation and
imaging with a resolution of 0.087 wavelength. We have also demonstrated that
the imaging potential can be extended to terahertz and infrared bands. The
proposed method can break the conventional barriers of plasmon-based lenses and
bring new possibilities to the field of superresolution imaging from microwave

proportional to the WTEC index with a factor of $1.5min^{-1}$. At small levels
of ionospheric disturbance (for WTEC < 0.1 TECU), this proportionality is
violated. It is shown that the contribution of daily dynamics of the background

higher sensitivity of the WTEC index to disturbances. This also leads to
violating the proportionality between WTEC and AATR indices at low levels of

query, to find the closest one to a given query point among a set of points, is
widely used in applications such as density estimation, pattern classification,
information retrieval and spatial analysis. A direct generalization of the NN
query is the k nearest neighbors (kNN) query, where the k closest point are
required to be found. Since NN and kNN problems were raised, many algorithms
have been proposed to solve them. It has been indicated in literature that the
only method to solve these problems exactly with sublinear time complexity, is
to filter out the unnecessary spatial computation by using the pre-processing
structure, commonly referred to as the spatial index. The recently proposed
spatial indices available for NN search, are almost constructed through spatial
partition. These indices are tree-like, and the tree-like hierarchical
structure can usually significantly improve the efficiency of NN search.
However, when the data are distributed extremely unevenly, it is difficult to
satisfy both the balance of the tree and the non-overlap of the subspace
corresponding to the nodes. Thus the acceleration performance of the tree-like
indices is severely jeopardized. In this paper, we propose a non-tree spatial
index which consists of multiple layers of Voronoi diagrams (MVD). This index
can entirely avoid the dilemma tree-like structures face, and solve the NN
problems stably with logarithmic time complexity. Furthermore, it is convenient
to achieve kNN search by extending NN search on MVD. In the experiments, we
evaluate the efficiency of this indexing for both NN search and kNN search by
comparing with VoR-tree, R-tree and kd-tree. The experiments indicate that
compared to NN search and kNN search with the other three indices, these two
search methods have significantly higher efficiency with MVD.

annotations of data through an online platform. Crowd workers with different
expertise are paid for their service, and the task requester usually has a
limited budget. How to collect reliable annotations for multi-label data and
how to compute the consensus within budget is an interesting and challenging,
but rarely studied, problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
accomplish Active Multi-label Crowd Consensus (AMCC). AMCC accounts for the
commonality and individuality of workers, and assumes that workers can be
organized into different groups. Each group includes a set of workers who share
a similar annotation behavior and label correlations. To achieve an effective
multi-label consensus, AMCC models workers' annotations via a linear
combination of commonality and individuality, and reduces the impact of
unreliable workers by assigning smaller weights to the group. To collect
reliable annotations with reduced cost, AMCC introduces an active crowdsourcing
learning strategy that selects sample-label-worker triplets. In a triplet, the
selected sample and label are the most informative for the consensus model, and
the selected worker can reliably annotate the sample with low cost. Our
experimental results on multi-label datasets demonstrate the advantages of AMCC
over state-of-the-art solutions on computing crowd consensus and on reducing
the budget by choosing cost-effective triplets.

of the CO luminosities ($L_{\rm CO(1-0)}$) with the mid-infrared luminosities
at 12 ($L_{12 \mu m}$) and 22 $\mu$m ($L_{\rm 22 \mu m}$), as well as the
dependence of the residuals on a variety of galaxy properties. The correlation
with $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$ is tighter and more linear, but galaxies with
relatively low stellar masses and blue colors fall significantly below the mean
$L_{\rm CO(1-0)}-L_{\rm 12\mu m}$ relation. We propose a new estimator of the
CO(1-0) luminosity (and thus the total molecular gas mass) that is a linear
combination of three parameters: $L_{\rm 12 \mu m}$, $M_\ast$ and $g-r$. We
show that, with a scatter of only 0.18 dex in log $(L_{\rm CO(1-0)})$, this
estimator provides unbiased estimates for galaxies of different properties and
types. An immediate application of this estimator to a compiled sample of
galaxies with only CO(J=2-1) observations yields a distribution of the
CO(J=2-1) to CO(J=1-0) luminosity ratios ($R21$) that agrees well with the
distribution of real observations, in terms of both the median and the shape.
Application of our estimator to the current MaNGA sample reveals a gas-poor
population of galaxies that are predominantly early-type and show no
correlation between molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio and star formation
rate, in contrast to gas-rich galaxies. We also provide alternative estimators
with similar scatters, based on $r$ and/or $z$ band luminosities instead of
$M_\ast$. These estimators serve as cheap and convenient $M_{\rm mol}$ proxies
to be potentially applied to large samples of galaxies, thus allowing
statistical studies of gas-related processes of galaxies.

e.g.~dissociative recombination of O$_2^+$, this is only true until the EUV
level reaches 10 times the present EUV flux, and then the rates start to
decrease. Furthermore, our results show that Mars could not have had a dense
atmosphere at the end of the Noachian epoch, since such an atmosphere would not
have been able to escape until today. In the pre-Noachian era, most of a magma
ocean and volcanic activity related outgassed CO$_2$ atmosphere could have been
lost thermally until the Noachian epoch, when non-thermal loss processes such
as suprathermal atom escape became dominant. Thus, early Mars could have been
hot and wet during the pre-Noachian era with surface CO$_2$ pressures larger
than 1 bar during the first 300 Myr after the planet's origin.

an approximation that not only minimizes the collage error but also maximizes

parameter estimation minimization problem can be understood as a multiple

generalized collage error, the entropy associated with the unknown parameters,

vitrification based on the density fluctuation dynamics for fragile
glass-forming liquids. (i) The relaxation of density fluctuations proceeds by
the particle (density) exchange process, and is diffusive; that is, the
allowable kinetic paths are strongly restricted by the local conservation law.
(ii) In normal liquid states, this exchange process is less cooperative, and
the diffusion coefficient of density fluctuations $D_c$ is given as $D_c\sim
\lambda^2/\tau_\alpha$, where $\lambda$ is the particle size and $\tau_\alpha$
is the structural relaxation time. On the other hand, in supercooled states the
restriction on the kinetic path is more severe with increasing the degree of
supercooling, which makes the exchange process more cooperative, resulting in
$D_c \sim \xi_{\rm d}^2/\tau_\alpha$ with $\xi_{\rm d}$ being the cooperative
length scale. (iii) The molecular dynamics simulation results show that the
self-diffusion coefficient of the tagged particle, $D_s$, almost coincides with
$D_c$, suggesting that the collective density diffusion and the particle
diffusion closely share the same mechanism: in normal states $D_s$ determines
$D_c$, but vice versa in supercooled states. This immediately leads to the idea
that the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation is not the anomaly in the
single-particle dynamics but reflects the increase in the cooperativity in the
density diffusion at the length scale of $\xi_{\rm d}$.

a smoothing trajectory strategy with the ability to handle moving scenes. We
use a two-step adaptive image alignment algorithm to find the canonical view of

can compare with the human annotation. With the experimental results, we can
get more consistent trajectories. At a certain degree, it can also slightly
improve the trained model. If go beyond a certain threshold, the smoothing

systems for fundamental and nuclear structure research, an analytic energy
derivative approach is presented in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory
framework to determine the atomic field shift and mass shift factors. This
approach allows the determination of expectation values of atomic operators,
overcoming fundamental problems that are present in existing atomic physics
methods, i.e. it satisfies the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, does not involve any
non-terminating series, and is free from choice of any perturbative parameter.
As a proof of concept, the developed analytic response relativistic
coupled-cluster theory has been applied to determine mass shift and field shift
factors for different atomic states of indium. High-precision isotope-shift
measurements of $^{104-127}$In were performed in the 246.8-nm (5p $^2$P$_{3/2}$

conventional resonant RF spin flippers, which employ an air core. High fields
are crucial for the construction of a high resolution and compact MIEZE

demonstrated that the pole shoe/solenoid coil RF flippers can achieve a MIEZE

highest obtained modulation frequency was 100 kHz.

been treated and presented in the Conference AO4ELT6:
  1. ALTA is an operational forecast system for the OT and all the critical
atmospheric parameters affecting the astronomical ground-based observations
conceived for the LBT. It operates since 2016 and it is in continuous evolution
to match with necessities/requirements of instruments assisted by AO of the LBT
(SOUL, SHARK-NIR, SHARK-VIS, LINC-NIRVANA,...). In this contribution, we
present a new implemented version of ALTA that, thanks to an auto-regression
method making use of numerical forecasts and real-time OT measurements taken in

astroclimatic parameters) never achieved before on time scales of the order of
a few hours.
  2. We will go through the main differences between optical turbulence
forecast performed with mesoscale and general circulation models (GCM) by
clarifying some fundamental concepts and by correcting some erroneous

existence of finite energy traveling waves for almost every value of the speed
in the subsonic range. Our argument works identically well in dimensions 2 and
3.
  With this result in hand, a compactness argument could fill the range of
admissible speeds. We are able to do so in dimension 3, recovering the
aforementioned result by Maris. The planar case turns out to be more difficult
and the compactness argument works only under an additional assumption on the

times between any two space regions, no matter how far apart. This justifies
inflationary scenarios starting from a quasi-homogeneous scalar field close to

presents a new theoretical framework for describing, in an idealized annular
combustor, the dynamics of the slow-flow variables, which define the state of
an eigenmode, i.e. if the latter is standing, spinning or mixed. The acoustic
pressure is expressed as a hypercomplex field and this ansatz is inserted into
a one dimensional wave equation that describes the thermoacoustics of a thin

classic Krylov-Bogoliubov method to the quaternion field in order to derive a
system of coupled first order differential equations for the four slow-flow

the temporal phase of the azimuthal thermoacoustic mode. The state of the mode
can be conveniently depicted by using the first three slow-flow variables as
spherical coordinates for a Bloch sphere representation. Stochastic forcing
from the turbulence in annular combustors is also accounted for. This new

resulting multi-grain structures: (i) trijunctions may be singular; (ii) for
each pair of grains, there exist two different grain boundary solutions that
cannot continuously transform to one another; (iii) if both solutions appear
along a grain boundary, a topologically stable, singular point defect must
exist between them. While (i) can, (ii) and therefore (iii) cannot be

singularities cause difficulties, such as lattice pinning in numerical
simulations. To overcome these problems, we propose two new formulations of the

predicts correlated variability across all wavebands, but cross-band time lags
depending on the type of blazar (FSRQ vs. BL Lac), as well as distinctive
spectral hysteresis patterns in all wavelength bands, from mm radio waves to
gamma-rays. These evolutionary signatures serve to provide diagnostics on the
competition between acceleration and radiative cooling.

At variance with
smaller clusters of stars, they exhibit signs of some chemical evolution. At
least for this reason, they are intermediate between open clusters and massive
objects such as nuclear clusters or compact galaxies. While some facts are well
established, the increasing amount of observational data are revealing a
complexity that has so far defied the attempts to interpret the whole data set
in a simple scenario. We review this topic focusing on the main observational
features of clusters in the Milky Way and its satellites. We find that most of
the observational facts related to the chemical evolution in globular clusters
are described as being primarily a function of the initial mass of the
clusters, tuned by further dependence on the metallicity - that mainly affects
specific aspects of the nucleosynthesis processes involved - and on the
environment, that likely determines the possibility of indepenedent chemical
evolution of the fragments or satellites, where the clusters form. We review
the impact of multiple populations on different regions of the colour-magnitude
diagram and underline the constraints related to the observed abundances of
lithium, to the cluster dynamics, and to the frequency of binaries in stars of
different chemical composition. We then re-consider the issues related to the
mass budget and the relation between globular cluster and field stars. Any
successful model of globular cluster formation should explain these facts.

different fixed temperatures is studied for fixed Prandtl number Pr=1.07.
Depending on the angle of inclination and the imposed temperature difference,
the flow exhibits a large variety of self-organized spatio-temporal convection
patterns. Close to onset, these patterns have been explained in terms of linear
stability analysis of primary and secondary flow states. At larger temperature
difference, far beyond onset, experiments and simulations show complex,
dynamically evolving patterns that are not described by stability analysis and
remain to be explained. Here we employ a dynamical systems approach. We
construct stable and unstable exact invariant states, including equilibria and
periodic orbits of the fully nonlinear three-dimensional Oberbeck-Boussinesq
equations. These invariant states underlie the observed convection patterns
beyond their onset. We identify state-space trajectories that, starting from
the unstable laminar flow, follow a sequence of dynamical connections between
unstable invariant states until the dynamics approaches a stable attractor.
Together, the network of dynamically connected invariant states mediates
temporal transitions between coexisting invariant states and thereby supports
the observed complex time-dependent dynamics in inclined layer convection.

providing natural speech frames to the decoder, that serves as a teacher model.
We then train another Tacotron2-based model as a student model, of which the
decoder takes the predicted speech frames as input, similar to how the decoder
works during run-time inference. With the distillation loss, the student model
learns the output probabilities from the teacher model, that is called
knowledge distillation. Experiments show that our proposed training scheme

self-absorption, the opacity of cold atomic hydrogen may be high, and this gas
may constitute an important mass component of the interstellar medium (ISM).
Atomic hydrogen gas can be cooled to temperatures much lower than found in the
cold neutral medium (CNM) through collisions with molecular hydrogen. In this
paper, we search for HI Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA) features in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as an indicator of such cold HI clouds, and use the
results to quantify atomic masses and atomic-to-molecular gas ratio. Our search
for HINSA features was conducted towards molecular clouds in the LMC using the
ATCA+Parkes HI survey and the MAGMA CO survey. HINSA features are prevalent in
the surveyed sightlines. This is the first detection of HINSA in an external
galaxy. The HINSA-HI/$\rm{H}_{2}$ ratio in the LMC varies from 0.5\e{-3} to
3.4\e{-3} (68\% interval), with a mean value of $(1.31 \pm 0.03)$\e{-3}, after
correcting for the effect of foreground HI gas. This is similar to the Milky
Way value and indicates that similar fractions of cold gas exist in the LMC and
the Milky Way, despite their differing metallicities, dust content and
radiation fields. The low ratio also confirms that, as with the Milky Way, the
formation timescale of molecular clouds is short. The ratio shows no radial
gradient, unlike the case for stellar metallicity. No correlation is found
between our results and those from previous HI absorption studies of the LMC.

with the severe data imbalance issue: negative examples significantly outnumber
positive examples, and the huge number of background examples (or easy-negative
examples) overwhelms the training. The most commonly used cross entropy (CE)
criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a
discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance
contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score
concerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice
loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced
NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sorensen-Dice coefficient or Tversky
index, which attaches similar importance to false positives and false
negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate
the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to
associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize
easy-negative examples.Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows
down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training.
With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost
on a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve
SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task; SOTA
results on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity
recognition task; along with competitive results on the tasks of machine
reading comprehension and paraphrase identification.

Synthetic Inertia (SI) provision from Wind Turbines (WTs) is proposed, which
eliminates the secondary frequency dip and allows the dynamics of SI from WTs
to be analytically integrated into the system frequency dynamics. Furthermore,
analytical system frequency constraints with SI provision from WTs are
developed and incorporated into a stochastic system scheduling model, which
enables the provision of SI from WTs to be dynamically optimized on a system
level. Several case studies are carried out on a Great Britain 2030 power
system with different penetration levels of wind generation and inclusion of
frequency response requirements in order to assess the performance of the
proposed model and analyze the influence of the improved SI control scheme on
the potential secondary frequency dip. The results demonstrate that the
inclusion of SI provision from WTs into UC can drastically impact the overall
system costs.

sharing is increasingly adopted, which is usually formulated as a generalized

experiments with three prosumers, and the scalability is tested by simulations
using 123 prosumers.

instrumented spinal surgery and can lead to reoperation. Purpose of this
observational and case-control study was to investigate the association of BMD
with the risk of reoperation following instrumented lumbar spinal fusion (LSF).
For the observational study, 81 patients were included who received LSF with
and without augmentation. For the case-control study, 18 patients who had
reoperation following LSF were matched to 26 patients who did not have
reoperation (matched by sex, age +/- 5 years, fused levels and
PMMA-augmentation). Opportunistic BMD screening was performed in perioperative
CT scans using asynchronous calibration. Mean BMD was compared between patients
with and without reoperation in augmented and non-augmented surgeries. In the
observational study, prevalence of osteoporosis (BMD < 80 mg/cc) was 29% in
non-augmented and 85% in augmented LSF. Seven of 48 patients with non-augmented
(15%) and 4 of 33 patients with augmented LSF (12%) had reoperation. In
non-augmented LSF, patients with reoperation had significantly lower BMD than
patients without reoperation (P = 0.005). The best cut-off to predict
reoperation after non-augmented LSF was BMD < 83.7 mg/cc. In the case-control
study, patients with reoperation presented numerically lower BMD of 78.8 +/-
33.1 mg/cc than patients without reoperation with BMD of 89.4 +/- 39.7 mg/cc (P
= 0.357). Despite much lower BMD surgeries with PMMA-augmentation showed no
higher reoperation rate compared to non-augmented surgeries. Patients with
reoperation following LSF showed slightly lower BMD compared to matched
patients without reoperation, but the difference was not statistically
significant. Opportunistic BMD screening can be performed in preoperative CT,
thus informing about osteoporotic bone, a potential risk factor of surgery
failure.

derivatives indicate a positive torque-luminosity correlation, that implies a
temporary accretion disc formation during the outburst. We also discover
several quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in company with their harmonics
whose centroid frequencies decrease as the source flux decays. The variation of
pulsed fraction and spectral power law index of the source with X-ray flux is
interpreted as the sign of transition from a critical to a sub-critical
accretion regime at the critical luminosity within the range of $6\times
10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $1.2\times 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Using
pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy, we show that the phases with higher flux

non-equilibrium system, in which both buoyancy and shear forces drive
spatio-temporally complex flow. As a function of the strength of thermal
driving and the angle of inclination, a multitude of convection patterns is
observed in experiments and numerical simulations. Several observed patterns
have been linked to exact invariant states of the fully nonlinear 3D
Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. These exact equilibria, traveling waves and
periodic orbits reside in state space and, depending on their stability
properties, are transiently visited by the dynamics or act as attractors. To
explain the dependence of observed convection patterns on control parameters,
we study the parameter dependence of the state space structure. Specifically,
we identify the bifurcations that modify the existence, stability and
connectivity of invariant states. We numerically continue exact invariant
states underlying spatially periodic convection patterns at Pr=1.07 under
changing control parameters for temperature difference between the walls and
inclination angle. The resulting state branches cover various inclinations from
horizontal layer convection to vertical layer convection and beyond. The
collection of all computed branches represents an extensive bifurcation network
connecting 16 different invariant states across control parameter values.
Individual bifurcation structures are discussed in detail and related to the
observed complex dynamics of individual convection patterns. Together, the
bifurcations and associated state branches indicate at what control parameter
values which invariant states coexist. This provides a nonlinear framework to
explain the multitude of complex flow dynamics arising in inclined layer
convection.

advanced driver assistance systems are being developed and introduced to the
market, including autonomous emergency braking and steering systems (AEBSS)
that autonomously perform braking or an evasive manoeuvre by steering in case
of a pending collision, in order to avoid the collision or mitigate its
severity. This study proposes a new prospective framework for quantifying
safety benefit of AEBSS for the protection of cyclists and pedestrians in terms
of saved lives and reduction in the number of people suffering serious
injuries. The core of the framework is a novel application of Bayesian
inference in such a way that prior information from counterfactual simulation
is updated with new observations from real-world testing of a prototype AEBSS.
As an illustration of the method, the framework is applied for safety benefit
assessment of the AEBSS developed in the European Union (EU) project PROSPECT.
In this application of the framework, counterfactual simulation results based
on the German In-Depth Accident Study Pre-Crash Matrix (GIDAS-PCM) data were
combined with results from real-world tests on proving grounds. The proposed
framework gives a systematic way for the combination of results from different
sources and can be considered for understanding the real-world benefit of new
AEBSS. Additionally, the Bayesian modelling approach used in this paper has a
great potential to be used in a wide range of other research studies.

to describe the materials with subwavelength periodicity is based on the
concept of effective material parameters, which can be rigorously derived
incorporating both local and nonlocal responses. However, to provide any
predictions relevant for applications, effective material parameters have to be
supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions. In this work, we provide a
comprehensive treatment of spatially dispersive bulk properties of multilayered
metamaterials as well as derive boundary conditions for the averaged fields. We
demonstrate that local bianisotropic model does not capture all the features
related to second-order nonlocal effects in the bulk of metamaterial. As we
prove, while the bulk response of multilayers does not depend on the unit cell
choice, effective boundary conditions are strongly sensitive to the sequence of
layers and multilayer termination. The developed theory provides a clear
interpretation of the recent experiments on the reflectance of all-dielectric
deeply subwavelength multilayers suggesting further avenues to experimentally
probe electromagnetic nonlocality in metamaterials.

which may be observed in the spectra of energetic cosmic rays. In the
background of such oscillating solutions gravitation repulsion between
finite-size objects becomes possible. Since the Lagrangian is a non-linear
function of curvature, equations of motion become of higher (4th) order and
exhibit very rich pattern of new physical effects. In particular, the evolution
of density perturbations is strongly different from that in General Relativity,
amplified due to both parametric resonance and anti-friction phenomena.

corresponding to a metal-to-insulator transition at 343 K in resistivity,
consistent with CDW formation and DFT results, but with large non-thermal
smearing of the spectra implying strong carrier scattering. At low
temperatures, the CDW picture is negated by the observation of a metallic Hall

interplay between electronic correlations and the presence of multiple narrow

provide accurate bounds on the parametric uncertainty, which are employed for
the construction of the tube in a robust MPC scheme. The resulting RAMPC

this paper, we provide similar conditions for a tube based formulation that is
parametrized using an incremental Lyapunov function, a scalar contraction rate

simple constructive designs for different RAMPC schemes with varying

entanglement witness that can detect entanglement through some local

fragile to lossy detectors. To avoid such difficulties,
measurement-device-independent entanglement witness based on a semi-quantum

witness to detect entanglement in a scenario where half of an entangled pair is
possessed by a single observer while the other half is with multiple observers
performing measurements sequentially, independently, and preserving

device-independently, both with equal and unequal sharpness quotients, are
higher than that obtained with standard and Bell inequality-based entanglement
detection methods, reflecting its robustness. The entanglement contents of the
sequentially shared states are also analyzed. Unlike other scenarios, our

conjectured to be computationally intractable. The average case hardness of
random $3$-SAT and other CSPs has broad and far-reaching implications on
problems in approximation, learning theory and cryptography.
  In this work, we show subexponential lower bounds on the size of linear
programming relaxations for refuting random instances of constraint
satisfaction problems. Formally, suppose $P : \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}$ is a
predicate that supports a $t-1$-wise uniform distribution on its satisfying
assignments. Consider the distribution of random instances of CSP $P$ with $m =
\Delta n$ constraints. We show that any linear programming extended formulation
that can refute instances from this distribution with constant probability must
have size at least
$\Omega\left(\exp\left(\left(\frac{n^{t-2}}{\Delta^2}\right)^{\frac{1-\nu}{k}}\right)\right)$
for all $\nu > 0$. For example, this yields a lower bound of size
$\exp(n^{1/3})$ for random $3$-SAT with a linear number of clauses.
  We use the technique of pseudocalibration to directly obtain extended
formulation lower bounds from the planted distribution. This approach bypasses
the need to construct Sherali-Adams integrality gaps in proving general LP
lower bounds. As a corollary, one obtains a self-contained proof of
subexponential Sherali-Adams LP lower bounds for these problems. We believe the

in terms of explanation. However, its usage has been limited due to the gap
with dense representations. Most NLP research progresses in recent years are
based on dense representations. Thus the desirable property of sparsity cannot
be leveraged. Inspired by Fourier Transformation, in this paper, we propose a
novel Semantic Transformation method to bridge the dense and sparse spaces,
which can facilitate the NLP research to shift from dense space to sparse space
or to jointly use both spaces. The key idea of the proposed approach is to use
a Forward Transformation to transform dense representations to sparse
representations. Then some useful operations in the sparse space can be
performed over the sparse representations, and the sparse representations can
be used directly to perform downstream tasks such as text classification and
natural language inference. Then, a Backward Transformation can also be carried
out to transform those processed sparse representations to dense
representations. Experiments using classification tasks and natural language
inference task show that the proposed Semantic Transformation is effective.

agnostic to data structure and only describe linear pairwise relationships, we
introduce the tensor-valued Gaussian distribution which caters for multilinear
interactions -- the linear relationship between fibers -- which is reflected by
the Kronecker separable structure of the mean and covariance. By virtue of the
statistical identifiability of the proposed distribution formulation, whereby
different parameter values strictly generate different probability
distributions, it is shown that the corresponding likelihood function can be
maximised analytically to yield the maximum likelihood estimator. For rigour,
the statistical consistency of the estimator is also demonstrated through
numerical simulations. The probabilistic framework is then generalised to
describe the joint distribution of multiple tensor-valued random variables,
whereby the associated mean and covariance exhibit a Khatri-Rao separable

peculiar properties in its morphologies of emission in the radio, optical and

bright limbs with prominent protrusions. Moreover, a filament has been detected
at the radio, optical and soft X-ray wavelengthes. The reason for these
peculiar features in the morphologies of the remnant is investigated using 3D
HD simulations. With the assumption that the supernova ejecta is evolved in the
ambient medium with a density discontinuity, the radius of the remnant's
boundary is smaller in the tenuous medium, and the shell consists of two
hemispheres with different radiuses. Along particular line of sights,
protrusions appear on the periphery of the remnants since the emission from the
edge of the hemisphere with a larger radius is located outside that from the
shell of the small hemisphere. Furthermore, the northwest filament of SN 1006
arises as a result of the intersection of the line of sight and the shocked
material near the edges of the two hemispheres. It can be concluded that the
features that the protrusions on the northeast and southwest limbs and the
northwest filament in the morphologies of SN 1006 can be reproduced as the

develop into hot rising sheets of fluid, with a component of radial flow
towards a central upwelling plume. The sheets form the ""spokes"" of the pattern,
and the plumes the ""hubs"". Such a pattern of flow is expected to occur beneath
plate interiors on Earth, but it remains a challenge to use observations to
place constraints on the convective planform of the mantle. Here we present
predictions of key surface observables (gravity, topography, and rates of melt

These models demonstrate that gravity and topography have only limited
sensitivity to the spokes, and mostly reflect the hubs (the rising and sinking
plumes). By contrast, patterns of melt generation are more sensitive to short
wavelength features in the flow. There is the potential to have melt generation
along the spokes, but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at
the hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is
sufficiently thin ($\lesssim 80$ km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently

receiving many research interests for learning graph-related tasks. While the
GCNs have been successfully applied to this problem, some caveats inherited
from classical deep learning still remain as open research topics in the
context of the node classification problem. One such inherited caveat is that
GCNs only consider the nodes that are a few propagations away from the labeled
nodes to classify them. However, taking only a few propagation steps away nodes
into account defeats the purpose of using the graph topological information in
the GCNs. To remedy this problem, the-state-of-the-art methods leverage the
network diffusion approaches, namely personalized page rank and its variants,
to fully account for the graph topology, {\em after} they use the Neural
Networks in the GCNs. However, these approaches overlook the fact that the
network diffusion methods favour high degree nodes in the graph, resulting in
the propagation of labels to unlabeled centralized, hub, nodes. To address this
biasing hub nodes problem, in this paper, we propose to utilize a
dimensionality reduction technique conjugate with personalized page rank so
that we can both take advantage from graph topology and resolve the hub node
favouring problem for GCNs. Here, our approach opens a new holistic road for
message passing phase of GCNs by suggesting the usage of other proximity
matrices instead of well-known Laplacian. Testing on two real-world networks
that are commonly used in benchmarking GCNs' performance for the node
classification context, we systematically evaluate the performance of the

statistical dependencies in neuroimaging and complex systems datasets. The
pairwise (or bivariate) transfer entropy from a source to a target node in a
network does not depend solely on the local source-target link weight, but on
the wider network structure that the link is embedded in. This relationship is
studied using a discrete-time linearly-coupled Gaussian model, which allows us
to derive the transfer entropy for each link from the network topology. It is
shown analytically that the dependence on the directed link weight is only a
first approximation, valid for weak coupling. More generally, the transfer
entropy increases with the in-degree of the source and decreases with the
in-degree of the target, indicating an asymmetry of information transfer
between hubs and low-degree nodes. In addition, the transfer entropy is
directly proportional to weighted motif counts involving common parents or
multiple walks from the source to the target, which are more abundant in
networks with a high clustering coefficient than in random networks. Our
findings also apply to Granger causality, which is equivalent to transfer
entropy for Gaussian variables. Moreover, similar empirical results on random
Boolean networks suggest that the dependence of the transfer entropy on the
in-degree extends to nonlinear dynamics.

assuming a weak barrier and applying the perturbation theory in the limit in
which the system is integrable and the solitary waves may be considered as
exact solitons. We do this in the case of negligible interspecies interactions,
and also when the nonlinearities are strongly asymmetric, allowing one to
neglect the self-interaction in one of the species. Then, we use systematic
simulations to study the transmissions of both components in regions outside
these approximations and, in particular, to compare numerical results with
their analytical countertparts. We concluded that there is an appreciable
parameter range where one component is almost entirely transmitted through the
barrier, while the other one is reflected. Excitation of internal vibrations in
the passing and rebounding solitons is explored too, with a conclusion that it
is weak in the regime of high-quality splitting.

work we present new low-frequency radio observations with the LOFAR Low-Band

resolution of 41'' and 6'' respectively. We compare these maps to VLA maps at
327 MHz and 1420 MHz, and detect the effect of low-frequency absorption in some
regions of the remnant due to the presence of free electrons along the
line-of-sight. We investigate two origins for the low-frequency free-free
absorption that we observe: external absorption from foreground, and internal
absorption from Tycho's unshocked ejecta. The external absorption could be due
to an ionised thin, diffuse cavity surrounding the SNR (although this cavity
would need to be very thin to comply with the neutral fraction required to
explain the remnant's optical lines), or it could be due to an over-ionised
molecular shell in the vicinity of the remnant. We note that possible ionising
sources are the X-ray emission from Tycho, its cosmic rays, or radiation from
Tycho's progenitor. For the internal absorption, we are limited by our
understanding of the spectral behaviour of the region at unabsorbed radio
frequencies. However, the observations are suggestive of free-free absorption
from unshocked ejecta inside Tycho's reverse shock.

calculations to study the phase diagram of free-standing, two-dimensional

correspond to borophene and $\mathrm{B_2O_3}$ sheets, respectively. Our results

exist. Intermediate compositions are heterogeneous mixtures of borophene and
$\mathrm{B_2O_3}$. Other hypothetical crystals such as $\mathrm{B_2O}$ are

into borophene and $\mathrm{B_2O_3}$. It is also shown that oxidizing borophene
inside the flakes is thermodynamically unfavorable over forming
$\mathrm{B_2O_3}$ at the edges. All findings can be rationalized by oxygen's
preference of two-fold coordination which is incompatible with higher in-plane
coordination numbers preferred by boron. These results agree well with recent
experiments and pave the way to understand the process of oxidation of
borophene and other two-dimensional materials.

substantial lateral distribution of Mn atoms across the layer, which is radial

retrieval where the query image is compared against the database of images and
its pose is inferred with the help of the retrieved images. The latter approach
assumes that images taken from the same places consists of the same landmarks

be learned using full supervision to be robust to different variations in
capture conditions like time of the day and weather. In this work, we introduce
a framework to enhance the performance of these retrieval based localization
methods by taking into account the additional information including GPS
coordinates and temporal neighbourhood of the images provided by the
acquisition process in addition to the descriptor similarity of pairs of images
in the reference or query database which is used traditionally for
localization. Our method constructs a graph based on this additional

expected, the amplitude of the $R_{N}I_c$ product is smaller than predicted by
theory. We also address the magnetic field dependence of the critical current.
The quasi-gaussian decay of the critical current with field expected of a long
narrow junction is observed for all superconducting contacts we used except for
aluminum. We present the striking non-monotonous effect of field on the
critical current of junctions with aluminum contacts, and analyze it in terms
of improved quasiparticle thermalization by a magnetic field.

require an assessment of how much a particular task is generating mental
workload on a user. This is necessary for understanding how those tasks,
operations, and activities can be improvised and made better suited for the
users so that they reduce the mental workload on the individual and the
operators can use them with ease and less difficulty. However, a particular
task can be gauged by a user as simple while for others it may be difficult.
Understanding the complexity of a particular task can only be done on user
level and we propose to do this by understanding the mental workload (MWL)
generated on an operator while performing a task which requires processing a
lot of information to get the task done. In this work, we have proposed an
experimental setup which replicates modern day workload on doing regular day
job tasks. We propose an approach to automatically evaluate the task complexity
perceived by an individual by using electroencephalogram (EEG) data of a user
during operation. Few crucial steps that are addressed in this work include
extraction and optimization of different features and selection of relevant
features for dimensionality reduction and using supervised machine learning
techniques. In addition to this, performance results of the classifiers are
compared using all features and also using only the selected features. From the
results, it can be inferred that machine learning algorithms perform better as
compared to traditional approaches for mental workload estimation.

neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for effective disease management and
delivery of medication and treatment. This research develops automatic clinical
monitoring techniques for PD, following treatment, using the novel application
of EAs. Specifically, the research question addressed was: Can accurate
monitoring of PD be achieved using EAs on rs-fMRI data for patients prescribed
Modafinil (typically prescribed for PD patients to relieve physical fatigue)?
Methods: This research develops novel clinical monitoring tools using data from
a controlled experiment where participants were administered Modafinil versus
placebo, examining the novel application of EAs to both map and predict the
functional connectivity in participants using rs-fMRI data. Specifically, CGP
was used to classify DCM analysis and timeseries data. Results were validated
with two other commonly used classification methods (ANN and SVM) and via
k-fold cross-validation. Results: Findings revealed a maximum accuracy of
74.57% for CGP. Furthermore, CGP provided comparable performance accuracy
relative to ANN and SVM. Nevertheless, EAs enable us to decode the classifier,
in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more easily than in
ANN and SVM. Conclusions: These findings underscore the applicability of both
DCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification technique for
brain imaging data with medical implications for medication monitoring.
Furthermore, classification of fMRI data for research typically involves
statistical modelling techniques being often hypothesis driven, whereas EAs use
data-driven explanatory modelling methods resulting in numerous benefits. DCM
analysis is novel for classification and advantageous as it provides
information on the causal links between different brain regions.

demonstrated that the band topology can be well characterized by the complex
Zak phase irrespective of the lattice constant and doping concentration. By
numerically solving the eigenmodes of a finite system, it is found that a
dimerized chain with a nonzero complex Zak phase supports nontrivial
topological eigenmodes localized over both edges. Moreover, by changing the
doping concentration of Si, it is possible to tune the resonance frequency of
the TPPs from far-infrared to near-infrared, and the localization length of the
edge modes are also modulated accordingly. Since these TPPs are highly

challenge, a novel neural network structure called Capsule Network has been
proposed, which introduces equivariance through capsules to significantly
enhance the learning ability for image segmentation and object detection. Due
to its requirement of performing a high volume of matrix operations, CapsNets
have been generally accelerated on modern GPU platforms that provide highly
optimized software library for common deep learning tasks. However, based on
our performance characterization on modern GPUs, CapsNets exhibit low
efficiency due to the special program and execution features of their routing
procedure, including massive unshareable intermediate variables and intensive
synchronizations, which are very difficult to optimize at software level. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid computing architecture design
named \textit{PIM-CapsNet}. It preserves GPU's on-chip computing capability for
accelerating CNN types of layers in CapsNet, while pipelining with an off-chip
in-memory acceleration solution that effectively tackles routing procedure's
inefficiency by leveraging the processing-in-memory capability of today's 3D

our design enables hierarchical improvements on CapsNet inference efficiency

such that the satisfaction of the safety constraints can be guaranteed. To
handle the large state dimension of such systems, an assume-guarantee contract
is used to break the large synthesis problem into smaller subproblems.
Parameterized signal temporal logic (pSTL) is used to formally describe the
behaviors of the subsystems, which we use as the template for the contract. We
show that robust control invariant sets (RCIs) for the subsystems can be
composed to form a robust control invariant set for the whole network system
under a valid assume-guarantee contract. An epigraph algorithm is proposed to
solve for a contract that is valid, ---an approach that has linear complexity
for sparse networks, which leads to a robust control invariant set for the
whole network system. Implemented with control barrier function (CBF), the
state of each subsystem is guaranteed to stay within the safe set. Furthermore,
we propose a contingency tube Model Predictive Control approach based on the
RCI, which is capable of handling severe contingencies, including topology
changes of the network. A power grid example is used to demonstrate the
proposed method. The simulation result includes both set point control and
contingency recovery, and the safety constraint is always satisfied.

changes due to sunlight exposition over time. Color fading is expected to be
non-decreasing as a function of time and stabilize eventually. These properties
can be expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the functions. We
propose a spatio-temporal model that takes this information into account by
jointly modeling the spatio-temporal process and its derivative process using
Gaussian processes (GPs). We fitted the proposed model to MFS data collected
from the surface of prehistoric rock art paintings. A multivariate covariance
function in a GP allows modeling trichromatic image color variables jointly
with spatial distances and time points variables as inputs to evaluate the
covariance structure of the data. We demonstrated that the colorimetric

modern accelerators for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The number of bits of the
numerical representation is set to the minimum precision that is able to retain
accuracy based on an offline profiling, and it is kept constant for DNN
inference.
  In this work, we explore the use of dynamic precision selection during DNN
inference. We focus on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which represent
the state-of-the-art networks for applications such as machine translation and
speech recognition. Unlike conventional DNNs, LSTM networks remember
information from previous evaluations by storing data in the LSTM cell state.
Our key observation is that the cell state determines the amount of precision
required: time steps where the cell state changes significantly require higher
precision, whereas time steps where the cell state is stable can be computed
with lower precision without any loss in accuracy.
  Based on this observation, we implement a novel hardware scheme that tracks
the evolution of the elements in the LSTM cell state and dynamically selects
the appropriate precision in each time step. For a set of popular LSTM
networks, our scheme selects the lowest precision for more than 66% of the
time, outperforming systems that fix the precision statically. We evaluate our
proposal on top of a modern accelerator highly optimized for LSTM computation,
and show that it provides 1.56x speedup and 23% energy savings on average
without any loss in accuracy. The extra hardware to determine the appropriate
precision represents a small area overhead of 8.8%.

phase grating. For example, the accelerating voltages of the X-ray tube are
supposed to be respectively set as 40 kV and 70 kV, with other energy spectra
being practically unusable for dual energy imaging. This system thus has low
flexibility and maneuverability in practical applications. In this work, dual

The advantage of this system is that, theoretically speaking, any two separated

contrast imaging is successfully performed when the accelerating voltages of
the X-ray tube are successively set as 40 kV and 50 kV. Our work increases the

""STABILIZER"". Given a tree of recursively clustered projects (using project
meta-data), STABILIZER promotes a model upwards if it performs best in the
lower clusters (stopping when the promoted model performs worse than the models
seen at a lower level).
  The number of models found by STABILIZER is minimal: one for defect
prediction (756 projects) and less than a dozen for project health (1628
projects). Hence, via STABILIZER, it is possible to find a few projects which
can be used for transfer learning and make conclusions that hold across
hundreds of projects at a time. Further, the models produced in this manner
offer predictions that perform as well or better than the prior
state-of-the-art.
  To the best of our knowledge, STABILIZER is order of magnitude faster than
the prior state-of-the-art transfer learners which seek to find conclusion
stability, and these case studies are the largest demonstration of the

considers transferability-based black-box attacks, where the attacker trains a
substitute model to approximate the target model, and then generates
adversarial examples from the substitute model to attack the target model.
Learning a good substitute model is critical to the success of these attacks,
but it requires a large number of queries to the target model. We propose a
novel framework which uses query synthesis based active learning to improve the
query efficiency in training the substitute model. Experiments on three

demonstrated that our method can improve the attack success rate with the same

achieve a desired attack performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work

  Question Answering",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-domain dialogue state tracking (DST) is a critical component for
conversational AI systems. The domain ontology (i.e., specification of domains,
slots, and values) of a conversational AI system is generally incomplete,
making the capability for DST models to generalize to new slots, values, and
domains during inference imperative. In this paper, we propose to model
multi-domain DST as a question answering problem, referred to as Dialogue State
Tracking via Question Answering (DSTQA). Within DSTQA, each turn generates a
question asking for the value of a (domain, slot) pair, thus making it
naturally extensible to unseen domains, slots, and values. Additionally, we use
a dynamically-evolving knowledge graph to explicitly learn relationships
between (domain, slot) pairs. Our model has a 5.80% and 12.21% relative
improvement over the current state-of-the-art model on MultiWOZ 2.0 and
MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets, respectively. Additionally, our model consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art model in domain adaptation settings. (Code is

MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991",,"ISBN 0-262-01114-X","cs.AI math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Normative expert systems have not become commonplace because they have been
difficult to build and use. Over the past decade, however, researchers have
developed the influence diagram, a graphical representation of a decision
maker's beliefs, alternatives, and preferences that serves as the knowledge
base of a normative expert system. Most people who have seen the representation
find it intuitive and easy to use. Consequently, the influence diagram has
overcome significantly the barriers to constructing normative expert systems.
Nevertheless, building influence diagrams is not practical for extremely large
and complex domains. In this book, I address the difficulties associated with
the construction of the probabilistic portion of an influence diagram, called a
knowledge map, belief network, or Bayesian network. I introduce two
representations that facilitate the generation of large knowledge maps. In
particular, I introduce the similarity network, a tool for building the network
structure of a knowledge map, and the partition, a tool for assessing the
probabilities associated with a knowledge map. I then use these representations
to build Pathfinder, a large normative expert system for the diagnosis of
lymph-node diseases (the domain contains over 60 diseases and over 100 disease
findings). In an early version of the system, I encoded the knowledge of the
expert using an erroneous assumption that all disease findings were
independent, given each disease. When the expert and I attempted to build a
more accurate knowledge map for the domain that would capture the dependencies
among the disease findings, we failed. Using a similarity network, however, we
built the knowledge-map structure for the entire domain in approximately 40
hours. Furthermore, the partition representation reduced the number of
probability assessments required by the expert from 75,000 to 14,000.

the Cosmological Horizon, produced by a static observer in four-dimensional de
Sitter (dS$_4$) spacetime. We consider a deformed extension of dS spacetime by
means of a single $\mathbb Z_q$ quotient, which resembles an Orbifold geometry.
The Orbifold parameter induces a pair of codimension two minimal surfaces given
by 2-spheres in the Euclidean geometry. Using dimensional reduction on the
two-dimensional plane where the minimal surfaces have support, we use the
Liouville field theory and the Kerr/CFT mechanism in order to describe the
underlying degrees of freedom of the Cosmological Horizon. We then show, that
in the large $q$-limit, this pair of codimensions two surfaces can be realized
as the conformal boundaries of dS$_3$. We notice that the central charge
obtained using Liouville theory, in the latter limit, corresponds to the
Strominger central charge obtained in the context of the dS/CFT correspondence.
In addition, a formulation of entanglement entropy for de Sitter spacetimes is
given in terms of dS holography and also a different approach in which the
entanglement between two disconnected bulk observers is described in terms of
the topology of the spacetime. Therefore, a quarter of the area formula is
proposed, in which the area corresponds to the are of the set of fixed points
of an $S^2/\mathbb Z_q$ orbifold.

be remotely configured by cellular base stations to coherently direct the
reflected radio waves towards specific UAVs in order to increase their received

models, we analyze the signal gains at UAVs due to the IRS deployments as a
function of UAV height as well as various IRS parameters including size,
altitude, and distance from base station. Our analysis suggests that even with
a small IRS, we can achieve significant signal gain for UAVs flying above the
cellular base station. We also find that the maximum gain can be achieved by
optimizing the location of IRS including its altitude and distance to BS.

framework of the Rumer-Fet model is considered. We introduce the concept of a
single quantum system, the generating core of which is an abstract
$C^\ast$-algebra. It is shown that various concrete implementations of the
operator algebra depend on the structure of generators of the fundamental
symmetry group attached to the energy operator. In the case of generators of
the complex shell of a group algebra of a conformal group, the spectrum of
states of a single quantum system is given in the framework of the basic
representation of the Rumer-Fet group, which leads to a group-theoretic
interpretation of the Mendeleev's periodic system of elements. A mass formula
is introduced that allows to give the termwise mass splitting for the main
multiplet of the Rumer-Fet group. The masses of elements of the Seaborg table
(eight-periodic extension of the Mendeleev table) are calculated starting from
the atomic number $Z=121$ to $Z=220$. The continuation of Seaborg homology
between lanthanides and actinides is established to the group of
superactinides. A 10-periodic extension of the periodic table is introduced in
the framework of the group-theoretic approach. The multiplet structure of the
extended table periods is considered in detail. It is shown that the period
lengths of the system of elements are determined by the structure of the basic
representation of the Rumer-Fet group. The theoretical masses of the elements
of 10th and 11th periods are calculated starting from $Z=221$ to $Z=364$. The

to develop general intelligence in the sense of being able to solve several
complex tasks with only one network architecture. This could be the case
because the brain is not a randomly initialized neural network, which has to be
trained by simply investing a lot of calculation power, but has from birth some
fixed hierarchical structure. To make progress in decoding the structural basis
of biological neural networks we here chose a bottom-up approach, where we
evolutionarily trained small neural networks in performing a maze task. This
simple maze task requires dynamical decision making with delayed rewards. We
were able to show that during the evolutionary optimization random severance of
connections lead to better generalization performance of the networks compared
to fully connected networks. We conclude that sparsity is a central property of
