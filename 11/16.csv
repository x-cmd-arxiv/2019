  Choice Overload",,,,,"econ.TH cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Assortment optimization is an important problem that arises in many
industries such as retailing and online advertising where the goal is to find a
subset of products from a universe of substitutable products which maximize
seller's expected revenue. One of the key challenges in this problem is to
model the customer substitution behavior. Many parametric random utility
maximization (RUM) based choice models have been considered in the literature.
However, in all these models, probability of purchase increases as we include
more products to an assortment. This is not true in general and in many
settings more choices hurt sales. This is commonly referred to as the choice
overload. In this paper we attempt to address this limitation in RUM through a
generalization of the Markov chain based choice model considered in Blanchet et
al. (2016). As a special case, we show that our model reduces to a
generalization of MNL with no-purchase attractions dependent on the assortment
S and strictly increasing with the size of assortment S. While we show that the
assortment optimization under this model is NP-hard, we present fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) under reasonable assumptions.

developed for modelling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations, which have
been established as a promising phase field modelling approach for simulation
of immiscible multiphase flows. The present study suggests that traditional
Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard models do not allow for surface tension effects to
be neglected due to the presence of the surface tension parameter in the
Cahn-Hilliard equation. This motivates the proposed formulation, which allows
surface tension effects to be changed without affecting the behaviour of the
phase transport. Two methods are proposed: The first uses stabilised SUPG/PSPG
linear elements, while the second is based on mixed Taylor-Hood elements. The
proposed models are applied to a number of benchmark and example problems,
including both capillary regime in which surface tension effects are dominant,
and inertial regime in which surface tension effects are negligibly small. All
results obtained agree very well with reference solutions.

where a strip of strong pinning coexists with a region containing no pinning.
For driving parallel to the strip, we find that the initial skyrmion motion is
confined to the unpinned region and the skyrmion Hall angle is zero. At larger
drives, a transition occurs to a phase in which motion also appears within the
pinned region, creating a shear band in the skyrmion velocity, while the
skyrmion Hall angle is still zero. As the drive increases further, the flow
becomes disordered and the skyrmion Hall angle increases with drive until
saturating at the highest drives when the system transitions into a moving
crystal phase. The different dynamic phases are associated with velocity and
density gradients across the pinning boundaries. We map out the dynamic phases
as a function of pinning strength, skyrmion density, and Magnus force strength,
and correlate the phase boundaries with features in the velocity-force curves
and changes in the local and global ordering of the skyrmion structure. For
large Magnus forces, the shear banding instability is replaced by large scale
intermittent flow in the pinned region accompanied by simultaneous motion
perpendicular to the direction of the drive, which appears as oscillations in
the transport curves. We also examine the case of a drive applied perpendicular
to the strip, where we find a jamming effect in which the skyrmion flow is
blocked by skyrmion-skyrmion interactions until the drive is large enough to
induce plastic flow.

of deformability, permeability and stimuli responsive properties. By means of
large-scale simulations we investigate the structural properties of nanogels at
liquid-liquid (A-B) interfaces and the miscibility of the liquids inside the
nanogels, covering the whole range of interfacial strength from the limit of
single-liquid to the case of stiff interfaces. To study the role of the
internal architecture and deformability of the nanogel we simulate a realistic
disordered and an ideal regular network, for a broad range of cross-linking
degrees. Unlike in previous investigations on liquid miscibility, excluded
volume interactions are considered for both the monomers and the explicit
solvent particles. The nanogel permeability is analysed by using an unbiased
grid representation that accounts for the surface fluctuations and adds to the
density profiles the exact number of liquid particles inside the nanogel. The
better packing efficiency of the regular network leads to higher values of the
total liquid uptake and the invasive capacity (A-particles in B-side and
viceversa than in the disordered network, though differences vanish in the
limit of rigid interfaces. Uptake and invasion are optimized at a cross-linking
degree that depends on the interfacial strength, tending to 15 - 20% for
moderate and stiff interfaces. As the interfacial strength increases, the
miscibility inside the nanogel is enhanced by a factor of up to 5 with respect
to the bare interface, with the disordered networks providing a better mixing
than their ideal counterparts. The emerging scenario reported here provides
general guidelines for tuning the shape, uptake, invasive, and mixing
capacities of nanogels adsorbed at liquid-liquid interfaces.

combine different models, have been proposed to overcome the selection step,
and proven fruitful especially in the supervised learning framework.
Conversely, these approaches have been scantily explored in the unsupervised

a plethora of mixture models, with different number of components and
parametrizations, is typically estimated. We propose an ensemble clustering
approach that circumvents the single best model paradigm, while improving
stability and robustness of the partitions. A new density estimator, being a
convex linear combination of the density estimates in the ensemble, is
introduced and exploited for group assignment. As opposed to the standard case,
where clusters are typically associated to the components of the selected
mixture model, we define partitions by borrowing the modal, or nonparametric,
formulation of the clustering problem, where groups are linked with
high-density regions. Staying in the density-based realm we thus show how
blending together parametric and nonparametric approaches may be beneficial
from a clustering perspective.

consider. The dynamics of the system is studied using the Heisenberg-Langevin
equations. We treat the counter-rotating terms in the Hamiltonian
perturbatively, which leads to the Bloch-Siegert shift in the resonator
frequency. It is shown how this can improve the readout. The theory of photon
transport through the qubit and the resonator it couples to is provided while
taking the effect of the counter-rotating terms into account. To calculate the
readout contrast, we use two approaches. The first one neglects the qubit
relaxation and allows us to derive a compact expression for the contrast. Also,
we obtain simple estimates for the system parameters to maximize the contrast.

further improve the contrast. We demonstrate that for a readout time of

be calculated if the wave functions of all internal states are known, which is
typically not the case in molecular systems. Marcus theory provides a
closed-form expression for the rate constant, which is a classical limit of the
golden rule, and indicates the existence of a normal regime and an inverted
regime. Semiclassical instanton theory presents a more accurate approximation
to the golden-rule rate including nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling,
which has so far been applicable to complex anharmonic systems in the normal
regime only. In this paper we extend the instanton method to the inverted
regime and study the properties of the periodic orbit, which describes the
tunnelling mechanism via two imaginary-time trajectories, one of which now
travels in negative imaginary time. It is known that tunnelling is particularly
prevalent in the inverted regime, even at room temperature, and thus this
method is expected to be useful in studying a wide range of molecular
transitions occurring in this regime.

actuation attacks. The attacks are modelled as false data injections to the
system, such that the total input (control input plus injection) satisfies hard
input constraints. We establish a sufficient condition under which it is not
possible to maintain the states of the system within a compact state constraint
set for all possible realizations of the actuation attack. The developed
condition is a simple function of the spectral radius of the system, the
relative sizes of the input and state constraint sets, and the proportion of
the input constraint set allowed to the attacker.

analysis shows that the centrality maximization performed by each node tends to

common approach is to use the penalized k-means algorithm with an additive
penalty term linear in the number of clusters. An open problem is estimating
the value of the coefficient of the penalty term. Since estimating the value of
the coefficient in a principled manner appears to be intractable for general
clusters, we investigate ""ideal clusters"", i.e. identical spherical clusters
with no overlaps and no outlier background noise. In this paper: (a) We derive,
for the case of ideal clusters, rigorous bounds for the coefficient of the
additive penalty. Unsurprisingly, the bounds depend on the correct number of
clusters, which we want to find in the first place. We further show that
additive penalty, even for this simplest case of ideal clusters, typically
produces a weak and often ambiguous signature for the correct number of
clusters. (b) As an alternative, we examine the k-means with multiplicative
penalty, and show that this parameter-free formulation has a stronger, and less
often ambiguous, signature for the correct number of clusters. We also
empirically investigate certain types of deviations from ideal cluster
assumption and show that combination of k-means with additive and
multiplicative penalties can resolve ambiguous solutions.

  Regression Models",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern methods for Bayesian regression beyond the Gaussian response setting
are often computationally impractical or inaccurate in high dimensions. In
fact, as discussed in recent literature, bypassing such a trade-off is still an
open problem even in routine binary regression models, and there is limited
theory on the quality of variational approximations in high-dimensional
settings. To address this gap, we study the approximation accuracy of
routinely-used mean-field variational Bayes solutions in high-dimensional
probit regression with Gaussian priors, obtaining novel and practically
relevant results on the pathological behavior of such strategies in uncertainty
quantification, point estimation and prediction. Motivated by these results, we
further develop a new partially-factorized variational approximation for the
posterior of the probit coefficients which leverages a representation with
global and local variables but, unlike for classical mean-field assumptions, it
avoids a fully factorized approximation, and instead assumes a factorization
only for the local variables. We prove that the resulting approximation belongs
to a tractable class of unified skew-normal densities that crucially
incorporates skewness and, unlike for state-of-the-art mean-field solutions,
converges to the exact posterior density as p goes to infinity. To solve the
variational optimization problem, we derive a tractable CAVI algorithm that
easily scales to p in the tens of thousands, and provably requires a number of
iterations converging to 1 as p goes to infinity. Such findings are also
illustrated in extensive empirical studies where our novel solution is shown to
improve the approximation accuracy of mean-field variational Bayes for any n
and p, with the magnitude of these gains being remarkable in those
high-dimensional p>n settings where state-of-the-art methods are
computationally impractical.

questions in neutrino physics. While current-generation neutrino oscillation
experiments are able to produce moderate indications on this ordering, upcoming
experiments of the next generation aim to provide conclusive evidence. In this
paper we study the combined performance of the two future multi-purpose
neutrino oscillation experiments JUNO and the IceCube Upgrade, which employ two
very distinct and complementary routes towards the neutrino mass ordering. The
approach pursued by the $20\,\mathrm{kt}$ medium-baseline reactor neutrino
experiment JUNO consists of a careful investigation of the energy spectrum of
oscillated $\bar{\nu}_e$ produced by ten nuclear reactor cores. The IceCube
Upgrade, on the other hand, which consists of seven additional densely
instrumented strings deployed in the center of IceCube DeepCore, will observe
large numbers of atmospheric neutrinos that have undergone oscillations
affected by Earth matter. In a joint fit with both approaches, tension occurs
between their preferred mass-squared differences $ \Delta
m_{31}^{2}=m_{3}^{2}-m_{1}^{2} $ within the wrong mass ordering. In the case of
JUNO and the IceCube Upgrade, this allows to exclude the wrong ordering at
$>5\sigma$ on a timescale of 3--7 years --- even under circumstances that are
unfavorable to the experiments' individual sensitivities. For PINGU, a
26-string detector array designed as a potential low-energy extension to
IceCube, the inverted ordering could be excluded within 1.5 years (3 years for
the normal ordering) in a joint analysis.

However, most existing network embedding methods assume that only a single type

jointly integrate the node embeddings from multiple graphs by introducing 1)
the consensus regularization framework that minimizes the disagreements among
the relation-type specific node embeddings, and 2) the universal discriminator
that discriminates true samples regardless of the relation types. We also show
that the attention mechanism infers the importance of each relation type, and
thus can be useful for filtering unnecessary relation types as a preprocessing
step. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate that DMGI
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, even though DMGI is fully

modify the mesoscopic islands with gate-tunable valves and non-topological

the Pauli master equation, and standard Monte Carlo simulations are applied to
observe the behavior of the system when the parity correction proposal is

solution for these challenges, particularly in scenarios relating to indoor

been envisioned to address some of the key challenges in the next generation
wireless networks. However, in realistic environments, it has been shown that
VLC systems suffer from additive optical interference due to ambient light, and
user-mobility which cause detrimental outages and overall degraded data rates.
Motivated by this, in this work, we first derive the statistics of the incurred
additive interference, and then analyze the rate of the considered NOMA-VLC
channel. An analytical expression is subsequently derived for the rate of
NOMA-VLC systems with ambient light and user-mobility, followed by the
formulation of a power-allocation technique for the underlying scenario, which
has been shown to outperform classical gain-ratio power allocation in terms of
achievable rate. The obtained analytical results are corroborated with computer
simulations for various realistic VLC scenarios of interest, which lead to
useful insights of theoretical and practical interest. For example, it is shown
that, in a NOMA-enabled VLC system, the maximum rate at which information can
be transmitted over a static VLC communication channel with ambient light
asymptotically converges to the Shannon Hartley capacity formula.

analysis on the densest dark matter filaments, we found that the radial density
profile, at scales around $1\, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$, approximately follow a
power-law function with index -2. Without making any assumption about the
velocity field, our algorithm finds that the saddle point arises as a natural
characteristic of the filamentary structure. In addition, its location along
the filament depends on the masses of the halos at the filament ends. We also
found that the infall velocities follow a cross-pattern near the saddle point,
being perpendicular to the filament spine when approaching from low-density
regions, and parallel away from the saddle point towards the ends of the
filament. Following theoretical prescriptions, we estimate the linear density
from the transverse velocity dispersion, finding a good correspondence with the

multitude of intrinsically random events occurring at a microscopic scale. We
bridge the gap between these scales by demonstrating convergence to a
mean-field limit for a general class of stochastic models representing each
individual ecological event in the limit of large system size. The proof relies
on classical stochastic coupling techniques that we generalize to cover
spatially extended interactions. The mean-field limit is a spatially extended
non-Markovian process characterized by nonlocal integro-differential equations
describing the evolution of the probability for a patch of land to be in a
given state (the generalized Kolmogorov equations of the process, GKEs). We
thus provide an accessible general framework for spatially extending many
classical finite-state models from ecology and population dynamics. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through a detailed
comparison of our limiting spatial model and the finite-size version of a
specific savanna-forest model, the so-called Staver-Levin model. There is
remarkable dynamic consistency between the GKEs and the finite-size system, in
spite of almost sure forest extinction in the finite-size system. To resolve
this apparent paradox, we show that the extinction rate drops sharply when
nontrivial equilibria emerge in the GKEs, and that the finite-size system's
quasi-stationary distribution (stationary distribution conditional on
non-extinction) closely matches the bifurcation diagram of the GKEs.
Furthermore, the limit process can support periodic oscillations of the
probability distribution, thus providing an elementary example of a jump
process that does not converge to a stationary distribution. In spatially
extended settings, environmental heterogeneity can lead to waves of invasion
and front-pinning phenomena.

natural basis for isolating statistically independent degrees of freedom. We
discuss how TMs were developed to describe compactly various processes:
superfluorescence, stimulated Raman scattering, spontaneous parametric down

the strongest Galactic CH3OH lines, the so-called class II masers, show no

Here we report class I 36GHz CH3OH 4(-1) - 3(0) E line emission from the nearby
galaxies Maffei2 and IC342, measured with the 100-m telescope at Effelsberg at
three different epochs within a time span of about five weeks. The 36GHz
methanol line of Maffei2 is the second most luminous among the sources detected
with certainty outside the Local Group of galaxies. This is not matched by the
moderate infrared luminosity of Maffei2. Higher resolution data are required to
check whether this is related to its prominent bar and associated shocks. Upper
limits for M82, NGC4388, NGC5728 and Arp220 are also presented. The previously
reported detection of 36GHz maser emission in Arp220 is not confirmed.
Non-detections are reported from the related class I 44GHz methanol transition

in NGC253 and NGC4945, our 36GHz profiles towards Maffei2 and IC342 are similar
to those of previously detected non-masing lines from other molecular species.
However, by analogy to our Galactic center region, it may well be possible that
the 36GHz methanol lines in Maffei~2 and IC~342 are composed of a large number
of faint and narrow maser features that remain spatially unresolved. In view of
this, a search for a weak broad 36GHz line component would also be desirable in

software backend serves as an API to the designer to design the CNN and train
it according to the hardware resources that are available. Using the CNN model,
hardware backend generates the necessary hardware components and integrates
them to generate the hardware description of the CNN. Finaly,

paper, we introduce a method for solving OPF problems, which can substantially
reduce solve times of the two-step hybrid techniques that comprise of a neural

network that predicts the binding status of constraints of the system is used
to generate an initial reduced OPF problem, defined by removing the predicted

demonstrate that optimizing this meta-loss objective results in a classifier
that significantly outperforms conventional loss functions used to train neural

are used to design egalitarian proofs of work and in the construction of

Broadly speaking, MHFs can be divided into two categories: data-dependent
memory hard functions (dMHFs) and data-independent memory hard functions
(iMHFs). iMHFs are resistant to certain side-channel attacks as the memory
access pattern induced by the honest evaluation algorithm is independent of the
potentially sensitive input e.g., password. While dMHFs are potentially
vulnerable to side-channel attacks (the induced memory access pattern might
leak useful information to a brute-force attacker), they can achieve higher
cumulative memory complexity (CMC) in comparison than an iMHF. In this paper,
we introduce the notion of computationally data-independent memory hard
functions (ciMHFs). Intuitively, we require that memory access pattern induced
by the (randomized) ciMHF evaluation algorithm appears to be independent from
the standpoint of a computationally bounded eavesdropping attacker --- even if
the attacker selects the initial input. We then ask whether it is possible to
circumvent known upper bound for iMHFs and build a ciMHF with CMC
$\Omega(N^2)$. Surprisingly, we answer the question in the affirmative when the
ciMHF evaluation algorithm is executed on a two-tiered memory architecture

finite element discretization of Euler equations in both steady and transient
form. Implicit time integration is used in the case of the transient form. A
differentiable local bounds preserving method has been developed, which
combines a Rusanov artificial diffusion operator and a differentiable shock
detector. Nonlinear stabilization schemes are usually stiff and highly
nonlinear. This issue is mitigated by the differentiability properties of the
proposed method. Moreover, in order to further improve the nonlinear
convergence, we also propose a continuation method for a subset of the
stabilization parameters. The resulting method has been successfully applied to
steady and transient problems with complex shock patterns. Numerical
experiments show that it is able to provide sharp and well resolved shocks. The
importance of the differentiability is assessed by comparing the new scheme
with its non-differentiable counterpart. Numerical experiments suggest that,
for up to moderate nonlinear tolerances, the method exhibits improved
robustness and nonlinear convergence behavior for steady problems. In the case
of transient problem, we also observe a reduction in the computational cost.

We study the property testing of
functions $\mathbb F_p^n\to[R]$. We say that a property is testable if there
exists an oblivious tester for this property with one-sided error and constant
query complexity. Furthermore, a property is proximity oblivious-testable
(PO-testable) if the test is also independent of the proximity parameter
$\epsilon$. It is known that a number of natural properties such as linearity
and being a low degree polynomial are PO-testable. These properties are
examples of linear-invariant properties, meaning that they are preserved under
linear automorphisms of the domain. Following work of Kaufman and Sudan, the
study of linear-invariant properties has been an important problem in
arithmetic property testing.
  A central conjecture in this field, proposed by Bhattacharyya, Grigorescu,
and Shapira, is that a linear-invariant property is testable if and only if it
is semi subspace-hereditary. We prove two results, the first resolves this
conjecture and the second classifies PO-testable properties.
  (1) A linear-invariant property is testable if and only if it is semi
subspace-hereditary.
  (2) A linear-invariant property is PO-testable if and only if it is locally
characterized.
  Our innovations are two-fold. We give a more powerful version of the
compactness argument first introduced by Alon and Shapira. This relies on a new
strong arithmetic regularity lemma in which one mixes different levels of
Gowers uniformity. This allows us to extend the work of Bhattacharyya, Fischer,
Hatami, Hatami, and Lovett by removing the bounded complexity restriction in
their work. Our second innovation is a novel recoloring technique called
patching. This Ramsey-theoretic technique is critical for working in the
linear-invariant setting and allows us to remove the translation-invariant
restriction present in previous work.

reconstitution has proven to be a valuable tool in fundamental studies of
enzyme structure/reactivity relationships or in the design of artificial signal
transduction systems in bioelectronics, synthetic biology, or bioanalytical
applications. In particular, those based on the spontaneous
reconstitution/activation of the apo-PQQ-dependent soluble glucose
dehydrogenase (sGDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were widely developed.
However, the reconstitution mechanism of sGDH with its two cofactors, i.e. the
pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and Ca2+, remains unknown. The objective here is
to elucidate this mechanism by stopped-flow kinetics under single-turnover
conditions. The reconstitution of sGDH exhibited biphasic kinetics,
characteristic of a square reaction scheme associated to two activation
pathways. From a complete kinetic analysis, we were able to fully predict the
reconstitution dynamic, but also to demonstrate that when PQQ first binds to
the apo-sGDH, it strongly impedes the access of Ca2+ to its enclosed position
at the bottom of the enzyme binding site, thereby greatly slowing down the
reconstitution rate of sGDH. This slow calcium insertion may purposely be
accelerated by providing more flexibility to the Ca2+ binding loop through the
specific mutation of the calcium coordinating P248 proline residue, reducing
thus the kinetic barrier to calcium ion insertion. The dynamic nature of the
reconstitution process is also supported by the observation of a clear loop
shift and a reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network and van der Waals
interactions observed in both active sites of the apo and holo forms, a
structural change modulation that was revealed from the refined X-ray structure
of apo-sGDH (PDB:5MIN).

arm tracer in a region with a given temperature may be at a different location
(offset) than an arm tracer in a region with a colder temperature. Some
conditions are found to be necessary or sufficient in order to detect an offset
between two arm tracers. To find the offset of a tracer from another tracer,
one needs a proper linear resolution. Starting in the dust lane and going
across the spiral arm, we seek the observed physical width of the star-forming
zone (offset). In our sample of 24 galaxies with measured offsets, we find
offsets with a median value near 326 pc and a mean near 370 pc. These offsets
are comparable to those found in our Milky Way galaxy, between the cold diffuse
CO 1-0 gas set at 0 pc, and the hot dust near 350 pc. Preliminary statistics
are performed on the angular velocity of the gas and stars and angular velocity
of the spiral pattern. Their observed orbital velocity of 200 km/s at a typical
galactic radius near 4 kpc yields an angular speed of the gas and stars near 60
km/s/kpc. Their deduced angular rotation for the spiral pattern averages 36
km/s/kpc. These observational results are close to the results predicted by the
shock-induced star-forming density wave theory. These mean or median property

of vacancy diffusion and mechanics where the vacancy generation/absorption at

stated in terms of general balance laws and completed by the choice of
constitutive equations consistent with classical non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. The kinetics of diffusional creep is derived from
physically-based mechanisms of climb of dislocations at grain boundaries, thus
introducing a dependence of diffusional creep on the density and mobility of
boundary dislocations. Several representative examples have been solved using
the finite element method and assuming representative volume elements made up
of an array of regular-shaped crystals. The effect of stress, temperature,
grain size, and grain boundary dislocation mobility is analyzed and compared
with classical theories of diffusional creep. The simulation results
demonstrate the ability of the present model to reproduce the macroscopic
stress and grain size dependence observed under both diffusion and interface
controlled regimes as well the evolution of this dependency with the
temperature. In addition, the numerical implementation of the model allows to
predict the evolution of microscopic fields through the microstructure.

to strong zero-bias anomalies in tunneling transport in roughly half of the
system's parameter space under an odd number of flux quanta. Due to their
coexistence with gapless subbands, the zero modes do not enjoy generic
topological protection. Depending on the details of subband mixing in realistic

structure, a significant modification of the directionality of the emitted

prolate capsule in unbounded shear flow. The motion of the capsule is simulated
using a model that incorporates shear elasticity, area dilatation, and bending
resistance. Here the deformability of the capsule is characterized by capillary
number Ca, which represents the ratio of viscous stresses to elastic restoring
stresses. For a capsule with small bending stiffness, at a given Ca, the
orientation converges over time towards a unique stable orbit independent of
the initial orientation. With increasing Ca, four dynamical modes are found for
the stable orbit: rolling, wobbling, oscillating-swinging, and swinging. For a
capsule with large bending stiffness, multiplicity in the orbit dynamics is
observed. When the viscosity ratio $\lambda \lesssim 1$, the long-axis of the
capsule always tends towards a stable orbit in the flow-gradient plane, either
tumbling or swinging, depending on Ca. When $\lambda \gtrsim 1$, the stable
orbit of the capsule is a tumbling motion at low Ca, irrespective of the
initial orientation. Upon increasing Ca, there is a symmetry-breaking
bifurcation away from the tumbling orbit, and the capsule is observed to adopt
multiple stable orbital modes including nonsymmetric precessing and rolling,
depending on the initial orientation. As Ca further increases, the nonsymmetric
stable orbit loses existence at a saddle-node bifurcation, and rolling becomes
the only attractor at high Ca, whereas the rolling state coexists with the
nonsymmetric state at intermediate values of Ca. A symmetry-breaking
bifurcation away from the rolling orbit is also found upon decreasing Ca. The
regime with multiple attractors becomes broader as the aspect ratio of the
capsule increases, while narrowing as viscosity ratio increases. We also report
the particle contribution to the stress, which also displays multiplicity.

strongly correlated, viscous electron fluids. These fluids are not amenable to
the perturbative methods of Fermi liquid theory, but can be described by
holography, that is, by mapping them onto a weakly curved gravitational theory
via gauge/gravity duality. The canonical system considered for realizations has
been graphene, which possesses Dirac dispersions at low energies as well as
significant Coulomb interactions between the electrons. In this work, we show
that Kagome systems with electron fillings adjusted to the Dirac nodes of their
band structure provide a much more compelling platform for realizations of
viscous electron fluids, including non-linear effects such as turbulence. In
particular, we find that in stoichiometric Scandium (Sc) Herbertsmithite, the
fine-structure constant, which measures the effective Coulomb interaction and
hence reflects the strength of the correlations, is enhanced by a factor of
about 3.2 as compared to graphene, due to orbital hybridization. We employ
holography to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy
density in Sc-Herbertsmithite, and find it about three times smaller than in
graphene. These findings put, for the first time, the turbulent flow regime
described by holography within the reach of experiments.

work and home. However, these IoT devices are prone to vulnerability exploits
due to their low cost, low resources, the diversity of vendors, and proprietary
firmware. Moreover, short range communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth or
ZigBee) open additional opportunities for the lateral movement of an attacker
within an organization. Thus, the type and location of IoT devices may
significantly change the level of network security of the organizational
network. In this work, we quantify the level of network security based on an
augmented attack graph analysis that accounts for the physical location of IoT
devices and their communication capabilities. We use the depth-first branch and
bound (DFBnB) heuristic search algorithm to solve two optimization problems:
Full Deployment with Minimal Risk (FDMR) and Maximal Utility without Risk
Deterioration (MURD). An admissible heuristic is proposed to accelerate the
search. The proposed method is evaluated using a real network with simulated
deployment of IoT devices. The results demonstrate (1) the contribution of the
augmented attack graphs to quantifying the impact of IoT devices deployed
within the organization on security, and (2) the effectiveness of the optimized
IoT deployment.

that the asymptotic evolution in gauge theories is universal, i.e. independent

well-defined few particle Fock states, dressed/coherent states can be seen to
form as intermediate states in the calculation of hard $S$-matrix elements. We
present a framework for the perturbative calculation of hard $S$-matrix

With hard cutoffs on the asymptotic Hamiltonian, the cancellation of
divergences can be seen explicitly. In dimensional regularization, where the
hard cutoffs are replaced by a renormalization scale, the contribution from the

can help detect unusual objects and uncover trends in large astronomical

different methods, or even small variations of the same method, can produce
significantly different outcomes. While intuitively somewhat surprising, this
can naturally occur when applying unsupervised ML to highly dimensional data,
where there can be many reasonable yet different answers to the same question.
In such a case the outcome of any single unsupervised ML method should be
considered a sample from a conceivably wide range of possibilities. We
therefore suggest an approach that eschews finding an optimal outcome, instead
facilitating the production and examination of many valid ones. This can be
achieved by incorporating unsupervised ML into data visualisation portals. We
present here such a portal that we are developing, applied to the sample of
SDSS spectra of galaxies. The main feature of the portal is interactive 2D maps
of the data. Different maps are constructed by applying dimensionality
reduction to different subspaces of the data, so that each map contains
different information that in turn gives a different perspective on the data.
The interactive maps are intuitive to use, and we demonstrate how peculiar
objects and trends can be detected by means of a few button clicks. We believe
that including tools in this spirit in next generation astronomical surveys
will be important for making unexpected discoveries, either by professional
astronomers or by citizen scientists, and will generally enable the benefits of
visual inspection even when dealing with very complex and extensive datasets.

galaxies show star-gas misalignment. The misalignment possibly results from
external effects such as gas accretion, interaction with other objects, and
other environmental effects, hence providing clues to these effects. We explore
the properties of misaligned galaxies using Horizon-AGN, a large-volume
cosmological simulation, and compare the result with the result of the

Horizon-AGN can match the overall misalignment fraction and reproduces the
distribution of misalignment angles found by observations surprisingly closely.
The misalignment fraction is found to be highly correlated with galaxy
morphology both in observations and in the simulation: early-type galaxies are
substantially more frequently misaligned than late-type galaxies. The gas
fraction is another important factor associated with misalignment in the sense
that misalignment increases with decreasing gas fraction. However, there is a
significant discrepancy between the SAMI and Horizon-AGN data in the
misalignment fraction for the galaxies in dense (cluster) environments. We
discuss possible origins of misalignment and disagreement.

redshift $z\sim3.5$: their last major merger occurs at $t_{\rm

$\leq$1:20, suggesting an upper limit of a few percent for the mass ratio of
the recently proposed Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger. These Auriga MW-analogues
have a negligible fraction of ex-situ stars in the b/p region ($<1\%$), with
flattened, thick disc-like metal-poor stellar populations. The average fraction
of ex-situ stars in the central regions of all Auriga galaxies with b/p's is 3%
-- significantly lower than in those which do not host a b/p or a bar. While
the central regions of these barred galaxies contain the oldest populations,
they also have stars younger than 5Gyrs (>30%) and exhibit X-shaped age and
abundance distributions. Examining the discs in our sample, we find that in
some cases a star-forming ring forms around the bar, which alters the
metallicity of the inner regions of the galaxy. Further out in the disc,
bar-induced resonances lead to metal-rich ridges in the $V_{\phi}-r$ plane --
the longest of which is due to the Outer Lindblad Resonance. Our results
suggest the Milky Way has an uncommonly quiet merger history, which leads to an
essentially in-situ bulge, and highlight the significant effects the bar can
have on the surrounding disc.

the system: the spatial derivatives are discretized using standard Lattice
Gauge Field Theory techniques, whereas the time evolution of the fields and
scale factor is implemented with explicit, composite, symplectic integrators.
An important property of our compound algorithm is that the discretized Gauss
constraint is respected exactly, regardless of the order of the symplectic
integrator. This remains true even when the background expansion is computed
""self-consistently""; that is, when the expansion history is computed using
spatial averaged components of the energy momentum tensor in the simulation
volume. Hence, our code can also be used in cases where the fields dominate the
energy density of the universe, for example, during reheating after inflation.
  We test the algorithm in scenarios of reheating where the inflaton is a
complex scalar field with a potential $\propto(2|\varphi|^2-v^2)^2$ and is
coupled to an Abelian gauge field. Tracing the evolution of the system through
complex dynamics (including resonant excitation of fields, backreaction,
formation of solitons, and changes in the equation of state) in a
self-consistently expanding universe, we find the energy conservation violation

case for type I solutions. Instead, the evolution of the shock wave is
determined by boundary conditions at the shock front and at the sonic point. We

plasmoids are generated in the central region of the layer, and they evolve at

Large-sized plasmoids are slow, but produce most of the observed synchrotron

co-adaptation (i.e., reducing the number of morphologies and behaviors tested).
Simulated experiments show that our approach requires drastically less design
prototypes to find good morphology-behaviour combinations, making this method
particularly suitable for future co-adaptation of robot designs in the real
world.

Policy Gradient (DDPG) often require additional exploration strategies,
especially if the actor is of deterministic nature. This work evaluates the use
of model-based trajectory optimization methods used for exploration in Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient when trained on a latent image embedding. In
addition, an extension of DDPG is derived using a value function as critic,
making use of a learned deep dynamics model to compute the policy gradient.
This approach leads to a symbiotic relationship between the deep reinforcement
learning algorithm and the latent trajectory optimizer. The trajectory
optimizer benefits from the critic learned by the RL algorithm and the latter
from the enhanced exploration generated by the planner. The developed methods
are evaluated on two continuous control tasks, one in simulation and one in the
real world. In particular, a Baxter robot is trained to perform an insertion
task, while only receiving sparse rewards and images as observations from the

investigated the potential future impact of these decisions on the population

disadvantaged groups. However, these previous studies have focused on either
simple one-step cost/benefit criteria, or on discrete underlying state spaces.
In this work, we first propose a natural continuous representation of
population state, governed by the Beta distribution, using a loan granting
setting as a running example. Next, we apply a model of population dynamics
under lending decisions, and show that when conditional payback probabilities
are estimated correctly 1) ``optimal'' behavior by lenders can lead to
''Matthew Effect'' bifurcations (i.e., ''the rich get richer and the poor get
poorer''), but that 2) many common fairness constraints on the allowable
policies cause groups to converge to the same equilibrium point. Last, we
contrast our results in the case of misspecified conditional probability
estimates with prior work, and show that for this model, different levels of
group misestimation guarantees that even fair policies lead to bifurcations. We

$2\gamma$ annihilations, and (ii) estimation of the spatial and time resolution
of the ortho-positronium image as a function of the coincidence resolving time

radiopharmaceutical is labelled with $^{44}Sc$ isotope emitting one positron

coincidence events. The ortho-positronium lifetime spectrum is determined for
each voxel of the image. Calculations were performed for cases of total-body

instrumental to discern the nature of the Higgs particle. In scenarios where an
additional strongly interacting sector is present in the electroweak theory
resulting in a composite Higgs and longitudinal components of the massive gauge
bosons, unitarity, analyticity and related techniques will be crucial to
understand the properties of such a sector. The situation today may be
reminiscent of the pre-QCD days: a strongly interacting theory governs the
short-distances, but we have only access to long-distance experiment involving
Nambu-Goldstone or pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Like in those days we can
only rely on symmetry and general properties of field theory. Luckily, unlike
in the pre-QCD days, we have now a much clearer idea of what we may be after.
  After presenting a classification of the various types of effective theories,
we establish the criteria as to under which conditions different
representations are possible and their equivalence. We discuss in detail the
implications of analyticity, causality and unitarity; describe various
unitarization methods and establish the properties of dynamically generated
resonances and form factors. The relation to effective Lagrangians with
explicit resonances is explained in the context of beyond the Standard Model
(BSM) physics and the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT). We discuss how
various BSM models may be reduced to the HEFT as well as implications from
holography and lattice studies in establishing BSM phenomenology. The methods
presented are then applied to various processes relevant to disentangle the
existence and nature of an extended electroweak symmetry breaking sector

applications. The typical approaches for nonlinear system identification
include Volterra series models, nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs
models, block-structured models, state-space models and neural network models.
Among them, neural networks (NN) is an important black-box method thanks to its
universal approximation capability and less dependency on prior information.
However, there are several challenges associated with NN. The first one lies in
the design of a proper neural network structure. A relatively simple network
cannot approximate the feature of the system, while a complex model may lead to
overfitting. The second lies in the availability of data for some nonlinear
systems. For some systems, it is difficult to collect enough data to train a
neural network. This raises the challenge that how to train a neural network
for system identification with a small dataset. In addition, if the uncertainty
of the NN parameter could be obtained, it would be also beneficial for further
analysis. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian deep learning approach to
address the above problems. Specifically, the Bayesian method can reinforce the
regularization on neural networks by introducing introduced sparsity-inducing
priors. The Bayesian method can also compute the uncertainty of the NN
parameter. An efficient iterative re-weighted algorithm is presented in this
paper. We also test the capacity of our method to identify the system on

a much larger chemical disequilibrium than other solar system planets with
atmospheres because of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, no analysis exists
comparing disequilibrium on lifeless, prebiotic planets to disequilibrium on
worlds with primitive chemotrophic biospheres that live off chemicals and not
light. Here, we use a photochemical-microbial ecosystem model to calculate the
atmosphere-ocean disequilibria of Earth with no life and with a chemotrophic
biosphere. We show that the prebiotic Earth likely had a relatively large
atmosphere-ocean disequilibrium due to the coexistence of water and volcanic
H2, CO2, and CO. Subsequent chemotrophic life probably destroyed nearly all of
the prebiotic disequilibrium through its metabolism, leaving a likely smaller
disequilibrium between N2, CO2, CH4, and liquid water. So, disequilibrium fell
with the rise of chemotrophic life then later rose with atmospheric oxygenation
due to oxygenic photosynthesis. We conclude that big prebiotic disequilibrium
between H2 and CO2 or CO and water is an anti-biosignature because these easily
metabolized species can be eaten due to redox reactions with low activation
energy barriers. However, large chemical disequilibrium can also be a
biosignature when the disequilibrium arises from a chemical mixture with
biologically insurmountable activation energy barriers, and clearly
identifiable biogenic gases. Earth's modern disequilibrium between O2, N2, and
liquid water along with minor CH4 is such a case. Thus, the interpretation of
disequilibrium requires context. With context, disequilibrium can be used to
infer dead or living worlds.

essential for our understanding of the gas kinematics on Galactic scales, in
particular its link with the formation and evolution of dense structures in the
interstellar medium. An approximation of the emission peaks with Gaussian
functions allows for an efficient and straightforward extraction of useful
physical information contained in the shape and Doppler-shifted frequency of
the emission lines contained in these enormous data sets. In this work we
present an overview and first results of a Gaussian decomposition of the entire
Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) 13CO (1-0) data that consists of about 2.3 million
spectra. We performed the decomposition with the fully automated GaussPy+
algorithm and fitted about 4.6 million Gaussian components to the GRS spectra.
We discuss the statistics of the fit components and relations between the
fitted intensities, velocity centroids, and velocity dispersions. We find that
the magnitude of the velocity dispersion values increase toward the inner
Galaxy and around the Galactic midplane, which we speculate is partly due to
the influence of the Galactic bar and regions with higher non-thermal motions
located in the midplane, respectively. We also use our decomposition results to
infer global properties of the gas emission and find that the number of fit
components used per spectrum is indicative for the amount of structure along
the line of sight. We find that the emission lines from regions located on the
far side of the Galaxy show increased velocity dispersion values, likely due to
beam averaging effects. We demonstrate how this trend has the potential to aid
in characterising Galactic structure by disentangling emission that is
belonging to the nearby Aquila Rift molecular cloud from emission that is more
likely associated with the Perseus and Outer spiral arms.

neutron star if the individual compact companions have masses that fall inside
the so-called mass gap of $3-5\ M_\odot$? For neutron stars, achieving such
masses typically requires extreme compactness and in this work we present
initial data and evolutions of binary neutron stars initially in
quasiequilibrium circular orbits having a compactness $C=0.336$. These are the
most compact, nonvacuum, quasiequilibrium binary objects that have been
constructed and evolved to date, including boson stars. The compactness
achieved is only slightly smaller than the maximum possible imposed by
causality, $C_{\rm max}=0.355$, which requires the sound speed to be less than
the speed of light. By comparing the emitted gravitational waveforms from the
late inspiral to merger and postmerger phases between such a binary neutron
star vs a binary black hole of the same total mass we identify concrete
measurements that serve to distinguish them. With that level of compactness,
the binary neutron stars exhibit no tidal disruption up until merger, whereupon
a prompt collapse is initiated even before a common core forms. Within the
accuracy of our simulations the black hole remnants from both binaries exhibit
ringdown radiation that is not distinguishable from a perturbed Kerr spacetime.
However, their inspiral leads to phase differences of the order of $\sim 5$ rad
over an $\sim 81$ km separation (1.7 orbits) while typical neutron stars
exhibit phase differences of $\geq 20$ rad. Although a difference of $\sim 5$
rad can be measured by current gravitational wave laser interferometers (e.g.,
aLIGO/Virgo), uncertainties in the individual masses and spins will likely
prevent distinguishing such compact, massive neutron stars from black holes.

bias of treatment effects for observational studies. Previous research has
shown that propensity score methods consistently estimate the marginal hazard

biomedical literature and there is a paucity of research into the use of
propensity score methods when data are recurrent in nature. The objective of
this paper is to extend the existing propensity score methods to recurrent data
setting. We illustrate our methods through a series of Monte Carlo simulations.
The simulation results indicate that without the presence of censoring, the
IPTW estimators allow us to consistently estimate the marginal hazard ratio for
each event. Under administrative censoring regime, the stabilized IPTW
estimator yields biased estimate of the marginal hazard ratio, and the degree
of bias depends on the proportion of subjects being censored. For variance
estimation, the na\""ive variance estimator often tends to substantially
underestimate the variance of the IPTW estimator, while the robust variance
estimator significantly reduces the estimation bias of the variance.

be dramatically higher if the network were denser. So there are large returns
to increasing interaction rates above the critical threshold. Nevertheless,
several natural types of interventions fail to move the equilibrium away from

the temporal position of target events in given audio segments. This task plays
a significant role in safety monitoring, acoustic early warning and other
scenarios. However, the deficiency of data and diversity of acoustic event
sources make the AED task a tough issue, especially for prevalent data-driven

their time-frequency domain properties, showing that different acoustic events
have different time-frequency scale characteristics. Inspired by the analysis,
we propose an adaptive multi-scale detection (AdaMD) method. By taking
advantage of the hourglass neural network and gated recurrent unit (GRU)

frequency resolutions. An adaptive training algorithm is subsequently adopted
to combine multi-scale predictions to enhance its overall capability.

solar activity. The power spectrum of solar activity recorded in sunspot data
is dominated by the $\sim$11-year quasi-periodicity, known as the Schwabe
cycle. In the mid-term range (1 month -- 11 years) a pronounced variability
known as a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is widely discussed. In the shorter
time scale a pronounced peak, corresponding to the synodic solar rotation
period ($\sim$ 27 days) is observed. Here we revisited the mid-term solar
variability in terms of statistical dynamic of fully turbulent systems, where
solid arguments are required to accept an isolated dominant frequency in a
continuous (smooth) spectrum. For that, we first undertook an unbiased analysis
of the standard solar data, sunspot numbers and the F10.7 solar radioflux
index, by applying a wavelet tool, which allows one to perform a frequency-time
analysis of the signal. Considering the spectral dynamics of solar activity
cycle by cycle, we showed that no single periodicity can be separated, in a
statistically significant manner, in the specified range of periods. We examine
whether a model of solar dynamo can reproduce the mid-term oscillation pattern
observed in solar data. We found that a realistically observed spectrum can be
explained if small spatial (but not temporal) scales are effectively smoothed.
This result is important because solar activity is a it global feature,
although monitored via small-scale tracers like sunspots.

analytic continuation to complex quasimomentum consistent with previous

(1) An explicit proof of the surface charge theorem is presented including a
unique relationship between the boundary charge $Q_B^{(\alpha)}$ of a single
band $\alpha$ and the bulk polarization in terms of the Zak-Berry phase with no
unknown integer left. This establishes a precise form of a bulk-boundary

the edge state energies, where the phase variable describes a continuous shift
of the lattice towards the boundary. The topological constraint is shown to be
equivalent to the quantization of a topological index $I=\Delta
Q_B-\bar{\rho}\in \{-1,0\}$ introduced in an accompanying letter

explore the degree of clustering in the data. Researchers fit
variance-component models and then report the proportion of variation in the
response that is due to systematic differences between clusters. Equally they
report the response correlation between units within a cluster. These
statistics are popularly referred to as variance partition coefficients (VPCs)
and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models
to categorical (binary, ordinal, or nominal) and count responses, these
statistics prove more challenging to calculate. For categorical response
models, researchers appeal to their latent response formulations and report
VPCs/ICCs in terms of latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the
observed categorical responses. For standard count response models, however,
there are no corresponding latent response formulations. More generally, there
is a paucity of guidance on how to partition the variation. As a result,
applied researchers are likely to avoid or inadequately report and discuss the
substantive importance of clustering and cluster effects in their studies. A
recent article drew attention to a little-known exact algebraic expression for
the VPC/ICC for the special case of the two-level random-intercept Poisson
model. In this article, we make a substantial new contribution. First, we
derive exact VPC/ICC expressions for more flexible negative binomial models

versatile, robust, and complex exoskeleton morphology. A fundamental challenge
in insect-inspired robotics has been the fabrication of robotic exoskeletons
that can match the complexity of exoskeleton structural mechanics. Hybrid
robots composed of rigid and soft elements have previously required access to
expensive multi-material 3D printers, multi-step casting and machining
processes, or limited material choice when using consumer-grade fabrication
methods. Here we introduce a new design and fabrication process to rapidly
construct flexible exoskeleton-inspired robots called flexoskeleton printing.
We modify a consumer-grade fused deposition material (FDM) 3D printer to
deposit filament directly onto a heated thermoplastic base layer which provides
extremely strong bond strength between the deposited material and the
inextensible, flexible base layer. This process significantly improves the
fatigue resistance of printed components and enables a new class of
insect-inspired robot morphologies. We demonstrate these capabilities through
design and testing of a wide library of canonical flexoskeleton elements;
ultimately leading to the integration of elements into a flexoskeleton walking
legged robot.

electrolyte mixture composed of mono- and multivalent ions confined to a
negatively charged nanoslit. The closure of these equations is based on an
asymmetric treatment of the ionic species with respect to their electrostatic
coupling strength; the weakly coupled monovalent ions are treated within a
gaussian approximation while the multivalent counterions of high coupling
strength are incorporated with a strong-coupling approach. The resulting
self-consistent formalism includes explicitly the interactions of the
multivalent counterions with the monovalent salt. In highly charged membranes
characterized by a pronounced multivalent counterion adsorption, these
interactions take over the salt-membrane charge coupling. As a result, the
increment of the negative membrane charge brings further salt anions into the
pore and excludes salt cations from the pore into the reservoir. The
corresponding like-charge attraction and opposite-charge repulsion effect is
amplified by the pore confinement but suppressed by salt addition into the
reservoir. The effect is particularly pronounced in high dielectric membranes
where the attractive polarization forces lead to a dense multivalent cation
layer at the membrane walls. These cation layers act as an effective positive
surface charge, resulting in a total monovalent cation exclusion and a strong
anion excess even in the case of neutral membrane walls.

compute the similarities. The natural words are embedded into Euclidean space
using a standard word embedding. The probability of each class is then a
function of the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the

to locate a random target within an interval by submitting queries, in the
presence of an adversary who observes all of her queries but not the responses.
How many queries are necessary and sufficient in order for the learner to
accurately estimate the target, while simultaneously concealing the target from
the adversary?
  Our main result is a query complexity lower bound that is tight up to the
first order. We show that if the learner wants to estimate the target within an
error of $\varepsilon$, while ensuring that no adversary estimator can achieve
a constant additive error with probability greater than $1/L$, then the query
complexity is on the order of $L\log(1/\varepsilon)$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$.
Our result demonstrates that increased privacy, as captured by $L$, comes at
the expense of a {multiplicative} increase in query complexity.
  Our proof method builds on Fano's inequality and a family of
proportional-sampling estimators. As an illustration of the method's wider
applicability, we generalize the complexity lower bound to settings involving
high-dimensional linear query learning and partial adversary observation.

characterization of vortex configurations. On a bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq

corresponding energy functional have been studied thoroughly in the limit
$\epsilon\to 0,$ where $\epsilon>0$ is the inverse of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter. The presence of an applied magnetic field of strength $h_{ex}\gg 1$
makes possible the existence of stable vortex states. A notable open problem is
whether there are solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation for any number of
vortices below $ h_{ex} |\Omega| /2 \pi,$ for external fields of up to
super-heating field strength. The best earlier partial results give, for every

$K_1\leq h_{ex} \leq 1/\epsilon^{\alpha}.$ Our strategy consists in combining:
the minimization over a subset of configurations for which we can obtain a very
precise localization of vortices; expansion of the energy in terms of a
modified vortex interaction energy that allows for a reduction to a potential

bidirectional transformer (BERT) models trained on both unrelated texts as well
as on the CC dataset. We contrast this performance with a TF-IDF baseline. Our
evaluation has three components: (1) a random test hold-out from the original
dataset; (2) a ""misspelling set,"" consisting of a hand-selected subset of the
test set, where every entry has at least one misspelling; (3) a separate
experimenter-generated free-text set. We find that the TF-IDF model performs
significantly better than the strongest BERT-based model on the test (best BERT
PR-AUC $0.3597 \pm 0.0041$ vs TF-IDF PR-AUC $0.3878 \pm 0.0148$, $p=7\cdot

However, when examining model predictions on experimenter-generated queries,

that in certain tasks, simple language embedding baselines may be very
performant; however, truly understanding their robustness requires further

chemical reduction of ABO3 (A: rare earth; B transition metal) with CaH2 may
result in both, ABO2 and ABO2H, we calculate the topotactic H binding energy by
density functional theory (DFT). We find intercalating H is energetically
favorable for LaNiO2 but not for Sr-doped NdNiO2. This has dramatic
consequences for the electronic structure as determined by DFT+dynamical mean
field theory: that of 3d9 LaNiO2 is similar to (doped) cuprates, 3d8 LaNiO2H is
a two-orbital Mott insulator. Topotactical H might hence explain why some
nickelates are superconducting and others are not.

  Conference (ASP-DAC), 2020",,,,"cs.DC cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown excellent performance in
image and speech applications. GANs create impressive data primarily through a
new type of operator called deconvolution (DeConv) or transposed convolution
(Conv). To implement the DeConv layer in hardware, the state-of-the-art
accelerator reduces the high computational complexity via the DeConv-to-Conv
conversion and achieves the same results. However, there is a problem that the
number of filters increases due to this conversion. Recently, Winograd minimal
filtering has been recognized as an effective solution to improve the
arithmetic complexity and resource efficiency of the Conv layer. In this paper,
we propose an efficient Winograd DeConv accelerator that combines these two
orthogonal approaches on FPGAs. Firstly, we introduce a new class of fast
algorithm for DeConv layers using Winograd minimal filtering. Since there are
regular sparse patterns in Winograd filters, we further amortize the
computational complexity by skipping zero weights. Secondly, we propose a new
dataflow to prevent resource underutilization by reorganizing the filter layout
in the Winograd domain. Finally, we propose an efficient architecture for
implementing Winograd DeConv by designing the line buffer and exploring the
design space. Experimental results on various GANs show that our accelerator
achieves up to 1.78x~8.38x speedup over the state-of-the-art DeConv
accelerators.

algorithm has convergence guarantees for stochastic minimization in the fully
stochastic regime, meaning that guarantees hold when each stochastic gradient

variance and when the stochastic Hessian estimates are bounded uniformly in
norm. The algorithm is also equipped with a worst-case complexity guarantee in
the nearly deterministic regime, i.e., when the stochastic gradient and Hessian
estimates are very close in expectation to the true gradients and Hessians. The
results of numerical experiments for training convolutional neural networks for

forecasting are presented. These results show that the algorithm can outperform
a stochastic gradient approach and the first-order TRish algorithm in practice.

of the mean firing rate, produces localized, finely spaced discrete attractors
that effectively span a 2D manifold. We demonstrate how the set of attracting

attractor dynamics without synaptic fine-tuning or regular structure. We
measure the network's storage capacity and find that the statistics of

something hitherto achievable only with (approximately) translationally

  We propose Benanza, a sustainable and extensible benchmarking and analysis
design that speeds up the characterization/optimization cycle of DL models on

models into an internal representation, a configurable benchmark generator that
automatically generates micro-benchmarks given a set of models, a database of
benchmark results, and an analyzer that computes the ""lower-bound"" latency of
DL models using the benchmark data and informs optimizations of model
execution. The ""lower-bound"" latency metric estimates the ideal model execution
on a GPU system and serves as the basis for identifying optimization
opportunities in frameworks or system libraries. We used Benanza to evaluate 30

with $([\omega]^{\omega},\subseteq^*)$ over $M$ adds no new sets of ordinals,
thus earning the name a ""barren"" extension. Moreover, under an additional
assumption, they proved that this generic extension preserves all strong
partition cardinals. This forcing thus produces a model $M[\mathcal{U}]$, where
$\mathcal{U}$ is a Ramsey ultrafilter, with many properties of the original
model $M$. This begged the question of how important the Ramseyness of
$\mathcal{U}$ is for these results. In this paper, we show that several classes
of $\sigma$-closed forcings which generate non-Ramsey ultrafilters have the
same properties. Such ultrafilters include Milliken-Taylor ultrafilters, a
class of rapid p-points of Laflamme, $k$-arrow p-points of Baumgartner and
Taylor, and extensions to a class of ultrafilters constructed by Dobrinen,
Mijares and Trujillo. Furthermore, the class of Boolean algebras

  We employ these maps to solve a domination problem for representations. In

CAT$(-1)$ Hadamard manifold is strictly dominated in length spectrum by a large
collection of Fuchsian ones. As an intermediate step in the proof, we obtain a
result of independent interest: parametrizations of certain Teichm{\""u}ller

techniques recently developed in the field of fluid dynamics are leveraged to
develop interpretable reduced-order models of plasmas that strike a balance
between accuracy and efficiency. In particular, dynamic mode decomposition
(DMD) is used to extract spatio-temporal magnetic coherent structures from the
experimental and simulation datasets of the HIT-SI experiment.
Three-dimensional magnetic surface probes from the HIT-SI experiment are
analyzed, along with companion simulations with synthetic internal magnetic
probes. A number of leading variants of the DMD algorithm are compared,
including the sparsity-promoting and optimized DMD. Optimized DMD results in
the highest overall prediction accuracy, while sparsity-promoting DMD yields
physically interpretable models that avoid overfitting. These DMD algorithms
uncover several coherent magnetic modes that provide new physical insights into
the inner plasma structure. These modes were subsequently used to discover a
previously unobserved three-dimensional structure in the simulation, rotating
at the second injector harmonic. Finally, using data from probes at
experimentally accessible locations, DMD identifies a resistive kink mode, a
ubiquitous instability seen in magnetized plasmas.

To address this issue, our main contribution in this paper is to propose an
effective approach to learn a low dimensional gaze representation without gaze
annotations, which to the best of our best knowledge, is the first work to do
so. The main idea is to rely on a gaze redirection network and use the gaze
representation difference of the input and target images (of the redirection
network) as the redirection variable. A redirection loss in image domain allows
the joint training of both the redirection network and the gaze representation
network. In addition, we propose a warping field regularization which not only
provides an explicit physical meaning to the gaze representations but also
avoids redirection distortions. Promising results on few-shot gaze estimation
(competitive results can be achieved with as few as <= 100 calibration

Different from previous methods following context-to-response matching or
utterance-to-response matching frameworks, this model treats both contexts and
responses as sequences of utterances when calculating the matching degrees
between them. For a context-response pair, the U2U-IMN model first encodes each
utterance separately using recurrent and self-attention layers. Then, a global
and bidirectional interaction between the context and the response is conducted
using the attention mechanism to collect the matching information between them.
The distances between context and response utterances are employed as a prior
component when calculating the attention weights. Finally, sentence-level
aggregation and context-response-level aggregation are executed in turn to
obtain the feature vector for matching degree prediction. Experiments on four

partitioned into three layers: the thermal adjustment layer (mixing both
entropy and material), the turbulent dissipation layer (mixing material but not
entropy), and the thermal dissipation layer (mixing neither entropy nor
material). The turbulent dissipation layer is separated from the thermal
adjustment layer and the thermal dissipation layer by the first and second zero
points of the vertical velocity correlation. The simulation results are in good
agreement with the prediction of the one-dimensional turbulent Reynolds stress
model. First, the layer structure is similar. Second, the upper boundary of the
thermal adjustment layer is close to the peak of the magnitude of the
temperature perturbation. Third, the P\'eclet number at the upper boundary of
the turbulent dissipation layer is close to 1. In addition, we have studied the
scalings of the overshooting distance on the relative stability parameter $S$,
the Prandtl number $\rm Pr$, and the P\'eclet number $\rm Pe$. The scaling on
$S$ is not unique. The trend is that the overshooting distance decreases with
$S$. Fitting on $\rm Pr$ shows that the overshooting distance increases with
$\rm Pr$. Fitting on $\rm Pe$ shows that the overshooting distance decreases
with $\rm Pe$. Finally, we calculate the ratio of the thickness of the
turbulent dissipation layer to that of the thermal adjustment layer. The ratio
remains almost constant, with an approximate value of 2.4.

It is typically applied to generate ensemble instances, which potentially
limits the problem size it can handle. Additionally, the data are often divided
by random sampling which may be suboptimal. To address these concerns, we
propose the $DC^2$ algorithm. Instead of ensemble instances, we produce
structure-preserving signature pieces to be assembled and conquered. $DC^2$
achieves the efficiency of sampling-based large scale kernel methods while
enabling parallel multicore or clustered computation. The data partition and
subsequent compression are unified by recursive random projections. Empirically
dividing the data by random projections induces smaller mean squared
approximation errors than conventional random sampling. The power of $DC^2$ is
demonstrated by our clustering algorithm $rpfCluster^+$, which is as accurate
as some fastest approximate spectral clustering algorithms while maintaining a
running time close to that of K-means clustering. Analysis on $DC^2$ when
applied to spectral clustering shows that the loss in clustering accuracy due
to data division and reduction is upper bounded by the data approximation error
which would vanish with recursive random projections. Due to its easy
implementation and flexibility, we expect $DC^2$ to be applicable to general
large scale learning problems.

stellar winds excited by the X-ray radiation from the neutron star. This would

simultaneously with the help of external linguistic knowledge. We first
incorporate external knowledge to impose different linguistic constraints

regularize RC models through posterior regularization. Linguistic constraints
induce more reasonable predictions for both semantic different and semantic
equivalent adversarial examples, and posterior regularization provides an
effective mechanism to incorporate these constraints. Our method can be applied

Grand Finale magnetometer (MAG) dataset, focusing on Saturn's internal magnetic
field. These measurements demonstrate that Saturn's internal magnetic field is
exceptionally axisymmetric, with a dipole tilt less than 0.007 degrees (25.2
arcsecs). Saturn's magnetic equator was directly measured to be shifted
northward by ~ 0.0468 +/- 0.00043 (1-sigma) $R_S$, 2820 +/- 26 km, at
cylindrical radial distances between 1.034 and 1.069 $R_S$ from the spin-axis.
Although almost perfectly axisymmetric, Saturn's internal magnetic field
exhibits features on many characteristic length scales in the latitudinal
direction. Examining Br at the a=0.75 $R_S$, c=0.6993 $R_S$ isobaric surface,
the degrees 4 to 11 contributions correspond to latitudinally banded magnetic
perturbations with characteristic width similar to that of the off-equatorial
zonal jets observed in the atmosphere of Saturn. Saturn's internal magnetic
field beyond 60 degrees latitude, in particular the small-scale features, are
less well constrained by the available measurements, mainly due to incomplete
spatial coverage in the polar region. A stably stratified layer thicker than
2500 km likely exists above Saturn's deep dynamo to filter out the
non-axisymmetric internal magnetic field. A heat transport mechanism other than

arbitrary image style transfers, of which the parameters are computed in a
pre-defined way. Such manually-defined nature eventually results in the
high-cost and shared encoders for both style and content encoding, making style
transfer systems cumbersome to be deployed in resource-constrained environments
like on the mobile-terminal side. In this paper, we propose a new and
generalized normalization module, termed as Dynamic Instance Normalization
(DIN), that allows for flexible and more efficient arbitrary style transfers.
Comprising an instance normalization and a dynamic convolution, DIN encodes a
style image into learnable convolution parameters, upon which the content image
is stylized. Unlike conventional methods that use shared complex encoders to
encode content and style, the proposed DIN introduces a sophisticated style
encoder, yet comes with a compact and lightweight content encoder for fast
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields
very encouraging results on challenging style patterns and, to our best
knowledge, for the first time enables an arbitrary style transfer using
MobileNet-based lightweight architecture, leading to a reduction factor of more
than twenty in computational cost as compared to existing approaches.
Furthermore, the proposed DIN provides flexible support for state-of-the-art
convolutional operations, and thus triggers novel functionalities, such as
uniform-stroke placement for non-natural images and automatic spatial-stroke
control.

desirable property of strong sure screening. In the marginal case, we examine
the superior numerical performance of GenCorr in comparison to two current

received increasing attention in recent years. However, both deep learning and
adversarial training rely on the availability of a large amount of labeled data
and usually do not generalize well to new, unseen classes when only a few
training samples are accessible. To address this problem, we explicitly
introduce a new challenging problem -- how to learn a robust deep model with
limited training samples per class, called defensive few-shot learning in this
paper. Simply employing the existing adversarial training techniques in the
literature cannot solve this problem. This is because few-shot learning needs
to learn transferable knowledge from disjoint auxiliary data, and thus it is
invalid to assume the sample-level distribution consistency between the
training and test sets as commonly assumed in existing adversarial training
techniques. In this paper, instead of assuming such a distribution consistency,
we propose to make this assumption at a task-level in the episodic training
paradigm in order to better transfer the defense knowledge. Furthermore, inside
each task, we design a task-conditioned distribution constraint to narrow the
distribution gap between clean and adversarial examples at a sample-level.
These give rise to a novel mechanism called multi-level distribution based
adversarial training (MDAT) for learning transferable adversarial defense. In
addition, a unified $\mathcal{F}_{\beta}$ score is introduced to evaluate
different defense methods under the same principle. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MDAT achieves higher effectiveness and robustness over
existing alternatives in the few-shot case.

is often due to past data available in the replay buffer that may be quite
different from the data distribution under the current policy. We argue that

distribution of the data collected by the behavior and target policies. This
data distribution shift between current and past samples can significantly
impact the performance of most modern off-policy based policy optimization
algorithms. In this work, we first do a systematic analysis of state
distribution mismatch in off-policy learning, and then develop a novel
off-policy policy optimization method to constraint the state distribution
shift. To do this, we first estimate the state distribution based on features
of the state, using a density estimator and then develop a novel constrained

challenges, we are inspired by a classical spatial data structure from computer
graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to facilitate 3D learning. The core
ingredient of BSP is an operation for recursive subdivision of space to obtain
convex sets. By exploiting this property, we devise BSP-Net, a network that
learns to represent a 3D shape via convex decomposition. Importantly, BSP-Net
is unsupervised since no convex shape decompositions are needed for training.
The network is trained to reconstruct a shape using a set of convexes obtained
from a BSP-tree built on a set of planes. The convexes inferred by BSP-Net can
be easily extracted to form a polygon mesh, without any need for iso-surfacing.
The generated meshes are compact (i.e., low-poly) and well suited to represent
sharp geometry; they are guaranteed to be watertight and can be easily
parameterized. We also show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net is
competitive with state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer primitives.

a tremendous experimental effort in different laboratories worldwide to measure
the relevant nuclear physics input quantities, namely ($n,\gamma$) cross
sections over the stellar temperature range (from few eV up to several hundred
keV) for most of the isotopes involved from Fe up to Bi. A brief historical
review focused on total energy detectors will be presented to illustrate how,
advances in instrumentation have led, over the years, to the assessment and
discovery of many new aspects of $s$-process nucleosynthesis and to the
progressive refinement of theoretical models of stellar evolution. A summary
will be presented on current efforts to develop new detection concepts, such as
the Total-Energy Detector with $\gamma$-ray imaging capability (i-TED). The
latter is based on the simultaneous combination of Compton imaging with neutron

plane of benzene. The high-frequency oscillating electric field creates
circular currents centered at each atom with a circle radius equal to the
maximum field amplitude of the laser. All six carbons have six such rings. For
a maximum field amplitude of 1.42 {\AA}, which is the carbon-carbon bond
distance, all six dynamic current circles intersect to create a deep vortex in
the middle, which supports a bound state of a pair of electrons. Such states
for benzene can be realized in experiments using a circularly polarized
XUV-laser in a range of intensities 10^16-10^17 W/cm^2 and frequencies 16 eV to
22 eV. Electronic dynamics calculations predict a minimal ionization of benzene
when the rise-time of the laser pulse is sudden, indicating a possible
experimental realization of these states characterized by a large cut-off in
the harmonic generation spectra. This stable electronic structure of the

calls for larger SCP with increasing height, however, it causes serious swing

main aim of this paper is to analyze the nonlinear dynamics in the FSRL system
of the SCP. A mathematical model for the swing motion of the FSRL system is
derived. The influence of relevant parameters, such as system damping,
excitation amplitude and rotation speed, on the stability and the responses of
the system are analyzed. The stability of the equilibrium, bifurcation and
chaotic motion are demonstrated, which are often observed in practical
situations. Melnikov method is used to derive the possible parameter region
that leads to chaotic motion. Three routes to chaos are identified in the FSRL
system, including period doubling, symmetry-breaking bifurcation and interior
crisis. The work in this paper explains the complex dynamics in the FSRL system

monitoring tend to generate massive amounts of data, which should be compressed

compression. A few compression methods based on lossy compression have been
proposed to compress this seemingly incompressible data. Unfortunately, they
are all designed to minimize the Euclidean distance between the original data
and the decompressed data, which fundamentally limits compression performance.
We recently proposed a new class of lossy compression based on statistical
similarity, called IDEALEM, which was also provided as a software package.
IDEALEM has demonstrated its performance by reducing data volume much more than
state-of-the-art compression methods while preserving unique patterns of data.
IDEALEM can operate in two different modes depending on the stationarity of
input data. This paper presents compression performance analyses of these two
modes, and investigates the difference between two transform techniques
targeted for non-stationary data. This paper also discusses the data
reconstruction quality of IDEALEM using spectral analysis and shows that
important frequency components in application domain are well preserved. We
expand the capability of IDEALEM by adding a new min/max check that facilitates
preserving significant patterns lasting only for a brief duration which were
previously hard to capture. This min/max check also accelerates the encoding
process significantly. Experiments show IDEALEM preserves significant patterns
in the original data with faster encoding time.

based on the first-principles calculations and phonon Boltzmann transport
equations, we find the replacement of Zr with heavy element Hf in ZrNCl doesn't
reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, instead, it surprisingly increases by
about 4 times at 300K. This unusual lattice thermal conductivity is mainly
attributed to the dramatic enhancement in phonon lifetimes in Hf compound,

Josephson Junctions coupled to a linear $RLC$ resonator. The junction are
hysteretic, and hence can be considered birhythmic, that is capable to
oscillate at different frequencies for the same set of parameters. Both
Josephson Junctions with identical and disordered parameters are considered.
With the uniform parameters, the array behaves similarly to single Josephson
junctions, also in the presence of noise. The magnitude of the effective energy
that characterizes the response to noise becomes smaller as the number of
elements of the array increases, making the resonator less stable. Disorder in
the parameters drastically changes the physics of the array. The disordered
array of Josephson junctions misses the birhythmicity properties for large
values of the variance of the disorder parameter. Nevertheless, the system
remains birhythmic for low values of the disorder parameter. Finally, disorder
makes it difficult to locate the separatrix, hinting to a more complex
structure of the effective energy landscape.

  Approach","ICML 2020",,,,"cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of the limited-bandwidth communication for
multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents cooperate with the assistance
of a communication protocol and a scheduler. The protocol and scheduler jointly
determine which agent is communicating what message and to whom. Under the
limited bandwidth constraint, a communication protocol is required to generate
informative messages. Meanwhile, an unnecessary communication connection should
not be established because it occupies limited resources in vain. In this
paper, we develop an Informative Multi-Agent Communication (IMAC) method to
learn efficient communication protocols as well as scheduling. First, from the
perspective of communication theory, we prove that the limited bandwidth
constraint requires low-entropy messages throughout the transmission. Then
inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we learn a valuable and
compact communication protocol and a weight-based scheduler. To demonstrate the
efficiency of our method, we conduct extensive experiments in various
cooperative and competitive multi-agent tasks with different numbers of agents
and different bandwidths. We show that IMAC converges faster and leads to
efficient communication among agents under the limited bandwidth as compared to

incorporated the wisdom of human experts, which is an important reason for
CNN's success. However, the design of the architectures is a difficult problem,

Moreover, the architecture designed by hand might be suboptimal, because it is

customized for PolSAR classification. The proposed DAS is equipped with a
PolSAR tailored search space and an improved one-shot search strategy. By DAS,
the weights parameters and architecture parameters (corresponds to the
hyperparameters but not the topologies) can be optimized by stochastic gradient
descent method during the training. The optimized architecture parameters
should be transformed into corresponding CNN architecture and re-train to
achieve high-precision PolSAR classification. In addition, complex-valued DAS

central black holes in galaxies can destroy short bars, when the black hole
reaches a mass of $\sim 0.1\%$ of the total stellar mass of the galaxy. We
study $N$-body simulations of galaxies with single and double bars to track the
long-term evolution of the central stellar mass distribution. We find that the
destruction of the short bar contributes significantly to the growth of the
bulge. The final bulge mass is roughly equal to the sum of the masses of the
initial pseudo bulge and short bar. The initially boxy/peanut-shaped bulge of
S\'ersic index $n\lesssim1$ is transformed into a more massive, compact

morphology ($n \approx 2$), kinematics (dispersion-dominated, isotropic), and
location on standard scaling relations (Kormendy relation, mass-size relation,

outstanding performances in both unsupervised and (semi-)supervised tasks.
Among the state-of-the-art methods is the AutoEncoding Transformations (AET) by
decoding transformations from the learned representations of original and
transformed images. Both deterministic and probabilistic AETs rely on the
Euclidean distance to measure the deviation of estimated transformations from
their groundtruth counterparts. However, this assumption is questionable as a
group of transformations often reside on a curved manifold rather staying in a
flat Euclidean space. For this reason, we should use the geodesic to
characterize how an image transform along the manifold of a transformation
group, and adopt its length to measure the deviation between transformations.
Particularly, we present to autoencode a Lie group of homography
transformations PG(2) to learn image representations. For this, we make an
estimate of the intractable Riemannian logarithm by projecting PG(2) to a
subgroup of rotation transformations SO(3) that allows the closed-form

the magnon Hall and Nernst conductivities. Gapped flat bands appear in a
continuum of magic angles in tFBL with DMI. In the lower limit of the

Experimental
observations indicate that several mechanisms are activated during the recovery
of functional activity after a stroke. Here we unveil how the brain recovers by
explaining the role played by three mechanisms: Plastic adaptation,
hyperexcitability and synaptogenesis. We consider two different damages in a
neural network: A diffuse damage that simply causes the reduction of the
effective system size and a localized damage, a stroke, that strongly alters
the spontaneous activity of the system. Recovery mechanisms observed
experimentally are implemented both separately and in a combined way.
Interestingly, each mechanism contributes to the recovery to a limited extent.
Only the combined application of all three together is able to recover the
spontaneous activity of the undamaged system. This explains why the brain
triggers independent mechanisms, whose cooperation is the fundamental
ingredient for the system recovery.

of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and
better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the
effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a
step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that
the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find
that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward
normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,
we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase
the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a
simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain
outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art
performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem,
we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by
replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments
show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of

Specifically, we propose a two-stage kin-face generation model to predict the

generative adversarial autoencoder conditioned on ages and genders to map
between facial appearance and high-level features. The second stage is our
proposed DNA-Net, which serves as a transformation between the deep and genetic

form the genes of a child. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method quantitatively and qualitatively: quantitatively, pre-trained models and
human subjects perform kinship verification on the generated images of
children; qualitatively, we show photo-realistic face images of children that
closely resemble the given pair of parents. In the end, experiments validate
that the proposed model synthesizes convincing kin-faces using both subjective

important role in modern machine learning-- yet, adversarial attacks on

In this paper, we seek to bridge this gap by proposing a black-box adversarial
attack for clustering models for linearly separable clusters. Our attack works
by perturbing a single sample close to the decision boundary, which leads to
the misclustering of multiple unperturbed samples, named spill-over adversarial
samples. We theoretically show the existence of such adversarial samples for
the K-Means clustering. Our attack is especially strong as (1) we ensure the
perturbed sample is not an outlier, hence not detectable, and (2) the exact
metric used for clustering is not known to the attacker. We theoretically
justify that the attack can indeed be successful without the knowledge of the
true metric. We conclude by providing empirical results on a number of
datasets, and clustering algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that generates spill-over adversarial samples without the knowledge
of the true metric ensuring that the perturbed sample is not an outlier, and
theoretically proves the above.

propose a secure communication scheme in which information data is precoded
onto dominant angle components of the sparse channel through a limited number
of radio-frequency (RF) chains, while artificial noise (AN) is broadcast over
the remaining nondominant angles interfering only with the eavesdropper with a
high probability. It is shown that the channel sparsity plays a fundamental
role analogous to secret keys in achieving secure communication. Hence, by
defining two statistical measures of the channel sparsity, we analytically
characterize its impact on secrecy rate. In particular, a substantial
improvement on secrecy rate can be obtained by the proposed scheme due to the
uncertainty, i.e., ""entropy"", introduced by the channel sparsity which is
unknown to the eavesdropper. It is revealed that sparsity in the power domain
can always contribute to the secrecy rate. In contrast, in the angle domain,
there exists an optimal level of sparsity that maximizes the secrecy rate. The
effectiveness of the proposed scheme and derived results are verified by

cannot be fixed by evaluating at a fixed number of samples. This means all

ON8.5 Vn dwarf with a projected equatorial rotational velocity of $v_{\textrm

close to equator-on, while ON dwarfs with lower $v_{\textrm e}\sin{i}$ values
are viewed more nearly pole-on. Combining parallaxes and proper motions from

computational cost of deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to
static methods (e.g. weight pruning), dynamic inference adaptively adjusts the
inference process according to each input sample, which can considerably reduce
the computational cost on ""easy"" samples while maintaining the overall model
performance. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, S2DNAS, which can
transform various static CNN models to support dynamic inference via neural
architecture search. To this end, based on a given CNN model, we first generate
a CNN architecture space in which each architecture is a multi-stage CNN
generated from the given model using some predefined transformations. Then, we
propose a reinforcement learning based approach to automatically search for the
optimal CNN architecture in the generated space. At last, with the searched
multi-stage network, we can perform dynamic inference by adaptively choosing a
stage to evaluate for each sample. Unlike previous works that introduce
irregular computations or complex controllers in the inference or re-design a
CNN model from scratch, our method can generalize to most of the popular CNN
architectures and the searched dynamic network can be directly deployed using
existing deep learning frameworks in various hardware devices.

typically required. This manual initialization interferes with the surgical
workflow and diminishes any advantages gained from navigation. We propose a
method for fully automatic registration using annotations produced by a neural
network. Neural networks are trained to simultaneously segment anatomy and
identify landmarks in fluoroscopy. Training data is obtained using an
intraoperatively incompatible 2D/3D registration of hip anatomy. Ground truth
2D labels are established using projected 3D annotations. Intraoperative
registration couples an intensity-based strategy with annotations inferred by
the network and requires no human assistance. Ground truth labels were obtained
in 366 fluoroscopic images across 6 cadaveric specimens. In a
leave-one-subject-out experiment, networks obtained mean dice coefficients for
left and right hemipelves, left and right femurs of 0.86, 0.87, 0.90, and 0.84.
The mean 2D landmark error was 5.0 mm. The pelvis was registered within 1
degree for 86% of the images when using the proposed intraoperative approach
with an average runtime of 7 seconds. In comparison, an intensity-only approach
without manual initialization, registered the pelvis to 1 degree in 18% of
images. We have created the first accurately annotated, non-synthetic, dataset
of hip fluoroscopy. By using these annotations as training data for neural
networks, state of the art performance in fluoroscopic segmentation and
landmark localization was achieved. Integrating these annotations allows for a
robust, fully automatic, and efficient intraoperative registration during
fluoroscopic navigation of the hip.

devices. As a result, the Web runtime system must simultaneously address two
challenges: responsiveness and energy-efficiency. Conventional Web runtime
systems fall short due to their reactive nature: they react to a user event
only after it is triggered. The reactive strategy leads to local optimizations
that schedule event executions one at a time, missing global optimization
opportunities. This paper proposes Proactive Event Scheduling (PES). The key
idea of PES is to proactively anticipate future events and thereby globally
coordinate scheduling decisions across events. Specifically, PES predicts
events that are likely to happen in the near future using a combination of
statistical inference and application code analysis. PES then speculatively
executes future events ahead of time in a way that satisfies the QoS
constraints of all the events while minimizing the global energy consumption.
Fundamentally, PES unlocks more optimization opportunities by enlarging the
scheduling window, which enables coordination across both outstanding events
and predicted events. Hardware measurements show that PES reduces the QoS
violation and energy consumption by 61.2% and 26.5%, respectively, over the
Android default Interactive CPU governor. It also reduces the QoS violation and
energy consumption by 63.1% and 17.9%, respectively, compared to EBS, a
state-of-the-art reactive scheduler.

Scaling up the integrated devices for quantum applications requires
highperformance single-photon generation and photonic qubit-qubit entangling
operations. However, previous demonstrations report major challenges in
producing multiple bright, pure and identical single-photons, and entangling
multiple photonic qubits with high fidelity. Another notable challenge is to
noiselessly interface multiphoton sources and multiqubit operators in a single
device. Here we demonstrate on-chip genuine multipartite entanglement and
quantum teleportation in silicon, by coherently controlling an integrated
network of microresonator nonlinear single-photon sources and linear-optic
multiqubit entangling circuits. The microresonators are engineered to locally
enhance the nonlinearity, producing multiple frequencyuncorrelated and
indistinguishable single-photons, without requiring any spectral filtering. The
multiqubit states are processed in a programmable linear circuit facilitating
Bell-projection and fusion operation in a measurement-based manner. We
benchmark key functionalities, such as intra-/inter-chip teleportation of
quantum states, and generation of four-photon Greenberger-HorneZeilinger

achieved in micrometer-scale silicon chips, fabricated by complementary

stereo vision system that simultaneously improves both performance and
energy-efficiency while achieving high accuracy. The key to ASV is to exploit
unique characteristics inherent to stereo vision, and apply stereo-specific
optimizations, both algorithmically and computationally. We make two
contributions. Firstly, we propose a new stereo algorithm, invariant-based
stereo matching (ISM), that achieves significant speedup while retaining high
accuracy. The algorithm combines classic ""hand-crafted"" stereo algorithms with
recent developments in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), by leveraging the
correspondence invariant unique to stereo vision systems. Secondly, we observe
that the bottleneck of the ISM algorithm is the DNN inference, and in
particular the deconvolution operations that introduce massive
compute-inefficiencies. We propose a set of software optimizations that
mitigate these inefficiencies. We show that with less than 0.5% hardware area
overhead, these algorithmic and computational optimizations can be effectively
integrated within a conventional DNN accelerator. Overall, ASV achieves 5x
speedup and 85% energy saving with 0.02% accuracy loss compared to today

velocity measurements with multi-mode fiber-fed high-resolution spectrographs.
Traditionally, modal noise is mitigated by agitating the fiber, this way
redistributing the light that propagates in the fiber over many different
modes. However, in case of fibers with only a limited number of modes, e.g. at
near-infrared wavelengths or in adaptive-optics assisted systems, this method
becomes very inefficient. The strong agitation that would be needed stresses
the fiber and can lead to focal ratio degradation. As an alternative approach,
we propose to use a classic optical double scrambler and to rotate the
scrambler's first fiber end during each exposure. Because of the rotating
illumination pattern of the scrambler's second fiber, the modes that are
excited vary continuously. This leads to very efficient averaging of the modal
pattern at the fiber exit and to a strong reduction of modal noise. In this
contribution, we present a prototype design and first laboratory results of the

potential to simplify mission planning by allowing asteroid body-fixed hovering

simplifies shape model generation and allows resource mapping via remote

sample drawn from a probability distribution with learnt mean and variance.
This paper elaborates on a hardware design that exploits cycle-to-cycle

rogue waves in a three component dusty plasma system (containing inertial warm
ion and negatively charged dust fluids along with inertialess $q$-distributed
electrons) has been theoretically investigated. A nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger
equation (NLSE) has been derived by employing the reductive perturbation
method. It is observed that the dusty plasma system under consideration
supports the fast and slow DIA modes, and that the dispersion and nonlinear
coefficients of the NLSE determine the parametric regimes not only for the
modulationally stable and unstable fast DIA mode, but also for the formation of
the DIA rogue waves. The parametric regimes for the modulational instability of
the fast DIA mode, and the criterion for the formation of the DIA rogue waves
have been found to be significantly modified by the effects of the relevant
plasma parameters, particularly, mass and charge state of ion and dust species,
number density of the plasma species, and non-extensive parameter $q$, etc. It
is found that the modulationally stable parametric regime decreases (increases)
with the increase in the value of positive (negative) $q$. The numerical
analysis has also shown that the nonlinearity as well as the amplitude and
width of the rogue waves increases (decreases) with the mass of positive ion
(negative dust grains) while decreases (increases) with the charge state of the
positive ion (negative dust). The applications of our present work in space
(viz., Earth ionosphere, magnetosphere, molecular clouds, interstellar medium,
cometary tails, and planetary rings, etc.) and laboratory plasmas have been
pinpointed.

fertile bi-directional interactions. On the one hand, important inspiration for

from artificial intelligence research. A central question at the intersection
of these two areas is concerned with the processes by which neocortex learns,
and the extent to which they are analogous to the back-propagation training

generalization properties of neocortical learning remains an area of active
research in the field of deep learning. Recent advances in our understanding of
neuronal, synaptic and dendritic physiology of the neocortex suggest new
approaches for unsupervised representation learning, perhaps through a new
class of objective functions, which could act alongside or in lieu of
back-propagation. Such local learning rules have implicit rather than explicit
objectives with respect to the training data, facilitating domain adaptation
and generalization. Incorporating them into deep networks for representation
learning could better leverage unlabelled datasets to offer significant
improvements in data efficiency of downstream supervised readout learning, and
reduce susceptibility to adversarial perturbations, at the cost of a more

research and led to impressive performance in various difficult tasks. However,
it is still unclear how the brain can perform credit assignment across many
areas as efficiently as backpropagation does in deep neural networks. In this
paper, we introduce a model that relies on a new role for a neuronal inhibitory
machinery, referred to as ghost units. By cancelling the feedback coming from
the upper layer when no target signal is provided to the top layer, the ghost
units enables the network to backpropagate errors and do efficient credit
assignment in deep structures. While considering one-compartment neurons and
requiring very few biological assumptions, it is able to approximate the error
gradient and achieve good performance on classification tasks. Error
backpropagation occurs through the recurrent dynamics of the network and thanks
to biologically plausible local learning rules. In particular, it does not
require separate feedforward and feedback circuits. Different mechanisms for
cancelling the feedback were studied, ranging from complete duplication of the
connectivity by long term processes to online replication of the feedback
activity. This reduced system combines the essential elements to have a working
biologically abstracted analogue of backpropagation with a simple formulation
and proofs of the associated results. Therefore, this model is a step towards
understanding how learning and memory are implemented in cortical multilayer
structures, but it also raises interesting perspectives for neuromorphic
hardware.

standard quantum-mechanical evolution and not calculable from Schr\""odinger's

collapse: one called the ""consistent"" or ""decoherent"" histories approach and
the other, the ""environmental decoherence"" approach, which studies the effect

In the ""environmental decoherence"" approach, one usually studies a
Markovian-approximated Master equation to study the time-evolution of reduced
density matrix and obtains the long-term dependence of the off-diagonal
elements of this matrix. We do not make a Markovian assumption and study a
particularly simple and calculable example. We find, the short-time behavior of

introduced by ref. Deep Learning Model for Finding New Superconductors, which
utilizes deep learning to read the periodic table and the laws of the elements,
is applicable not only for superconductors, for which the method was originally
applied but also for other problems of materials by demonstrating band gap
estimations. We then extended the method to learn the laws better by directly
learning the cylindrical periodicity between the right- and left-most columns
in the periodic table at the learning representation level, that is, by
considering the left- and right-most columns to be adjacent to each other.
Thus, while the original method handles the table as is, the extended method
treats the periodic table as if its two edges are connected. This is achieved
using novel layers named periodic convolution layers, which can handle inputs
exhibiting periodicity and may be applied to other problems related to computer
vision, time series, and so on for data that possess some periodicity. In the
reading periodic table method, no material feature or descriptor is required as
input. We demonstrated two types of deep learning estimation: methods to
estimate the existence of a bandgap, and methods to estimate the value of the
bandgap given when the existence of the bandgap in the materials is known.
