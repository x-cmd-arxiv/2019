during many cycles. Recent multi spacecraft observations of coronal bright
points revealed slow retrograde toroidal phase drift (with the speed of 3 m/s
of 1 yr oscillations, which naturally suggested their connection with
Rossby-type waves in the interior. We have studied from a theoretical point of
view the dynamics of global magneto-Kelvin and magneto-Rossby waves in the
solar tachocline with toroidal magnetic field. Using spherical coordinates, the
dispersion relations of the waves and latitudinal structure of solutions were
obtained analytically. We have also obtained the spectrum of unstable
magneto-Rossby wave harmonics in the presence of the latitudinal differential
rotation. Estimated periods and phase speeds show that the magneto-Rossby waves
rather than the Kelvin waves match with the observations of 1 yr oscillations.
On the other hand, Morlet wavelet analysis of Greenwich Royal Observatory
sunspot areas for the solar cycle 23 has revealed multiple periodicities with
periods of 450-460 days, 370-380 days, 310-320 days, 240-270 days, and 150-175
days in hemispheric and full disk data. Comparison of theoretical results with
the observations allow us to conclude that the global magneto-Kelvin waves in
the upper overshoot tachocline may be responsible for the periodicity of
450-460 days (1.3 yrs), while the remaining periods can be connected with
different harmonics of global fast magneto-Rossby waves.

for searching deviations of Newton's inverse square law in ocean. In the
context of non-minimally coupled curvature-matter theory of gravity the results
of Zumberge et al. can be used to obtain an upper bound both on the strength
$\alpha$ and range $\lambda$ of the Yukawa potential arising from the
non-relativistic limit of the non-minimally coupled theory. The existence of an
upper bound on $\lambda$ is related to the presence of an extra force, specific
of the nonminimally coupled theory, which depends on $\lambda$ and on the
gradient of mass density, and has an effect in the ocean because of
compressibility of seawater.
  These results can be achieved after a suitable treatment of the conversion of
pressure to depth in the ocean by resorting to the equation of state of
seawater and taking into account the effect of the extra force on hydrostatic
equilibrium. If the sole Yukawa interaction were present the experiment would
yield only a bound on $\alpha$, while, in the presence of the extra force we
find an upper bound on the range: $\lambda_{\rm max}= 57.4$ km. In the interval
$1 \,{\rm m}<\lambda<\lambda_{\rm max}$ the upper bound on $\alpha$ is
consistent with the constraint $\alpha<0.002$ found in Zumberge et al.

expansion (FHEE-DE) scheme for reversible data hiding in encrypted domain
(RDH-ED). In the proposed scheme, we use key-switching and bootstrapping
techniques to control the ciphertext extension and decryption failure. To
realize the data extraction directly from the encrypted domain without the
private key, a key-switching based least-significant-bit (KS-LSB) data hiding
method has been designed. In application, the user first encrypts the plaintext
and uploads ciphertext to the server. Then the server performs data hiding by
FHEE-DE and KS-LSB to obtain the marked ciphertext. Additional data can be
extracted directly from the marked ciphertext by the server without the private
key. The user can decrypt the marked ciphertext to obtain the marked plaintext.
Then additional data or plaintext can be obtained from the marked plaintext by
using the standard DE extraction or recovery. A fidelity constraint of DE is
introduced to reduce the distortion of the marked plaintext. FHEE-DE enables
the server to implement FHEE-DE recovery or extraction on the marked
ciphertext, which returns the ciphertext of original plaintext or additional
data to the user. In addition, we simplified the homomorphic operations of the
proposed universal FHEE-DE to obtain an efficient version. The Experimental
results demonstrate that the embedding capacity, fidelity, and reversibility of
the proposed scheme are superior to existing RDH-ED methods, and fully
separability is achieved without reducing the security of encryption.

global dynamics elevates many particles into excited states, and can lead to
macroscopic entanglement and the failure of tensor networks. Here, we show that
for quantum transport -- one of the most important cases of this failure -- the
fundamental issue is the canonical basis in which the scenario is cast: When
particles flow through an interface, they scatter, generating a ""bit"" of
entanglement between spatial regions with each event. The frequency basis
naturally captures that -- in the long-time limit and in the absence of
inelastic scattering -- particles tend to flow from a state with one frequency
to a state of identical frequency. Recognizing this natural structure yields a
striking -- potentially exponential in some cases -- increase in simulation
efficiency, greatly extending the attainable spatial- and time-scales, and
broadening the scope of tensor network simulation to hitherto inaccessible
classes of non-equilibrium many-body problems.

relation of collaborative similarity. Nevertheless, there exist multiple
relations between items in real-world scenarios. Distinct from the
collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user
perspective, these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from
different perspectives of meta-data, functionality, etc. However, how to
incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation
research. In this work, we propose Relational Collaborative Filtering (RCF), a
general framework to exploit multiple relations between items in recommender

in inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level hierarchical
attention mechanism to model user preference. The first-level attention
discriminates which types of relations are more important, and the second-level
attention considers the specific relation values to estimate the contribution
of a historical item in recommending the target item. To make the item
embeddings be reflective of the relational structure between items, we further
formulate a task to preserve the item relations, and jointly train it with the
recommendation task of preference modeling. Empirical results on two real
datasets demonstrate the strong performance of RCF. Furthermore, we also
conduct qualitative analyses to show the benefits of explanations brought by
the modeling of multiple item relations.

dependence arises from the oscillation of a scalar field with a non-zero mass.
We systematically explore the scalar profile around the black hole for
different scalar masses. In the small mass limit, the scalar field has a $1/r$
component at large radius $r$, consistent with Jacobson's result. In the large
mass limit (with the Compton wavelength of order of the horizon or smaller),
the scalar field has a $1/r^{3/4}$ profile yielding a pile-up close to the

information about the dark matter particle mass. As an application, we consider
the case of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, recently imaged
by the Event Horizon Telescope. Its horizon size is roughly the Compton
wavelength of a scalar particle of mass $10^{-20}$ eV. We consider the
implications of the expected scalar pile-up close to the horizon, for fuzzy

obtained from the rank function using the unary numeral system. Both
persistence diagrams and graded persistence diagrams are integer-valued
functions on the Cartesian plane. Whereas the persistence diagram takes
non-negative values, the graded persistence diagram takes values of 0, 1, or
-1. The sum of the graded persistence diagrams is the persistence diagram. We
show that the positive and negative points in the k-th graded persistence
diagram correspond to the local maxima and minima, respectively, of the k-th
persistence landscape. We prove a stability theorem for graded persistence
diagrams: the 1-Wasserstein distance between k-th graded persistence diagrams
is bounded by twice the 1-Wasserstein distance between the corresponding
persistence diagrams, and this bound is attained. In the other direction, the
1-Wasserstein distance is a lower bound for the sum of the 1-Wasserstein
distances between the k-th graded persistence diagrams. In fact, the
1-Wasserstein distance for graded persistence diagrams is more discriminative
than the 1-Wasserstein distance for the corresponding persistence diagrams.

The proposed model also reveals the effect of ferroelectric thickness on the
dynamic pull-in and pull-out voltages and the effect of ferroelectric damping
on the energy dissipated during actuation. We infer from our analysis that the
hybrid actuators are better than the standalone MEMS actuators in terms of
operating voltage and energy dissipation. Further, we show that one can
trade-off a small part of the reduction in actuation voltage to achieve
identical pull-in times in the hybrid and standalone MEMS actuators, while
still consuming substantially lower energy in the former as compared to the

it suitable for analysis and evaluation of various heterogeneous systems

(Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) on a uniformly growing/contracting domain. Our
starting point is a recently derived fractional Fokker-Planck equation, which
covers both the case of Brownian diffusion and the case of a subdiffusive
Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW). We find a high sensitivity of the random
walk properties to the details of the domain growth rate, which gives rise to a
variety of regimes with extremely different behaviors. At the origin of this
rich phenomenology is the fact that the walkers still move while they wait to
jump, since they are dragged by the deterministic drift arising from the domain
growth. Thus, the increasingly long waiting times associated with the ageing of
the subdiffusive CTRW imply that, in the time interval between two consecutive
jumps, the walkers might travel over much longer distances than in the normal
diffusive case. This gives rise to seemingly counterintuitive effects. For
example, on a static domain, both Brownian diffusion and subdiffusive CTRWs
yield a stationary particle distribution with finite width when a harmonic
potential is at play, thus indicating a confinement of the diffusing particle.
However, for a sufficiently fast growing/contracting domain, this qualitative
behavior breaks down, and differences between the Brownian case and the
subdiffusive case are found. In the case of Brownian particles, a sufficiently
fast exponential domain growth is needed to break the confinement induced by
the harmonic force; in contrast, for subdiffusive particles such a breakdown
may already take place for a sufficiently fast power-law domain growth. Our
analytic and numerical results for both types of diffusion are fully confirmed
by random walk simulations.

main source of uncertainty for any subtraction algorithm. Aiming at mitigating
the effect of such fluctuations, we present a new method to estimate the
background contribution to the transverse momentum on a jet-by-jet basis. Our
approach is based on estimating the median background momentum density stored
above a $p_{\rm T}$-cut applied at the constituent level and an experimentally
accessible correction term related to the signal contribution below the cut.
This allows to trade part of the uncertainty due to background contamination
for that of the signal below the cut, similarly to SoftKiller method. We
propose to reduce the fluctuations of the latter by exploiting intrinsic
correlations among the soft and hard sectors of QCD jets. Our data-driven
approach is tested against PYTHIA8 and JEWEL di-jet events embedded in a

Wave Approach (RCWA) for s-polarized monochromatic incident light. The RCWA is
widely used to solve electromagnetic boundary-value problems where the relative
permittivity varies periodically in one direction, i.e., scattering by a
grating. This semi-analytical approach expands all the electromagnetic field
phasors as well as the relative permittivity as Fourier series in the spatial
variable along the direction of periodicity, and also replaces the relative
permittivity with a stairstep approximation along the direction normal to the
direction of periodicity. Thus, there is error due to Fourier truncation and
also due to the approximation of grating permittivity. We prove that the RCWA
is a Galerkin scheme, which allows us to employ techniques borrowed from the
Finite Element Method to analyze the error. An essential tool is a Rellich
identity that shows that certain continuous problems have unique solutions that
depend continuously on the data with a continuity constant having explicit
dependence on the relative permittivity. We prove that the RCWA converges with
an increasing number of retained Fourier modes and with a finer approximation
of the grating interfaces. Numerical results show that our convergence results
for increasing the number of retained Fourier modes are seen in practice, while
our estimates of convergence in slice thickness are pessimistic.

${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ superstring and generalized supergravity. We
start to give a brief review of the ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ superstring
formulated in the Green-Schwartz formalism, and then introduce homogeneous
Yang-Baxter (YB) deformation of the ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ superstring
based on $r$-matrices which are solutions to the homogeneous classical YB
equation. By performing a supercoset construction, we derive the general
formula for homogeneous YB deformed backgrounds associated with bosonic
$r$-matrices. The deformed backgrounds are shown to be solutions of the
standard type IIB supergravity or generalized supergravity. Next, we explain
that homogeneous YB deformation can be regarded as a kind of the $O(d,d)$
duality transformations. Once YB deformations are realized as duality
transformations, the corresponding $O(d,d)$ transformations are applied to
almost all backgrounds. Moreover, we discuss spacetime structures of
homogeneous YB deformed backgrounds and clarify a T-fold structure of them by
showing the associated $O(d,d; \mathbb{Z})$ $T$-duality monodromy. Finally, we
consider the Weyl invariance of string theories in generalized supergravity
backgrounds. We show that generalized supergravity can be reproduced from
double field theory with the dilaton depending on a linear dual coordinate.
From this result, we construct a possible counterterm to cancel out the Weyl
anomaly of bosonic string theories on generalized supergravity backgrounds. In
particular, we show that the counterterm is definitely local. In this sense,
string theories can be consistently defined in generalized supergravity
backgrounds.

optimization problems are well characterized, where the majority of results
utilize iterate averaged stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with polynomially
decaying step sizes. In contrast, SGD's final iterate behavior has received
much less attention despite their widespread use in practice. Motivated by this
observation, this work provides a detailed study of the following question:
what rate is achievable using the final iterate of SGD for the streaming least
squares regression problem with and without strong convexity?
  First, this work shows that even if the time horizon T (i.e. the number of
iterations SGD is run for) is known in advance, SGD's final iterate behavior
with any polynomially decaying learning rate scheme is highly sub-optimal
compared to the minimax rate (by a condition number factor in the strongly
convex case and a factor of $\sqrt{T}$ in the non-strongly convex case). In
contrast, this paper shows that Step Decay schedules, which cut the learning
rate by a constant factor every constant number of epochs (i.e., the learning
rate decays geometrically) offers significant improvements over any
polynomially decaying step sizes. In particular, the final iterate behavior
with a step decay schedule is off the minimax rate by only $log$ factors (in
the condition number for strongly convex case, and in T for the non-strongly
convex case). Finally, in stark contrast to the known horizon case, this paper
shows that the anytime (i.e. the limiting) behavior of SGD's final iterate is
poor (in that it queries iterates with highly sub-optimal function value
infinitely often, i.e. in a limsup sense) irrespective of the stepsizes
employed. These results demonstrate the subtlety in establishing optimal
learning rate schemes (for the final iterate) for stochastic gradient
procedures in fixed time horizon settings.

important ingredient in factorized predictions for inclusive jet mass cross
sections initiated by massive quarks emerging from a hard interaction with
smooth quark mass dependence. Due to the effects coming from the secondary
production of massive quark-antiquark pairs there are two options to define the
SCET jet function, which we call universal and mass mode jet functions. They
are related to whether or not a soft mass mode (zero) bin subtraction is
applied for the secondary massive quark contributions and differ in particular
concerning the infrared behavior for vanishing quark mass. We advocate that a
useful alternative to the common zero-bin subtraction concept is to define the
SCET jet functions through subtractions related to collinear-soft matrix
elements. This avoids the need to impose additional power counting arguments as
required for zero-bin subtractions. We demonstrate how the two SCET jet
function definitions may be used in the context of two recently developed
factorization approaches to treat secondary massive quark effects. We clarify
the relation between these approaches and in which way they are equivalent. Our
two-loop calculation involves interesting technical subtleties related to
spurious rapidity divergences and infrared regularization in the presence of

hours. In this work, we use Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs)
to generate new high-resolution ($35~h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$) 3D realizations of
cosmic HI at $z=5$. We do so by sampling from a 100-dimension manifold, learned

through giant planetary impacts. We make use of smooth particle hydrodynamical
(SPH) collision simulations and survey a large phase-space of
terrestrial/super-terrestrial planetary collisions. We characterize the
properties of such collisions, finding one rare case in which an exomoon forms
through a graze&capture scenario, in addition to a few graze&merge or hit&run
scenarios. Typically however, our collisions form massive circumplanetary
discs, for which we use follow-up N-body simulations in order to derive
lower-limit mass estimates for the ensuing exomoons. We investigate the mass,
long-term tidal-stability, composition and origin of material in both the discs
and the exomoons. Our giant-impact models often generate relatively iron-rich
moons, that form beyond the synchronous radius of the planet, and would thus
tidally evolve outward with stable orbits, rather than be destroyed. Our
results suggest that it is extremely difficult to collisionally form
currently-detectable exomoons orbiting super-terrestrial planets, through
single giant impacts. It might be possible to form massive, detectable exomoons
through several mergers of smaller exomoons, formed by multiple impacts,
however more studies are required in order to reach a conclusion. Given the
current observational initiatives, the search should focus primarily on more
massive planet categories. However, about a quarter of the exomoons predicted

to be detectable given a factor 2 improvement in the detection capability of

galaxy morphology and star formation in central galaxies with stellar masses in
the range $10^9-10^{11.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We quantify galaxy morphology by
a kinematical decomposition of the stellar component into a spheroidal and a
disc component (spheroid-to-total ratio, S/T) and by the concentration of the
stellar mass density profile ($C_{82}$). S/T is correlated with stellar mass
and star-formation activity, while $C_{82}$ correlates only with stellar mass.
Overall, we find good agreement with observational estimates for both S/T and
$C_{82}$. Low and high mass galaxies are dominated by random stellar motion,
while only intermediate-mass galaxies
($M_{\star}\approx10^{10}-10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) are dominated by
ordered rotation. Whereas higher-mass galaxies are typical spheroids with high
concentrations, lower-mass galaxies have low concentration, pointing to
different formation channels. Although we find a correlation between S/T and
star-formation activity, in the TNG model galaxies do not necessarily change
their morphology when they transition through the green valley or when they
cease their star formation, this depending on galaxy stellar mass and
morphological estimator. Instead, the morphology (S/T and $C_{82}$) is
generally set during the star-forming phase of galaxies. The apparent
correlation between S/T and star formation arises because earlier-forming
galaxies had, on average, a higher S/T at a given stellar mass. Furthermore, we
show that mergers drive in-situ bulge formation in intermediate-mass galaxies
and are responsible for the recent spheroidal mass assembly in the massive
galaxies with $M_{\star}>10^{11}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In particular, these
massive galaxies assemble about half of the spheroidal mass while star-forming
and the other half through mergers while quiescent.

are still little studied in comparison to their periodic counterparts. Here, we
consider an ultracold bosonic gas in an eight-fold symmetric lattice and assume
a toy model where the atoms occupy the ground states of the local minima of the

interest in the local nature of the phases. The usual Mott-insulator, density
wave, and supersolid phases of the standard and extended Bose-Hubbard model are

that does not assume a star-formation history (SFH; although does not constrain
the IMF) for comparison. When no SFH is assumed, we derived a negative
metallicity gradient for IC 1459 that could be driven by a distinct metal-poor

the key of understanding the perplexing experimental observations of quantum
metals that are beyond FL, i.e., dubbed non-Fermi-liquid (nFL), ranging from
the Cu- and Fe-based oxides, heavy fermion compounds to the recently discovered
twisted graphene heterostructures. However, to fully understand such an exotic
state of matter, at least theoretically, one would like to construct a lattice
model and to solve it with unbiased quantum many-body machinery. Here we
achieve this goal by designing a 2D lattice model comprised of fermionic and
bosonic matter fields coupled with dynamic $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge fields, and
obtain its exact properties with sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that as the bosonic matter fields become disordered, with the help of
deconfinement of the $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge fields, the system reacts with
changing its nature from the conventional normal metal with an FS to an
orthogonal metal of nFL without FS and quasiparticles and yet still responds to
magnetic probe like an FL. Such a quantum phase transition from a normal metal
to an orthogonal metal, with its electronic and magnetic spectral properties
revealed, is calling for the establishment of new paradigm of quantum metals

reveals a flux drop by a factor of $\sim 22$ with respect to the Swift

relative to its UV/optical emission. The lack of correlated UV variability
results in a steep X-ray-to-optical power-law slope ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) of
-1.97 in the low X-ray flux state, corresponding to an X-ray weakness factor of
36.2 at rest-frame 2 keV relative to its UV/optical luminosity. The mild
UV/optical continuum and emission-line variability also suggest that the
accretion rate did not change significantly. A single power-law model modified

disk reflection and partial covering absorption, to explain the extreme X-ray

dwarfs (WDs) triggered by Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in hierarchical
triple-star systems. However, predicted merger rates are several orders of
magnitude lower than the observed SNe Ia rate. The low predicted rates can be
attributed in part to the fact that many potential WD-merger progenitor
systems, with high mutual orbital inclination, merge or interact before the WD
stage. Recently, evidence was found for the existence of natal kicks imparted
on WDs with a typical magnitude of 0.75 km/s. In triples, kicks change the
mutual inclination and in general increase the outer orbit eccentricity,
bringing the triple into an active LK regime at late stages and avoiding the
issue of pre-WD merger or interaction. Stars passing by the triple can result
in similar effects. However, both processes can also disrupt the triple. In
this paper, we quantitatively investigate the impact of WD kicks and flybys on
the rate of WD mergers using detailed simulations. We find that WD kicks and
flybys combine to increase the predicted WD merger rates by a factor of ~2.5,
resulting in a time-integrated rate of ~1.1e-4 Msun^-1. Despite the significant
boost, the predicted rates are still more than one order of magnitude below the
observed rate of ~1e-3 Msun^-1. However, many systematic uncertainties still
remain in our calculations, in particular the potential contributions from
tighter triples, dynamically unstable systems, unbound systems due to WD kicks,

apply both state dependent and state independent cloners (orthogonal and

range for broadcasting of entanglement in terms of the input state parameters.
Our results highlight several instances where the state dependent cloners
outperform their state independent counterparts in broadcasting entanglement.

Indeed, the Mn-Mn magnetic interaction is found to be ferromagntic and strong

first converts an instruction provided as unconstrained natural language into a
form that a robot can understand by parsing it into verb frames. Our approach
then fills in missing information in the instruction by observing objects in
its vicinity and leveraging commonsense reasoning. To learn commonsense
reasoning automatically, our approach distills knowledge from large
unstructured textual corpora by training a language model. Our results show the
feasibility of a robot learning commonsense knowledge automatically from

patterns to identify the ecological processes shaping microbial ecosystems. One
promising approach is to use minimal models that can relate mechanistic
assumptions at the microbe scale to community-level patterns. Here, we
demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the Microbial Consumer
Resource Model (MiCRM) -- a minimal model for microbial communities with
resource competition, metabolic crossfeeding and stochastic colonization -- can
qualitatively reproduce patterns found in survey data including compositional
gradients, dissimilarity/overlap correlations, richness/harshness correlations,
and nestedness of community composition. By using the MiCRM to generate
synthetic data with different environmental and taxonomical structure, we show
that large scale patterns in the EMP can be reproduced by considering the
energetic cost of surviving in harsh environments and HMP patterns may reflect
the importance of environmental filtering in shaping competition. We also show
that recently discovered dissimilarity-overlap correlations in the HMP likely
arise from communities that share similar environments rather than reflecting
universal dynamics. We identify ecologically meaningful changes in parameters
that alter or destroy each one of these patterns, suggesting new mechanistic
hypotheses for further investigation. These findings highlight the promise of
minimal models for microbial ecology.

during guide field reconnection in the low-$\beta$ environment of the inner
heliosphere and the solar corona. The reconnection exhaust is bounded by two
rotational discontinuities (RD) and two slow shocks (SS) form within the
exhaust as in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. At the RDs, ions are
accelerated by the magnetic field tension to drive the reconnection outflow as
well as flows in the out-of-plane direction. The out-of-plane flows stream
toward the midplane and meet to drive the SSs. The SSs differ greatly from
those in the MHD model. The turbulence at the shock fronts and both upstream
and downstream is weak so the shocks are laminar and produce little
dissipation. Downstream of the SSs the counterstreaming ion beams lead to
higher density, which leads to a positive potential between the SSs that acts
to confine the downstream electrons to maintain charge neutrality. The
potential accelerates electrons from upstream of the SSs to downstream region
and traps a small fraction but only modestly increases the downstream electron
temperature above the upstream value. In the low-$\beta$ limit the released
magnetic energy is split between bulk flow and ion heating with little energy
going to electrons. That the model does not produce strong electron heating nor
an energetic electron component suggests that other mechanisms, such as
multiple x-line reconnection, are required to explain energetic electron
production in large flares. The model can be tested with the expected data from
the Parker Solar Probe.

between two infinitesimally close trajectories of a chaotic system. Its
long-time behavior is given by the generalized Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(k)$
providing the logarithmic growth rate of the $k-$th moment of the distance. The
Legendre transform of $\gamma(k)$ is a large deviations function that gives the
probability of rare fluctuations where the logarithmic rate of change of the
distance is much larger or much smaller than the mean rate defining the first
Lyapunov exponent. The only non-trivial zero of $\gamma(k)$ is at minus the
correlation dimension of the attractor which for incompressible flows reduces
to the space dimension. We describe here general properties constraining the
form of $\gamma(k)$ and the Gallavotti-Cohen type relations that hold when
there is symmetry under time-reversal. This demands studying joint growth rates
of infinitesimal distances and volumes. We demonstrate that quartic polynomial
approximation for $\gamma(k)$ does not violate the Marcinkiewicz theorem on
invalidity of polynomial form for the generating function. We propose that this
quartic approximation will fit many experimental situations, not having the
effective time-reversibility and the short correlation time properties of the
quadratic Grassberger-Procaccia estimates. We take the existing $\gamma(k)$ for
turbulent channel flow and demonstrate that the quartic fit is nearly perfect.
The violation of time-reversibility for the Lagrangian trajectories of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence below the viscous scale is considered.
We demonstrate how the fit can be used for finding the correlation dimensions
of strange attractors via easily measurable quantities. We provide a simple
formula via the Lyapunov exponents, holding in quadratic approximation, and

an introduction to the concept of deformation quantization, we briefly recall
existence, classification and representation results for formal star products.
We come then to results concerning the notion of formal star products with
symmetries; one has a Lie group action (or a Lie algebra action) compatible
with the Poisson structure, and one wants to consider star products such that
the Lie group acts by automorphisms (or the Lie algebra acts by derivations).
We recall in particular the link between left invariant star products on Lie
groups and Drinfeld twists, and the notion of universal deformation formulas.
Classically, symmetries are particularly interesting when they are implemented
by a moment map and we give indications to build a corresponding quantum moment
map. Reduction is a construction in classical mechanics with symmetries which
allows to reduce the dimension of the manifold; we describe one of the various
quantum analogues which have been considered in the framework of formal
deformation quantization. We end up by some considerations about convergence of
star products.

periods that exceed the duration of the survey manifest in the data as an
incomplete orbit or linear trend, a feature that can either present as the sole

the signatures of previously discovered companion(s). A diagnostic that can
confirm or constrain scenarios in which the trend is caused by an unseen
stellar, rather than planetary, companion is the use of high-contrast imaging
observations. Here, we present RV data from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search

six companions have resolved orbits, with three that lie in the planetary

Lepton Flavour Universality violating effects in B-decays, involving $b \to c

Physics explanation can be sought within the framework of R-parity violating
Supersymmetry, which contains the necessary ingredients to explain the
anomalies via both leptoquark, tree-level exchange and one-loop diagrams
involving purely leptonic interactions. In addition, an approximate $U(2)^2$
flavour symmetry, that respects gauge coupling unification, successfully
controls the strength of these interactions. Nevertheless strong constraints
from leptonic processes and $Z$ boson decays exclude most of the relevant
parameter space at the $2 \sigma$ level. Moreover, R-parity violation deprives
Supersymmetry of its Dark Matter candidates. Motivated by these deficiencies,
we introduce a new gauge singlet superfield, charged under the flavour symmetry
and show that its third-generation, scalar component may participate in loop
diagrams that alleviate the above-mentioned tensions, while at the same time
reproduce the observed relic abundance. We obtain a solution to both anomalies
that is also fully consistent with the rich Flavour and Dark Matter
phenomenology. Finally, we assess the prospect to probe the model at future
experiments.

of each galaxy. Each of the 45 mock data sets is taken as an independent
observed galaxy. Using van den Bosch's 2008 triaxial Schwarzschild
implementation, we assess model estimates of various galaxy properties,
covering mass profiles, intrinsic shapes, stellar orbit distributions and
velocity anisotropies. Total mass within $\overline{R_{\rm e}}$ is recovered
well with average deviations within $\pm15$ percent. Stellar mass is
underestimated by $\sim24$ percent and dark matter overestimated by $\sim38$
percent (assuming an NFW dark matter profile and allowing for degeneracy
between stellar mass and dark matter mass). Using a gNFW profile, these values
improve to $\sim13$ percent for stellar mass and $\sim18$ percent for dark
matter. Axis ratio estimates show a moderate bias of $\Delta (b/a)=0.07$ and
$\Delta (c/a)=0.14$ ($a\ge b\ge c$). Distributions of the orbit circularities
$\lambda_z$ and $\lambda_x$, representing rotation about the minor and major
axes, are well reconstructed. Separating orbits into thermal categories, our
models match the average fractions of these categories to within $10$ percent.
Velocity anisotropy is well estimated with values matching in the inner regions
but becoming slightly radially biased in the outer regions. Overall, the galaxy
property estimates we obtained using Schwarzschild modelling are not
implausible and are representative of the simulated galaxies we modelled.

that two complex modes of the interactive system do not share just the
wavenumber, but they rather coalesce in both their wavenumbers and eigenvectors

synchronization between the electromagnetic wave and the beam's charge wave for
any amount of output power extracted from the beam, setting the threshold of
this EPD-BWO to any arbitrary, desired, value. Indeed, we show that the
presence of distributed radiation in the SWS results in having high-threshold
electron-beam current to start oscillations which implies higher power
generation. These findings have the potential to lead to highly efficient BWOs

other. In addition, a review of collision models further sheds light on
collision models that can be rewritten in a linear matrix form. More
quantitative mathematical studies are then carried out by comparing explicit
expressions for the post collision populations. Thanks to this, it is possible
to deduce the impact of both the polynomial basis (raw, Hermite, central,
central Hermite, cumulant) and the inclusion of regularization steps on

a quantum magnetic field-tunable contribution to the polarization, which shows
sharp identical Aharonov-Bohm resonances as a function of magnetic flux - with
the period $hc/2e$ - and survives at relatively high temperature. We
demonstrate that this tunneling interferometer can be described in terms of
ensemble of flux-tunable qubits giving equal contributions to conductance and
spin polarization. The number of active qubits participating in the charge and
spin transport is given by the ratio of the temperature and the level spacing.
The interferometer can effectively operate at high temperature and can be used
for quantum calculations. In particular, the ensemble of qubits can be
described by a single Hadamard operator. The obtained results open wide avenue

  To achieve that goal, we study the cobordism category of manifolds with
positive scalar curvature. Under suitable connectivity conditions, we can
identify the homotopy fibre of the forgetful map from the psc cobordism
category to the ordinary cobordism category with a delooping of spaces of psc
metrics. This uses a version of Quillen's Theorem B and instances of the
Gromov--Lawson surgery theorem.
  We extend some of the surgery arguments by Galatius and the second named

Segal's theory of $\Gamma$-spaces is then used to construct the claimed
infinite loop space structures.

diffeomorphism groups on spaces of psc metrics. We show that under mild

homotopy automorphisms of the spaces of psc metrics factors through the

stop-and-go traffic congestion on a freeway segment. The traffic dynamics of
the freeway segment are governed by a macroscopic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model,
consisting of $2\times 2$ quasi-linear partial differential equations (PDEs)
for traffic density and velocity. Boundary stabilization of the linearized ARZ
PDE model has been solved by PDE backstepping, guaranteeing spatial $L^2$ norm
regulation of the traffic state to uniform density and velocity and ensuring
that traffic oscillations are suppressed. Collocated Proportional (P) and
Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers also provide stability guarantees under
certain restricted conditions, and are always applicable as model-free control
options through gain tuning by trail and error, or by model-free optimization.
Although these approaches are mathematically elegant, the stabilization result
only holds locally and is usually affected by the change of model parameters.
Therefore, we reformulate the PDE boundary control problem as a RL problem that
pursues stabilization without knowing the system dynamics, simply by observing
the state values. The proximal policy optimization, a neural network-based
policy gradient algorithm, is employed to obtain RL controllers by interacting
with a numerical simulator of the ARZ PDE. Being stabilization-inspired, the RL
state-feedback boundary controllers are compared and evaluated against the
rigorously stabilizing controllers in two cases: (i) in a system with perfect
knowledge of the traffic flow dynamics, and then (ii) in one with only partial
knowledge. We obtain RL controllers that nearly recover the performance of the
backstepping, P, and PI controllers with perfect knowledge and outperform them
in some cases with partial knowledge.

infectious disease can support decision making and help to hinder disease
spread. In this paper, we develop a computing system platform focusing on
collective intelligence causal modeling, in order to support PSAW in the domain
of infectious disease. Analyses of global epidemics require integration of
multiple different data and models, which can be originated from multiple
independent researchers. These models should be integrated to accurately assess
and predict the infectious disease in terms of holistic view. The system shall
provide three main functions: (1) collaborative causal modeling, (2) causal
model integration, and (3) causal model reasoning. These functions are
supported by subject-matter expert and artificial intelligence (AI), with
uncertainty treatment. Subject-matter experts, as collective intelligence,
develop causal models and integrate them as one joint causal model. The
integrated causal model shall be used to reason about: (1) the past, regarding
how the causal factors have occurred; (2) the present, regarding how the spread
is going now; and (3) the future, regarding how it will proceed. Finally, we
introduce one use case of predictive situation awareness for the Ebola virus
disease.

traffic states based on Aw-Rascle-Zhang(ARZ) partial differential equations
(PDE) model. Traffic state estimation refers to acquisition of traffic state
information from partially observed traffic data. This problem is relevant for
freeway due to its limited accessibility to real-time traffic information. We
propose a boundary observer design so that estimates of aggregated traffic
states in a freeway segment are obtained simply from boundary measurement of
flow and velocity. The macroscopic traffic dynamics is represented by the ARZ
model, consisting of $2 \times 2$ coupled nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs for traffic
density and velocity. Analysis of the linearized ARZ model leads to the study
of a hetero-directional hyperbolic PDE model for congested traffic regime.
Using spatial transformation and PDE backstepping method, we construct a
boundary observer with a copy of the nonlinear plant and output injection of
boundary measurement errors. The output injection gains are designed for the
error system of the linearized ARZ model so that the exponential stability of
error system in the $L^2$ norm and finite-time convergence to zero are
guaranteed. Simulations are conducted to validate the boundary observer design
for nonlinear ARZ model without knowledge of initial conditions.

can be regarded as a sequence of long periods of cultural stasis punctuated by
paradigm shifts that transform culture upside-down over the turn of a few
generations. We propose here a population dynamics model devised to analyse
paradigm shifts. In this model individuals are defined by a vector of cultural
traits that can change mainly through imitation of other individuals' traits.
The novelty of the model is that cultural traits may interact reinforcing or
hindering each other. Imitation is then biased by the 'cultural fitness'
landscape thus defined. Our main result is that abrupt paradigm shifts occur,
as a response to weak changes in the landscape, only when cultural traits do
interact---whereas adaptation is smooth if there is no interaction. Borrowing
the genetic term, this interaction is called 'cultural epistasis'. The result
is robust to the way that epistasis is implemented, to whether imitation is
biased by homophily, or to changes in other model parameters. Finally, a
relevant consequence of this dynamics is the irreversible nature of paradigm
shifts: the old paradigm cannot be restored even if the external changes are
undone. Our model puts the phenomenon of paradigm shifts in cultural evolution
in the same category as catastrophic shifts in ecology or phase transitions in
physics.

for optimizing their stability properties. We specifically show that, under
certain regularity assumptions on the parametrization, the problem of finding
the minimum-cost parameters that achieve a given requirement on a system norm
reduces to a \emph{geometric program}, which in turn can be exactly and
efficiently solved by convex optimization. The flexibility of geometric
programming allows the state, input, and output matrices of the system to
simultaneously depend on the parameters to be tuned. The class of system norms
under consideration includes the $H^2$ norm, $H^\infty$ norm, Hankel norm, and
Schatten $p$-norm. Also, the parameter tuning problem for ensuring the robust
stability of the system under structural uncertainties is shown to be solved by
geometric programming. The proposed optimization framework is further extended
to delayed positive linear systems, where it is shown that the parameter
tunning problem jointly constrained by the exponential decay rate, the
$\mathcal L^1$-gain, and the $\mathcal L^\infty$-gain can be solved by convex
optimization. The assumption on the system parametrization is stated in terms
of posynomial functions, which form a broad class of functions and thus allow
us to deal with various interesting positive linear systems arising from, for
example, dynamical buffer networks and epidemic spreading processes. We present
numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization
framework.

system with its environment. However the effects of decoherence are often
thought of and modeled through a simpler picture in which the role of the
environment is to introduce classical noise in the system's degrees of freedom.
Here we establish necessary conditions that the classical noise models need to
satisfy to quantitatively model the decoherence. Specifically, for
pure-dephasing processes we identify well-defined statistical properties for
the noise that are determined by the quantum many-point time correlation
function of the environmental operators that enter into the system-bath
interaction. In particular, for the exemplifying spin-boson problem with a
Lorentz-Drude spectral density we show that the high-temperature quantum
decoherence is quantitatively mimicked by colored Gaussian noise. In turn, for
dissipative environments we show that classical noise models cannot describe
decoherence effects due to spontaneous emission induced by a dissipative
environment. These developments provide a rigorous platform to assess the
validity of classical noise models of decoherence.

is exacerbated in recent immune-oncology trials where toxicity outcomes can
take a long time to observe. We propose a novel phase I design, the
probability-of-decision toxicity probability interval (PoD-TPI) design, to
accelerate phase I trials. PoD-TPI enables dose assignment in real-time in the
presence of pending toxicity outcomes. With uncertain outcomes, the dose
assignment decisions are treated as a random variable, and we calculate the
posterior distribution of the decisions. The posterior distribution reflects
the variability in the pending outcomes and allows a direct and intuitive
evaluation of the confidence of all possible decisions. Optimal decisions are
calculated based on 0-1 loss, and extra safety rules are constructed to enforce
sufficient protection from exposing patients to risky doses. A new and useful
feature of PoD-TPI is that it allows investigators and regulators to balance
the trade-off between enrollment speed and making risky decisions by tuning a
pair of intuitive design parameters. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the
operating characteristics of PoD-TPI and demonstrate that PoD-TPI shortens
trial duration and maintains trial safety and efficiency compared to existing

fundamental importance in a range of applications including tsunami and
internal ocean wave modelling. This study is performed in the context of the
viscous fluid conduit system-the driven, cylindrical, free interface between
two miscible Stokes fluids with high viscosity contrast. Due to buoyancy
induced nonlinear self-steepening balanced by stress induced interfacial
dispersion, the disturbance evolves into a slowly modulated wavetrain and
further, into a sequence of solitary waves. An extension of Whitham modulation
theory, termed the solitary wave resolution method, is used to resolve the
fission of an initial disturbance into solitary waves. The developed theory
predicts the relationship between the initial disturbance's profile, the number
of emergent solitary waves, and their amplitude distribution, quantifying an
extension of the well-known soliton resolution conjecture from integrable
systems to non-integrable systems that often provide a more accurate modelling
of physical systems. The theoretical predictions for the fluid conduit system
are confirmed both numerically and experimentally. The number of observed
solitary waves is consistently within 1-2 waves of the prediction, and the
amplitude distribution shows remarkable agreement. Universal properties of
solitary wave fission in other fluid dynamics problems are identified.

network clustering, including non-trivial clustering coefficients. In this
paper we present a specific Triangle Generalized Preferential Attachment Model
(TGPA) that, by construction, has nontrivial clustering. We further prove that
this model has a power-law in both the degree distribution and eigenvalue
spectra. We use this model to investigate a recent finding that power-laws are
more reliably observed in the eigenvalue spectra of real-world networks than in
their degree distribution. One conjectured explanation for this is that the
spectra of the graph is more robust to various sampling strategies that would
have been employed to collect the real-world data compared with the degree
distribution. Consequently, we generate random TGPA models that provably have a
power-law in both, and sample subgraphs via forest fire, depth-first, and
random edge models. We find that the samples show a power-law in the spectra
even when only 30\% of the network is seen. Whereas there is a large chance
that the degrees will not show a power-law. Our TGPA model shows this behavior
much more clearly than a standard preferential attachment model. This provides
one possible explanation for why power-laws may be seen frequently in the
spectra of real world data.

by $\sim$3-9 kpc in projection, both of which are optically classified as Type
2 (obscured) AGNs based on diagnostic ratios of the narrow emission lines.
Combined with independent, empirical star formation rate estimates based on the
host-galaxy stellar continua, the new Chandra X-ray observations allow us to
evaluate the dual-AGN hypothesis for each merging system. We confirm two (SDSS
J0907+5203 and SDSS J1544+0446) of the five targets as bona-fide dual AGNs. For
the other three targets, the existing data are consistent with the dual-AGN
scenario, but we cannot rule out the possibility of stellar/shock heating
and/or one AGN ionizing both gaseous components in the merger. The average
X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio in our targets seems to be systematically
smaller than that observed in single AGNs but is higher than that seen in dual
AGNs selected from AGNs with double-peaked narrow emission lines. We suggest
that the systematically smaller X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio observed in
dual AGNs than in single AGNs is due to a high nuclear gas column likely from
strong merger-induced inflows. Unlike double-peaked-[O III]-selected dual AGNs,
the new sample selected from resolved galaxy pairs are not subject to the
orientation bias caused by the double-peak line-of-sight velocity splitting
selection, which also contributes to lowering the X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity
ratio.

the challenging task of encoding high-cardinality categorical features into
digestible inputs for machine learning algorithms. This paper describes a
Bayesian encoding technique developed for WeWork's lead scoring engine which
outputs the probability of a person touring one of our office spaces based on
interaction, enrichment, and geospatial data. We present a paradigm for
ensemble modeling which mitigates the need to build complicated preprocessing
and encoding schemes for categorical variables. In particular, domain-specific
conjugate Bayesian models are employed as base learners for features in a
stacked ensemble model. For each column of a categorical feature matrix we fit
a problem-specific prior distribution, for example, the Beta distribution for a
binary classification problem. In order to analytically derive the moments of
the posterior distribution, we update the prior with the conjugate likelihood
of the corresponding target variable for each unique value of the given
categorical feature. This function of column and value encodes the categorical
feature matrix so that the final learner in the ensemble model ingests
low-dimensional numerical input. Experimental results on both curated and real
world datasets demonstrate impressive accuracy and computational efficiency on
a variety of problem archetypes. Particularly, for the lead scoring engine at
WeWork -- where some categorical features have as many as 300,000 levels -- we
have seen an AUC improvement from 0.87 to 0.97 through implementing conjugate
Bayesian model encoding.

sequences on the universal time scale across a whole sequence of images. The

resonance imaging (fMRI) data as the neural signals of interest for decoding
visual scenes. However, our visual perception operates in a fast time scale of
millisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike. There are few studies of
decoding by using spikes. Here we fulfill this aim by developing a novel
decoding framework based on deep neural networks, named spike-image decoder
(SID), for reconstructing natural visual scenes, including static images and
dynamic videos, from experimentally recorded spikes of a population of retinal
ganglion cells. The SID is an end-to-end decoder with one end as neural spikes
and the other end as images, which can be trained directly such that visual
scenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly accurate fashion. Our SID also
outperforms on the reconstruction of visual stimulus compared to existing fMRI
decoding models. In addition, with the aid of a spike encoder, we show that SID
can be generalized to arbitrary visual scenes by using the image datasets of
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore, with a pre-trained SID, one can
decode any dynamic videos to achieve real-time encoding and decoding of visual
scenes by spikes. Altogether, our results shed new light on neuromorphic
computing for artificial visual systems, such as event-based visual cameras and
visual neuroprostheses.

addition, we consider the case of catastrophic collisions between these

observed crater distributions are best modeled by the crater size distribution
corresponding to the $s_2 = 3.5$ index of the SFD of impactors with diameters
smaller than 60 km. However, for crater diameters $D \lesssim 3-8$ km (which
correspond to impactor diameters $d \sim 0.04 - 0.15$ km), the observed
distributions become flatter and deviate from our results, which may evidence
processes of erosion and/or crater saturation at small crater sizes or a

relevance and interestingness of a system response at each turn can be a useful
signal for mitigating such issues and improving system quality by selecting
responses from different approaches. Towards this goal, we present a system
that evaluates chatbot responses at each dialog turn for coherence and
engagement. Our system provides explicit turn-level dialog quality feedback,
which we show to be highly correlated with human evaluation. To show that
incorporating this feedback in the neural response generation models improves

reranking and direct modification of the loss function during training. Our
studies show that a response generation model that incorporates these combined

stochastic optimization. Recent work by Zhang et al. [2017] presents an
analysis for the hitting time of SGLD for the first and second order stationary
points. The proof in Zhang et al. [2017] is a two-stage procedure through
bounding the Cheeger's constant, which is rather complicated and leads to loose
bounds. In this paper, using intuitions from stochastic differential equations,
we provide a direct analysis for the hitting times of SGLD to the first and
second order stationary points. Our analysis is straightforward. It only relies
on basic linear algebra and probability theory tools. Our direct analysis also
leads to tighter bounds comparing to Zhang et al. [2017] and shows the explicit
dependence of the hitting time on different factors, including dimensionality,
smoothness, noise strength, and step size effects. Under suitable conditions,
we show that the hitting time of SGLD to first-order stationary points can be
dimension-independent. Moreover, we apply our analysis to study several

separating the mixed spectral data pertaining to various materials observed
individual pixels. Recently, nonlinear spectral unmixing has received
particular attention because a linear mixture is not appropriate under many
conditions. However, existing nonlinear unmixing approaches are often based on
specific assumptions regarding the inherent nonlinearity, and they can be
ineffective when applied to conditions deviating from the original assumptions.
Therefore, these approaches are not well suited to scenes with unknown
nonlinearity characteristics. This paper presents an unsupervised nonlinear
spectral unmixing method based on a deep autoencoder network that applies to a
generalized linear-mixture/nonlinear fluctuation model, consisting of a linear
mixture component and an additive nonlinear mixture component that depends on
both endmembers and abundances. The proposed approach benefits from the
universal modeling ability of deep neural networks to learn the inherent
nonlinearity of the nonlinear mixture component from the data itself via the
autoencoder network, rather than relying on an assumed form. Extensive
experiments with numerically synthetic, labeled laboratory-created data and
real airborne data, illustrate the generality and effectiveness of this
approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

consumer Red, Green, Blue and Depth (RGB-D) camera and an Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) to detect obstacles. As the device leverages the ground height
continuity among adjacent image frames, it is able to segment the ground from
obstacles accurately and rapidly. Based on the detected ground, the optimal
walkable direction is computed and the user is then informed via converted beep
sound. Moreover, by utilizing deep learning techniques, the device can
semantically categorize the detected obstacles to improve the users' perception
of surroundings. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deployed on a
smartphone with a depth-image-based object detection to decide what the object
type is and where the object is located, and then notifies the user of such

goal of developing formulations to extract intrinsic information from limited
amount of data. When one considers the modeling of unpredictably varying
processes and complex dynamical signals with a large number of unknowns (such
as those encountered in the fields of finance, NLP, communications, etc.),
there is a need for algorithms to have increased sensitivity with short spans
of data, while maintaining stochastic generalization ability. This naturally
calls for an increased focus on localized stochastic representation. So far,
most metrics developed for characterizing signals envision data from entropic
and probabilistic points of view that lack sensitivity towards quick changes in
signal dynamics. We hypothesize that models that work with the intrinsic
uncertainties associated with local data induced metric spaces would be
significantly more sensitive towards signal characterization. To this end, we
develop a new framework for stochastic signal processing that is based on
decomposing the local metric space of the signal in a Gaussian Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A major advantage of our framework is that we are
able to implement this decomposition on a sample-by-sample basis. The key
aspects of our framework are the following: (1) We use a data defined metric
related to Parzen density estimation for quantifying the local structure of
data in the Gaussian RKHS. (2) We use a quantum description of this metric
which consequently introduces uncertainty in the structure of the local kernel
space. Since the RKHS has been well established and known for providing
universal data fitting capabilities, we submit that local quantifiers of the
kernel space data projection could significantly improve acquisition of signal
information.

both problems have the same optimal value. By solving the equivalent problem in
the joint-actuation space, we can generate human-like motions comparable to
those generated by musculotendon models, while retaining the benefit of simple
modeling and fast computation offered by joint-actuation models. Our method
transforms constant bounds on muscle activations to nonlinear, state-dependent
torque limits in the joint-actuation space. In addition, the metabolic energy
function on muscle activations is transformed to a nonlinear function of joint
torques, joint configuration and joint velocity. Our technique can also benefit
policy optimization using deep reinforcement learning approach, by providing a
more anatomically realistic action space for the agent to explore during the
learning process. We take the advantage of the physiologically-based simulator,
OpenSim, to provide training data for learning the torque limits and the

between different data structures in a program. Traditionally, such invariants
are manually enforced and checked by programmers. This ad-hoc practice is
difficult because the programmer must manually account for all the locations
and configurations that break an invariant. Moreover, implicit invariants are
brittle under code-evolution: when the invariants and data structures change,
the programmer must repeat the process of manually repairing all of the code
locations where invariants are violated.
  A much better approach is to introduce data invariants as a language feature
and rely on language support to maintain invariants. To handle this challenge,
we introduce Targeted Synthesis, a technique for integrating data invariants
with invariant-agnostic imperative code at compile-time. This technique is
nontrivial due to the complex structure of both invariant specifications, as
well as general imperative code.
  The key insight is to take a language co-design approach involving both the
language of data invariants, as well as the imperative language. We leverage
this insight to produce two high-level results: first, we support a language
with iterators without requiring general quantified reasoning, and second, we
infer complicated invariant-preserving patches. We evaluate these claims
through a language termed Spyder, a core calculus of data invariants over
imperative iterator programs. We evaluate the expressiveness and performance of
Spyder on a variety of programs inspired by web applications, and we find that
Spyder efficiently compiles and maintains data invariants.

deep generative neural networks. This permutation symmetry plays an important
role in understanding the computation performance of a broad class of neural
networks with two or more hidden units. However, a theoretical study of the
permutation symmetry is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model with
only two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address
how the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which
the concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language)
starts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data
size is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite.
Remarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields
of hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the
weakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing
the minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data.
Inspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed
algorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Furthermore, our
minimal model reveals that the permutation symmetry can also be spontaneously
broken following the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the unsupervised learning is a progressive combination of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and permutation symmetry breaking which are both
spontaneous processes driven by data streams (observations). All these effects
can be analytically probed based on the minimal model, providing theoretical
insights towards understanding unsupervised learning in a more general context.

gadgets may support more applications. In particular, our work is the first to
prove a randomized lifting theorem for logarithmic-size gadgets, thus improving
some applications of the theorem. Second, our result can be seen as a strong
generalization of a direct-sum theorem for functions with low discrepancy.

of $G$ is at least $a$ or $G$ contains a subcubic (i.e., of maximum degree at
most $3$) tree of treedepth at least $b$ as a subgraph.
  As a direct corollary, we obtain that every graph of treedepth $\Omega(k^3)$
is either of treewidth at least $k$, contains a subdivision of full binary tree
of depth $k$, or contains a path of length $2^k$. This improves the bound of
$\Omega(k^5 \log^2 k)$ of Kawarabayashi and Rossman [SODA 2018].
  We also show an application of our techniques for approximation algorithms of
treedepth: given a graph $G$ of treedepth $k$ and treewidth $t$, one can in
polynomial time compute a treedepth decomposition of $G$ of width
$\mathcal{O}(kt \log^{3/2} t)$. This improves upon a bound of $\mathcal{O}(kt^2
\log t)$ stemming from a tradeoff between known results.
  The main technical ingredient in our result is a proof that every tree of
treedepth $d$ contains a subcubic subtree of treedepth at least $d \cdot \log_3
((1+\sqrt{5})/2)$.

autonomous vehicles. As a part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), it
can remind the driver about dangers timely. Compared with traditional studied
scenes such as the university campus and market surveillance videos, it is
difficult to detect abnormal event from a driver's perspective due to camera
waggle, abidingly moving background, drastic change of vehicle velocity, etc.
To tackle these specific problems, this paper proposes a spatial localization
constrained sparse coding approach for anomaly detection in traffic scenes,
which firstly measures the abnormality of motion orientation and magnitude
respectively and then fuses these two aspects to obtain a robust detection
result. The main contributions are threefold: 1) This work describes the motion
orientation and magnitude of the object respectively in a new way, which is
demonstrated to be better than the traditional motion descriptors. 2) The
spatial localization of object is taken into account of the sparse
reconstruction framework, which utilizes the scene's structural information and
outperforms the conventional sparse coding methods. 3) Results of motion
orientation and magnitude are adaptively weighted and fused by a Bayesian
model, which makes the proposed method more robust and handle more kinds of
abnormal events. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are
validated by testing on nine difficult video sequences captured by ourselves.
Observed from the experimental results, the proposed method is more effective
and efficient than the popular competitors, and yields a higher performance.

correlated to a maximum in the DLVO energy barrier, due to two competing
effects: Calcium adsorption onto calcite surface rises the zeta potential and
consequently the electrostatic repulsion, while increasing salt concentration
induces stronger electrostatic screening. We also demonstrate that the addition
of sodium hydroxide completely screens the surface charge and leads to a more

modality that aims to reconstruct optical parameters in biological tissues from
ultrasound measurements. As propagating light gets partially absorbed, the
resulting thermal expansion generates minute ultrasonic signals (the
photo-acoustic effect) that are measured at the boundary of a domain of
interest. Standard inversion procedures first reconstruct the source of
radiation by an inverse ultrasound (boundary) problem and second describe the
optical parameters from internal information obtained in the first step.
  This paper considers the rotating experimental setting. Light emission and
ultrasound measurements are fixed on a rotating gantry, resulting in a
rotation-dependent source of ultrasound. The two-step procedure we just
mentioned does not apply. Instead, we propose an inversion that directly aims
to reconstruct the optical parameters quantitatively. The mapping from the
unknown (absorption and diffusion) coefficients to the ultrasound measurement
via the unknown ultrasound source is modeled as a composition of a
pseudo-differential operator and a Fourier integral operator. We show that for
appropriate choices of optical illuminations, the above composition is an
elliptic Fourier integral operator. Under the assumption that the coefficients
are unknown on a sufficiently small domain, we derive from this a (global)
injectivity result (measurements uniquely characterize our coefficients)
combined with an optimal stability estimate. The latter is the same as that
obtained in the standard (non-rotating experimental) setting.

separate fluids, comprising the electron inertia and charge separation. The
discretization of this system with standard explicit schemes is constrained by
very restrictive time steps and cell sizes related to the resolution of the
Debye length, electron plasma frequency, and electron sound waves. Both sheath
and electron inertia are fundamental to fully explain the physics in
low-pressure and low-temperature plasmas. However, most of the phenomena of
interest for fluid models occur at speeds much slower than the electron thermal
speed and are quasi-neutral, except in small charged regions. In this work, we
present a scheme based on the Lagrange-projection operator splitting that
preserves the asymptotic regime where the plasma is quasi-neutral with massless
electrons. As a result, the quasi-neutral regime is treated without the need of
an implicit solver nor the resolution of the Debye length and electron plasma
frequency. Additionally, the scheme proves to accurately represent the dynamics
of the electrons both at low speeds and when the electron speed is comparable
to the thermal speed. In addition, a well-balanced treatment of the ion source
terms is proposed in order to tackle problems where the ion temperature is very
low compared to the electron temperature. The scheme significantly improves the
accuracy both in the quasi-neutral limit and in the presence of plasma sheaths
when the Debye length is resolved. The scheme is assessed in two specifically
designed test-cases: a quasi-neutral two-stream periodic perturbation with
analytical solution and a low-temperature discharge that includes sheaths.

formulation where the effect of violation is described as a local interaction
[R. Shaniv, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 103202 (2018)]. An entangled ion pair
in a decoherence free subspace (DFS) is shown to double the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) of one ion, while (even)-N/2 such DFS pairs in a collective
entangled state improve SNR by N times, provided the state parity or the
even/odd numbers of ions can be measured. It remains to find out, however, how
such fiducial entangled states can be prepared at nonexponentially small
success rates. This work suggests two types of many particle entangled states
for testing LSV: the maximally entangled NOON state, which can achieve
Heisenberg limited precision; and the balanced spin-1 Dicke state, which is
readily available in deterministic fashion. We show that the latter also lives
in a DFS and is immune to stray magnetic fields. It can achieve classical
precision limit or the standard quantum limit (SQL) based on collective
population measurement without individual atom resolution. Given the high
interests in LSV and in entanglement assisted quantum metrology, our
observation offers additional incentives for pursuing practical applications of
many atom entangled states.

which increases the number of data centers across the world. These data centers
are usually connected to each other using long-distance and high-speed
networks. As known, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the predominant
protocol used to provide such connectivity among these data centers.
Unfortunately, the huge bandwidth-delay product (BDP) of these networks hinders
TCP from achieving full bandwidth utilization. In order to increase TCP
flexibility to adapt for high-BDP networks, we propose a new delay-based and
RTT-independent congestion control algorithm (CCA), namely Elastic-TCP. It
mainly contributes the novel window-correlated weighting function (WWF) to
increase TCP bandwidth utilization over high-BDP networks. Extensive simulation
and testbed experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed
Elastic-TCP by comparing its performance to the commonly used TCPs developed by
Microsoft, Linux, and Google. The results show that the proposed Elastic-TCP
achieves higher average throughput than the other TCPs, while it maintains the
sharing fairness and the loss ratio. Moreover, it is worth noting that the new
Elastic-TCP presents lower sensitivity to the variation of buffer size and
packet error rate than the other TCPs, which grants high efficiency and
stability.

structured data, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They
usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating
node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph
related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph
neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the
\textit{graph representation} from node representations are demanded. A common
way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural
information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to
preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There
are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous
to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks.
However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the
pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator $\pooling$
based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local
structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on
the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN
convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework $\m$ for graph
classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand $\pooling$ from
both local and global perspectives. Experimental results of the graph
classification task on $6$ commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

for the number of rational points of height at most $B$ on any integral
subvariety $X$ of ${\mathbb P}^n_{\mathbb Q}$ of degree $d\geq 2$, where one
can write $O_{d,n, \varepsilon}$ instead of $O_{X, \varepsilon}$ as soon as
$d\geq 4$. Our main contribution is to remove the factor $B^\varepsilon$ as
soon as $d \geq 5$, without introducing a factor $\log B$, while moreover
obtaining polynomial dependence on $d$ of the implied constant. Working
polynomially in $d$ allows us to give a self-contained and slightly simplified
treatment of dimension growth for degree $d \geq 16$, while in the range $5
\leq d \leq 15$ we invoke results by Browning, Heath-Brown and Salberger. Along
the way we improve the well-known bounds due to Bombieri and Pila on the number
of integral points of bounded height on affine curves and those by Walsh on the
number of rational points of bounded height on projective curves. The former
improvement leads to a slight sharpening of a recent estimate due to Bhargava,
Shankar, Taniguchi, Thorne, Tsimerman and Zhao on the size of the $2$-torsion
subgroup of the class group of a degree $d$ number field. Our treatment builds
on recent work by Salberger which brings in many primes in Heath-Brown's

learned latent representations can be more robust to noise. Then the mutual
information estimation is utilized to provide more discriminative information

embed the latent representations into the eigenspace and subsequently clusters
them, which can fully exploit the relationship between inputs to achieve
optimal clustering results. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show

on two microscopic length-scales $L_c^+$ and $L_c^-$. If the corrugation
parameter $L$ is greater than $L_c^+$, the process is continuous similar to
complete wetting on a planar wall. For $L_c^-<L<L_c^+$, the complete wetting
exhibits first-order \emph{depinning transition} corresponding to an abrupt
unbinding of the liquid-gas interface from the wall. Finally, for $L<L_c^-$ the
interface remains pinned at the wall even at bulk liquid-gas coexistence. This
implies that nano-modification of substrate surfaces can always change their
wetting character from hydrophilic into hydrophobic, in direct contrast to the
macroscopic Wenzel law. The resulting surface phase diagram reveals close

on the dynamics of DDS. Indeed, hypothesis on the systems can be translated
into polynomial equations over DDS. Solutions to these equations provide the
validation to the initial hypothesis. Unfortunately, finding solutions to
general equations over DDS is undecidable. In this article, we want to push the
envelope further by proposing a practical approach for some decidable cases in
a suitable configuration that we call the Hypothesis Checking. We demonstrate
that for many decidable equations all boils down to a ""simpler"" equation.
However, the problem is not to decide if the simple equation has a solution,
but to enumerate all the solutions in order to verify the hypothesis on the
real and undecidable systems. We evaluate experimentally our approach and show
that it has good scalability properties.

equivalent to Carleson measure estimates, to square function estimates, and to
$\varepsilon$-approximability, for solutions to the second order divergence

uniformly rectifiable boundary, absolute continuity of elliptic measure with

present paper, the authors demonstrate that nonetheless, Carleson measure
estimates, square function estimates, and $\varepsilon$-approximability remain
valid in such $\Omega$, for solutions of $Lu=0$, provided that such solutions
enjoy these properties in Lipschitz subdomains of $\Omega$.
  Moreover, we establish a general real-variable transference principle, from
Lipschitz to chord-arc domains, and from chord-arc to open sets with uniformly
rectifiable boundary, that is not restricted to harmonic functions or even to
solutions of elliptic equations. In particular, this allows one to deduce the

variant is that its $H^1$-norm error can be bounded only in terms of the
$H^1$-norm best error in a space of broken polynomials. We establish this
estimate with the help of recent results on the quasi-optimality of
nonconforming methods. We prove also an improved error bound in the $L^2$-norm
by duality. Compared to previous works on quasi-optimal nonconforming methods,
the main novelties are that Hybrid High-Order methods handle pairs of unknowns,
and not a single function, and, more crucially, that these methods employ a
reconstruction that is one polynomial degree higher than the discrete unknowns.
The proposed modification affects only the formulation of the discrete
right-hand side. This is obtained by properly mapping discrete test functions

  geometric multigrid",,,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of finite element solvers on modern computer architectures is
typically memory bound for sufficiently large problems. The main cause for this
is that loading matrix elements from RAM into CPU cache is significantly slower
than performing the arithmetic operations when solving the problem. In order to
improve the performance of iterative solvers within the high-performance
computing context, so-called matrix-free methods are widely adopted in the
fluid mechanics community, where matrix-vector products are computed
on-the-fly.
  To date, there have been few (if any) assessments into the applicability of
the matrix-free approach to problems in solid mechanics. In this work, we
perform an initial investigation on the application of the matrix-free approach
to problems in quasi-static finite-strain hyperelasticity to determine whether
it is viable for further extension. Specifically, we study different numerical
implementations of the finite element tangent operator, and determine whether
generalized methods of incorporating complex constitutive behavior might be
feasible. In order to improve the convergence behavior of iterative solvers, we
also propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ
them to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner. The performance of the
matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner is compared to
the matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner on a
single node for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous
hyperelastic material in two and three dimensions. We conclude that the
application of matrix-free methods to finite-strain solid mechanics is
promising, and that is it possible to develop numerically efficient
implementations that are independent of the hyperelastic constitutive law.

  In the context of inverse semigroups $S$ we give a characterization of

$domain$ $measurability$ and $localization$. Given a unital representation of
$S$ in terms of partial bijections on some set $X$ we define a natural
generalization of the uniform Roe algebra of a group, which we denote by
$\mathcal{R}_X$. We show that the following notions are then equivalent: (1)
$X$ is domain measurable; (2) $X$ is not paradoxical; (3) $X$ satisfies the
domain F{\o}lner condition; (4) there is an algebraically amenable dense
*-subalgebra of $\mathcal{R}_X$; (5) $\mathcal{R}_X$ has an amenable trace; (6)
$\mathcal{R}_X$ is not properly infinite and (7) $[0]\not=[1]$ in the

condition, we give several C*-algebraic characterizations of the amenability of

injecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure
localization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a
public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their
neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device
is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the
Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT
devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious
node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are
verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between
nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity.
The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process
permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The
simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves
the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of
malicious nodes.

2D3V simulations. We find that the energy gain in SSA always arises from the
electrostatic field of a Buneman wave. Electron energization is more efficient
in the out-of-plane orientation of the large-scale magnetic field because both
the phase speed and the amplitude of the waves are higher than for the in-plane
scenario. Also, a larger number of electrons is trapped by the waves compared
to the in-plane configuration. We conclude that significant modifications of
the simulation parameters are needed to reach the same level of SSA efficiency
as in simulations with out-of-plane magnetic field or 3D simulations.

The movement induced by an expression extends beyond the movement epicenter.
Thus, the movement occurring in an occluded region propagates towards
neighboring visible regions. In presence of occlusions, per expression, we
compute the importance of each unoccluded facial region and we construct
adapted facial frameworks that boost the performance of per expression binary

In particular, in the case of the general linear group, it provides a geometric
interpretation of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence between permutations
and pairs of standard tableaux of the same shape.
  We extend Steinberg's approach to the case of a symmetric pair $(G,K)$ to
obtain two different maps, namely a \emph{generalized Steinberg map} and an
\emph{exotic moment map}.
  Although the framework is general, in this paper we focus on the pair $(G,K)
= (\mathrm{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C}) \times
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C}))$. Then the generalized Steinberg map is a map from
\emph{partial} permutations to the pairs of nilpotent orbits in $
\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{C}) $. It involves a generalization of the classical
Robinson--Schensted correspondence to the case of partial permutations.
  The other map, the exotic moment map, establishes a combinatorial map from
the set of partial permutations to that of signed Young diagrams, i.e., the set
of nilpotent $K$-orbits in the Cartan space
$(\mathrm{Lie}(G)/\mathrm{Lie}(K))^* $.

The continuum at 0.87 mm and molecular transitions from C17O, C34S, H13CO+,
CH3OH, SO2 , and C2H were observed at high angular resolution (0.4"", ~60 au
diameter) towards each source. Disc and stellar masses are estimated from the
continuum flux and position-velocity diagrams, and six of the sources show
disc-like structures. Towards the more luminous sources, compact emission and
large line widths are seen for transitions of SO2 that probe warm gas (Eu ~200
K). In contrast, C17O emission is detected towards the least evolved and less
luminous systems. No emission of CH3OH is detected towards any of the continuum
peaks, indicating an absence of warm CH3OH gas towards these sources. A
power-law relation is seen between the stellar mass and the bolometric
luminosity, corresponding to a mass accretion rate of (2.4 +/- 0.6) x 10^-7
Msun/year for the Class I sources. This mass accretion rate is lower than the
expected value if the accretion is constant in time and rather points to a
scenario of accretion occurring in bursts. The differentiation between C17O and
SO2 suggests that they trace different physical components: C17O traces the
densest and colder regions of the disc-envelope system, while SO2 may be
associated with regions of higher temperature, such as accretion shocks. The
lack of warm CH3OH emission suggests that there is no hot-core-like region
around any of the sources and that the CH3OH column density averaged over the
disc is low.

by striving for ultimate precision and sensitivity (e.g., in the search for

violate both time reversal $(T)$ and parity $(P)$ invariance, and are via the
$CPT$-theorem also $CP$-violating. Finding an EDM would be a strong indication
for physics beyond the SM, and pushing upper limits further provides crucial
tests for any corresponding theo\-retical model, e.g., SUSY. Up to now, EDM
searches focused on neutral systems (neutrons, atoms, and molecules). Storage

different temperatures, when solitons flow along the junction. Here, we
consider the effect of both a bias current and an external magnetic field on
the thermal evolution of the device. In the flux-flow regime, a chain of
magnetically-excited solitons rapidly moves along the junction driven by the
bias current. We explore the range of bias current triggering the flux-flow
regime at fixed values of magnetic field, and the stationary temperature
distribution in this operation mode. We evidence a steady multi-peaked
temperature profile which reflects on the average soliton distribution along
the junction. Finally, we analyse also how the friction affecting the soliton
dynamics influences the thermal evolution of the system.

of attributing a cyber-attack helps to construct efficient and targeted
mitigating and preventive security measures. In this work, we propose an
argumentation-based reasoner (ABR) as a proof-of-concept tool that can help a
forensics analyst during the analysis of forensic evidence and the attribution
process. Given the evidence collected from a cyber-attack, our reasoner can
assist the analyst during the investigation process, by helping him/her to
analyze the evidence and identify who performed the attack. Furthermore, it
suggests to the analyst where to focus further analyses by giving hints of the
missing evidence or new investigation paths to follow. ABR is the first
automatic reasoner that can combine both technical and social evidence in the
analysis of a cyber-attack, and that can also cope with incomplete and
conflicting information. To illustrate how ABR can assist in the analysis and
attribution of cyber-attacks we have used examples of cyber-attacks and their
analyses as reported in publicly available reports and online literature. We do
not mean to either agree or disagree with the analyses presented therein or

specific characteristics of the breaking of conformal symmetry, induced by the

irreducible (1PI, nonlocal) anomaly action with the prediction of a similar
(but exact) nonlocal action identified by the CWI's. The two predictions can be
exactly matched at the level of 3-point functions. The analysis of the $TJJ$

solutions of the CWI's - predict massless (dynamical) scalar exchanges in
3-point functions as the signature of the conformal anomaly. In a local
formulation such 1PI actions exhibit a ghost in the spectrum which may induce
ghost condensation. We also discuss alternative approaches, which take to
Wess-Zumino forms of the action with an asymptotic dilaton, which should be
considered phenomenological alternatives to the exact nonlocal action. If
derived by a Weyl gauging, they also include a ghost in the spectrum. The two
formulations, nonlocal and of WZ type, can be unified under the assumption that
they describe the same anomaly phenomenon at two separate (UV/IR) ends of the
renormalization group flow, possibly separated by a vacuum rearrangement at an
intermediate scale. A similar analysis is presented for an $\mathcal{N}=1$

potential is of particular interest in hydrogeology for its sensitivity to
water flow. Estimating water flux in porous media using streaming potential
data relies on our capacity to understand, model, and upscale the
electrokinetic coupling at the mineral-solution interface. Different approaches
have been proposed to predict streaming potential generation in porous media.
One of these approaches is the flux averaging which is based on determining the
excess charge which is effectively dragged in the medium by water flow. In this
study, we develop a physically-based analytical model to predict the effective
excess charge in saturated porous media using a flux-averaging approach in a
bundle of capillary tubes with a fractal pore-size distribution. The proposed
model allows the determination of the effective excess charge as a function of
pore water ionic concentration and hydrogeological parameters like porosity,
permeability and tortuosity. The new model has been successfully tested against
different set of experimental data from the literature. One of the main
findings of this study is the mechanistic explanation to the empirical
dependence between the effective excess charge and the permeability that has
been found by several researchers. The proposed model also highlights the link
to other lithological properties and it is able to reproduce the evolution of
effective excess charge with electrolyte concentrations.

the existence of a wide diffuse polymer layer 150+/-40 Angstrom in width at the

approximately thermal regimes, separated by out-of-equilibrium ones in which
detailed balance is broken. Moreover, we show that under appropriately chosen

analogous support for the existence of the Chapman-Kolmogorov-Schr\""odinger
equation for them, performing a Monte Carlo study. It is numerically seen as a
Wick rotation can turn the heat kernel into the Schr\""odinger one, mapping such
kernels through the corresponding stochastic processes. In this way, we
introduce a new kind of improper complex stochastic process. This permits a
reformulation of quantum mechanics using purely geometrical concepts that are
strongly linked to stochastic processes. Applications to economics are also
entailed.

context of Markov switching models with time varying transition probabilities.
Markov switching models are commonly employed in empirical macroeconomic
research and policy work. However, the information used to model the switching
process is usually limited drastically to ensure stability of the model.
Increasing the number of included variables to enlarge the information set
might even result in decreasing precision of the model. Moreover, it is often
not clear a priori which variables are actually relevant when it comes to
informing the switching behavior. Building strongly on recent contributions in
the field of factor analysis, we introduce a general type of Markov switching
autoregressive models for non-linear time series analysis. Large numbers of
time series are allowed to inform the switching process through a factor
structure. This factor-augmented Markov switching (FAMS) model overcomes
estimation issues that are likely to arise in previous assessments of the
modeling framework. More accurate estimates of the switching behavior as well
as improved model fit result. The performance of the FAMS model is illustrated
in a simulated data example as well as in an US business cycle application.

and complexity of computations involved. As a result, test data selection is
performed manually and in an ad hoc way. This raises the question of how we can
automatically select candidate test data to test deep learning models. Recent
research has focused on adapting test selection metrics from code-based
software testing (such as coverage) to deep learning. However, deep learning
models have different attributes from code such as spread of computations
across the entire network reflecting training data properties, balance of
neuron weights and redundancy (use of many more neurons than needed). Such
differences make code-based metrics inappropriate to select data that can
challenge the models (can trigger misclassification). We thus propose a set of
test selection metrics based on the notion of model uncertainty (model
confidence on specific inputs). Intuitively, the more uncertain we are about a
candidate sample, the more likely it is that this sample triggers a
misclassification. Similarly, the samples for which we are the most uncertain,
are the most informative and should be used to improve the model by retraining.
We evaluate these metrics on two widely-used image classification problems
involving real and artificial (adversarial) data. We show that
uncertainty-based metrics have a strong ability to select data that are
misclassified and lead to major improvement in classification accuracy during
retraining: up to 80% more gain than random selection and other
state-of-the-art metrics on one dataset and up to 29% on the other.

reconstruction method which employs weighted least-squares (WLS) for pressure
integration. Pressure gradients are calculated from the velocity fields, and
velocity errors are estimated from the velocity divergence for incompressible
flow. Pressure gradient errors are estimated by propagating the velocity errors
through Navier-Stokes momentum equation. A weight matrix is generated based on
the pressure gradient errors, then employed for pressure reconstruction. The
pressure reconstruction method was demonstrated and analyzed using synthetic
velocity fields as well as Poiseuille flow measured using in vitro 4D-flow MRI.
Performance of the proposed WLS method was compared to the method of solving
the pressure Poisson equation which has been the primary method used in the
previous studies. Error analysis indicated that the proposed method is more
robust to velocity measurement errors. Improvement on pressure results was
found to be more significant for the cases with spatially-varying velocity
error level, with reductions in error ranging from 50% to over 200%. Finally,
the method was applied to flow in a patient-specific cerebral aneurysm.
Validation was performed with in vitro flow data collected using Particle
Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) and Shake the Box (STB) method, and in vivo flow
measurement obtained using 4D-flow MRI. Pressure calculated by WLS, as opposed
to the Poisson equation, was more consistent with the flow structures and
showed better agreement between the in vivo and in vitro data. These results
suggest the utility of WLS method to obtain reliable pressure field from

the drift direction in the second component was opposite to the fourth

drift bands were seen around a central core emission. The emission showed a
gradual decrease in intensity during mode A which stabilised to a relatively

in a formal development of mathematical statements about real numbers and the

contribution is to adhere to the conventions of computable analysis to provide
a general purpose interface for algorithmic reasoning on continuous structures.
The results that provide complete computational content include that the
algebraic operations and the efficient limit operator on the reals are
computable, that certain countably infinite products are isomorphic to spaces
of functions, compatibility of the enumeration representation of subsets of
natural numbers with the abstract definition of the space of open subsets of
the natural numbers, and that continuous realizability implies sequential
continuity. We also formalize proofs of non-computational results that support
the correctness of our definitions. These include that the information
theoretic notion of continuity used in the library is equivalent to the metric
notion of continuity on Baire space, a complete comparison of the different
concepts of continuity that arise from metric and represented-space structures
and the discontinuity of the unrestricted limit operator on the real numbers

stars-to-dust mass ratio (M_{Stars}/M_{Dust}), gas-to-dust mass ratio

mass of dust and dust temperature (SFR/M_{Dust} and T_{Dust}). Late type
galaxies (later than Sc) in all of the environments can be modelled using
simple closed box chemical evolution and a simple star formation history
(SFR(t) \propto t\exp{-t/\tau}). For earlier type galaxies the physical
mechanisms that give rise to their properties are clearly much more varied and
require a more complicated model (mergers, gas in or outflow). However, we find
little or no difference in the properties of galaxies of the same morphological

that it is morphology, how and whenever this is laid down, and consistent

Ferromagnetic domain growth occurs as these vortices annihilate. The distinct

Particularly, extraction of discriminative features from raw EEG signals,

we observed that there is a significant difference between the variances of EEG
signals captured from the same brain region when a subject performs different
tasks. This observation lead us to use singular value decomposition for
computing dominant variances of EEG signals captured from a certain brain
region while performing a certain task and use them as features (nuclear
features). A simple and efficient class means based minimum distance classifier
(CMMDC) is enough to predict brain states. This approach results in the feature
space of significantly small dimension and gives equally good classification
results on clean as well as raw data. We validated the effectiveness and
robustness of the technique using four datasets of different tasks: fluid
intelligence clean data (FICD), fluid intelligence raw data (FIRD), memory
recall task (MRT), and eyes open / eyes closed task (EOEC). For each task, we
analyzed EEG signals over six (06) different brain regions with 8, 16, 20, 18,
18 and 100 electrodes. The nuclear features from frontal brain region gave the
100% prediction accuracy. The discriminant analysis of the nuclear features has

investigations and monitoring. Automatic emotion recognition (AER) using
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an effective method for decoding the real
emotions, which are independent of body gestures, but it is a challenging
problem. Several automatic emotion recognition systems have been proposed,
which are based on traditional hand-engineered approaches and their
performances are very poor. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deep
learning (DL) in many recognition tasks, we introduce an AER system (Deep-AER)
based on EEG brain signals using DL. A DL model involves a large number of
learnable parameters, and its training needs a large dataset of EEG signals,
which is difficult to acquire for AER problem. To overcome this problem, we
proposed a lightweight pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional neural network
(LP-1D-CNN) model, which involves a small number of learnable parameters. Using
LP-1D-CNN, we build a two level ensemble model. In the first level of the
ensemble, each channel is scanned incrementally by LP-1D-CNN to generate
predictions, which are fused using majority vote. The second level of the
ensemble combines the predictions of all channels of an EEG signal using
majority vote for detecting the emotion state. We validated the effectiveness
and robustness of Deep-AER using DEAP, a benchmark dataset for emotion
recognition research. The results indicate that FRONT plays dominant role in
AER and over this region, Deep-AER achieved the accuracies of 98.43% and 97.65%
for two AER problems, i.e., high valence vs low valence (HV vs LV) and high
arousal vs low arousal (HA vs LA), respectively. The comparison reveals that
Deep-AER outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with large margin. The
Deep-AER system will be helpful in monitoring for health care and security
investigations.

The successful introduction of deep learning in place of more traditional

methods suffer from their own issues that make them often inapplicable to the

primordial black hole binaries during their early inspiral stage while
accreting high-density radiation surrounding them in the early universe. We
first show that the gravitational wave amplitude produced from a primordial
black hole binary has correction terms because of the rapid rate of increase in
masses of the primordial black holes. These correction terms arise due to
non-vanishing first and second time derivatives of the masses and their
contribution to the overall second time derivative of quadrupole moment tensor.
We find that some of these correction terms are not only significant in
comparison with the main term but even dominant over the main term for certain
ranges of time in the early Universe. The significance of these correction
terms is not only for the gravitational wave amplitude produced from an
individual PBH-binary, but persists for the overall stochastic gravitational
wave background produced from them. We show that the spectral density produced
from such accreting primordial black hole binaries lie within the detectability
range of some present and future gravitational wave detectors.

objects are interacting/merging systems; (b) the ratio between un-obscured and

it was assumed that the deformable 3D structure is generated by a linear
combination of rigid basis shapes. The non-rigid shape will be decomposed into
the mean shape and the degenerate shapes, constructed from the right singular
vectors of the low-rank decomposition. The right singular vectors are affinely
back-projected into the 3D space, and the affine back-projections will also be
solved as part of the factorisation. By construction, a direct interpretation
for the right singular vectors of the low-rank decomposition will also follow:
they can be seen as principal components, hence, the first variant of our
method is referred to as Rank-1-PCA. The second variant, referred to as
Rank-1-ICA, additionally estimates the orthogonal transform which maps the
deformation modes into as statistically independent modes as possible. It has
the advantage of pinpointing statistically dependent subspaces related to, for
instance, lip movements on human faces. Moreover, in contrast to prior works,
no predefined dimensionality for the subspaces is imposed. The experiments on

using dynamical methods. Specifically, we show that the taxation problem is
intimately connected to the heat equation. Our first result is a new property
of the optimal tax which we call the fairness principle. The optimal tax at any
income is invariant under a family of properly adjusted Gaussian averages (the
heat kernel) of the optimal taxes at other incomes. That is, the optimal tax at
a given income is equal to the weighted by the heat kernels average of optimal
taxes at other incomes and income densities. Moreover, this averaging happens
at every scale tightly linked to each other providing a unified weighting
scheme at all income ranges. The fairness principle arises not due to equality
considerations but rather it represents an efficient way to smooth the burden
of taxes and generated revenues across incomes. Just as nature wants to
distribute heat evenly, the optimal way for a government to raise revenues is
to distribute the tax burden and raised revenues evenly among individuals. We
then construct a gradient flow of taxes -- a dynamic process changing the
existing tax system in the direction of the increase in tax revenues -- and
show that it takes the form of a heat equation. The fairness principle holds
also for the short-term asymptotics of the gradient flow, where the averaging
is done over the current taxes. The gradient flow we consider can be viewed as
a continuous process of a reform of the nonlinear income tax schedule and thus
unifies the variational approach to taxation and optimal taxation. We present
several other characteristics of the gradient flow focusing on its smoothing
properties.

effects. Recent methods are able to mitigate these effects by including the
corresponding distributions in the sensor fusion algorithm. However, these
approaches require prior knowledge about the sensor's distribution, which is
often not available. We introduce a novel sensor fusion algorithm based on
variational Bayesian inference, that is able to approximate the true
distribution with a Gaussian mixture model and to learn its parametrization
online. The proposed Incremental Variational Mixture algorithm automatically
adapts the number of mixture components to the complexity of the measurement's
error distribution. We compare the proposed algorithm against current
state-of-the-art approaches using a collection of open access real world
datasets and demonstrate its superior localization accuracy.

on the sum of all $p$-values and the average of expected $p$-value under the
false null hypotheses has been proposed in the current work. This formulation
of the parameter of interest $\pi_0$ has also been used to construct a new
estimator for the same. The proposed estimator removes the problem of choosing
tuning parameters in the existing estimators. Though the formulation is quite
general, computation of the new estimator demands use of an initial estimate of
$\pi_0$. The issue of choosing an appropriate initial estimator is also
discussed in this work. The current work assumes normality of each gene
expression level and also assumes similar tests for all the hypotheses.
Extensive simulation study shows that, the proposed estimator performs better
than its closest competitor, the estimator proposed in Cheng et al., 2015 over
a substantial continuous subinterval of the parameter space, under independence
and weak dependence among the gene expression levels. The proposed method of
estimation is applied to two real gene expression level data-sets and the
results are in line with what is obtained by the competing method.

AGN optical spectral types are caused by different viewing angles with respect
to an obscuring 'torus'. Therefore, this model predicts that type 1 and type 2
AGNs should have similar host-galaxy properties. We investigate this prediction
with 2463 X-ray selected AGNs in the COSMOS field. We divide our sample into
type 1 and type 2 AGNs based on their spectra, morphologies, and variability.
We derive their host-galaxy stellar masses ($M_\star$) through SED fitting, and
find that the host $M_\star$ of type 1 AGNs tend to be slightly smaller than
those of type 2 AGNs by
$\Delta\overline{\mathrm{log}M_\star}\approx0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ ($\approx
4\sigma$ significance). Besides deriving star-formation rates (SFRs) from SED
fitting, we also utilize far-infrared (FIR) photometry and a stacking method to
obtain FIR-based SFRs. We find that the SFRs of type 1 and type 2 sources are
similar once their redshifts and X-ray luminosities are controlled. We also
investigate cosmic environment, and find that the surface number densities
(sub-Mpc) and cosmic-web environments ($\approx 1\text{--}10$~Mpc) are similar
for both populations. In summary, our analyses show that the host galaxies of
type 1 and type 2 AGNs have similar SFR and cosmic environment in general, but
the former tend to have lower $M_\star$ than the latter. The difference in
$M_\star$ indicates that the AGN unification model is not strictly correct and
both host galaxy and torus may contribute to the optical obscuration of AGNs.

networks an interesting alternative to investigate, as they are extremely fast
once trained and have recently been shown to rival the sensitivity of matched
filtering for black-hole merger signals. We train a convolutional neural
network with residual (short-cut) connections and compare its detection power
to that of a fully-coherent matched-filtering search using the WEAVE pipeline.
As test benchmarks we consider two types of all-sky searches over the frequency
range from $20\,\mathrm{Hz}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{Hz}$: an `easy' search using
$T=10^5\,\mathrm{s}$ of data, and a `harder' search using $T=10^6\,\mathrm{s}$.
Detection probability $p_\mathrm{det}$ is measured on a signal population for
which matched filtering achieves $p_\mathrm{det}=90\%$ in Gaussian noise. In
the easiest test case ($T=10^5\,\mathrm{s}$ at $20\,\mathrm{Hz}$) the DNN
achieves $p_\mathrm{det}\sim88\%$, corresponding to a loss in sensitivity depth
of $\sim5\%$ versus coherent matched filtering. However, at higher-frequencies
and longer observation time the DNN detection power decreases, until
$p_\mathrm{det}\sim13\%$ and a loss of $\sim 66\%$ in sensitivity depth in the
hardest case ($T=10^6\,\mathrm{s}$ at $1000\,\mathrm{Hz}$). We study the DNN
generalization ability by testing on signals of different frequencies,
spindowns and signal strengths than they were trained on. We observe excellent
generalization: only five networks, each trained at a different frequency,
would be able to cover the whole frequency range of the search.

heavy elements into the universe. By observing the emission from this ejecta,
scientists can probe the ejecta properties (mass, velocity and composition
distributions). The emission (a.k.a. kilonova) is powered by the radioactive
decay of the heavy isotopes produced in the merger and this emission is
reprocessed by atomic opacities to optical and infra-red wavelengths.
Understanding the ejecta properties requires calculating the dependence of this
emission on these opacities. The strong lines in the optical and infra-red in
lanthanide opacities have been shown to significantly alter the light-curves
and spectra in these wavelength bands, arguing that the emission in these
wavelengths can probe the composition of this ejecta. Here we study variations
in the kilonova emission by varying individual lanthanide (and the actinide
uranium) concentrations in the ejecta. The broad forest of lanthanide lines
makes it difficult to determine the exact fraction of individual lanthanides.
Nd is an exception. Its opacities above 1 micron are higher than other
lanthanides and observations of kilonovae can potentially probe increased
abundances of Nd. Similarly, at early times when the ejecta is still hot (first
day), the U opacity is strong in the 0.2-1 micron wavelength range and kilonova

approaches to object detection in images. Although they can generally achieve a
good detection performance under normal circumstances, their recall in a scene
with extreme cases is unacceptably low. This is mainly because bounding box
annotations contain much environment noise information, and non-maximum
suppression (NMS) is required to select target boxes. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose the first anchor-free and NMS-free object detection model called
weakly supervised multimodal annotation segmentation (WSMA-Seg), which utilizes
segmentation models to achieve an accurate and robust object detection without
NMS. In WSMA-Seg, multimodal annotations are proposed to achieve an
instance-aware segmentation using weakly supervised bounding boxes; we also
develop a run-data-based following algorithm to trace contours of objects. In
addition, we propose a multi-scale pooling segmentation (MSP-Seg) as the
underlying segmentation model of WSMA-Seg to achieve a more accurate
segmentation and to enhance the detection accuracy of WSMA-Seg. Experimental
results on multiple datasets show that the proposed WSMA-Seg approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors.

  We instead propose to use the concept of signal detection, which is more
universal. In signal detection, it is the sample properties which are detected.
Photons play the role of information carriers for the signal. Signal detection
for example allows modeling the effects which polychromaticity has on image
quality.
  $\mathit{SNR}$ spectra (= spatial $\mathit{SNR}$) are used as a quantity to
describe if reliable signal detection is possible. They include modulation
transfer and phase contrast in addition to noisiness effects. $\mathit{SNR}$

elliptic PDEs with lognormal diffusion coefficient $a=\exp(Z)$ where $Z$ is a
Gaussian random field defined by an infinite series expansion
$Z(\boldsymbol{y}) = \sum_{j\ge1} y_j\,\phi_j$ with $y_j\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$
and a given sequence of functions $\{\phi_j\}_{j\ge1}$. We use the MDFEM to
approximate the expected value of a linear functional of the solution of the
PDE which is an infinite-dimensional integral over the parameter space. The
proposed algorithm uses the multivariate decomposition method (MDM) to compute
the infinite-dimensional integral by a decomposition into finite-dimensional
integrals, which we resolve using quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, and for
which we use the finite element method (FEM) to solve different instances of
the PDE.
  We develop higher-order quasi-Monte Carlo rules for integration over the
finite-dimensional Euclidean space with respect to the Gaussian distribution by
use of a truncation strategy. By linear transformations of interlaced
polynomial lattice rules from the unit cube to a multivariate box of the
Euclidean space we achieve higher-order convergence rates for functions
belonging to a class of anchored Gaussian Sobolev spaces, taking into account
the truncation error.
  Under appropriate conditions, the MDFEM achieves higher-order convergence
rates in term of error versus cost, i.e., to achieve an accuracy of
$O(\epsilon)$ the computational cost is $O(\epsilon^{-1/\lambda-d'/\lambda}) =
O(\epsilon^{-(p^*+d'/\tau)/(1-p^*)})$ where $\epsilon^{-1/\lambda}$ and
$\epsilon^{-d'/\lambda}$ are respectively the cost of the quasi-Monte Carlo
cubature and the finite element approximations, with $d' = d \, (1+\delta')$
for some $\delta' \ge 0$ and $d$ the physical dimension, and $0 < p^* \le

  Estimation","8 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a self-adaptive contractive (SAC) algorithm is proposed for
enhanced dynamic phasor estimation in the diverse operating conditions of
modern power systems. At a high-level, the method is composed of three stages:
parameter shifting, filtering and parameter unshifting. The goal of the first
stage is to transform the input signal phasor so that it is approximately
mapped to nominal conditions. The second stage provides estimates of the
phasor, frequency, rate of change of frequency (ROCOF), damping and rate of
change of damping (ROCOD) of the parameter shifted phasor by using a
differentiator filter bank (DFB). The final stage recovers the original signal
phasor parameters while rejecting misleading estimates. The most important
features of the algorithm are that it offers convergence guarantees in a set of
desired conditions, and also great harmonic rejection. Numerical examples,
including the IEEE C37.118.1 standard tests with realistic noise levels, as
well as fault conditions, validate the proposed algorithm.

latent preferences. The canonical direct-elicitation approach for measuring

improve estimates of peoples' out-of-sample purchase behavior. Furthermore,
swapping WTP data with choice data generated from a simple task,

complex than in Bitcoin because of major differences in the reward system and a

them all at once at the end of an attack cycle. The first strategy is damaging

an attack on the difficulty adjustment formula. We show that the current reward
for signaling uncle blocks is a weak incentive for the attacker to signal
blocks. We compute the profitabilities of different strategies and find out
that for a large parameter space values, strategies that do not signal blocks

that are linked to retrograde (westward) flow at the equatorial day side for
$p<0.1$~bar. Retrograde flow inhibits efficient eastward heat transport and
naturally explains the small hotspot shift and large day-night-side gradient of
WASP-43b ($P_{\text{orb}}=P_{\text{rot}}=0.8135$~days) observed with Spitzer.
We find that deep wind jets are mainly associated with very fast rotations
($P_{\text{rot}}=P_{\text{orb}}\leq 1.5$~days) which correspond to the Rhines
length smaller than $2$ planetary radii. We also diagnose wave activity that
likely gives rise to deviations from superrotation. Further, we show that we
can achieve full steady state in our climate simulations by imposing a deep
forcing regime for $p>10$~bar: convergence time scale
$\tau_{\text{conv}}=10^6-10^8$~s to a common adiabat, as well as linear drag at
depth ($p\geq 200$~bar), which mimics to first order magnetic drag. Lower
boundary stability and the deep forcing assumptions were also tested with
climate simulations for HD~209458b ($P_{\text{orb}}=P_{\text{rot}}=3.5$~days).
HD~209458b simulations always show shallow wind jets (never deeper than
100~bar) and unperturbed superrotation. If we impose a fast rotation
($P_{\text{orb}}=P_{\text{rot}}=0.8135$~days), also the HD~209458b-like
simulation shows equatorial retrograde flow at the day side. We conclude that
the placement of the lower boundary at $p=200$~bar is justified for slow
rotators like HD~209458b, but we suggest that it has to be placed deeper for
fast-rotating, dense hot Jupiters ($P_{\text{orb}}\leq 1.5$~days) like
WASP-43b. Our study highlights that the deep atmosphere may have a strong
influence on the observable atmospheric flow in some hot Jupiters.

perturbations generated by public health officials to slow down or stop a
disease outbreak are studied over distinct classes of static social networks.
The dynamics are stochastic in nature with individuals (nodes) being assigned
fixed levels of education or wealth. Nodes may change their epidemiological
status from susceptible, to infected and to recovered. Most importantly, it is
assumed that when the prevalence reaches a pre-determined threshold level, P*,
information, called awareness in our framework, starts to spread, a process
triggered by public health authorities. Information is assumed to spread over
the same static network and whether or not one becomes a temporary informer, is
a function of his/her level of education or wealth and epidemiological status.
Stochastic simulations show that threshold selection P* and the value of the
average basic reproduction number impact the final epidemic size
differentially. For the Erdos-Renyi and Small-world networks, an optimal choice
for P* that minimize the final epidemic size can be identified under some
conditions while for Scale-free networks this is not case.

during the last decades. However, the emergence of a large number of vehicles
poses the critical but challenging problem of vehicle re-identification (reID).
Till now, for most vehicle reID algorithms, both the training and testing
processes are conducted on the same annotated datasets under supervision.
However, even a well-trained model will still cause fateful performance drop
due to the severe domain bias between the trained dataset and the real-world
scenes.
  To address this problem, this paper proposes a domain adaptation framework
for vehicle reID (DAVR), which narrows the cross-domain bias by fully
exploiting the labeled data from the source domain to adapt the target domain.
DAVR develops an image-to-image translation network named Dual-branch
Adversarial Network (DAN), which could promote the images from the source
domain (well-labeled) to learn the style of target domain (unlabeled) without
any annotation and preserve identity information from source domain. Then the
generated images are employed to train the vehicle reID model by a proposed
attention-based feature learning model with more reasonable styles. Through the
proposed framework, the well-trained reID model has better domain adaptation
ability for various scenes in real-world situations. Comprehensive experimental
results have demonstrated that our proposed DAVR can achieve excellent
performances on both VehicleID dataset and VeRi-776 dataset.

synthesize a new image of that person in pose P(xb), while preserving the
visual details in xa. In order to deal with pixel-to-pixel misalignments caused

connections in the generator of our Generative Adversarial Network. Moreover, a
nearest-neighbour loss is proposed instead of the common L1 and L2 losses in
order to match the details of the generated image with the target image.
Quantitative and qualitative results, using common datasets and protocols
recently proposed for this task, show that our approach is competitive with
respect to the state of the art. Moreover, we conduct an extensive evaluation
using off-the-shell person re-identification (Re-ID) systems trained with

such extra research.
  This paper presents methods for uncertainty quantification and research
prioritisation in health impact models based on Value of Information (VoI)
analysis. Specifically, we
  1. discuss statistical methods for quantifying uncertainty in this type of
model, given the typical kinds of data that are available, which are often
weaker than the ideal data that are desired;
  2. show how the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) can be

uncertainty in the output;
  3. show how research time can be prioritised efficiently, in the light of
which components contribute most to outcome uncertainty.
  The same methods can be used whether the purpose of the model is to estimate
quantities of interest to a policy maker, or to explicitly decide between
policies. We demonstrate how these methods might be used in a model of the

under this principle: applying different spike-based Signal Processing blocks.
Computation in the spike domain requires the conversion of signals from analog
or digital representation to the spike domain, which could present a speed
constraint in many cases. This paper presents a spike-based system to convert
audio information from low-power pulse density modulation (PDM)
MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) microphones into rate coded spike
frequencies. These spikes represent the input signal of the NAS, avoiding the
analog or digital to spike conversion, and therefore improving the time
response of the NAS. This conversion has been done in VHDL as an interface for
PDM microphones, converting their pulses into temporal distributed spikes
following a pulse frequency modulation (PFM) scheme with an accurate
Inter-Spike-Interval, known as ""PDM to spikes interface"" (PSI). This was tested
in two scenarios, first as a stand-alone circuit for its characterization, and
then integrated with a NAS for verification. The PSI achieves a Total Harmonic
Distortion (THD) of -39.51dB and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 59.12dB,
demands less than 1\% of the resources of a Spartan-6 FPGA and has a power
consumption below 5mW.

  effect of spatial superposition of mass on the microstructure of space-time","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we are exploring the feasibility of observing non-classical
features of gravity in a low-energy regime in a quantum optomechanical
experiment. If gravity is to have an underlying quantum nature, it should hold
the most fundamental quantum characteristics such as the superposition
principle and entanglement. Despite the weakness of gravity, in principle there
is a chance, to observe such a quantum signature of the gravity by exploiting
the quantum optomechanical techniques, without direct observation of graviton.
We are investigating a new dynamical scheme called, gravitational quantum
regime, in which the source of gravity is a quantum particle, and its centre of
mass is subject to the spatial superposition. In a Gedankenexperiment, a test
particle is gravitationally interacting with a quantum nanoparticle in a
double-slit setup. Possible entanglement or superposition of the fields is
investigated. We are looking for the corresponding deviation of the classical
description of gravity despite being far from the Planck scale. Any
experimental interrogation which reveals that gravitational field obeys the
quantum superposition principle would be the first recognition of quantumness
of gravity. This study will show how feasible it is to search for a
non-classical feature of gravity in such a regime of motion. Moreover, this
proposal would be an attempt to test the objectivity of the quantum
superposition principle and its contribution to the microstructure of
space-time.

This approach allows to find the value of the parameter $a_0$, for which the
Bose distribution (in the statistical sense) becomes zero. In the second part
of the paper, the process of separation of a nucleon from the atom's nucleus is
studied from the mathematical point of view. At the moment when the nucleon
tears away from the fermionic nucleus, the nucleus becomes a boson. We
investigate the further transformations of bosonic and fermionic separation
states in a small neighborhood of the pressure $P$ equal to zero. We use
infinitely small quantities to modify the parastatistical distribution. Our
conception is based on interpolation formulas yielding expansions in powers of
the density. This method differs from those in other models based on the
interaction potential between two or three particles. We obtain new important
relations connecting the temperature with the chemical potential during the
separation of a nucleon from the atom's nucleus. The obtained relations allow
us to construct, on an antipode of sorts of the Hougen--Watson P-Z chart, the
very high temperature isotherms corresponding to nuclear matter. It is proved
mathematically that the passage of particles satisfying the Fermi--Dirac
distribution to the Bose--Einstein distribution in the neighborhood of pressure
$P$ equal to zero occurs in a region known as the ""halo"".

show that mixtures of exponential distributions with a few components are

individuals from a large pool of candidates, such that certain constraints are

research has successfully considered diverse families of objective functions
and constraints, one of the most common limitations is the focus on the
single-team paradigm. Despite its well-documented applications in multiple
domains, this paradigm is not appropriate when the team-builder needs to
partition the entire population into multiple teams. Team-partitioning tasks
are very common in an educational setting, in which the teacher has to
partition the students in her class into teams for collaborative projects. The
task also emerges in the context of organizations, when managers need to
partition the workforce into teams with specific properties to tackle relevant
projects. In this work, we extend the team formation literature by introducing
the Guided Team-Partitioning (GTP) problem, which asks for the partitioning of
a population into teams such that the centroid of each team is as close as
possible to a given target vector. As we describe in detail in our work, this
formulation allows the team-builder to control the composition of the produced
teams and has natural applications in practical settings. Algorithms for the
GTP need to simultaneously consider the composition of multiple non-overlapping
teams that compete for the same population of candidates. This makes the
problem considerably more challenging than formulations that focus on the
optimization of a single team. In fact, we prove that GTP is NP-hard to solve
and even to approximate. The complexity of the problem motivates us to consider
efficient algorithmic heuristics, which we evaluate via experiments on both
real and synthetic datasets.

fingerprint sensor interoperability problem,). The ridge orientation patterns
in a fingerprint are invariant to sensor type. Based on this observation, we
propose a robust fingerprint descriptor called the co-occurrence of ridge
orientations (Co-Ror), which encodes the spatial distribution of ridge
orientations. Employing this descriptor, we introduce an efficient automatic
fingerprint verification method for cross-matching problem. Further, to enhance
the robustness of the method, we incorporate scale based ridge orientation
information through Gabor-HoG descriptor. The two descriptors are fused with
canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and the matching score between two

people's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to
understand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often
seen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be
possible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates
within set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to
evaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs
and outputs. We place a ""glass box"" around the system by mapping moral values
into explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way
that if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to
the value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and
comparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks
to agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values
into concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability;
stakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant
abstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by
operating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with
different interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an
impact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and
providing them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values.

reveal that there exists the fallacy of definition in P-reduction caused by the
disguised displacement of NDTM from Oracle machine to Turing machine. The
definition or derivation of P-reduction is essentially equivalent to Turing's
computability. Whether NP problems might been reduced to logical forms
(tautology or SAT) or NP problems might been reduced each other, they have not
been really proven in Cook's 1971 paper.

  Compatible with LED Drivers",,"published in 2018",,,"eess.SY cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents design and control of dual-switch non-inverting
buck-boost converter (CBB). This converter is designed to simplify the
compatibility of electronic ballast with simple and low cost LED drivers. The
converter provides starting voltage and current limitation of electronic
ballasts, which operates at continuous conduction mode (CCM). The voltage of
load terminal is controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM regulator.
Although both converter switches are controlled separately, one feedback
control loop is needed to obtain the desired compensator level. Appropriate
control requirements have been defined by analyzing open-loop characteristic of
converter transfer function through the small-signal model of CBB, which lets
decide about the control strategy and analyse the stability and performance of
the closed loop control system. In order to obtain the desired output voltage,
Type-III rational controller is preferred because of the non-minimum phase
feature in the converter boost mode. The performance of the synthesized voltage
controller is verified by comparing of the pre-determined performance
requirements and the obtained simulation results.

changes before cement setting and identify ripening as the major
destabilization mechanism at stake. Drainage plays only a minor role in cement
foam destabilization except when bubble size is large. Then we show that a
single stability criterion can be defined, for a large range of cement foams
with different formulations. This criterion involves the bubble radius and the
yield stress of the cement paste such as confined by and between the bubbles,
at a given characteristic time after sample preparation.

general insights into modern electronic structure theory with a focus on
heavy-element-containing compounds. We first give a short overview of
relativistic Hamiltonians that are frequently applied to account for
relativistic effects. Then, we scrutinize various quantum chemistry methods
that approximate the $N$-electron wave function. In this respect, we will
review the most popular single- and multi-reference approaches that have been
developed to model the multi-reference nature of heavy element compounds and
their ground- and excited-state electronic structures. Specifically, we
introduce various flavors of post-Hartree--Fock methods and optimization
schemes like the complete active space self-consistent field method, the
configuration interaction approach, the Fock-space coupled cluster model, the
pair-coupled cluster doubles ansatz, also known as the antisymmetric product of
1 reference orbital geminal, and the density matrix renormalization group
algorithm. Furthermore, we will illustrate how concepts of quantum information
theory provide us with a qualitative understanding of complex electronic
structures using the picture of interacting orbitals. While modern quantum
chemistry facilitates a quantitative description of atoms and molecules as well
as their properties, concepts of quantum information theory offer new
strategies for a qualitative interpretation that can shed new light onto the
chemistry of complex molecular compounds.
