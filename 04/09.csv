investigate the temporary captures using the tube manifolds of the horizontal
Lyapunov orbits originating at $L_1$ and $L_2$ of the CR3BP at energy values
which have not been considered so far. After showing that the radius of
convergence of any Hamiltonian normalization at $L_1$ or $L_2$ computed with
the Cartesian variables is limited in amplitude by $\|1-\mu-x_{L_1}\|$ ($\mu$
denoting the reduced mass of the problem), we investigate if regularizations
allow us to overcome this limit. In particular, we consider the Hamiltonian
describing the planar three-body problem in the Levi-Civita regularization and
we compute its normalization for the Sun-Jupiter reduced mass for an interval
of energy which overcomes the limit of Cartesian normalizations. As a result,
for the largest values of the energy that we consider, we notice a transition
in the structure of the tubes manifolds emanating from the Lyapunov orbit,
which can contain orbits that collide with the secondary body before performing
one full circulation around it. We discuss the relevance of this transition for
temporary captures.

Controlling error fields during coil fabrication and assembly is crucial for
stellarators. Excessively tight coil tolerance increases time and cost, and, in

improve the recently proposed Hessian matrix method to rapidly identify
important coil deviations. Two of the most common figures of merit, magnetic
island size and quasi-symmetry, are analytically differentiated over coil
parameters. By extracting the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, we can
directly identify sensitive coil deviations in the order of the eigenvalues.
The new method is applied to the upcoming CFQS configuration. Important
perturbations that enlarge n/m=4/11 islands and deteriorate quasi-axisymmetry
of the magnetic field are successfully determined. The results suggest each
modular coil should have separate tolerance and some certain perturbation
combinations will produce significant error fields. By relaxing unnecessary
coil tolerance, this method will hopefully lead to a substantial reduction in

way, which can help remedy several theoretical defects. In order to find out
the properties of interacting dark energy models, it is necessary to
investigate the cosmological perturbations in detail. However, due to the
improper use of pressure perturbation of dark energy, a large-scale instability
at the early stage occurs occasionally. In recent years, parametrized
post-Friedmann approach has been used to calculate the perturbation equations
in the interacting dark energy scenario. Under this framework, the dark energy
pressure perturbation was replaced by the relationship between the momentum
density of dark energy and other components on a large scale. However, this
paper shows that if the interaction terms are related to the velocity
perturbation of dark energy, the density perturbation of dark matter and the
matter power spectrum will diverge when the equation of state parameter of dark
energy $w$ is close to $-1$. A simple parameterization steering clear of this
problem is proposed in this paper which is a more general form and can be
applied to explore the interaction between dark matter and dark energy by using
various cosmological data.

which the probability of a draw under optimal play becomes positive. We study
the nature of the phase transitions which occur for normal play rules (where a
player unable to move loses the game) and misere rules (where a player unable
to move wins), as well as for an ""escape game"" in which one player tries to
force the game to end while the other tries to prolong it forever. For
instance, for a Poisson$(\lambda)$ offspring distribution, the game tree is
infinite with positive probability as soon as $\lambda>1$, but the game with
normal play has positive probability of draws if and only if $\lambda>e$. The
three games generally have different critical points; under certain assumptions
the transitions are continuous for the normal and misere games and
discontinuous for the escape game, but we also discuss cases where the opposite
possibilities occur. We connect the nature of the phase transitions to the
behaviour of quantities such as the expected length of the game under optimal

Beta-Bernoulli multi-armed bandit with Thompson Sampling, and the second stage
learns the training mixing ratio of these selected auxiliary tasks via a

and show that, while sampling from the posterior does indeed lead to better
generalisation than is obtained by standard optimisation of the cost function,
even better performance can in general be achieved by sampling finite
temperature ($T$) distributions derived from the posterior. Taking the example
of two different deep (3 hidden layers) classifiers for MNIST data, we find
quite different $T$ values to be appropriate in each case. In particular, for a
typical neural network classifier a clear minimum of the test error is observed
at $T>0$. This suggests an early stopping criterion for full batch simulated
annealing: cool until the average validation error starts to increase, then
revert to the parameters with the lowest validation error. As $T$ is increased
classifiers transition from accurate classifiers to classifiers that have
higher training error than assigning equal probability to each class. Efficient
studies of these temperature-induced effects are enabled using a
replica-exchange Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation technique. Finally, we show
how thermodynamic integration can be used to perform model selection for deep
neural networks. Similar to the Laplace approximation, this approach assumes
that the posterior is dominated by a single mode. Crucially, however, no
assumption is made about the shape of that mode and it is not required to
precisely compute and invert the Hessian.

environment to gather necessary information for answering user questions.
Existing works have laid a solid foundation towards solving this interesting
problem. But the current performance, especially in navigation, suggests that
EmbodiedQA might be too challenging for the contemporary approaches. In this
paper, we empirically study this problem and introduce 1) a simple yet
effective baseline that achieves promising performance; 2) an easier and
practical setting for EmbodiedQA where an agent has a chance to adapt the
trained model to a new environment before it actually answers users questions.
In this new setting, we randomly place a few objects in new environments, and
upgrade the agent policy by a distillation network to retain the generalization
ability from the trained model. On the EmbodiedQA v1 benchmark, under the
standard setting, our simple baseline achieves very competitive results to
the-state-of-the-art; in the new setting, we found the introduced small change
in settings yields a notable gain in navigation.

planetary signal changes on the order of many km/s during the observations, in
contrast with the telluric absorption which is stationary in wavelength,
allowing us to remove the contamination from telluric lines while preserving
the features of the planetary spectrum. The emission signal from HD 102195b's

their own caste. In examining the desired qualities in a spouse, we find that
individuals open to intercaste marriage are more individualistic in the

mirrors larger societal trends away from collectivism. Finally, we show that

simulation. All techniques resulted in valid inference under a monotone
missingness pattern. A non-monotone missingness pattern led to biased and
non-confidence valid regression coefficients after nested and appended
imputation, depending on the correlation structure of the data. Correlations
within timepoints must be stronger than correlations between timepoints to
obtain valid inference. In an empirical example, the three strategies performed
similarly.We conclude that appended imputation is especially beneficial in
longitudinal datasets that suffer from dropout.

which often relies on fusion of heterogeneous sensors. Although this
heterogeneity presents a challenge for sensor calibration, it is also the main
prospect for reliability and robustness of autonomous systems. In this paper,
we propose a method for multisensor calibration based on Gaussian processes
(GPs) estimated moving object trajectories, resulting with temporal and
extrinsic parameters. The appealing properties of the proposed temporal
calibration method are: coordinate frame invariance, thus avoiding prior
extrinsic calibration, theoretically grounded batch state estimation and
interpolation using GPs, computational efficiency with O(n) complexity,
leveraging data already available in autonomous robot platforms, and the end
result enabling 3D point-to-point extrinsic multisensor calibration. The
proposed method is validated both in simulations and real-world experiments.
For real-world experiment we evaluated the method on two multisensor systems:
an externally triggered stereo camera, thus having temporal ground truth
readily available, and a heterogeneous combination of a camera and motion
capture system. The results show that the estimated time delays are accurate up
to a fraction of the fastest sensor sampling time.

contact with the driver of an approaching vehicle when making their crossing
decisions. This work presents evidence that this widely held belief is false.
We do so by showing that, in majority of cases where conflict is possible,
pedestrians begin crossing long before they are able to see the driver through
the windshield. In other words, we are able to circumvent the very difficult
question of whether pedestrians choose to make eye contact with drivers, by
showing that whether they think they do or not, they can't. Specifically, we
show that over 90\% of people in representative lighting conditions cannot
determine the gaze of the driver at 15m and see the driver at all at 30m. This
means that, for example, that given the common city speed limit of 25mph, more
than 99% of pedestrians would have begun crossing before being able to see
either the driver or the driver's gaze. In other words, from the perspective of
the pedestrian, in most situations involving an approaching vehicle, the
crossing decision is made by the pedestrian solely based on the kinematics of
the vehicle without needing to determine that eye contact was made by
explicitly detecting the eyes of the driver.

arrival rate of peers has recently been shown to be crucially dependent on the
chunk sharing policy employed. Some policies can result in low frequencies of a
particular chunk, known as the missing chunk syndrome, which can dramatically
reduce throughput and lead to instability of the system. For instance, commonly
used policies that nominally ""boost"" the sharing of infrequent chunks such as
the well known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. Recent
efforts have largely focused on the careful design of boosting policies to
mitigate this issue. We take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a
policy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s).
Following terminology from statistics wherein the most frequent value in a data
set is called the mode, we refer to this policy as mode-suppression. We also
consider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode
frequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. We prove
the stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman
bound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer
arrival rate. We then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small
number of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating
these samples over time. We show numerically that the variants of
mode-suppression yield near-optimal download times, and outperform all other
recently proposed chunk sharing algorithms.

challenge here is to learn to navigate in new environments that are unseen

unseen environments as compared to seen ones. In this paper, we present a
generalizable navigational agent. Our agent is trained in two stages. The first
stage is training via mixed imitation and reinforcement learning, combining the
benefits from both off-policy and on-policy optimization. The second stage is
fine-tuning via newly-introduced 'unseen' triplets (environment, path,
instruction). To generate these unseen triplets, we propose a simple but
effective 'environmental dropout' method to mimic unseen environments, which
overcomes the problem of limited seen environment variability. Next, we apply
semi-supervised learning (via back-translation) on these dropped-out
environments to generate new paths and instructions. Empirically, we show that
our agent is substantially better at generalizability when fine-tuned with
these triplets, outperforming the state-of-art approaches by a large margin on
the private unseen test set of the Room-to-Room task, and achieving the top
rank on the leaderboard.

intrinsic 2D-3D mapping ambiguities and limited training data. We adopt a
compact parametric 3D hand model that represents deformable and articulated
hand meshes. To achieve the model fitting to RGB images, we investigate and
contribute in three ways: 1) Neural rendering: inspired by recent work on human
body, our hand mesh estimator (HME) is implemented by a neural network and a
differentiable renderer, supervised by 2D segmentation masks and 3D skeletons.
HME demonstrates good performance for estimating diverse hand shapes and
improves pose estimation accuracies. 2) Iterative testing refinement: Our
fitting function is differentiable. We iteratively refine the initial estimate
using the gradients, in the spirit of iterative model fitting methods like ICP.
The idea is supported by the latest research on human body. 3) Self-data
augmentation: collecting sized RGB-mesh (or segmentation mask)-skeleton
triplets for training is a big hurdle. Once the model is successfully fitted to
input RGB images, its meshes i.e. shapes and articulations, are realistic, and
we augment view-points on top of estimated dense hand poses. Experiments using
three RGB-based benchmarks show that our framework offers beyond
state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation, as well as recovers dense 3D
hand shapes. Each technical component above meaningfully improves the accuracy

i.e. of the dynamics that quantum systems undergo by completely positive maps,
in abstracto: Resources are in principle all maps from one quantum system to
another, but some maps are deemed free. The free maps are supposed to satisfy
certain axioms, among them closure under tensor products, under composition and
freeness of the identity map (the latter two say that the free maps form a
monoid). The free maps act on the resources simply by tensor product and
composition. This generalizes the much-studied resource theories of quantum
states, and abolishes the distinction between resources (states) and the free
maps, which act on the former, leaving only maps, divided into resource-full
and resource-free ones.
  We discuss the axiomatic framework of quantifying channel resources, and show
two general methods of constructing resource monotones of channels.
Furthermore, we show that under mild regularity conditions, each resource
theory of quantum channels has a distinguished monotone, the robustness (and
its smoothed version), generalizing the analogous concept in resource theories
of states. We give an operational interpretation of the log-robustness as the
amount of heat dissipation (randomness) required for resource erasure by random
reversible free maps, valid in broad classes of resource theories of quantum
channels. Technically, this is based on an abstract version of the recent
convex-split lemma, extended from its original domain of quantum states to
ordered vector spaces with sufficiently well-behaved base norms (which includes
the case of quantum channels with diamond norm or variants thereof). Finally,
we remark on several key issues concerning the asymptotic theory.

other young INS families manifest themselves as anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs)
and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) which are commonly accepted as magnetars,
i.e. magnetically powered neutron stars with decaying superstrong fields. Yet
some other young INS are identified as central compact objects (CCOs) and X-ray
dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) which are cooling objects powered by their
thermal energy. Older pulsars, as a result of a previous long episode of
accretion from a companion, manifest themselves as millisecond pulsars and more
commonly appear in binary systems. We use Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture
model (DPGMM), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, for analyzing the
distribution of these pulsar families in the parameter space of period and
period derivative. We compare the average values of the characteristic age,
magnetic dipole field strength, surface temperature and transverse velocity of
all discovered clusters. We verify that DPGMM is robust and provides hints for
inferring relations between different classes of pulsars. We discuss the
implications of our findings for the magneto-thermal spin evolution models and
fallback discs.

typically handled with penalties. We propose *log-barrier extensions*, which
approximate Lagrangian optimization of constrained-CNN problems with a sequence
of unconstrained losses. Unlike standard interior-point and log-barrier
methods, our formulation does not need an initial feasible solution. The
proposed extension yields an upper bound on the duality gap -- generalizing the
result of standard log-barriers -- and yielding sub-optimality certificates for
feasible solutions. While sub-optimality is not guaranteed for non-convex
problems, this result shows that log-barrier extensions are a principled way to
approximate Lagrangian optimization for constrained CNNs via implicit dual
variables. We report weakly supervised image segmentation experiments, with
various constraints, showing that our formulation outperforms substantially the
existing constrained-CNN methods, in terms of accuracy, constraint satisfaction
and training stability, more so when dealing with a large number of

extracting social/political trends. There has been a lot of previous works for
sentiment analysis, some based on hand-engineering relevant textual features,

present a model based on an ensemble of long-short-term-memory (LSTM), and
convolutional neural network (CNN), one to capture the temporal information of

experimental results, we show that using this ensemble model we can outperform
both individual models. We are also able to achieve a very high accuracy rate

which asks if the property of a function having some specified correlation with

question: We show that given distance parameters $\frac{1}{2} >c_u>c_{\ell} \ge
0$, there is a tester which given oracle access to $f:\{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow
\{-1,1\}$, with query complexity $ 2^k \cdot \mathsf{poly}(k,1/|c_u-c_{\ell}|)$
and distinguishes between the following cases:
  $\mathbf{1.}$ The distance of $f$ from any $k$-junta is at least $c_u$;
  $\mathbf{2.}$ There is a $k$-junta $g$ which has distance at most $c_\ell$
from $f$.
  This is the first non-trivial tester (i.e., query complexity is independent
of $n$) which works for all $1/2 > c_u > c_\ell \ge 0$. The best previously
known results by Blais \emph{et~ al.}, required $c_u \ge 16 c_\ell$. In fact,
with the same query complexity, we accomplish the stronger goal of identifying
the most correlated $k$-junta, up to permutations of the coordinates.
  We can further improve the query complexity to $\mathsf{poly}(k,
1/|c_u-c_{\ell}|)$ for the (weaker) task of distinguishing between the
following cases:
  $\mathbf{1.}$ The distance of $f$ from any $k'$-junta is at least $c_u$.
  $\mathbf{2.}$ There is a $k$-junta $g$ which is at a distance at most
$c_\ell$ from $f$.
  Here $k'=O(k^2/|c_u-c_\ell|)$.

$d$-dimensional space using rotations and translations. Assume that there are
sets with common points, and moreover the pairwise correspondences are known
for such sets. We consider a least-squares formulation of this problem, where
the variables are the transforms associated with the point sets. The present
novelty is that we reduce this nonconvex problem to an optimization over the
positive semidefinite cone, where the objective is linear but the constraints
are nevertheless nonconvex. We propose to solve this using variable splitting
and the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM). Due to the
linearity of the objective and the structure of constraints, the ADMM
subproblems are given by projections with closed-form solutions. In particular,
for $m$ point sets, the dominant cost per iteration is the partial
eigendecomposition of an $md \times md$ matrix, and $m-1$ singular value
decompositions of $d \times d$ matrices. We empirically show that for
appropriate parameter settings, the proposed solver has a large convergence
basin and is stable under perturbations. As applications, we use our method for
$2$D shape matching and $3$D multiview registration. In either application, we
model the shapes/scans as point sets and determine the pairwise correspondences
using ICP. In particular, our algorithm compares favorably with existing
methods for multiview reconstruction in terms of timing and accuracy.

general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations employing
finite-temperature equations of state and neutrino-cooling effects. Using eight
different models with dimensionless spins ranging from $\chi\simeq-0.14$ to

angular distribution and composition of the ejected matter. Most importantly,
we find that the dynamical component of the ejected mass can be strongly
suppressed in the case of high spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum.
In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum
yielding a more extended and ""colder"" object, with reduced ability to shed mass

Universe as a function of disk parameters and the amplitude of
non-axisymmetries. We use the 1320 not-highly inclined disk galaxies
($i<65^{\circ}$) from the S$^4$G survey. The ring fraction increases with bar
Fourier density amplitude: this can be interpreted as evidence for the role of
bars in ring formation. The sizes of inner rings are positively correlated with
bar strength: this can be linked to the radial displacement of the 1/4
ultra-harmonic resonance while the bar grows and the pattern speed decreases.
The ring intrinsic ellipticity is weakly controlled by the non-axisymmetric
perturbation strength: this relation is not as strong as expected from
simulations, especially when we include the dark matter halo in the force
calculation. The ratio of outer-to-inner ring semi-major axes is uncorrelated
with bar strength: this questions the manifold origin of rings. In addition, we
confirm that i) $\sim 1/3$ ($\sim 1/4$) of the galaxies hosting inner (outer)
rings are not barred; ii) on average, the sizes and shapes of rings are roughly
the same for barred and non-barred galaxies; and iii) the fraction of inner
(outer) rings is a factor of $1.2-1.4$ ($1.65-1.9$) larger in barred galaxies
than in their non-barred counterparts. Finally, we apply unsupervised machine
learning (Self-Organizing Maps, SOMs) to show that, among early-type galaxies,
ringed or barred galaxies cannot be univocally distinguished based on 20
internal and external fundamental parameters. We confirm, with the aid of SOMs,
that rings are mainly hosted by red, massive, gas-deficient, dark-matter poor,
and centrally concentrated galaxies. We conclude that the present-day coupling
between rings and bars is not as robust as predicted by numerical models

  LCE Data Structure","Full version of a paper accepted to STOC 2019",,"10.1145/3313276.3316368",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is an invertible text transformation that,
given a text $T$ of length $n$, permutes its symbols according to the
lexicographic order of suffixes of $T$. BWT is one of the most heavily studied
algorithms in data compression with numerous applications in indexing, sequence
analysis, and bioinformatics. Its construction is a bottleneck in many
scenarios, and settling the complexity of this task is one of the most
important unsolved problems in sequence analysis that has remained open for 25
years. Given a binary string of length $n$, occupying $O(n/\log n)$ machine
words, the BWT construction algorithm due to Hon et al. (SIAM J. Comput., 2009)
runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(n/\log n)$ space. Recent advancements (Belazzougui,
STOC 2014, and Munro et al., SODA 2017) focus on removing the alphabet-size
dependency in the time complexity, but they still require $\Omega(n)$ time.
  In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that breaks the $O(n)$-time
barrier for BWT construction. Given a binary string of length $n$, our
procedure builds the Burrows-Wheeler transform in $O(n/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and
$O(n/\log n)$ space. We complement this result with a conditional lower bound
proving that any further progress in the time complexity of BWT construction
would yield faster algorithms for the very well studied problem of counting
inversions: it would improve the state-of-the-art $O(m\sqrt{\log m})$-time
solution by Chan and P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu (SODA 2010). Our algorithm is based on a
novel concept of string synchronizing sets, which is of independent interest.
As one of the applications, we show that this technique lets us design a data
structure of the optimal size $O(n/\log n)$ that answers Longest Common
Extension queries (LCE queries) in $O(1)$ time and, furthermore, can be
deterministically constructed in the optimal $O(n/\log n)$ time.

models with independent measurements of the neutron star radii expected from
x-ray astronomy (the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from
pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of
recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. This method eschews the need to
invoke the so-called parabolic approximation to extrapolate from symmetric
nuclear matter, allowing us to directly constrain the neutron-matter EoS. Using
a principal component analysis, we identify the combination of parameters most
tightly constrained by observational data. We discuss sensitivity to various
effects such as different component masses through population-model
sensitivity, phase transitions in the core EoS, and large deviations from the
central parameter values.

an example of a more general problem of finding consistent descriptions of

N$_{H}$$>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ while 15 are moderately obscured AGNs with
10$^{22}$ $<$ N$_{H}$ $<$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. Additionally, we estimate AGN
contributions to the IR luminosity (8-1000$\mu$m rest-frame) greater than 20%
for 19 DOGs based on SED decomposition using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m and the five
Herschel bands (100-500 $\mu$m). Only 7 of these are detected in X-rays
individually. We performed a X-ray stacking analysis for the 86 undetected
DOGs. We find that the AGN fraction in DOGs increases with 24$\mu$m flux and
that it is higher than that of the general 24$\mu$m population. However, no
significant difference is found when considering only X-ray detections. This
strongly motivates the combined use of X-ray and far-IR surveys to successfully
probe a wider population of AGNs, particularly for the most obscured ones.

dynamics of one-dimensional spin-1 models that conserve charge (total $S^z$)

only three-site terms and find that the infinite temperature auto-correlation
saturates to a finite value---showcasing non-thermal behavior. The absence of
thermalization is identified as a consequence of the strong fragmentation of
the Hilbert space into exponentially many invariant subspaces in the local
$S^z$ basis, arising from the interplay of dipole conservation and local
interactions. Second, we extend the model by including four-site terms and find
that this perturbation leads to a weak fragmentation: the system still has
exponentially many invariant subspaces, but they are no longer sufficient to
avoid thermalization for typical initial states. More generally, for any finite
range of interactions, the system still exhibits non-thermal eigenstates
appearing throughout the entire spectrum. We compare our results to charge and
dipole moment conserving random unitary circuit models for which we reach
identical conclusions.

relativistic heavy ions and is a precursor to the quark-gluon plasma. The
existence of this state is a prediction of the color glass condensate (CGC)
effective theory. In many applications of the CGC framework, the boost
invariant approximation is employed. It assumes that the longitudinal extent of
the nuclei can be approximated as infinitesimally thin. Consequently, the
Glasma produced from such a collision is boost invariant and can be effectively
described in 2+1D. Therefore, observables of the boost invariant Glasma are by
construction independent of rapidity.
  The main goal of this thesis is to develop a numerical method for the
non-boost-invariant setting where nuclei are assumed to be thin, but of finite
longitudinal extent. This is in conflict with a number of simplifications that
are used in the boost invariant case. In particular, one has to describe the
collisions in 3+1D in the laboratory or center-of-mass frame. The change of
frame forces the explicit inclusion of the color charges of nuclei. The new
method is tested using an extension of the McLerran-Venugopalan model which
includes a parameter for longitudinal thickness. It reproduces the boost
invariant setting as a limiting case. Studying the pressure components of the
Glasma, one finds the pressure anisotropy remains large. The energy density of
the Glasma depends on rapidity due to the explicit breaking of boost
invariance. The width of the observed rapidity profiles is controlled by the
collision energy and can be shown to roughly agree with experimental data.
Finally, a new numerical scheme for real-time lattice gauge theory is developed
which provides higher numerical stability than the previous method. This new
scheme is shown to be gauge-covariant and conserves the Gauss constraint even
for large time steps.

resource that provides the computational speed-up for quantum computation. For
universal quantum computation using qudits, of odd-prime dimension,
contextuality has been shown to be a necessary and possibly sufficient
resource. However, the role of contextuality in quantum computation with qubits
remains open. The $n$-qubit stabilizer formalism, which by itself cannot
provide a quantum computer super-polynomial computational advantage over a
classical counterpart, is contextual. Therefore contextuality cannot be
identified as a sufficient resource for quantum computation. However it can be
identified as a necessary resource. In this paper we construct a contextual
$\psi$-epistemic ontological model of the $n$-qubit stabilizer formalism, to
investigate the contextuality present in the formalism. We demonstrate it is
possible for such a model to be outcome deterministic, and therefore have a
value assignment to all Pauli observables. In our model the value assignment
must be updated after a measurement of any stabilizer observable. Remarkably,
this includes the value assignments for observables that commute with the
measurement. A stronger manifestation of contextuality than is required by
known no-go theorems.

Active scanning, which generates irregular traffic, is a method to get an
overview of connected and active devices. Since such additional traffic may
lead to an unexpected behavior of devices, active scanning methods should be
avoided in critical infrastructure networks. In such cases, passive network
monitoring offers an alternative, which is often used in conjunction with
complex deep-packet inspection techniques. There are very few publications on
lightweight passive scanning methodologies for industrial networks. In this

observed clustering of LAEs, adding a new potential difficulty to the
interpretation of upcoming surveys. We present a model of LAEs that
incorporates Lyman-alpha radiative transfer processes in the interstellar and

model of galaxy of formation and evolution. We find that the radiative transfer
inside galaxies produces selection effects over galaxy properties. In
particular, observed LAEs tend to have low metallicities and intermediate star
formation rates. At low redshift we find no evidence of a correlation between
the spatial distribution of LAEs and the intergalactic medium properties.
However, at high redshift the LAEs are linked to the line of sight velocity and
density gradient of the intergalactic medium. The strength of the coupling
depends on the outflow properties of the galaxies and redshift. This effect
modifies the clustering of LAEs on large scales, adding non linear features. In
particular, our model predicts modifications to the shape and position of the
baryon acoustic oscillation peak. This work highlights the importance of
including radiative transfer physics in the cosmological analysis of LAEs.

have been an area of great interest for several years, with the sought-after
ability to control magnetic degrees of freedom via charge currents serving as
an impetus. The orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) is a kinetic magnetoelectric
effect consisting of a bulk orbital magnetization induced by a charge current.
It is the orbital analogue of the spin Edelstein effect in spin-orbit coupled
materials, in which a charge current drives nonzero electron spin
magnetization. The OEE has recently been investigated in the context of Weyl
semimetals and Weyl metals. Motivated by these developments, we study a model
of electrons without spin-orbit coupling which exhibits line nodes that get
gapped out by via symmetry breaking due to an interaction-induced charge
density wave order. This model is shown to exhibit a temperature dependent OEE,
which appears due to symmetry reduction into a gyrotropic crystal class.

the state of the art PPF-FoldNet auto-encoder (AE) with a pose-variant sibling,
where the discrepancy between the two leads to pose-specific descriptors. Based
upon this, we introduce RelativeNet, a relative pose estimation network to
assign correspondence-specific orientations to the keypoints, eliminating any

hypothesize-and-verify algorithm to quickly use the predictions and align two

followed from observations that rely on deriving parameters from
column-integrated paths through the emitting layer. Here, we investigate the
effects of density and temperature gradients along such paths on the measured
H$_{3}^{+}$ spectrum and its resulting interpretation. In a non-isothermal
atmosphere, H$_{3}^{+}$ column densities retrieved from such observations are
found to represent a lower limit, reduced by 20% or more from the true

measured H$_{3}^{+}$ temperature variations are often attributable to
well-understood solar zenith angle effects rather than indications of real
atmospheric variability. Finally, based on these insights, a preliminary method
of deriving vertical temperature structure is demonstrated at Jupiter using
model reproductions of electron density and H$_{3}^{+}$ measurements. The sheer
diversity and uncertainty of conditions in planetary atmospheres prohibits this

extended duration containing little change. Applying densely an action

from their state-chart graphs. A set of operations are commutative if changing
the order of their execution on an object does not affect the abstract state of
the object and returns the same response. Concurrent operations that commute at
object-level can be executed concurrently at transaction-level, which boosts
performance while preserving the appearance of atomicity and isolation.
Utilizing object-level commutativity in transactional execution enables the
reuse of existing non-blocking programming techniques for thread-level
synchronization. In our approach, we generate state-chart graphs by tracking
data on the atomic instructions invoked on the concurrent object during model
checking and represent the atomic instructions as states in a state-transition
representation. Considering the non-deterministic nature of concurrent
programs, we determine commutativity by exhaustively searching for identical
object states captured at a thread-level granularity across all thread
interleavings. With this methodology, a user can not only verify commutativity
among operations, but also can visually check ways in which methods commute at
object-level, which is an edge over current state-of-the-art tools. The
object-level commutative information helps in identifying faulty
implementations and performance improvement considerations. We use the graph
database, Neo4j, to represent object states as nodes that further assists the
user to check for concurrency properties using Cypher queries.

whether the presence of massive satellite has any effect on the whole satellite
population in MW analogues. In this article, we investigate this problem using
a semi-analytical model combined with the Millennium-II Simulation.
MW-analogous galaxies are defined to have similar stellar mass or dark matter
halo mass to the MW. We find that, in the first case, the halo mass is larger
and there are, on average, twice as many satellites in Milky Way analogs if
there is a massive satellite galaxy in the system. This is mainly from the halo
formation bias. The difference is smaller if MW analogues are selected using
halo mass. We also find that the satellites distribution is slightly
asymmetric, being more concentrated on the line connecting the central galaxy
and the massive satellite and that, on average, LMC have brought in 14.7
satellite galaxies with $M_{r}<0$ at its accretion, among which 4.5 satellites
are still within a distance of 50kpc from the LMC. Considering other
satellites, we predict that thereare 7.8 satellites with 50kpc of the LMC. By
comparing our model with the early data of Satellites Around Galactic Analogs

limitations of natural lifting (aka escalation) techniques. For example, we
prove that even optimal rank lower bounds on $k$-tensors cannot yield
non-trivial lower bounds on the rank of $d$-tensors, for any constant $d>k$.
This significantly extends recent barrier results on the limits of (matrix)
rank methods by Efremenko, Garg, Oliveira and Wigderson, which handles the
(very important) case $k=2$.
  Our generalization requires the development of new technical tools and
results in algebraic geometry, which are interesting in their own right and
possibly applicable elsewhere. The basic issue they probe is the relation
between numeric and symbolic rank of tensors, essential in the proofs of
previous and current barriers. Our main technical result implies that for every
symbolic $k$-tensor (namely one whose entries are polynomials in some set of
variables), if the tensor rank is small for every evaluation of the variables,
then it is small symbolically. This statement is obvious for $k=2$.
  To prove an analogous statement for $k>2$ we develop a ""numeric to symbolic""
transfer of algebraic relations to algebraic functions, somewhat in the spirit
of the implicit function theorem. It applies in the general setting of
inclusion of images of polynomial maps, in the form appearing in Raz's elusive
functions approach to proving VP $\neq$ VNP. We give a toy application showing
how our transfer theorem may be useful in pursuing this approach to prove
arithmetic complexity lower bounds.

gamma-ray burst (GRB) absorbers at $1<z<3$ showing the presence of neutral
carbon (\ion{C}{I}). By modelling their parametric extinction laws, we discover
a broad range of dust models characterizing the GRB \ion{C}{I} absorption
systems. In addition to the already well-established correlation between the
amount of \ion{C}{I} and visual extinction, $A_V$, we also observe a
correlation with the total-to-selective reddening, $R_V$. All three quantities
are also found to be connected to the presence and strength of the 2175\,{\AA}
dust extinction feature. While the amount of \ion{C}{I} is found to be
correlated with the SED-derived dust properties, we do not find any evidence
for a connection with the depletion-derived dust content as measured from
[Zn/Fe] and $N$(Fe)$_{\rm dust}$. To reconcile this, we discuss a scenario
where the observed extinction is dominated by the composition of dust particles
confined in the molecular gas-phase of the ISM. We argue that since the
depletion level trace non-carbonaceous dust in the ISM, the observed extinction
in GRB \ion{C}{I} absorbers is primarily produced by carbon-rich dust in the
molecular cloud and is therefore only observable in the extinction curves and
not in the depletion patterns. This also indicates that the 2175\,{\AA} dust
extinction feature is caused by dust and molecules in the cold and molecular
gas-phase. This scenario provides a possible resolution to the discrepancy
between the depletion- and SED-derived amounts of dust in high-$z$ absorbers.

  Traffic",,,,,"math.OC math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop backstepping state feedback control to stabilize a moving
shockwave in a freeway segment under bilateral boundary actuations of traffic
flow. A moving shockwave, consisting of light traffic upstream of the shockwave
and heavy traffic downstream, is usually caused by changes of local road
situations. The density discontinuity travels upstream and drivers caught in
the shockwave experience transitions from free to congested traffic. Boundary
control design in this paper brings the moving shockwave front to a static
setpoint position, hindering the upstream propagation of traffic congestion.
The traffic dynamics are described with Lighthill-Whitham-Richard (LWR) model,
leading to a system of two first-order hyperbolic partial differential
equations (PDEs). Each represents the traffic density of a spatial domain
segregated by the moving interface. By Rankine-Hugoniot condition, the
interface position is driven by flux discontinuity and thus governed by a PDE
state dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE). For the PDE-ODE coupled
system. the control objective is to stabilize both the PDE states of traffic
density and the ODE state of moving shock position to setpoint values. Using
delay representation and backstepping method, we design predictor feedback
controllers to cooperatively compensate state-dependent input delays to the
ODE. From Lyapunov stability analysis, we show local stability of the
closed-loop system in $H^1$ norm. The performance of controllers is
demonstrated by numerical simulation.

bottleneck. Traffic on a freeway segment with capacity drop at outlet of the
segment is a common phenomenon leading to traffic bottleneck problem. The
capacity drop can be caused by lane-drop, hills, tunnel, bridge or curvature on
the road. If incoming traffic flow remains unchanged, traffic congestion forms
upstream of the bottleneck due to outgoing traffic overflowing its capacity.
Therefore, it is important for us to regulate the incoming traffic flow of the
segment so that the outgoing traffic at the bottleneck can be discharged with
the maximum flow rate. Traffic densities on the freeway segment are described
with Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) macroscopic Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) model. To prevent the traffic congestion forming upstream of the
bottleneck, incoming flow at the inlet of the freeway segment is controlled so
that the optimal density could be achieved to maximize the outgoing flow and
not to surpass the capacity at outlet. The density and traffic flow relation,
described with fundamental diagram, is assumed to be unknown at the bottleneck
area. We tackle this problem using Extremum Seeking (ES) Control with delay
compensation for LWR PDE. ES control, a non-model based approach for real-time
optimization, is adopted to find the optimal density for the unknown
fundamental diagram. A predictor feedback control design is proposed to
compensate the delay effect of traffic dynamics in the freeway segment. In the

changed our perception of the universe and humanity's place within it. Recent
work indicates that a solar system's X-ray and high energy particle environment
is of fundamental importance to the formation and development of the
atmospheres of close-in planets such as hot Jupiters, and Earth-like planets
around M stars. X-ray imaging and spectroscopy provide powerful and unique
windows into the high energy flux that an exoplanet experiences, and X-ray
photons also serve as proxies for potentially transfigurative coronal mass
ejections. Finally, if the host star is a bright enough X-ray source, transit
measurements akin to those in the optical and infrared are possible and allow
for direct characterization of the upper atmospheres of exoplanets. In this
brief white paper, we discuss contributions to the study of exoplanets and
their environs which can be made by X-ray data of increasingly high quality
that are achievable in the next 10--15 years.

In this direction, Fe$_{2}$ScX (X=P,As,Sb) compounds are investigated using mBJ
for the band gap and SCAN to describe the electronic bands and phonon
properties for TE applications. The band gaps obtained from mBJ are 0.81 eV,
0.69 eV and 0.60 eV for Fe$_{2}$ScX compounds, respectively. The phonon
dispersion, phonon density of states (DOS) and partial DOS are calculated. The
phonon contributions to specific heat are obtained as a function of temperature
under harmonic approximation. The electronic band structutre calculated from
mBJ and SCAN functionals are qualitatively compared. The TE parameters are
calculated for both hole and electron dopings under semiclassical theory. We
use simple, but reasonable method to estimate phonon relaxation time
($\tau_{ph}$). Using the specific heat, estimated $\tau_{ph}$ and slopes (phase
velocity) of acoustic branches in the linear region, lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) at 300 K is calculated for three compounds. The
obtained values of $\kappa_{ph}$ with constant $\tau_{ph}$ are 18.2, 13.6 and
10.3 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively. Finally, the temperature dependent figure
of merit $ZT$ values are calculated for optimal carrier concentrations in the
doping range considered, to evaluate the materials for TE application. The $ZT$
values for n-type Fe$_{2}$ScX, in 900-1200 K, are 0.34-0.43, 0.40-0.48 and

reduction techniques e.g., cryogenic cooling. In this paper, we performed a
noise-induced decoherence analysis of single and multi-qubit quantum gates
using physics-based simulations. The analysis indicates that (i) decoherence
depends on the input state and the gate type. Larger number of $|1\rangle$

phase damping; (iii) shorter depth implementation of a quantum function can
achieve lower decoherence. Simulations indicate 20\% improvement in the

inner surface of the cell membrane influences the direction of cell expansion
and thereby plant morphology. For correct expansion of organs that primarily
grow by elongating, such as roots and stems, MTs must bend in the
high-curvature direction along the cylindrically shaped cell membrane in order
to form the required circumferential arrays. Computational studies, which have
recapitulated the self-organization of these arrays, ignored MT mechanics and
assumed MTs follow geodesics of the cell surface. Here, we show, through
analysis of a derived Euler-Lagrange equation, that an elastic MT constrained
to a cylindrical surface will deflect away from geodesics and toward low
curvature directions to minimize bending energy. This occurs when the curvature
of the cell surface is relatively high for a given anchor density. In the limit
of infinite anchor density, MTs always follow geodesics. We compare our
analytical predictions to measured curvatures and anchor densities and find
that the regime in which cells are forming these cortical arrays straddles the
region of parameter space in which arrays must form under the antagonistic
influence of this mechanically induced deflection. Although this introduces a
potential obstacle to forming circumferentially orientated arrays that needs to
be accounted for in the models, it also raises the question of whether plants
use this mechanical phenomenon to regulate array orientation. The model also
constitutes an elegant generalization of the classical Euler-bucking
instability along with an intrinsic unfolding of the associated pitchfork
bifurcation.

coupling on the energy evolution of charged projectiles in the classical
one-component plasma. The average projectile kinetic energy is found to
decrease linearly with time when $\nu_{\alpha}/\omega_{p} \lesssim 10^{-2}$,
where $\nu_{\alpha }$ is the Coulomb collision frequency between the projectile
and the medium, and $\omega_{p}$ is the plasma frequency. Stopping power is
obtained from the slope of this curve. In comparison to the weakly coupled
limit, strong Coulomb coupling causes the magnitude of the stopping power to
increase, the Bragg peak to shift to several times the plasma thermal speed,
and for the stopping power curve to broaden substantially. The rate of change
of the total projectile kinetic energy averaged over many independent
simulations is shown to consist of two measurable components: a component
associated with a one-dimensional friction force, and a thermal energy exchange
rate. In the limit of a slow and massive projectile, these can be related to
the macroscopic transport rates of self-diffusion and temperature relaxation in
the plasma. Simulation results are compared with available theoretical models
for stopping power, self-diffusion coefficients, and temperature relaxation
rates.

deep neural network from scratch, transfer learning has been extensively used
in many deep-neural-network-based applications. A commonly used transfer
learning approach involves taking a part of a pre-trained model, adding a few
layers at the end, and re-training the new layers with a small dataset. This
approach, while efficient and widely used, imposes a security vulnerability
because the pre-trained model used in transfer learning is usually publicly
available, including to potential attackers. In this paper, we show that
without any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker
can launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft
instances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. We assume
that the attacker has no access to any target-specific information, including
samples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by
Softmax to each class, and thus making the attack target-agnostic. These
assumptions render all previous attack models inapplicable, to the best of our
knowledge. To evaluate the proposed attack, we perform a set of experiments on
face recognition and speech recognition tasks and show the effectiveness of the
attack. Our work reveals a fundamental security weakness of the Softmax layer
when used in transfer learning settings.

surface. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate the compensation
problem as an end-to-end learning problem and propose a convolutional neural
network, named CompenNet, to implicitly learn the complex compensation
function. CompenNet consists of a UNet-like backbone network and an autoencoder
subnet. Such architecture encourages rich multi-level interactions between the
camera-captured projection surface image and the input image, and thus captures
both photometric and environment information of the projection surface. In
addition, the visual details and interaction information are carried to deeper
layers along the multi-level skip convolution layers. The architecture is of
particular importance for the projector compensation task, for which only a
small training dataset is allowed in practice. Another contribution we make is
a novel evaluation benchmark, which is independent of system setup and thus
quantitatively verifiable. Such benchmark is not previously available, to our
best knowledge, due to the fact that conventional evaluation requests the
hardware system to actually project the final results. Our key idea, motivated
from our end-to-end problem formulation, is to use a reasonable surrogate to
avoid such projection process so as to be setup-independent. Our method is
evaluated carefully on the benchmark, and the results show that our end-to-end

labelled examples. A successful approach to tackle this problem is to compare
the similarity between examples in a learned metric space based on
convolutional neural networks. However, existing methods typically suffer from
meta-level overfitting due to the limited amount of training tasks and do not
normally consider the importance of the convolutional features of different
examples within the same channel. To address these limitations, we make the
following two contributions: (a) We propose a novel meta-learning approach for
aggregating useful convolutional features and suppressing noisy ones based on a
channel-wise attention mechanism to improve class representations. The proposed
model does not require fine-tuning and can be trained in an end-to-end manner.
The main novelty lies in incorporating a shared weight generation module that
learns to assign different weights to the feature maps of different examples
within the same channel. (b) We also introduce a simple meta-level dropout
technique that reduces meta-level overfitting in several few-shot learning
approaches. In our experiments, we find that this simple technique
significantly improves the performance of the proposed method as well as
various state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms. Applying our method to

gradients of the Galactic disk. The analysis is based on high-resolution
spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan Clay 6.5-m
telescope on Las Campanas. We used a non-NLTE analysis in a self-consistent
semi-automatic routine based on TLUSTY and SYNSPEC to determine atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances. Stellar parameters (effective temperature,
surface gravity, projected rotational velocity, microturbulence, and
macroturbulence) and silicon and oxygen abundances are presented for 28 stars
located beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic centre plus three stars in the solar
neighborhood. The stars of our sample are mostly on the main-sequence, with
effective temperatures between 20800 - 31300 K, and surface gravities between
3.23 - 4.45 dex. The radial oxygen and silicon abundance gradients are negative
and have slopes of -0.07 dex/kpc and -0.09 dex/kpc, respectively, in the region
$8.4 \leq R_G \leq 15.6$\,kpc. The obtained gradients are compatible with the
present-day oxygen and silicon abundances measured in the solar neighborhood
and are consistent with radial metallicity gradients predicted by
chemodynamical models of Galaxy Evolution for a subsample of young stars
located close to the Galactic plane.

message-passing network sto compute its edge connectivity $\lambda$ exactly in
the CONGEST model, as long as there are no parallel edges. Our algorithm takes
$\tilde O(n^{1-1/353}D^{1/353}+n^{1-1/706})$ time to compute $\lambda$ and a
cut of cardinality $\lambda$ with high probability, where $n$ and $D$ are the
number of nodes and the diameter of the network, respectively, and $\tilde O$
hides polylogarithmic factors. This running time is sublinear in $n$ (i.e.
$\tilde O(n^{1-\epsilon})$) whenever $D$ is. Previous sublinear-time
distributed algorithms can solve this problem either (i) exactly only when
$\lambda=O(n^{1/8-\epsilon})$ [Thurimella PODC'95; Pritchard, Thurimella, ACM
Trans. Algorithms'11; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14] or (ii) approximately [Ghaffari,
Kuhn, DISC'13; Nanongkai, Su, DISC'14].
  To achieve this we develop and combine several new techniques. First, we
design the first distributed algorithm that can compute a $k$-edge connectivity
certificate for any $k=O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{nk}+D)$.
Second, we show that by combining the recent distributed expander decomposition
technique of [Chang, Pettie, Zhang, SODA'19] with techniques from the
sequential deterministic edge connectivity algorithm of [Kawarabayashi, Thorup,
STOC'15], we can decompose the network into a sublinear number of clusters with
small average diameter and without any mincut separating a cluster (except the
`trivial' ones). Finally, by extending the tree packing technique from [Karger
STOC'96], we can find the minimum cut in time proportional to the number of
components. As a byproduct of this technique, we obtain an $\tilde O(n)$-time
algorithm for computing exact minimum cut for weighted graphs.

In contrast to the functional limit theorem in [arXiv:1902.06249v1] for

essential, as we present an example showing that the theorem extended with the

(e.g., a solution of an SDE with irregular coefficients or a Markov process

stellar streams and stellar overdensities. Validation tests on synthetic data
possessing similar properties to the DES data show that the method is able to
recover input parameters with a precision better than 3\%. Based on the
best-fit models, we create simulated stellar catalogues covering the whole DES

provide evidence for a break in the power law index describing the stellar

couple linearly to the gauge field. In the first paper of the series we have
shown that the theory reproduces continuum $\text{SU}(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory
in $d=2$ dimensions if $N_b$ is larger than $N_c-\frac{3}{4}$ and conjectured,
following the argument of Budzcies and Zirnbauer, that this remains true for

simulations of the simplest nontrivial case, i.e., gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$
in three dimensions. We show that observables computed in the induced theory,
such as the static $q\bar q$ potential and the deconfinement transition
temperature, agree with the same observables computed from the ordinary
plaquette action up to lattice artifacts. We also find that the bound for $N_b$
can be relaxed to $N_c-\frac{5}{4}$ as conjectured in our earlier paper.
Studies of how the new discretization can be used to change the order of
integration in the path integral to arrive at dual formulations of QCD are left

bones without explicitly segmenting them. Towards this, we propose a new simple
yet efficient deep network architecture, called \textit{relational reasoning
network (RRN)}, to accurately learn the local and the global relations among
the landmarks in CMF bones; specifically, mandible, maxilla, and nasal bones.
  Approach: The proposed RRN works in an end-to-end manner, utilizing learned
relations of the landmarks based on dense-block units. For a given few
landmarks as input, RRN treats the landmarking process similar to a data
imputation problem where predicted landmarks are considered missing.
  Results: We applied RRN to cone beam computed tomography scans obtained from
250 patients. With a 4-fold cross validation technique, we obtained an average
root mean squared error of less than 2 mm per landmark. Our proposed RRN has
revealed unique relationships among the landmarks that help us in inferring
several \textit{reasoning} about informativeness of the landmark points. The
proposed system identifies the missing landmark locations accurately even when
severe pathology or deformation are present in the bones.
  Conclusions: Accurately identifying anatomical landmarks is a crucial step in
deformation analysis and surgical planning for CMF surgeries. Achieving this
goal without the need for explicit bone segmentation addresses a major
limitation of segmentation based approaches, where segmentation failure (as
often the case in bones with severe pathology or deformation) could easily lead
to incorrect landmarking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of
its kind algorithm finding anatomical relations of the objects using deep
learning.

flavor-oscillations and decoherence on their way to Earth due to their
interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected in
pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation
pattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the
characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.
From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by
the presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider
different DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the
eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states
with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions
with DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the
resulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,
e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density
distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we
identify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM
model. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the
extent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM
produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects
may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino
flavor-states by letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated
response seem to support the notion that these neutrinos can be taken as DM
tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence and/or competition
of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.

with a wide bandwidth from zero to megahertz range. Full vector sensing
capability is proffered by modulating fields along the preferential NV axis and
in the transverse plane and subsequent demodulation of the signal. This sensor
exhibits a root mean square noise floor of about 300 pT/Hz^(1/2) in all
directions. The present technique is broadly applicable to both ensemble
sensors and potentially also single-NV sensors, extending the vector capability
to nanoscale measurement under ambient temperatures.

challenge to future robotic vision systems. As a source of inspiration, insects
are quite apt at searching for mates and tracking prey -- which always appear
as small dim speckles in the visual field. The exquisite sensitivity of insects
for small target motion, as revealed recently, is coming from a class of
specific neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Although a few
STMD-based models have been proposed, these existing models only use motion
information for small target detection and cannot discriminate small targets
from small-target-like background features (named as fake features). To address
this problem, this paper proposes a novel visual system model (STMD+) for small
target motion detection, which is composed of four subsystems -- ommatidia,
motion pathway, contrast pathway and mushroom body. Compared to existing
STMD-based models, the additional contrast pathway extracts directional
contrast from luminance signals to eliminate false positive background motion.
The directional contrast and the extracted motion information by the motion
pathway are integrated in the mushroom body for small target discrimination.
Extensive experiments showed the significant and consistent improvements of the
proposed visual system model over existing STMD-based models against fake
features.

population of AGB stars is too luminous to have evolved from the oldest
globular cluster age stellar population, yet has a velocity dispersion
consistent with the oldest populations (the red clump stars) in the bulge. We
identify two groups of maser stars by their kinematics; the subgroup with
kinematics similar to the bulge has the highest bolometric luminosities with
some giants reaching $M_{bol}<-6$. In a new result, we find that the most
luminous maser stars with bulge kinematics are concentrated to the Galactic
plane with the most luminous maers being found at $b<\mid 1.5^\circ \mid$;
while the disk maser population shows no such difference. This mirrors a
similar concentration to the Galactic Center found for long period Miras, noted

well execution without the knowledge of second order moments of the wireless

predict the next item a user will choose are crucial for online platforms.
However, existing approaches often use out-of-the-box sequence models which are
limited by speed and memory consumption, are often infeasible for production
environments, and usually do not incorporate cross-session information, which
is crucial for effective recommendations. Here we propose Hierarchical Temporal
Convolutional Networks (HierTCN), a hierarchical deep learning architecture
that makes dynamic recommendations based on users' sequential multi-session
interactions with items. HierTCN is designed for web-scale systems with
billions of items and hundreds of millions of users. It consists of two levels
of models: The high-level model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to
aggregate users' evolving long-term interests across different sessions, while
the low-level model is implemented with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN),
utilizing both the long-term interests and the short-term interactions within
sessions to predict the next interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on a
public XING dataset and a large-scale Pinterest dataset that contains 6 million
users with 1.6 billion interactions. We show that HierTCN is 2.5x faster than
RNN-based models and uses 90% less data memory compared to TCN-based models. We
further develop an effective data caching scheme and a queue-based mini-batch
generator, enabling our model to be trained within 24 hours on a single GPU.
Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic recommendation
methods, with up to 18% improvement in recall and 10% in mean reciprocal rank.

non-relativistic mean field models consistent with bulk properties of finite
nuclei and the observed lower bound on the maximum mass of neutron star. The
tidal deformability and radius show a strong correlation with specific linear
combinations of the isoscalar and isovector nuclear matter parameters
associated with the EoS. Such correlations suggest that a precise value of the
radius or the tidal deformability can put tight bounds on several EoS
parameters, in particular, on the slope of the incompressibility and the
curvature of the symmetry energy. We show that the density dependence of the

the density dependence of the symmetry energy on the extension of the
crust-core transition region of a magnetized neutron star. The increase of the

introduction of the term constituent to describe a set which is within a given

assigns to any given set a diagram which specifies a directed graph, or

structure isomorphisms between sets need not preserve the number of elements,

five-element set, which is a surjective mapping despite the mismatch in
cardinalities. The constituent structure of a set determines the mathematical
objects for which the set is a suitable representation. Different schemes for

specific and novel way of representing ordered pairs and tuples of sets as

prior knowledge of the domain of interest. This is achieved by the introduction
of a new family of adaptation layers, based on the principles of squeeze and
excitation, and a new domain-attention mechanism. In the proposed universal
detector, all parameters and computations are shared across domains, and a
single network processes all domains all the time. Experiments, on a newly
established universal object detection benchmark of 11 diverse datasets, show
that the proposed detector outperforms a bank of individual detectors, a
multi-domain detector, and a baseline universal detector, with a 1.3x parameter
increase over a single-domain baseline detector. The code and benchmark will be

fundamental goals in graph mining. Given a graph, we can often order vertices
in a way that neighboring vertices have a higher probability of being connected
to each other. This implies that the edges form a band around the diagonal in
the adjacency matrix. Such structure may rise for example if the graph was
created over time: each vertex had an active time interval during which the
vertex was connected with other active vertices.
  The goal of this paper is to model this phenomenon. To this end, we formulate
an optimization problem: given a graph and an integer $K$, we want to order
graph vertices and partition the ordered adjacency matrix into $K$ bands such
that bands closer to the diagonal are more dense. We measure the goodness of a
segmentation using the log-likelihood of a log-linear model, a flexible family
of distributions containing many standard distributions. We divide the problem
into two subproblems: finding the order and finding the bands. We show that
discovering bands can be done in polynomial time with isotonic regression, and
we also introduce a heuristic iterative approach. For discovering the order we
use Fiedler order accompanied with a simple combinatorial refinement. We
demonstrate empirically that our heuristic works well in practice.

improve their visual recognition abilities. We conduct experiments using the

applications. In addition to the visual features, recent approaches have
benefited from the use of context, e.g., inter-relationships among the
activities and objects. However, these approaches require data to be labeled,
entirely available beforehand, and not designed to be updated continuously,
which make them unsuitable for surveillance applications. In contrast, we
propose a continuous-learning framework for context-aware activity recognition
from unlabeled video, which has two distinct advantages over existing methods.
First, it employs a novel active-learning technique that not only exploits the
informativeness of the individual activities but also utilizes their contextual
information during query selection; this leads to significant reduction in
expensive manual annotation effort. Second, the learned models can be adapted
online as more data is available. We formulate a conditional random field model
that encodes the context and devise an information-theoretic approach that
utilizes entropy and mutual information of the nodes to compute the set of most
informative queries, which are labeled by a human. These labels are combined
with graphical inference techniques for incremental updates. We provide a
theoretical formulation of the active learning framework with an analytic
solution. Experiments on six challenging datasets demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior performance with significantly less manual

the effective dimension D of protein from scaling of the structure factor:
collective assembly from inner segments remains globular (D aroud 3) at almost

explained based on a measure different from expected value, like geometric
mean. When the probability distribution of possible outcomes is significantly
skewed, it is generally known that expected value leads to an erroneous picture
owing to its sensitivity to outliers, extreme values of rare occurrence. Since
geometric mean, or its counterpart median for the log-normal distribution, does
not suffer from this drawback, it provides us with a more appropriate measure
especially for evaluating long-term outcomes dominated by outliers. Thus, the
present formula makes a more realistic prediction for long-term outcomes of a
large volatility, for which the probability distribution becomes conspicuously
heavy-tailed.

calculate the evolution of a gravitationally collapsing core until $\sim2000$
yr after protostar formation using a three-dimensional resistive
magnetohydrodynamic simulation, in which the protostar is resolved with a
spatial resolution of $5.6\times10^{-3}$ AU. Following protostar formation, a
rotationally supported disk is formed. Although the disk size is as small as
$\sim2-4$ AU, it remains present until the end of the simulation. Since the
magnetic field dissipates and the angular momentum is then not effectively
transferred by magnetic effects, the disk surface density gradually increases
and spiral arms develop due to gravitational instability. The disk angular
momentum is then transferred mainly by gravitational torques, which induce an
episodic mass accretion onto the central protostar. The episodic accretion
causes a highly time-variable mass ejection (the high-velocity jet) near the
disk inner edge, where the magnetic field is well coupled with the neutral gas.
As the mass of the central protostar increases, the jet velocity gradually
increases and exceeds $\sim100$ km s$^{-1}$. The jet opening angle widens with
time at its base, while the jet keeps a very good collimation on the large
scale. In addition, a low-velocity outflow is driven from the disk outer edge.
A cavity-like structure, a bow shock and several knots, all of which are
usually observed in star-forming regions, are produced in the outflowing

is investigated for this binary optimization problem. Compared to the hard
concrete gradient estimator from Louizos et al., ARM demonstrates superior
performance of pruning network architectures while retaining almost the same

also enables conditional computation during model training but with improved
effectiveness due to the exact binary stochasticity. Thanks to the flexibility
of ARM, many smooth or non-smooth parametric functions, such as scaled sigmoid

and the unbiasness of the ARM estimator is retained, while the hard concrete
estimator has to rely on the hard sigmoid function to achieve conditional
computation and thus accelerated training. Extensive experiments on multiple

Systems (CSSs) have been put forward to improve the storage capacity. Compared
with traditional storage systems, CSSs have lots of advantages, such as higher
capacity, lower cost, and easier scalability. But they are also with higher
complexity. In order to ensure CSSs to be reliable, it is necessary to prove
the correctness of CSSs management programs. In fact, we are going to verify
Block-based Cloud Storage Systems (BCSSs), since BCSSs are the most popular
CSSs.
  In this paper, the correctness of management programs in BCSSs have been
proven, and a verification framework based on separation logic is proposed to
finish the proven process. The main contributions are as follows. (1) A novel
framework with two-tier heap structure is constructed to reflect the
characteristics of BCSSs, and a modeling language is defined based on it. (2)
Assertions based on separation logic is constructed to describe the properties
of BCSSs. (3) The Hoare-style specifications are proposed to reason about the
BCSSs. The results demonstrate that the correctness and reliability of BCSSs
can be verified by the above proposed methods. Furthermore, the proposed
specifications is sound in the application of reasoning about BCSSs.

multimodal style transfer (MST). MST explicitly considers the matching of

trained to transfer each sub-style and render the final stylized result. We
also generalize MST to improve some existing methods. Extensive experiments

challenges of seismic imaging is detecting subsurface salt structure which is
indispensable for identification of hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path

notoriously difficult and professional seismic imaging often requires expert

been successfully applied in many fields, and several attempts have been made
in the field of seismic imaging. But the high cost of manual annotations by
geophysics experts and scarce publicly available labeled datasets hinder the
performance of the existing CNN-based methods. In this work, we propose a
semi-supervised method for segmentation (delineation) of salt bodies in seismic

upper-level GRU to capture the contexts of utterance-level embeddings.
Moreover, we promote the framework to two variants, HiGRU with individual

(HiGRU-sf), so that the word/utterance-level individual inputs and the
long-range contextual information can be sufficiently utilized. Experiments on
three dialogue emotion datasets, IEMOCAP, Friends, and EmotionPush demonstrate
that our proposed HiGRU models attain at least 8.7%, 7.5%, 6.0% improvement

Recently, many deep models have been proposed to learn low-order and high-order
feature interactions from original features. However, since useful interactions
are always sparse, it is difficult for DNN to learn them effectively under a
large number of parameters. In real scenarios, artificial features are able to
improve the performance of deep models (such as Wide & Deep Learning), but
feature engineering is expensive and requires domain knowledge, making it
impractical in different scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to augment
feature space automatically. In this paper, We propose a novel Feature
Generation by Convolutional Neural Network (FGCNN) model with two components:
Feature Generation and Deep Classifier. Feature Generation leverages the
strength of CNN to generate local patterns and recombine them to generate new
features. Deep Classifier adopts the structure of IPNN to learn interactions
from the augmented feature space. Experimental results on three large-scale
datasets show that FGCNN significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art
models. Moreover, when applying some state-of-the-art models as Deep
Classifier, better performance is always achieved, showing the great
compatibility of our FGCNN model. This work explores a novel direction for CTR
predictions: it is quite useful to reduce the learning difficulties of DNN by
automatically identifying important features.

Robustness is strengthened in the coarse matching (CM) stage through
generalized training while discrimination power is enhanced in the fine

connected in series as the input proposals of the FM stage are generated by the
CM stage. They are also connected in parallel as the matching scores and box

$k$, its goal is to decide if an $n$-node $m$-edge graph can be disconnected by
removing $k$ vertices. Although a linear-time algorithm was postulated since
1974 [Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge
connectivity being resolved over two decades ago [Karger STOC'96], so far no
vertex connectivity algorithms are faster than $O(n^2)$ time even for $k=4$ and
$m=O(n)$. In the simplest case where $m=O(n)$ and $k=O(1)$, the $O(n^2)$ bound
dates five decades back to [Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory'69]. For
general $k$ and $m$, the best bound is $\tilde{O}(\min(kn^2,
n^\omega+nk^\omega))$.
  In this paper, we present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(m+k^{7/3}n^{4/3})$ time for any $k=O(\sqrt{n})$. This gives the {\em
first subquadratic time} bound for any $4\leq k \leq o(n^{2/7})$ and improves

faster than the previous Henzinger's 2-approximation algorithm [J.

  The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity,
which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit
$o(n^2)$ time. Instead, we design the first local algorithm for computing
vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a
separator of size at most $k$ or certify that there is no separator of size at
most $k$ `near' a given seed node.

Medical diagnosis is to discover informative ones first and then map them to

some feature space and a classifier is applied after to generate diagnosis
results. However, in many real-world cases, data is often of low-quality due to
a variety of reasons, such as data consistency, integrity, completeness,
accuracy, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, attention based
multi-instance neural network (AMI-Net), to make the single disease
classification only based on the existing and valid information in the
real-world outpatient records. In the context of a patient, it takes a bag of
instances as input and output the bag label directly in end-to-end way.
Embedding layer is adopted at the beginning, mapping instances into an

correlations among instances and their importance for the final classification
are captured by multi-head attention transformer, instance-level multi-instance

derive bounds for three kinds of power constraints inherent to a wireless
transmitter. These include the canonical peak power constraint and average
power constraint. In addition, we consider a time varying peak power constraint

optimal exponent with which error probability drops to zero when channel coding
rate is simultaneously allowed to approach capacity \emph{at a certain rate},

moderate deviation regime of the block fading channel. We compare the bounds

difficulties optimizing the PDD criteria without auxiliary losses result in

signals within the teacher-student framework, we propose a novel optimization
criterion based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). In the proposed
method, the inverse autoregressive flow-based student model is incorporated as
a generator in the GAN framework, and jointly optimized by the PDD mechanism
with the proposed adversarial learning method. As this process encourages the
student to model the distribution of realistic speech waveform, the perceptual
quality of the synthesized speech becomes much more natural. Our experimental

impressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction,
the settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent
drawback in the single-view setting: the lack of reliable 3D constraints can
cause unresolvable ambiguities. We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape
recovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are
given as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from
multi-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Multiview geometric constraints are incorporated into the network by
establishing dense correspondences between different views leveraging a novel
self-supervised view alignment loss. The main ingredient of the view alignment
loss is a differentiable dense optical flow estimator that can backpropagate
the alignment errors between an input view and a synthetic rendering from
another input view, which is projected to the target view through the 3D shape
to be inferred. Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes
can be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another
can better align with the observed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over other 3DMM methods.

in applications to large-scale problems in machine learning and related areas.
Despite the progress, the gap between theory and practice remains significant,
with theoreticians pursuing mathematical optimality at a cost of obtaining
specialized procedures in different regimes (e.g., modulus of strong convexity,
magnitude of target accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio), and with practitioners
not readily able to know which regime is appropriate to their problem, and
seeking broadly applicable algorithms that are reasonably close to optimality.
To bridge these perspectives it is necessary to study algorithms that are
adaptive to different regimes. We present the stochastically controlled
stochastic gradient (SCSG) method for composite convex finite-sum optimization
problems and show that SCSG is adaptive to both strong convexity and target
accuracy. The adaptivity is achieved by batch variance reduction with adaptive
batch sizes and a novel technique, which we referred to as geometrization,

truncated unity functional renormalization group to study the many-body

the effect of the exchange interaction. We show that varying the

be induced by a combination of the ferromagnetic exchange and pair hopping

small region of the parameter space considered. We encounter the
three-sublattice charge-density-wave phase in a large part of the parameter
space. It is replaced by the incommensurate charge density wave when increasing
the exchange integral. In order to reduce the computational effort, we derive
the explicit symmetry relations for the bosonic propagators of the effective
interaction and propose a linear-response-based approach for identifying the
form factor of order parameter. Their efficiencies are confirmed by numerical

the time. These maps are compared to the spots occulted during transits to
validate our reconstruction and derive information on the latitudes of the

one of which has a lifetime of at least $\sim 1400$ days, although with a
varying level of activity. The latitudinal differential rotation is of solar
type, that is, with the equator rotating faster than the poles. We estimate a
minimum relative amplitude $\Delta \Omega/ \Omega$ between $\sim 0.08 \pm 0.05$

individual starspots and depending on the adopted spot model parameters. We
find marginal evidence of a short-term intermittent activity cycle of $\sim 48$
days and an indication of a longer cycle of $400-600$ days characterized by an
equatorward migration of the mean latitude of the spots as in the Sun. The
rotation of Kepler-17 is likely to be significantly affected by the tides
raised by its massive close-by planet. We confirm the reliability of
maximum-entropy spot models to map starspots in young active stars and

(SPWT) schemes for multi-user unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) :1) regional
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) and
artificial-noise-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (ANLNR) (R-SLNR-ANLNR) maximization
and 2) point SLNR and ANLNR (P-SLNR-ANLNR) maximization, are proposed to tackle
with the estimation errors of the target users' location. In SPWT system, the
estimation error for SPWT can not be ignored. However the conventional robust
methods in secure wireless communications optimize the beamforming vector in
the desired positions only in statistical means and can not guarantee the
security for each symbol. Proposed regional robust schemes are designed for
optimizing the secrecy performance in the whole error region around the
estimated location. Specifically, with known maximal estimation error, we
define target region and wiretap region. Then design an optimal beamforming
vector and an artificial noise projection matrix, which achieve the
confidential signal in the target area having the maximal power while only few
signal power is conserved in the potential wiretap region. Instead of
considering the statistical distributions of the estimated errors into
optimization, we optimize the SLNR and ANLNR of the whole target area, which
significantly decreases the complexity. Moreover, the proposed schemes can
ensure that the desired users are located in the optimized region, which are
more practical than conventional methods. Simulation results show that our
proposed regional robust SPWT design is capable of substantially improving the
secrecy rate compared to the conventional non-robust method. The P-SLNR-ANLNR
maximization-based method has the comparable secrecy performance with a lower
complexity than that of the R-SLNR-ANLNR maximization-based method.

the representation of unpredictable unresolved processes. When compared to a
deterministic model, a stochastic model represents `model uncertainty', i.e.,
sources of error in the forecast due to the limitations of the forecast model.
We present a technique for systematically deriving new stochastic
parametrisations or for constraining existing stochastic approaches. A
high-resolution model simulation is coarse-grained to the desired forecast
model resolution. This provides the initial conditions and forcing data needed
to drive a Single Column Model (SCM). By comparing the SCM parametrised
tendencies with the evolution of the high resolution model, we can estimate the
error in the SCM tendencies that a stochastic parametrisation seeks to
represent. We use this approach to assess the physical basis of the widely used
Stochastically Perturbed Parametrisation Tendencies (SPPT) scheme. We find
justification for the multiplicative nature of SPPT, and for the use of
spatio-temporally correlated stochastic perturbations. We find evidence that
the stochastic perturbation should be positively skewed, indicating that
occasional large-magnitude positive perturbations are physically realistic.
However other key assumptions of SPPT are less well justified, including
coherency of the stochastic perturbations with height, coherency of the
perturbations for different physical parametrisation schemes, and coherency for
different prognostic variables. Relaxing these SPPT assumptions allows for an
error model that explains a larger fractional variance than traditional SPPT.
In particular, we suggest that independently perturbing the tendencies
associated with different parametrisation schemes is justifiable, and would
improve the realism of the SPPT approach.

has great potential due to easy implementation of torque control with
direct-drive motors. However, the control system usually requires road-tire
friction and slip-ratio values, which must be estimated. While it is not
possible to obtain the first one directly, the estimation of latter value
requires accurate measurements of chassis and wheel velocity. In addition,
existing TCS structures are often designed without considering the robustness
and energy efficiency of torque control. In this work, both problems are
addressed with a smart TCS design having an integrated acoustic road-type
estimation (ARTE) unit. This unit enables the road-type recognition and this
information is used to retrieve the correct look-up table between friction
coefficient and slip-ratio. The estimation of the friction coefficient helps
the system to update the necessary input torque. The ARTE unit utilizes machine
learning, mapping the acoustic feature inputs to road-type as output. In this
study, three existing TCS for EVs are examined with and without the integrated
ARTE unit. The results show significant performance improvement with ARTE,
reducing the slip ratio by 75% while saving energy via reduction of applied
torque and increasing the robustness of the TCS.

the largest temperature difference created with our refrigerator, it is crucial
to address the nonlinear regime of transport, accounting for electron-electron

UV-emitting clumps, which lie $\simeq 2-10$ kpc from the bulk of star
formation. Clumpy substructures can contribute no more than $1-7$% of the total
star formation in these galaxies (3$\sigma$ upper limits). The lack of

unique Mott-CDW state. Spatially resolved STS measurements reveal that an
apparent V-shape pseudogap forms at the Fermi Level (E$_{F}$), with the origin
of the electronic states splitting and transformation from the Mott states, and
the CDW gaps are largely preserved. The formation of the pseudogap has little
correlation to the variation of local Se concentration, but appears to be a
global characteristics. Furthermore, the correlation length of local density of
states (LDOS) diverges at the Fermi energy and decays rapidly at high energies.
The spatial correlation shows a power-law decay close to the Fermi energy. Our
statistics analysis of the LDOS indicates that our system exhibits weak
multifractal behavior of the wave functions. These findings strongly support a
correlated metallic state induced by disorder in our system, which provides an
new insight into the novel mechanism of emerging superconductivity in the
two-dimensional correlated electronic systems.

also be seen as a compact representation of a set of strings. This paper
considers the labeled tree indexing problem, and provides a number of new
results on space bound analysis, and on algorithms for efficient construction
and pattern matching queries. Kosaraju [FOCS 1989] was the first to consider
the labeled tree indexing problem, and he proposed the suffix tree for a
backward trie, where the strings in the trie are read in the leaf-to-root
direction. In contrast to a backward trie, we call a usual trie as a forward
trie. Despite a few follow-up works after Kosaraju's paper, indexing
forward/backward tries is not well understood yet. In this paper, we show a
full perspective on the sizes of indexing structures such as suffix trees,
DAWGs, CDAWGs, suffix arrays, affix trees, affix arrays for forward and
backward tries. Some of them take $O(n)$ space in the size $n$ of the input
trie, while the others can occupy $O(n^2)$ space in the worst case. In
particular, we show that the size of the DAWG for a forward trie with $n$ nodes
is $\Omega(\sigma n)$, where $\sigma$ is the number of distinct characters in
the trie. This becomes $\Omega(n^2)$ for an alphabet of size $\sigma =
\Theta(n)$. Still, we show that there is a compact $O(n)$-space implicit
representation of the DAWG for a forward trie, whose space requirement is
independent of the alphabet size. This compact representation allows for
simulating each DAWG edge traversal in $O(\log \sigma)$ time, and can be
constructed in $O(n)$ time and space over any integer alphabet of size $O(n)$.
In addition, this readily extends to the first indexing structure that permits
bidirectional pattern searches over a trie within linear space in the input
trie size.

the (upsampled) representations from all the parallel convolutions rather than
only the representation from the high-resolution convolution as done

evidenced by superior results. We show top results in semantic segmentation on

Matter, has been hypothesized to be stable in bulk, and conceivably stable or
metastable in finite systems---strangelets---as an alternative state to
ordinary baryonic matter. Strangelets, if they exist, may be relics from the
hot and dense early universe, or they could be produced in high energy events,
such as collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic speeds. This thesis
investigates the implications of various effects that affects the possible
(meta-) stability of strangelets, such as finite size, distribution of quark
states (shell model), interaction with a hadron gas, non-zero temperature and
QCD constraints of color singletness of the wave function. These effects are
studied within the phenomenological MIT bag model of quark matter using the
multiple reflection expansion for a liquid drop model equation of state with
comparison to a shell model. Finite size, non-zero temperature and color
singlet constraints have a destabilizing effect on strangelets, and can
suppress their production in heavy ion collisions.

to other human parsing tasks without extensive re-training. In this paper, we
aim to learn a single universal human parsing model that can tackle all kinds
of human parsing needs by unifying label annotations from different domains or
at various levels of granularity. This poses many fundamental learning
challenges, e.g. discovering underlying semantic structures among different
label granularity, performing proper transfer learning across different image
domains, and identifying and utilizing label redundancies across related tasks.
  To address these challenges, we propose a new universal human parsing agent,
named ""Graphonomy"", which incorporates hierarchical graph transfer learning
upon the conventional parsing network to encode the underlying label semantic
structures and propagate relevant semantic information. In particular,
Graphonomy first learns and propagates compact high-level graph representation
among the labels within one dataset via Intra-Graph Reasoning, and then
transfers semantic information across multiple datasets via Inter-Graph
Transfer. Various graph transfer dependencies (\eg, similarity, linguistic
knowledge) between different datasets are analyzed and encoded to enhance graph
transfer capability. By distilling universal semantic graph representation to
each specific task, Graphonomy is able to predict all levels of parsing labels
in one system without piling up the complexity. Experimental results show
Graphonomy effectively achieves the state-of-the-art results on three human
parsing benchmarks as well as advantageous universal human parsing performance.

first attempt to develop a method that can convert speech into a voice that
matches an input face image and generate a face image that matches the voice of
the input speech by leveraging the correlation between faces and voices. We
propose a model, consisting of a speech converter, a face encoder/decoder and a
voice encoder. We use the latent code of an input face image encoded by the
face encoder as the auxiliary input into the speech converter and train the
speech converter so that the original latent code can be recovered from the
generated speech by the voice encoder. We also train the face decoder along
with the face encoder to ensure that the latent code will contain sufficient
information to reconstruct the input face image. We confirmed experimentally
that a speech converter trained in this way was able to convert input speech
into a voice that matched an input face image and that the voice encoder and
face decoder can be used to generate a face image that matches the voice of the

for stimuli or actions. While the number of neurons that can be recorded
simultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most cases these recordings
cannot access a complete population. In particular, it is hard to
simultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent
progress have made possible to profile each recorded neuron in a given area
thanks to genetic and physiological tools, and to pool together recordings from
neurons of the same type across different experimental sessions. However, it is
unclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same
type from these sequential recordings. Neural networks exhibit collective
behaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous activity, that are not
directly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just put
together the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we show that we can
infer the activity of a full population of retina ganglion cells from
sequential recordings, using a novel method based on copula distributions and
maximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion cell
to a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the
noise correlations using copulas, and then the full activity of a large
population of ganglion cells of the same type using maximum entropy modeling.
Remarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses to
different stimuli and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our
method to construct a very large population merging cells' responses from
different experiments. We predicted synchronous activity accurately and showed
it grew substantially with the number of neurons. This approach is a promising
way to infer population activity from sequential recordings in sensory areas.

momentum of isotropic noise is intuitively expected to be zero. We formulate
the general features of the isotropic noise such as equipartition of energy and
the vanishing of integrated Poynting vector. We demonstrate that in
bi-anisotropic materials, a finite radiative momentum persists that performs
work on the matter when its parameters change slowly. We find that Faraday
rotation in the scattering of the radiative noise induces an angular momentum
along the applied external magnetic field. Also, a Poynting vector starts
circulating around the matter, raising the question whether it really describes
the energy flow. These effects are small and hard to measure in any real
experiment. Yet, they are surprising predictions of the classical, macroscopic
Maxwell equations, and make contact with the outcome of recent QED calculations

sensors provide a rich source of information about the chemical composition of
the materials present in a given place. This makes hyperspectral imaging an
important tool for earth sciences, land-cover studies, and military and
strategic applications. However, the scarcity of labeled training examples and
spatial variability of spectral signature are two of the biggest challenges
faced by hyperspectral image classification. In order to address these issues,
we aim to develop a framework for material-agnostic information retrieval in
hyperspectral images based on Positive-Unlabelled (PU) classification. Given a
hyperspectral scene, the user labels some positive samples of a material he/she
is looking for and our goal is to retrieve all the remaining instances of the
query material in the scene. Additionally, we require the system to work
equally well for any material in any scene without the user having to disclose
the identity of the query material. This material-agnostic nature of the
framework provides it with superior generalization abilities. We explore two
alternative approaches to solve the hyperspectral image classification problem
within this framework. The first approach is an adaptation of non-negative risk
estimation based PU learning for hyperspectral data. The second approach is
based on one-versus-all positive-negative classification where the negative
class is approximately sampled using a novel spectral-spatial retrieval model.
We propose two annotator models - uniform and blob - that represent the
labelling patterns of a human annotator. We compare the performances of the
proposed algorithms for each annotator model on three benchmark hyperspectral
image datasets - Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas.

narrow-field X-ray instruments could help in understanding the origin of
ultra-long GRBs. However, the observers face a true problem in rapidly
activating follow-up observations, due to the challenging identification of an
ultra-long GRB before the end of the prompt phase. We present here a comparison
of the prompt properties available after a few tens of minutes of a sample of
ultra-long GRBs and normal long GRBs, looking for prior indicators of the long

unreliable parameter inference. To circumvent this issue, we propose a new BSL

performance of this new approach to BSL, and document its superior accuracy

antiferromagnetic eigenmodes manifest a high degree of entanglement between the
two sublattices, thereby establishing antiferromagnets as reservoirs for strong
quantum correlations. Based on these novel insights, we outline strategies for

A natural
question arises can we reduce that memory requirement whilst maintaining
performance. In particular, in this work we address the problem of memory
efficient learning for multiple tasks. To this end, we propose a novel network
architecture producing multiple networks of different configurations, termed
deep virtual networks (DVNs), for different tasks. Each DVN is specialized for
a single task and structured hierarchically. The hierarchical structure, which
contains multiple levels of hierarchy corresponding to different numbers of
parameters, enables multiple inference for different memory budgets. The
building block of a deep virtual network is based on a disjoint collection of
parameters of a network, which we call a unit. The lowest level of hierarchy in
a deep virtual network is a unit, and higher levels of hierarchy contain lower
levels' units and other additional units. Given a budget on the number of
parameters, a different level of a deep virtual network can be chosen to
perform the task. A unit can be shared by different DVNs, allowing multiple
DVNs in a single network. In addition, shared units provide assistance to the
target task with additional knowledge learned from another tasks. This
cooperative configuration of DVNs makes it possible to handle different tasks
in a memory-aware manner. Our experiments show that the proposed method
outperforms existing approaches for multiple tasks. Notably, ours is more
efficient than others as it allows memory-aware inference for all tasks.

already been studied. Furthermore, in many situations, a regularization scheme
retrieving smooth solutions is blindly applied, without taking into account the
prior available knowledge. The present work discusses an algorithm for the
inversion of the complex signal in its entirety, as well as a regularization
method that promotes the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity
distribution. This regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient
support stabilizer into a truncated generalized singular value decomposition
scheme. The results of the implementation of this sparsity-enhancing
regularization at each step of a damped Gauss-Newton inversion algorithm (based
on a nonlinear forward model) are compared with the solutions obtained via a
standard smooth stabilizer. An approach for estimating the depth of
investigation, that is, the maximum depth that can be investigated by a chosen

discussed. The effectiveness and limitations of the whole inversion algorithm

approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images.
We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new
dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep
generative network for predicting shape.
  First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2.5 Million
photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing
diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body, we
annotate the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and
optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of
tasks.
  We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these
images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm
based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to
improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the
full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images
incomplete.
  Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an
input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the
clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results
in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic
validation and on the wild images.

primary goal of this paper is to extend the popular Isolation Forest (IF)

In this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to
derive high-precision CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared
(IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump (RC) stars are selected as tracers by
stellar parameters from APOGEE survey. The multiband photometric data are
collected from Gaia, APASS, SDSS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys. For the
first time, we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs
E(lambda-GRP)/E(GBP-GRP) from color excess--color excess diagrams. Through
elaborate uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the precision of our CERs is
significantly improved (sigma < 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we
calculate the relative extinction A_GBP/A_GRP for 5051 RC stars. By combining
the CERs with the A_GBP/A_GRP, the optical--mid-IR extinction A_lambda/A_GRP

flexibility and oversubscription issues in data centres. This paper
experimentally demonstrates and discusses the implementation of a server
centric PON based data centre architecture with high speed and reliability. The
architecture is set up using a set of servers grouped into racks directly
connected together and to the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) through gateway
servers. The switching and routing functionalities have been embedded into
servers using 4x10GE Xilinx NetFPGA. Flow continuity has been observed through
live video streaming using IP cameras transmitting over up to 110 km optical
connections through WDM nodes and the PON network.

across a variety of fields. Many existing community detection methods detect
communities through optimizing a community evaluation function. However, most

detect small communities in the large-scale network (the so-called resolution
limit problem). In this paper, we introduce two novel node-centric community
evaluation functions by connecting correlation analysis with community
detection. We will further show that the correlation analysis can provide a
novel theoretical framework which unifies some existing evaluation functions in
the context of a correlation-based optimization problem. In this framework, we
can mitigate the resolution limit problem and eliminate the influence of random
fluctuations by selecting the right correlation function. Furthermore, we
introduce three key properties used in mining association rule into the context
of community detection to help us choose the appropriate correlation function.
Based on our introduced correlation functions, we propose a community detection

questions whether strong coupling can be achieved with a single molecule only
and how this is unambiguously proven are still under debate. A critical issue
of plasmonic in contrast to photonic systems is additional excitonic line
broadening, which is often neglected when modeling such systems. This has led
to too optimistic design predictions or incorrect interpretation of ambiguous
experimental data, for example in models relying on Maxwell solvers without
self-consistent incorporation of line broadening effects. In this paper, we
present a heuristic modeling approach for strongly coupled systems based on
plasmonic nanoparticles and dipolar emitters that accounts for such broadening
and elucidates on recent experiments with single emitters. We explicitly focus
on a clear and intuitive classical description that utilizes well-established
methods, easy to use within typical Maxwell solvers. The heuristic model (i)
provides experimentally relevant numbers like emitter densities and spectra
(ii) allows to discriminate systems, which can reach the strong coupling regime
from those, which can not (iii) allows to identify optimization routes and (iv)
nicely matches with experimental findings. In particular, we employ an approach

leveraging time-consecutive camera images in handover decision problems. While
making handover decisions, it is important to predict future long-term
performance---e.g., the cumulative sum of time-varying data rates---proactively
to avoid making myopic decisions. However, this study experimentally notices
that a time-variation in the received powers is not necessarily informative for
proactively predicting the rapid degradation of data rates caused by moving
obstacles. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a proactive
framework wherein handover timings are optimized while obstacle-caused data
rate degradations are predicted before the degradations occur. The key idea is
to expand a state space to involve time consecutive camera images, which
comprises informative features for predicting such data rate degradations. To
overcome the difficulty in handling the large dimensionality of the expanded
state space, we use a deep reinforcement learning for deciding the handover
timings. The evaluations performed based on the experimentally obtained camera
images and received powers demonstrate that the expanded state space
facilitates (i) the prediction of obstacle-caused data rate degradations from
500 ms before the degradations occur and (ii) superior performance to a
handover framework without the state space expansion

proj})$ forms a unique exceptional cycle in $C$, up to an equivalent relation
$\approx$; if the quiver of $A$ is not of type $A_3$, this gives all the
exceptional $n$-cycle in $K^b(A\mbox{-}{\rm proj})$ with $n\ge 2$, up to
$\approx$; and a string complex is an exceptional $1$-cycle if and only if it
is at the mouth of a characteristic component with {\rm AG}-invariant $(1, m)$.
However, a band complex at the mouth is possibly not an exceptional $1$-cycle.

hierarchical trajectory optimization approach for planning dynamic movements

goals that cannot be reached in a kinematic fashion. First, we find a feasible
CoM motion according to the centroidal dynamics of the robot. Then, we refine
the solution by applying the robot's full-dynamics model, where the feasible
CoM trajectory is used as a warm-start point. To accomplish the unscheduled
contact behavior, we use complementarity constraints to describe the contact
model, i.e. environment geometry and non-sliding active contacts. Both
optimization phases are posed as Mathematical Program with Complementarity

in a separable Banach space. The renewal model has been there identified with
constrained and non-constrained pinning models of polymers, which amount to
Gibbs changes of measure of a classical renewal process. In this paper we show
that the constrained pinning model is the common mathematical structure to the
Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation and to some relevant one-dimensional
lattice models of Statistical Mechanics, such as the Fisher-Felderhof model of
fluids, the Wako-Sait\^o-Mu\~noz-Eaton model of protein folding, and the
Tokar-Dreyss\'e model of strained epitaxy. Then, in the framework of the
constrained pinning model, we develop an analytical characterization of the
large deviation principles for cumulative rewards corresponding to multivariate
deterministic rewards that are uniquely determined by, and at most of the order
of magnitude of, the time elapsed between consecutive renewals. In particular,
we outline the explicit calculation of the rate functions and successively we
identify the conditions that prevent them from being analytic and that underlie
affine stretches in their graphs. Finally, we apply the general theory to the
number of renewals. From the point of view of Equilibrium Statistical Physics
and Statistical Mechanics, cumulative rewards of the above type are the
extensive observables that enter the thermodynamic description of the system.
The number of renewals, which turns out to be the commonly adopted order
parameter for the Poland-Scheraga model and for also the renewal models of
Statistical Mechanics, is one of these observables.

  Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving","ICCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of object detection algorithms is becoming increasingly important in
autonomous vehicles, and object detection at high accuracy and a fast inference
speed is essential for safe autonomous driving. A false positive (FP) from a
false localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and
hinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can
cope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This
paper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a
real-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the
most representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and
redesigning the loss function. In addition, this paper proposes a method for
predicting the localization uncertainty that indicates the reliability of bbox.
By using the predicted localization uncertainty during the detection process,
the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the FP and increase the true
positive (TP), thereby improving the accuracy. Compared to a conventional
YOLOv3, the proposed algorithm, Gaussian YOLOv3, improves the mean average
precision (mAP) by 3.09 and 3.5 on the KITTI and Berkeley deep drive (BDD)
datasets, respectively. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is capable of
real-time detection at faster than 42 frames per second (fps) and shows a
higher accuracy than previous approaches with a similar fps. Therefore, the
proposed algorithm is the most suitable for autonomous driving applications.

DNN robustness in the semantic space. We qualitatively analyze different DNNs'
semantic robustness by visualizing the DNN global behavior as semantic maps and
observe interesting behavior of some DNNs. Since generating these semantic maps
does not scale well with the dimensionality of the semantic space, we develop a
bottom-up approach to detect robust regions of DNNs. To achieve this, we
formalize the problem of finding robust semantic regions of the network as
optimizing integral bounds and we develop expressions for update directions of
the region bounds. We use our developed formulations to quantitatively evaluate
the semantic robustness of different popular network architectures. We show
through extensive experimentation that several networks, while trained on the
same dataset and enjoying comparable accuracy, do not necessarily perform
similarly in semantic robustness. For example, InceptionV3 is more accurate
despite being less semantically robust than ResNet50. We hope that this tool
will serve as a milestone towards understanding the semantic robustness of
DNNs.

multi-modular structure incorporating possible imperfections at the discrete

applied loads. The model is built up through the repetition of n units, each
one comprising two rigid rods having equal lengths, linked by means of
pointwise constraints capable to elastically limit motions in terms of relative
translations (sliders) and rotations (hinges). The mechanical response of the
structure is analyzed by varying the number n of the elemental moduli, as well
as in the limit case of infinite number of infinitesimal constituents, in light
of the theory of (first order) Structured Deformations (SDs), that interprets
the deformation of any continuum body as the projection, at the macroscopic
scale, of geometrical changes occurring at the level of its sub-macroscopic
elements. In this way, a wide family of nonlinear elastic behaviors is
generated by tuning internal microstructural parameters, the tensile buckling
and the classical Euler Elastica under compressive loads resulting as special
cases in the so-called continuum limit, say when n tends to 1. Finally, by
plotting the results in terms of first Piola-Kirchhoff stress versus
macroscopic stretch, it is for the first time demonstrated that such SDs-based
1D models can be helpfully used to generalize some standard hyperelastic

essential to its optimization for anti-corrosion coatings, spintronics, and

mediated diffusion in Cr2O3 the correlation with experimentally measured
diffusivities remains poor partly due to the insufficient accuracy of the
theoretical approaches. Here an attempt to resolve these discrepancies is made
through high accuracy density functional theory simulations coupled with grand
canonical formalism of defect thermochemistry. In this approach, point defect
formation energies were computed using hybrid exchange correlation functional.
This level of theory proved to be essential for achieving the agreement with
experimental self-diffusion coefficients. The analysis of the resulting
self-diffusion coefficients indicate that chromium has higher mobility at low
temperatures and high oxygen partial pressures, in particular at standard
temperature and pressure conditions. At high vacuum, high temperature
conditions, oxygen diffusion becomes dominant. At Cr/Cr2O3 interfaces O
vacancies were found to be more mobile than Cr vacancies at all temperatures.
Cr diffuses preferentially along the c-axis at low temperatures but switches to
basal plane at higher temperatures. O diffusion is primarily bound to basal
plane at all temperatures.

competent regressors from an ensemble to estimate the target value of a given
test pattern. This competence is usually quantified using the performance of
the regressors in local regions of the feature space around the test pattern.
However, choosing the best measure to calculate the level of competence
correctly is not straightforward. The literature of dynamic classifier
selection presents a wide variety of competence measures, which cannot be used
or adapted for DRS. In this paper, we review eight measures used with
regression problems, and adapt them to test the performance of the DRS
algorithms found in the literature. Such measures are extracted from a local
region of the feature space around the test pattern, called region of
competence, therefore competence measures.To better compare the competence
measures, we perform a set of comprehensive experiments of 15 regression
datasets. Three DRS systems were compared against individual regressor and
static systems that use the Mean and the Median to combine the outputs of the
regressors from the ensemble. The DRS systems were assessed varying the
competence measures. Our results show that DRS systems outperform individual
regressors and static systems but the choice of the competence measure is
problem-dependent.

Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia are underwent to Electroencephalography
(EEG) in order to evaluate through biological indexes the functional
connectivity between brain regions and activation areas during cognitive
performance. EEG recordings are frequently contaminated by muscle artifacts,
which obscure and complicate their interpretation. These muscle artifacts are
particularly difficult to be removed from the EEG in order the latter to be
used for further clinical evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a new approach
in removing muscle artifacts from EEG data using a method that combines second
and high order statistical information. Subjects and Methods: In the proposed
system the muscle artifacts of the EEG signal are removed by using the
Independent Vector Analysis (IVA). The latter was formulated as a general joint
Blind Source Separation (BSS) method that uses both second-order and higher
order statistical information and thus takes advantage of both Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).
Diagonalization methods for IVA in the proposed system were reworked based on
SCHUR decomposition offering a faster second order blind identification
algorithm that can be used on time demanding applications. Results: The
proposed method is evaluated in both simulated and real EEG data. To
quantitatively examine the performance of the new method, two objective
measures were adopted. The first measure is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
while the second is the Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Conclusion: The proposed
method overcomes with the need of removing muscle artifacts on both realistic
simulated EEG data and brain activity from people with cognitive impairment.

that slow heating ramps yield a core-shell network through sequential gelation,
while fast heating ramps yield a random binary network through homo-gelation.
Here, secondary particles are shown to aggregate in a monolayer fashion upon
the first gel, which can be qualitatively reproduced through Brownian dynamics
simulations using a model based on a temperature-dependent interaction
potential incorporating steric repulsion and van der Waals attraction. Through
oscillatory rheology it is shown that secondary microgel deposition enhances
the structural integrity of the previously formed single species gel, and the
final structure exhibits higher elastic and loss moduli than its

that aging processes in the scaffold before secondary microgel deposition

  modifications of the text and new references added",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the problem of the third black hole parameter, an electric charge.
While the mass and the spin of black holes are frequently considered in the
majority of publications, the charge is often neglected and implicitly set
identically to zero. However, both classical and relativistic processes can
lead to a small non-zero charge of black holes. When dealing with neutral
particles and photons, zero charge is a good approximation. On the other hand,
even a small charge can significantly influence the motion of charged
particles, in particular cosmic rays, in the vicinity of black holes.
Therefore, we stress that more attention should be paid to the problem of a
black-hole charge and hence, it should not be neglected a priori, as it is done
in most astrophysical studies nowadays. The paper looks at the problem of the
black-hole charge mainly from the astrophysical point of view, which is
complemented by a few historical as well as philosophical notes when relevant.
In particular, we show that a cosmic ray or in general elementary charged
particles passing a non-neutral black hole can experience an electromagnetic
force as much as sixteen times the gravitational force for the mass of the
Galactic centre black hole and its charge being seventeen orders of magnitude
less than the extremal value (calculated for a proton). Furthermore, a
Kerr-Newman rotating black hole with the maximum likely charge of 1 Coulomb per
solar mass can have the position of its innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
moved by both rotation and charge in ways that can enhance or partly cancel
each other, putting the ISCO not far from the gravitational radius or out at
more than 6 gravitational radii. An interpretation of X-ray radiation from near
the ISCO of a black hole in X-ray binaries is then no longer unique.

to the existence of different Fermi surface topology above and below the band

short-range scatterer by solving Boltzmann transport equations
self-consistently. The thermoelctric power and figure of merit are
significantly enhanced as the Fermi energy goes below the band touching point

Fermi energy approaches to the van Hove singularity for lower spin-orbit

Given a lesion image, our aim is to predict a comprehensive set of relevant

downstream fine-grained diagnosis. To address this task, we first design a deep
learning module to extract relevant semantic labels from the radiology reports

propose a lesion annotation network (LesaNet) based on a multilabel

Hierarchical relations and mutually exclusive relations between the labels are
leveraged to improve the label prediction accuracy. The relations are utilized
in a label expansion strategy and a relational hard example mining algorithm.
We also attach a simple score propagation layer on LesaNet to enhance recall
and explore implicit relation between labels. Multilabel metric learning is
combined with classification to enable interpretable prediction. We evaluated
LesaNet on the public DeepLesion dataset, which contains over 32K diverse
lesion images. Experiments show that LesaNet can precisely annotate the lesions

a Mott insulator in cuprate superconductors. In multiple-layer FeSe/STO films,
high-Tc superconductivity occurs by suppressing the nematic order in the parent

of the recent progress, domain adaptation is still limited in achieving the
invariance of feature distributions at a finer category level. To this end, we
propose in this paper a new domain adaptation method called Domain-Symmetric

additional classifier that shares with them its layer neurons. To train the
SymNet, we propose a novel adversarial learning objective whose key design is
based on a two-level domain confusion scheme, where the category-level
confusion loss improves over the domain-level one by driving the learning of
intermediate network features to be invariant at the corresponding categories
of the two domains. Both domain discrimination and domain confusion are
implemented based on the constructed additional classifier. Since target
samples are unlabeled, we also propose a scheme of cross-domain training to
help learn the target classifier. Careful ablation studies show the efficacy of
our proposed method. In particular, based on commonly used base networks, our

minimal-energy shape of short DNA loops of approximately $100$ base pairs (bp).
We show that in these loops the excess twist density oscillates as a response
to an imposed bending stress, as recently found in DNA minicircles and observed
in nucleosomal DNA. These twist oscillations, here referred to as twist waves,
are due to the coupling between twist and bending deformations, which in turn
originates from the asymmetry between DNA major and minor grooves. We introduce
a simple analytical variational shape, that reproduces the exact loop energy up
to the fourth significant digit, and is in very good agreement with shapes
obtained from coarse-grained simulations. We, finally, analyze the loop
dynamics at room temperature, and show that the twist waves are robust against
thermal fluctuations. They perform a normal diffusive motion, whose origin is
briefly discussed.

part of its weight to finite voltage and the junction becomes resistive. The
dissipative environment can even suppress the superconducting effect of the
junction via a quantum phase transition occuring when the ohmic resistance
$R_s$ exceeds the quantum resistance $R_{q}=h/(2e)^2$. For a topological
junction hosting Majorana bound states with a $4 \pi$ periodicity of the
superconducting phase, the phase transition is shifted to $4 R_{q}$. We
consider a Josephson junction mixing the $2 \pi$ and $4 \pi$ periodicities
shunted by a resistor, with a resistance between $R_q$ and $4 R_q$. Starting
with a quantum circuit model, we derive the non-monotonic temperature
dependence of its differential resistance resulting from the competition
between the two periodicities; the $4 \pi$ periodicity dominating at the lowest
temperatures. The non-monotonic behaviour is first revealed by straightforward
perturbation theory and then substantiated by a fermionization to exactly
solvable models when $R_s=2R_{q}$: the model is mapped onto a helical wire
coupled to a topological superconductor when the Josephson energy is small and
to the Emery-Kivelson line of the two-channel Kondo model in the opposite case.

puts a direct limitation on the abilities of the agent. We present a
generalization of EQA - Multi-Target EQA (MT-EQA). Specifically, we study

to multiple locations (""dresser in bedroom"", ""oven in kitchen"") and perform
comparative reasoning (""dresser"" bigger than ""oven"") before it can answer a

composed of a program generator, a controller, a navigator, and a VQA module.
The program generator converts the given question into sequential executable

includes nearly all WN stars of our Galactic sample. In the present paper, we
apply the new distances to the previously analyzed Galactic WN stars and
rescale the results accordingly. On this basis, we present a revised catalog of
55 Galactic WN stars with their stellar and wind parameters. The correlations
between mass-loss rate and luminosity show a large scatter, for the
hydrogen-free WN stars as well as for those with detectable hydrogen. The
slopes of the $\log L - \log \dot{M}$ correlations are shallower than found
previously. The empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) still shows the
previously established dichotomy between the hydrogen-free early WN subtypes
that are located on the hot side of the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and the
late WN subtypes, which show hydrogen and reside mostly at cooler temperatures
than the ZAMS (with few exceptions). However, with the new distances, the
distribution of stellar luminosities became more continuous than obtained
previously. The hydrogen-showing stars of late WN subtype are still found to be
typically more luminous than the hydrogen-free early subtypes, but there is a
range of luminosities where both subclasses overlap. The empirical HRD of the
Galactic single WN stars is compared with recent evolutionary tracks. Neither
these single-star evolutionary models nor binary scenarios can provide a fully

reconstruction in X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners. The presence of
hyper-dense materials in a scene, such as metals, can strongly attenuate
X-rays, producing severe streaking artifacts in the reconstruction. These metal
artifacts can greatly limit subsequent object delineation and information
extraction from the images, restricting their diagnostic value. This problem is
particularly acute in the security domain, where there is great heterogeneity
in the objects that can appear in a scene, highly accurate decisions must be
made quickly. The standard practical approaches to reducing metal artifacts in
CT imagery are either simplistic non-adaptive interpolation-based projection
data completion methods or direct image post-processing methods. These standard
approaches have had limited success. Motivated primarily by security
applications, we present a new deep-learning-based metal artifact reduction
(MAR) approach that tackles the problem in the projection data domain. We treat
the projection data corresponding to metal objects as missing data and train an
adversarial deep network to complete the missing data in the projection domain.
The subsequent complete projection data is then used with FBP to reconstruct
image intended to be free of artifacts. This new approach results in an
end-to-end MAR algorithm that is computationally efficient so practical and
fits well into existing CT workflows allowing easy adoption in existing
scanners. Training deep networks can be challenging, and another contribution
of our work is to demonstrate that training data generated using an accurate
X-ray simulation can be used to successfully train the deep network when
combined with transfer learning using limited real data sets. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and potential of our algorithm on simulated and real

worst-case complexity bound, makes these methods computationally more
expensive. Hence, to counteract this effect, we propose a multilevel strategy

Specifically, local and global convergence results are proved and a complexity
bound to reach first order stationary points is also derived. A multilevel
version of the well known adaptive method based on cubic regularization (ARC,

  Modeling",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In general insurance, risks from different categories are often modeled
independently and their sum is regarded as the total risk the insurer takes on
in exchange for a premium. The dependence from multiple risks is generally
neglected even when correlation could exist, for example a single car accident
may result in claims from multiple risk categories. It is desirable to take the
covariance of different categories into consideration in modeling in order to
better predict future claims and hence allow greater accuracy in ratemaking. In
this work multivariate severity models are investigated using mixture of
experts models with bivariate gamma distributions, where the dependence
structure is modeled directly using a GLM framework, and covariates can be
placed in both gating and expert networks. Furthermore, parsimonious
parameterisations are considered, which leads to a family of bivariate gamma
mixture of experts models. It can be viewed as a model-based clustering
approach that clusters policyholders into sub-groups with different
dependencies, and the parameters of the mixture models are dependent on the
covariates. Clustering is shown to be important in separating the data into
sub-groupings where strong dependence is often present, even if the overall
data set exhibits only weak dependence. In doing so, the correlation within
different components features prominently in the model. It is shown that, by
applying to both simulated data and a real-world Irish GI insurer data set,
claim predictions can be improved.

to result from the interplay of the effective attraction between the protein

globe started making use of quantitative indicators to measure the performance

the evaluated researchers are still largely unknown. We attempt to shed light
on this topic by investigating how Italian researchers reacted to the
introduction in 2011 of national regulations in which key passages of
professional careers are governed by bibliometric indicators. A new inwardness
measure, able to gauge the degree of scientific self-referentiality of a
country, is defined as the proportion of citations coming from the country
itself compared to the total number of citations gathered by the country.
Compared to the trends of the other G10 countries in the period 2000-2016,
Italy's inwardness shows a net increase after the introduction of the new
evaluation rules. Indeed, globally and also for a large majority of the
research fields, Italy became the European country with the highest inwardness.
Possible explanations are proposed and discussed, concluding that the observed
trends are strongly suggestive of a generalized strategic use of citations,
both in the form of author self-citations and of citation clubs. We argue that
the Italian case offers crucial insights on the constitutive effects of
evaluation systems. As such, it could become a paradigmatic case in the debate
about the use of indicators in science-policy contexts.

non-Abelian statistics, is driven both by the quest for deeper understanding of
nature and prospects for universal topological quantum computation. However,
physical systems that can host these exotic excitations are rare and hard to
realize in experiments. Here we study the domain walls and the edge states
formed in spin transitions in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Effective
theory approach and exact diagonalization in a disk and torus geometries proves
the existence of the counter-propagating edge modes with opposite spin
polarizations at the boundary between the two neighboring regions of the
two-dimensional electron liquid in spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized phases.
By analytical and numerical analysis, we argue that these systems can host
parafermions when coupled to an s-wave superconductor and are experimentally
feasible. We investigate settings based on $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$, $\nu=\frac{4}{3}$
and $\nu=\frac{5}{3}$ spin transitions and analyze spin-flipping interactions
that hybridize counter-propagating modes. Finally, we discuss spin-orbit
interactions of composite fermions.

necessary for solving some fundamental graph problems in the streaming model of
computation. For instance, we show that any streaming algorithm that finds a
weighted minimum $s$-$t$ cut in an $n$-vertex undirected graph requires
$n^{2-o(1)}$ space unless it makes $n^{\Omega(1)}$ passes over the stream.
  To prove our lower bounds, we introduce and analyze a new four-player
communication problem that we refer to as the hidden-pointer chasing problem.
This is a problem in spirit of the standard pointer chasing problem with the
key difference that the pointers in this problem are hidden to players and
finding each one of them requires solving another communication problem, namely
the set intersection problem. Our lower bounds for graph problems are then
obtained by reductions from the hidden-pointer chasing problem.
  Our hidden-pointer chasing problem appears flexible enough to find other
applications and is therefore interesting in its own right. To showcase this,
we further present an interesting application of this problem beyond streaming
algorithms. Using a reduction from hidden-pointer chasing, we prove that any
algorithm for submodular function minimization needs to make $n^{2-o(1)}$ value
queries to the function unless it has a polynomial degree of adaptivity.

the `latent' (or gross) rate of return, since the principal submatrix relates
the state variables to each other but with dividend retention. We find that DPI
reduces to the placement of the maximum eigenvalue of $L$ between the dominant

bound, for the coefficient measuring the year-on-year dividend-on-dividend
sensitivity in achieving robust equity valuation (independence of small

general circulation model and find the stratosphere under high obliquity could
be over 3 orders of magnitude moister than under the low obliquity equivalent,
even with the same global annual mean surface temperature. Three complexities
that only exist under high obliquity are found to be causally relevant. 1)
Seasonal variation under high obliquity causes extremely high surface
temperatures to occur during polar days, moistening the polar air that may
eventually enter the stratosphere. 2) Unlike the low obliquity scenario where
the cold trap efficiently freezes out water vapor, the high obliquity
stratosphere gets most of its moisture input from high latitudes, and thus
largely bypasses the cold trap. 3) A high obliquity climate tends to be warmer
than its low obliquity equivalent, thus moistening the atmosphere as a whole.
We found each of the above factors could significantly increase stratospheric
humidity. These results indicate that, for an earth-like exoplanet, it is more
likely to detect water from surface evaporation if the planet is under high
obliquity. The water escape could cause a high obliquity planet to loss
habitability before the runaway greenhouse takes place.

differ in some respect from the observations that the model is trained on.
Novelty detection is one of the fundamental requirements of a good
classification or identification system since sometimes the test data contains
observations that were not known at the training time. In other words, the
novelty class is often is not presented during the training phase or not well
defined.
  In light of the above, one-class classifiers and generative methods can
efficiently model such problems. However, due to the unavailability of data
from the novelty class, training an end-to-end model is a challenging task
itself. Therefore, detecting the Novel classes in unsupervised and
semi-supervised settings is a crucial step in such tasks.
  In this thesis, we propose several methods to model the novelty detection
problem in unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. The proposed frameworks
applied to different related applications of anomaly and outlier detection
tasks. The results show the superior of our proposed methods in compare to the
baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

discussion on the root cause of the controversy, we provide sensitive but
non-invasive methods that can not only directly correlate luminescence with the
underlying structure, but also distinguish point defects from embedded

correlated Raman-PL as a passive structure-property method to identify the

existence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in emissive Cs4PbBr6. We finally employed a
diamond anvil cell to probe the response of luminescence centers to hydrostatic

statistical measures computed from both the original and the Laplacian of
Gaussian filtering of the grayscale MRI. The classifier performance suggests
that texture analysis may be a helpful tool for designing a generalized and

atlas is obtained by overlaying the muscle segmentation ground truth, provided

pressure, a self-excited thermoacoustic oscillation can arise. These nonlinear
oscillations are one of the biggest challenges faced in the design of safe and
reliable gas turbines and rocket motors. In the worst-case scenario,
uncontrolled thermoacoustic oscillations can shake an engine apart.
Reduced-order thermoacoustic models, which are nonlinear and time-delayed, can
only qualitatively predict thermoacoustic oscillations. To make reduced-order
models quantitatively predictive, we develop a data assimilation framework for
state estimation. We numerically estimate the most likely nonlinear state of a
Galerkin-discretized time delayed model of a horizontal Rijke tube, which is a
prototypical combustor. Data assimilation is an optimal blending of
observations with previous state estimates (background) to produce optimal
initial conditions. A cost functional is defined to measure the statistical
distance between the model output and the measurements from experiments; and
the distance between the initial conditions and the background knowledge. Its
minimum corresponds to the optimal state, which is computed by Lagrangian
optimization with the aid of adjoint equations. We study the influence of the
number of Galerkin modes, which are the natural acoustic modes of the duct,
with which the model is discretized. We show that decomposing the measured
pressure signal in a finite number of modes is an effective way to enhance
state estimation, especially when nonlinear modal interactions occur during the
assimilation window. This work represents the first application of data
assimilation to nonlinear thermoacoustics, which opens up new possibilities for
real-time calibration of reduced-order models with experimental measurements.

the signal always has a linear shortcut and the non-linear path enhances it in

modeling and forecasting recurrent trajectories on a compact manifold. For the
purposes of this paper, a trajectory is a sequence of coordinates in a phase
space defined by an underlying hidden dynamical system. Our work is inspired by
earlier work on the use of KDE to detect shipping anomalies using high-density,
high-quality automated information system (AIS) data as well as our own earlier
work in trajectory modeling. We focus specifically on the sparse, noisy
trajectory reconstruction problem in which the data are (i) sparsely sampled
and (ii) subject to an imperfect observer that introduces noise. Under certain
regularity assumptions, we show that the constructed estimator minimizes a
specific energy function defined over the trajectory as the number of samples
obtained grows.

relativistic velocity sum rule. The Laue theory is experimentally verified by
the Fizeau water tube experiment. In contrast, the Rosen version of dielectric
special relativity was derived heuristically and has no experimental
validation. Consequently, the Rosen theory and its consequences are mostly
ignored in the scientific literature and there is little to no discussion about
the incompatibility of the two theories of relativity in a dielectric. In this
article, the Laue theory is developed from boundary conditions using inertial
reference frames moving at constant velocity along the interface between a
simple linear dielectric medium and the vacuum. Then, the Rosen theory is
derived in the context of inertial frames of reference moving at constant
velocity in the interior of an arbitrarily large linear isotropic homogeneous
dielectric medium. These derivations show that the Laue and Rosen theories of
dielectric special relativity are both correct but have different regimes of
applicability. The Rosen theory applies to physics in the interior of a simple
linear dielectric and the Laue theory is used to relate these physics to a
Laboratory Frame of Reference in the vacuum where measurements can be

Turing barrier from emergent behavior in distributed systems. In particular, we
present an algorithmic network that is a mathematical model of a networked
population of randomly generated computable systems with a fixed communication
protocol. Then, in order to solve an undecidable problem, we study how nodes
(i.e., Turing machines or computable systems) can harness the power of the
metabiological selection and the power of information sharing (i.e.,
communication) through the network. Formally, we show that there is a pervasive
network topological condition, in particular, the small-diameter phenomenon,
that ensures that every node becomes capable of solving the halting problem for
every program with a length upper bounded by a logarithmic order of the
population size. In addition, we show that this result implies the existence of
a central node capable of emergently solving the halting problem in the minimum
number of communication rounds. Furthermore, we introduce an
algorithmic-informational measure of synergy for networked computable systems,
which we call local algorithmic synergy. Then, we show that such algorithmic
network can produce an arbitrarily large value of expected local algorithmic
synergy.

active components are challenging to assemble and control outside the
laboratory since they need some special facilities, which is not

Conducting polymer actuators (CPAs), and Ionic carbon nanotube-based actuators
(i-CNTAs) are three main types of the i-EAPs. In this paper, the working

of which are how to achieve both 1) the association between multiple UEs and

high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based
frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be
processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission
from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds
itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied
to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression
techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to
minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper we will
use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate
that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently.
Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in
inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D
image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method
automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to
the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation
frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve
significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or
much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when
compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first machine vision guided medical image compression
framework for segmentation in the clouds.

order to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown

Instead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an
image-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the
RibCage.
  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of
instance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,
namely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation
Benchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.
While synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on
segmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the
different challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of
the evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as

`Bayesian deep learning knows what it does not know,' the uncertainty of DNN
outputs has been investigated as a reliability measure for the classification

samples are not always easy-to-retrieve samples. This study investigates two
aspects of image-caption embedding-and-retrieval systems. On one hand, we
quantify feature uncertainty by considering image-caption embedding as a
regression task, and use it for model averaging, which can improve the
retrieval performance. On the other hand, we further quantify posterior
uncertainty by considering the retrieval as a classification task, and use it
as a reliability measure, which can greatly improve the retrieval performance
by rejecting uncertain queries. The consistent performance of two uncertainty
measures is observed with different datasets (MS COCO and Flickr30k), different
deep learning architectures (dropout and batch normalization), and different

for finding cancer cells in the blood. Such a technology holds promise for
early detection of primary cancer or metastasis. Here we describe a new deep

signal processing and feature extraction steps by a convolutional neural

computational efficiency enables low-latency inference and makes this pipeline
suitable for cell sorting via deep learning. Our neural network takes less than
a few milliseconds to classify the cells, fast enough to provide a decision to
a cell sorter for real-time separation of individual target cells. We

covariant formalism and an equal time approximation, and finally based on the
Dirac-Fock picture of the electron and positron fields and Coulomb gauge, is
given here. The formalism first leads to different physical interactions from
the use of an exponential cluster operator for radiative effects. Lamb, Breit
and hyperfine interactions are obtained. Next, relativistic many-body effects
are determined using the matter cluster in a way familiar from the
nonrelativistic CC. This step can be nontrivial. By allowing the matter cluster
to deviate from its traditional excitation-only form, vacuum polarization
effects are generated using the pair part of Coulomb interaction. The resulting
ground state correlation energy includes both relativistic and QED corrections,
the latter including contributions from Lamb, Breit, hyperfine and vacuum
polarization effects. The many-electron part of the theory is explicitly
formulated for closed shell species. The conservatism of the second step
indicates that extensions to multireference and state-specific cases are
possible. To illustrate the CC approach, expressions are derived for
relativistic and QED corrections to the orbital energies, configuration
energies and the ground state correlation energy in a minimal basis calculation
on noninteracting H2 molecules. Size-consistency is maintained at every step.
Because spinors of nonzero orbital angular momentum are absent, the spin-orbit
interaction and Lamb shift corrections vanish in this example. However, one
finds the kinetic energy correction, Darwin terms and corrections to the
two-electron interaction in relativistic energy values through order mc2a4Z4,
and Breit interaction energy and hyperfine splitting of levels as QED effects
through the same order. Pair energies are explicitly shown through the lowest
possible orders.
