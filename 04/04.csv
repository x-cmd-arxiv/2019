innovative clustering strategy, and generation of Indicators of Compromise

small number of tweets as relevant (false positive rate under 10%), and
summarises the results to very few IoCs per day. A qualitative evaluation of
the IoCs generated by SYNAPSE demonstrates their relevance (based on the CVSS

mediate the local inhibition strength and tune the temporal latency of local

effective to extract colliding cues from complex dynamic visual scenes. We
tested the proposed method using a range of stimuli including simulated

otherwise simply use backward error correction, e.g. TCP, but where overly

(FatSegNet) to accurately identify, segment, and quantify abdominal adipose

consistent localization of the abdominal region using two 2D-Competitive Dense
Fully Convolutional Networks (CDFNet), (ii) segmentation of adipose tissue on
three views by independent CDFNets, and (iii) view aggregation. FatSegNet is
trained with 33 manually annotated subjects, and validated by: 1) comparison of
segmentation accuracy against a testingset covering a wide range of body mass
index (BMI), 2) test-retest reliability, and 3) robustness in a large cohort
study. Results: The CDFNet demonstrates increased robustness compared to
traditional deep learning networks. FatSegNet dice score outperforms manual
raters on the abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT, 0.828 vs. 0.788), and
produces comparable results on subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT, 0.973 vs.

and excellent agreement between scan sessions (VAT: APD = 2.957%, ICC=0.998 and
SAT: APD= 3.254%, ICC=0.996). Conclusion: FatSegNet can reliably analyze a 3D

replicates known VAT and SAT volume effects in a large cohort study, and
permits localized analysis of fat compartments.

affecting both the elastic and viscous response, as well as the plastic yield
stress, is rigorously characterized by showing existence of weak solutions to
the constitutive and balance equations of the model. The analysis relies on the
notions of plastic-strain measures and bounded-deformation displacements, on
sophisticated time-regularity estimates to establish a duality between
acceleration and velocity of the elastic displacement, on the theory of
rate-independent processes for the energy conservation in the dynamical-plastic

motivate incorporating multicast and broadcast transmission into the

can potentially improve unicast throughput and broadcast coverage with respect
to traditional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FDM) or time
division multiplexing (TDM), by simultaneously using the same frequency and
time resources for multiple unicast or broadcast transmissions. In this paper,
the performance of LDM-based unicast and broadcast transmission in a cellular
network is studied by assuming a single frequency network (SFN) operation for
the broadcast layer, while allowing arbitrarily clustered cooperation among the
base stations (BSs) for the transmission of unicast data streams. Beamforming
and power allocation between unicast and broadcast layers, the so-called
injection level in the LDM literature, are optimized with the aim of minimizing
the sum-power under constraints on the user-specific unicast rates and on the
common broadcast rate. The effects of imperfect channel coding and imperfect
CSI are also studied to gain insights into robust implementation in practical
systems. The non-convex optimization problem is tackled by means of successive
convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Performance upper bounds are also
presented by means of the $\rm{S}$-procedure followed by semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). Finally, a dual decomposition-based solution is proposed to
facilitate an efficient distributed implementation of LDM where the optimal
unicast beamforming vectors can be obtained locally by the cooperating BSs.
Numerical results are presented, which show the tightness of the proposed
bounds and hence the near-optimality of the proposed solutions.

presents a novel methodology to inspect the internal software activities of IoT

forensically important software activities can be revealed through an

cryptographic algorithms running on high-end IoT devices can be detected with

scenario predicts constant flavor-changing probabilities at short-baseline
distances. Therefore, it cannot explain the spectral distortions observed in
the LSND and MiniBooNE appearance experiments. On the other hand, the survival
probabilities oscillate as functions of $L/E$ and could explain oscillations in
short-baseline disappearance experiments. We also derive the bounds on the
mixing parameters from the existing short-baseline neutrino oscillation data.

due to the precise targeting features they offer. Although researchers and
journalists have found many ways that advertisers can target---or
exclude---particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively little
attention has been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery
process, comprised of the platform's choices about which users see which ads.
  It has been hypothesized that this process can ""skew"" ad delivery in ways
that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than others
to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this
paper, we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to
market and financial optimization effects as well as the platform's own
predictions about the ""relevance"" of ads to different groups of users. We find
that both the advertiser's budget and the content of the ad each significantly
contribute to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe
significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for ""real"" ads for
employment and housing opportunities despite neutral targeting parameters.
  Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to
potentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their
targeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for
policymakers and platforms to carefully consider the role of the ad delivery
optimization run by ad platforms themselves---and not just the targeting
choices of advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.

cost-effective assessments. However, assessing a treatment effect from EHRs is

patients' social economic status. To adjust for unobserved confounders, we
develop the medical deconfounder, a machine learning algorithm that unbiasedly
estimates treatment effects from EHRs. The medical deconfounder first
constructs a substitute confounder by modeling which medications were
prescribed to each patient; this substitute confounder is guaranteed to capture
all multi-medication confounders, observed or unobserved (arXiv:1805.06826). It
then uses this substitute confounder to adjust for the confounding bias in the

produces closer-to-truth treatment effect estimates; it also identifies
effective medications that are more consistent with the findings in the medical

calculation of the partial decay widths and branching ratios of the Higgs
bosons of the Next-to-Minimal 2-Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM). The N2HDM is based
on a general CP-conserving 2HDM which is extended by a real scalar singlet
field. The program computes the complete electroweak one-loop corrections to
all non-loop-induced two-body on-shell Higgs boson decays in the N2HDM and
combines them with the state-of-the-art QCD corrections that are already
implemented in the existing program N2HDECAY. Most of the independent input
parameters of the electroweak sector of the N2HDM are renormalized in an
on-shell scheme. The soft-$\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking squared mass scale $m_{12}^2$
and the vacuum expectation value $v_S$ of the $SU(2)_L$ singlet field, however,
are renormalized with $\overline{\text{MS}}$ conditions, while for the four
scalar mixing angles $\alpha _i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and $\beta$ of the N2HDM, several
different renormalization schemes are applied. By giving out the leading-order
and the loop-corrected partial decay widths separately from the branching
ratios, the program ewN2HDECAY not only allows for phenomenological analyses of
the N2HDM at highest precision, it can also be used for a study of the impact
of the electroweak corrections and the remaining theoretical uncertainty due to
missing higher-order corrections based on a change of the renormalization
scheme. The input parameters are then consistently calculated with a parameter
conversion routine when switching from one renormalization scheme to the other.

of an image, denoting the objects (with nodes) and their relationships (with
edges). The best performing works to date are based on exploiting the context
surrounding objects or relations,e.g., by passing information among objects. In
these approaches, to transform the representation of source objects is a
critical process for extracting information for the use by target objects. In
this work, we argue that a source object should give what tar-get object needs
and give different objects different information rather than contributing
common information to all targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a
Target-TailoredSource-Transformation (TTST) method to efficiently propagate
information among object proposals and relations. Particularly, for a source
object proposal which will contribute information to other target objects, we
transform the source object feature to the target object feature domain by
simultaneously taking both the source and target into account. We further
explore more powerful representations by integrating language prior with the
visual context in the transformation for the scene graph generation. By doing
so the target object is able to extract target-specific information from the
source object and source relation accordingly to refine its representation. Our
framework is validated on the Visual Genome bench-mark and demonstrated its
state-of-the-art performance for the scene graph generation. The experimental
results show that the performance of object detection and visual relation-ship
detection are promoted mutually by our method.

Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) impact simulations of two orbiting moonlets inside
the planetary gravitational potential and find that the classical outcome of
two bodies impacting in free space is altered as erosive mass loss is more
significant with decreasing distance to the planet. Depending on the conditions
of accretion, each moonlet could have a distinct isotopic signature, therefore,
we assess the initial mixing during their merger, in order to estimate whether
future measurements of surface variations could distinguish between lunar
origin scenarios (single vs. multiple moonlets). We find that for
comparable-size impacting bodies in the accretionary regime, surface mixing is
efficient, but in the hit-and-run regime, only a small amount of material is
transferred between the bodies. However, sequences of hit-and-run impacts are
expected, which will enhance the surface mixing. Overall, our results show that
large scale heterogeneities can arise only from the merger of drastically
different component masses. Surfaces of moons resulting from the merger of
comparable-sized components have little material heterogeneities, and such
impacts are preferred, as the relatively massive impactor generates more melt,
extending the lunar magma ocean phase.

expression for which one can get the photothermally induced change of

that a PR2 robot can use this approach with a custom six electrode capacitive

case of telecommunication networks (SONET rings) which gained attention from
practitioners and theorists alike. Given an undirected cycle on $n$ nodes
together with non-negative demands between any pair of nodes, the Ring Loading
Problem asks for an unsplittable routing of the demands such that the maximum
cumulated demand on any edge is minimized. Let $L$ be the value of such a
solution. In the relaxed version of the problem, each demand can be split into
two parts where the first part is routed clockwise while the second part is
routed counter-clockwise. Denote with $L^*$ the maximum load of a minimum split
routing solution. In a landmark paper, Schrijver, Seymour and Winkler [SSW98]
showed that $L \leq L^* + 1.5D$, where $D$ is the maximum demand value. They
also found (implicitly) an instance of the Ring Loading Problem with $L = L^* +
1.01D$. Recently, Skutella [Sku16] improved these bounds by showing that $L
\leq L^* + \frac{19}{14}D$, and there exists an instance with $L = L^* + 1.1D$.

origin of two very massive stars (VMS): the O2.5If*/WN6 star RFS7 ($\sim$100
$M_{\odot}$), and the O3.5If* star RFS8 ($\sim$70 $M_{\odot}$), found within
$\approx$ 53 and 58 pc respectively from the Galactic massive young cluster NGC
3603, using Gaia data. RFS7 is found to exhibit motions resembling a runaway
star from NGC 3603. This is now the most massive runaway star candidate known
in the Milky Way. Although RFS8 also appears to move away from the cluster
core, it has proper-motion values that appear inconsistent with being a runaway
from NGC 3603 at the $3\sigma$ level (but with substantial uncertainties due to
distance and age). Furthermore, no evidence for a bow-shock or a cluster was
found surrounding RFS8 from available near-infrared photometry. In summary,
whilst RFS7 is likely a runaway star from NGC 3603, making it the first VMS
runaway in the Milky Way, RFS8 is an extremely young ($\sim$2 Myr) VMS, which
might also be a runaway, but this would need to be established from future
spectroscopic and astrometric observations, as well as precise distances. If
RFS8 were still not meeting the criteria for being a runaway from NGC 3603 from

considerably underestimated. An optically thick disk with scattering can be
misidentified as an optically thin disk. Dust scattering in more inclined disks
can reduce the intensity even further, making the disk look even fainter. The
measured optical depth of $\sim$0.6 in several DSHARP disks can be naturally
explained by optically thick dust with an albedo of $\sim$0.9 at 1.25 mm. Using
the DSHARP opacity, this albedo corresponds to a dust population with the
maximum grain size ($s_{max}$) of 0.1-1 mm. For optically thick scattering
disks, the measured spectral index $\alpha$ can be either larger or smaller
than 2 depending on if the dust albedo increases or decreases with wavelength.
Using the DSHARP opacity, $\alpha<2$ corresponds to $s_{max}$ of 0.03-0.3 mm.
We describe how this optically thick scattering scenario could explain the
observed scaling between submm continuum sizes and luminosities, and might help
ease the tension between the dust size constraints from polarization and dust
continuum measurements. We suggest that a significant amount of disk mass can
be hidden from ALMA observations at short millimeter wavelengths. For compact
disks smaller than 30 au, we can easily underestimate the dust mass by more
than a factor of 10. Longer wavelength observations (e.g. VLA or SKA) are
desired to probe the dust mass in disks.

must be close to the Chandrasekhar limit, this also being the characteristic
mass of stars. If they provide the dark matter (DM), the collapse fraction must
be of order the cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio $\sim 10^{-9}$, which
suggests a scenario in which a baryon asymmetry is produced efficiently in the
outgoing shock around each PBH and then propagates to the rest of the Universe.
We suggest that the temperature increase in the shock provides the ingredients
for hot spot electroweak baryogenesis. This also explains why baryons and DM
have comparable densities, the precise ratio depending on the size of the PBH
relative to the cosmological horizon at formation. The observed value of the
collapse fraction and baryon asymmetry depends on the amplitude of the
curvature fluctuations which generate the PBHs and may be explained by an
anthropic selection effect associated with the existence of galaxies. We
propose a scenario in which the quantum fluctuations of a light stochastic
spectator field during inflation generate large curvature fluctuations in some
regions, with the stochasticity of this field providing the basis for the
required selection. Finally, we identify several observational predictions of
our scenario that should be testable within the next few years. In particular,
the PBH mass function could extend to sufficiently high masses to explain the
black hole coalescences observed by LIGO/Virgo.

download a message, where privacy implies that no one DB can infer which

placement and delivery designs. Previous works have derived the capacity, or
infimum download cost, of PIR with uncoded storage placement and also
sufficient conditions of a storage placement design to meet capacity. However,
the currently proposed storage placement designs require splitting each message
into an exponential number of sub-messages with respect to the number of DBs.
In this work, when DBs have the same storage constraint, we propose two simple
storage placement designs that satisfy the capacity conditions. Then, for more
general heterogeneous storage constraints, we translate the storage placement
design process into a ""filling problem"". We design an iterative algorithm to
solve the filling problem where, in each iteration, messages are partitioned

discrete-time, stochastic predator-prey model of the Leslie type to simulated
time series of densities and kill rate data. Our model has both environmental
stochasticity in the growth rates and interaction stochasticity, i.e., a
stochastic functional response. We examine what the kill rate data brings to
the quality of the estimates, and whether estimation is possible (for various
time series lengths) solely with time series of population counts or biomass
data. Both Bayesian and frequentist estimation are performed, providing
multiple ways to check model identifiability. The Fisher Information Matrix
suggests that models with and without kill rate data are all identifiable,
although correlations remain between parameters that belong to the same
functional form. However, our results show that if the attractor is a fixed
point in the absence of stochasticity, identifying parameters in practice
requires kill rate data as a complement to the time series of population
densities, due to the relatively flat likelihood. Only noisy limit cycle
attractors can be identified directly from population count data (as in inverse
modelling), although even in this case, adding kill rate data - including in
small amounts - can make the estimates much more precise. Overall, we show that
under process stochasticity in interaction rates, interaction data might be
essential to obtain identifiable dynamical models for multiple species. These
results may extend to other biotic interactions than predation, for which
similar models combining interaction rates and population counts could be
developed.

donated by GCs by searching for stars that bear the unique chemical
fingerprints typical for a subset of GC stars often dubbed `second-generation
stars'. These are stars showing light element abundance anomalies such as a
pronounced CN-band strength accompanied by weak CH-bands. Based on this
indicator, past studies have placed the fraction of halo stars with a GC origin
between a few to up to 50%. Using low-resolution spectra from the most recent
data release of the latest extension of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV),
we were able to identify 118 metal-poor ($-1.8\le$[Fe/H]$\le -1.3$) CN-strong
stars in a sample of 4470 halo giant stars out to 50 kpc. This results in an
observed fraction of these stars of 2.6$\pm$0.2%. Using an updated formalism to
account for the fraction of stars lost early on in the GCs' evolution we
estimate the fraction of the halo that stems from disrupted clusters to be
11$\pm$1%. This number represents the case that stars lost from GCs were
entirely from the first generation and is thus merely an upper limit. Our
conclusions are sensitive to our assumptions of the mass lost early on from the
first generation formed in the GCs, the ratio of first-to-second generation
stars, and other GC parameters. We carefully test the influence of varying
these parameters on the final result and find that, under realistic scenarios,
the above fraction depends on the main assumptions at less than 10%. We further
recover a flat trend in this fraction with Galactocentric radius, with a
marginal indication of a rise beyond 30 kpc that could reflect the ex-situ
origin of the outer halo. (abridged)

pairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born together.
The simulations predict that co-natal pairs originate preferentially from
high-mass and relatively young ($< 1$ Gyr) star clusters. \textit{Gaia} will
eventually deliver well-determined metallicities for the brightest stars,
enabling the identification of thousands of co-natal pairs due to disrupting
star clusters in the solar neighborhood.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange. We perform interacting spin wave calculations
of the structure factor and spectral function of this model, showing good
agreement with results from a simple effective non-Hermitian model for the

including Vega and Sirius. At the same time, space photometry observations of
A- and late B-type stars from Kepler and TESS have highlighted the existence of
rotational modulation of surface features akin to stellar spots. Here we
explore the possibility that surface magnetic spots might be caused by the
presence of small envelope convective layers at or just below the stellar
surface, caused by recombination of H and He. Using 1D stellar evolution
calculations and assuming an equipartition dynamo, we make simple estimates of
field strength at the photosphere. For most models the largest effects are
caused by a convective layer driven by second helium ionization. While it is
difficult to predict the geometry of the magnetic field, we conclude that the
majority of intermediate-mass stars should have dynamo-generated magnetic
fields of order a few gauss at the surface. These magnetic fields can appear at
the surface as bright spots, and cause photometric variability via rotational
modulation, which could also be wide-spread in A-stars. The amplitude of
surface magnetic fields and their associated photometric variability is
expected to decrease with increasing stellar mass and surface temperature, so
that magnetic spots and their observational effects should be much harder to
detect in late B-type stars.

gas is too long to provide the source of cold gas. Supersonic, cold streams
have been invoked as a mechanism for feeding massive halos at high redshift and
deliver the cold gas required for continued star formation at the rates

by some cosmological simulations. However, the cold streams are likely to be
subject to the supersonic version of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI),
which eventually leads to stream disruption. Cosmological simulations have yet
to obtain the spatial resolution required for understanding the detailed
stability properties of cold streams. In this paper, we consider instead an
idealized model of magnetized cold streams that we spatially resolve. Using
linear theory we show how magnetic fields with dynamically important field
strengths do not inhibit the KHI but rather enhance its growth rate. We perform
nonlinear simulations of magnetized stream disruption and find that magnetic
fields can nevertheless increase stream survival times by suppressing the
mixing rate of cold gas with the circumgalactic medium. We find that magnetic
fields can allow streams to survive $\sim 2-8$ times longer and, consequently,
that streams $\sim 2-8$ times thinner can reach the central galaxy if the

efficiency drops due to the decrease in dredge-up efficiency in metal-rich
thermally-pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars, coupled to a higher
initial abundance of oxygen. However, while models predict a metallicity
ceiling above which carbon stars cannot form, previous observations have not

galaxies, resulting in a C/M that is too low by more than a factor of 10 in the
innermost fields and indicating a dramatic decline in C star formation

its world line. In quantum theory however, such well-defined trajectories are
forbidden. After introducing a general characterisation of quantum clocks, we
demonstrate that, in the weak-field, low-velocity limit, all ""good"" quantum
clocks experience time dilation as dictated by general relativity when their
state of motion is classical (i.e. Gaussian). For nonclassical states of
motion, on the other hand, we find that quantum interference effects may give
rise to a significant discrepancy between the proper time and the time measured
by the clock. The universality of this discrepancy implies that it is not
simply a systematic error, but rather a quantum modification to the proper time
itself. We also show how the clock's delocalisation leads to a larger
uncertainty in the time it measures -- a consequence of the unavoidable
entanglement between the clock time and its center-of-mass degrees of freedom.
We demonstrate how this lost precision can be recovered by performing a
measurement of the clock's state of motion alongside its time reading.

popular techniques to identify such causal relations. However, in one-to-one
matching, when a treatment or control unit has multiple pair assignment options
with similar match quality, different matching algorithms often assign
different pairs. Since, all the matching algorithms assign pair without
considering the outcomes, it is possible that with same data and same

problem becomes more prominent in case of large-scale observational studies.
Recently, a robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertainty which uses
discrete optimization techniques to explore all possible assignments. Though
optimization techniques are very efficient in its own way, they are not
scalable to big data. In this work, we consider causal inference testing with
binary outcomes and propose computationally efficient algorithms that are
scalable to large-scale observational studies. By leveraging the structure of
the optimization model, we propose a robustness condition which further reduces
the computational burden. We validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms

follows the dust content in molecular clouds and the inter-cloud medium
separately, and allows growth only on pre-existing dust grains. At early times,
this can make a significant difference to the dust growth rate. Above $z\sim8$,
type II SNe are the primary source of dust, whereas below $z\sim8$, grain
growth in molecular clouds dominates, with the total dust content being
dominated by the latter below $z\sim6$. However, the detailed history of galaxy

metallicity and age, which can be used to deduce the DTM ratio of galaxies at
any redshift. At $z\lesssim3$, we find a fairly flat mean relation between
metallicity and the DTM, and a positive correlation between metallicity and the

and inference speed of deep networks by reducing the complexity of (i)
numerical representations (for example, by deterministic or stochastic
quantization) and (ii) arithmetic operations (for example, by binarization of
weights).
  We propose a stochastic binarization scheme for deep networks that allows for
efficient inference on hardware by restricting itself to additions of small
integers and fixed shifts. Unlike previous approaches, the underlying
randomized approximation is progressive, thus permitting an adaptive control of
the accuracy of each operation at run-time. In a low-precision setting, we
match the accuracy of previous binarized approaches. Our representation is
unbiased - it approaches continuous computation with increasing sample size. In
a high-precision regime, the computational costs are competitive with previous
quantization schemes. Progressive stochastic binarization also permits
localized, dynamic accuracy control within a single network, thereby providing
a new tool for adaptively focusing computational attention.
  We evaluate our method on networks of various architectures, already
pretrained on ImageNet. With representational costs comparable to previous
schemes, we obtain accuracies close to the original floating point
implementation. This includes pruned networks, except the known special case of
certain types of separated convolutions. By focusing computational attention
using progressive sampling, we reduce inference costs on ImageNet further by a

100 million years after the formation of the Sun. Our project makes use of the

purposes. We obtained partial/complete lightcurves for 42 CCs. We use
statistical tests to derive general properties about the shape and rotational
frequency distributions of the CC population, and infer that the CCs have
slower rotations and are more elongated/deformed than the other trans-Neptunian
objects. Based on the available full lightcurves, the mean rotational period of
the CC population is 9.48$\pm$1.53h whereas the mean period of the rest of the
trans-Neptunian objects is 8.45$\pm$0.58h. About 65% of the trans-Neptunian
objects (excluding the CCs) have a lightcurve amplitude below 0.2mag compared
to the 36% of CCs with small amplitude. We present the full lightcurve of one
new likely contact binary: 2004 VC131 with a potential density of 1gcc for a
mass ratio of 0.4. We also have hints that 2004 MU8 and 2004 VU75 are maybe
potential contact binaries based on their sparse lightcurves but more data are
needed to confirm such a find. Assuming equal-sized binaries, we find that only
~10-25% of the Cold Classicals could be contact binaries, suggesting that there
is a deficit of contact binaries in this population compared to previous
estimates and compared to the abundant (~40-50%) possible contact binaries in
the 3:2 resonant population. This estimate is a lower limit and will increase
if non equal-sized contact binaries are also considered. Finally, we put in

  Factorization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV physics.app-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the fabrication of casting parts sensor data is typically
automatically recorded and accumulated for process monitoring and defect
diagnosis. As casting is a thermal process with many interacting process
parameters, root cause analysis tends to be tedious and ineffective. We show
how a decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is
guided by a knowledge-based initialization strategy, is able to extract
physical meaningful sources from temperature time series collected during a
thermal manufacturing process. The approach assumes the time series to be
generated by a superposition of several simultaneously acting component
processes. NMF is able to reverse the superposition and to identify the hidden
component processes. The latter can be linked to ongoing physical phenomena and
process variables, which cannot be monitored directly. Our approach provides
new insights into the underlying physics and offers a tool, which can assist in
diagnosing defect causes. We demonstrate our method by applying it to real
world data, collected in a foundry during the series production of casting
parts for the automobile industry.

this paper we study the qualitative and quantitative formal modelling of
architectures applied on parametric component-based systems, that consist of an
unknown number of instances of each component. Specifically, we introduce an
extended propositional interaction logic and investigate its first-order level
which serves as a formal language for the interactions of parametric systems.
Our logics achieve to encode the execution order of interactions, which is a
main feature in several important architectures, as well as to model recursive
interactions. Moreover, we prove the decidability of equivalence,
satisfiability, and validity of first-order extended interaction logic
formulas, and provide several examples of formulas describing well-known
architectures. We show the robustness of our theory by effectively extending
our results for parametric weighted architectures. For this, we study the
weighted counterparts of our logics over a commutative semiring, and we apply
them for modelling the quantitative aspects of concrete architectures. Finally,
we prove that the equivalence problem of weighted first-order extended
interaction logic formulas is decidable in a large class of semirings, namely

This task is difficult because in many cases we observe actions individuals

addition, agents are strategic, so when the rules change, they will also change
their actions. Existing methods (e.g. structural estimation, inverse
reinforcement learning) make counterfactual predictions by constructing a model
of the game, adding the assumption that agents' behavior comes from optimizing
given some goals, and then inverting observed actions to learn agent's
underlying utility function (a.k.a. type). Once the agent types are known,
making counterfactual predictions amounts to solving for the equilibrium of the
counterfactual environment. This approach imposes heavy assumptions such as
rationality of the agents being observed, correctness of the analyst's model of
the environment/parametric form of the agents' utility functions, and various
other conditions to make point identification possible. We propose a method for
analyzing the sensitivity of counterfactual conclusions to violations of these
assumptions. We refer to this method as robust multi-agent counterfactual

counterfactual claims for classic environments in market design: auctions,

smooth walls a linear dependency is observed, steeper behaviours are found to
set in by increasing wall roughness. The variation of the steepness, in turn,
depends on the shape of the wall roughness, wherein gentle steepness changes

graph algorithms. Using GPUs to accelerate irregular graph algorithms is even
more difficult to be efficient, since GPU's highly structured SIMT architecture
is not a natural fit for irregular applications. With lots of previous efforts
spent on subtly mapping graph algorithms onto the GPU, the performance of graph
processing on GPUs is still highly memory-latency bound, leading to low
utilization of compute resources. Random memory accesses generated by the
sparse graph data structure are the major causes of this significant memory
access latency. Simply applying the conventional cache blocking technique
proposed for matrix computation have limited benefit due to the significant
overhead on the GPU. We propose GraphCage, a cache centric optimization
framework for highly efficient graph processing on GPUs. We first present a
throughput-oriented cache blocking scheme (TOCAB) in both push and pull
directions. Comparing with conventional cache blocking which suffers repeated
accesses when processing large graphs on GPUs, TOCAB is specifically optimized
for the GPU architecture to reduce this overhead and improve memory access
efficiency. To integrate our scheme into state-of-the-art implementations
without significant overhead, we coordinate TOCAB with load balancing
strategies by considering the sparsity of subgraphs. To enable cache blocking
for traversal-based algorithms, we consider the benefit and overhead in
different iterations with different working set sizes, and apply TOCAB for
topology-driven kernels in pull direction. Evaluation shows that GraphCage can
improve performance by 2 ~ 4x compared to hand optimized implementations and
state-of-the-art frameworks (e.g. CuSha and Gunrock), with less memory
consumption than CuSha.

spectra discrepancies due to unavoidable variations such as age, diet, and
medical background. A wealth of pre-processing methods are available, and it is
often up to trial-and-error or user experience to select the method which gives
the best results. This process can be incredibly time consuming and
inconsistent for multiple operators.
  In this study we detail a method to analyze the statistical variability
within a set of training spectra and determine suitability to form a robust

  Raman spectroscopy is ideal for noninvasive, nondestructive analysis. Routine

(LQG) are that its generators provide an anomaly free representation of the
classical constraint algebra and that physical states which lie in the kernel
of these generators encode propagation. A physical state in LQG is expected to
be a sum over graphical $SU(2)$ spin network states. By propagation we mean
that a quantum perturbation at one vertex of a spin network state propagates to
vertices which are `many links away' thus yielding a new spin network state
which is related to the old one by this propagation. A physical state encodes
propagation if its spin network summands are related by propagation. Here we
study propagation in an LQG quantization of Smolin's weak coupling limit of
Euclidean Gravity based on graphical $U(1)^3$ `charge' network states. Building
on our earlier work on anomaly free quantum constraint actions for this system,
we analyse the extent to which physical states encode propagation. In
particular, we show that a slight modification of the constraint actions
constructed in our previous work leads to physical states which encode robust
propagation. Under appropriate conditions, this propagation merges, seperates
and entangles vertices of charge network states. The `electric' diffeomorphism
constraints introduced in prevous work play a key role in our considerations.
The main import of our work is that there are choices of quantum constraint
constructions through LQG methods which are consistent with vigorous
propagation thus providing a counterpoint to Smolin's early observations on the
difficulties of propagation in the context of LQG type operator constructions.
Whether the choices considered in this work are physically appropriate is an
open question worthy of further study.

at the Lagrange-type equations which, in some details, differ from the
corresponding equations obtained previously by Kaula (1964).
  We also write down detailed expressions for $da/dt$, $de/dt$ and $di/dt$, to
order $e^4$. They differ from Kaula's expressions which contain a redundant
factor of $M/(M+M^{\prime}),$ with $M$ and $M^{\prime}$ being the masses of the
primary and the secondary. As Kaula was interested in the Earth-Moon system,
this redundant factor was close to unity and was unimportant in his
developments. This factor, however, must be reinstated when Kaula's theory is
applied to a binary composed of partners of comparable masses.
  We have found that, while it is legitimate to simply sum the primary's and
secondary's inputs in $da/dt$ or $de/dt$, this is not the case for $di/dt$. So
our expression for $di/dt$ differs from that of Kaula in two regards. First,
the contribution due to the dissipation in the secondary averages out when the
apsidal precession is uniform. Second, we have obtained an additional term
which emerges owing to the conservation of the angular momentum: a change in
the inclination of the orbit causes a change of the primary's plane of equator.

Therefore, it is critical for them to exhibit either plasticity or some form of
structural transition to absorb and release a sufficient amount of mechanical
energy before failure occurs. This study reports that the ThCr2Si2-structured
intermetallic compound (CaFe2As2) and a hybrid of its structure (CaKFe4As4)

with strain up to 17% through a reversible, deformation-induced, lattice
collapse, leading to a modulus of resilience orders of magnitude higher than
that of most engineering materials. Such superelasticity also can enable strain
engineering, which refers to the modification of material properties through
elastic strain. Density Functional Theory calculations and cryogenic
nanomechanical tests predict that superconductivity in CaKFe4As4 could be
turned on/off through the superelasticity process, before fracture occurs, even
under uniaxial compression, which is the favorable switching loading mode in
most engineering applications. Our results suggest that other members with the

likely explanation for the double red-clump observed in the bulge. We confirm
that bulge stars mostly follow abundance trends observed in the disk. However,
this similarity is not confirmed across for all elements and metallicity
regimes. The more metal-poor bulge population at [Fe/H] $\lesssim -0.8$ is
enhanced in the elements associated with core collapse supernovae (SNeII). In
addition, the [La/Eu] abundance ratio suggests higher $r$-process contribution,
and likely higher star formation in the bulge compared to the disk. This
highlights the complex evolution in the bulge, which should be investigated
further, both in terms of modelling; and with additional observations of the
inner Galaxy.

(IMDs) and their morphologies on dynamic spectra, in particular the positioning
of emission and absorption ridges and the repetition rate of fiber groups.
These were compared with a model in order to determine the conditions under
which the IMDs appear and exhibit the above characteristics. Methods. We
analyzed sixteen metric type IV events with embedded IMDs. The events were
recorded with the Artemis-JLS/SAO high resolution (10 ms cadence) receiver in
the 270-450MHz range with a frequency resolution of 1.4 MHz. We developed
cross- and autocorrelation techniques to measure the duration, spectral width,
and frequency drift of fiber bursts in 47 IMD groups. We also developed a
semi-automatic algorithm to track fibers on dynamic spectra. Results. We
distinguish six morphological groups of fibers, based on the relative position
of the emission and absorption ridges. These included fibers with emission or
absorption ridges only, fibers with the absorption ridge at lower or higher
frequency than the emission, or with two absorption ridges above and below the
emission or with two emission ridges were separated by an absorption ridge.
Some borderline cases of IMDs with very high drift rate (~0.30 s-1) or very
narrow total bandwidth (~8 MHz) were recorded; among them a group of rope-like
IMDs with fast repetition rate and relatively narrow total frequency extent.
The whistler hypothesis leads to reasonable magnetic field (~4.6 G), but the
Alfven-wave hypothesis requires much higher field. We estimated the ratio of
the whistler to the cyclotron frequency, x, to be ~ 0.3 to 0.6 and the average
frequency scale along the loop of ~220Mm. We present empirical relations
between fiber burst parameters and discuss their possible origin.

from RGB-D images. Assuming a static scene, the developed theoretical framework
generalizes the widely used direct energy formulation (photometric error
minimization) technique for obtaining a rigid body transformation that aligns
two overlapping RGB-D images to a continuous formulation. The continuity is
achieved through functional treatment of the problem and representing the
process models over RGB-D images in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space;
consequently, the registration is not limited to the specific image resolution
and the framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the
gradient. We solve the problem by maximizing the inner product between two
functions defined over RGB-D images, while the continuous action of the rigid
body motion Lie group is captured through the integration of the flow in the
corresponding Lie algebra. Energy-based approaches have been extremely
successful and the developed framework in this paper shares many of their
desired properties such as the parallel structure on both CPUs and GPUs,
sparsity, semi-dense tracking, avoiding explicit data association which is
computationally expensive, and possible extensions to the simultaneous
localization and mapping frameworks. The evaluations on experimental data and
comparison with the equivalent energy-based formulation of the problem confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed technique, especially, when the lack of

powerful tools for graph analytics tasks in numerous applications, ranging from
social networks and natural language processing to bioinformatics and
chemoinformatics, thanks to their ability to capture the complex relationships
between concepts. At present, the vast majority of GCNs use a neighborhood
aggregation framework to learn a continuous and compact vector, then performing
a pooling operation to generalize graph embedding for the classification task.
These approaches have two disadvantages in the graph classification task:
(1)when only the largest sub-graph structure ($k$-hop neighbor) is used for
neighborhood aggregation, a large amount of early-stage information is lost
during the graph convolution step; (2) simple average/sum pooling or max
pooling utilized, which loses the characteristics of each node and the topology
between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called, dual
attention graph convolutional networks (DAGCN) to address these problems. DAGCN
automatically learns the importance of neighbors at different hops using a
novel attention graph convolution layer, and then employs a second attention
component, a self-attention pooling layer, to generalize the graph
representation from the various aspects of a matrix graph embedding. The dual
attention network is trained in an end-to-end manner for the graph
classification task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art graph kernels

complex, with multiple types of algorithms and workflows needed to process and

provide much needed resources enabling faster processing of much larger
datasets than would be possible at any individual lab. The PhenoMeNal project
has developed such an infrastructure, allowing users to run analyses on local
or commercial cloud platforms. We have examined the computational scaling
behaviour of the PhenoMeNal platform using four different implementations
across 1-1000 virtual CPUs using two common metabolomics tools.
  Results: Our results show that data which takes up to 4 days to process on a
standard desktop computer can be processed in just 10 min on the largest
cluster. Improved runtimes come at the cost of decreased efficiency, with all
platforms falling below 80% efficiency above approximately 1/3 of the maximum
number of vCPUs. An economic analysis revealed that running on large scale
cloud platforms is cost effective compared to traditional desktop systems.
  Conclusions: Overall, cloud implementations of PhenoMeNal show excellent
scalability for standard metabolomics computing tasks on a range of platforms,
making them a compelling choice for research computing in metabolomics.

independent samples from a distribution $P$ over a finite alphabet of size $k$

gamma distribution with shape $k - 1$ and rate $n$. The resulting exponential
concentration inequality becomes meaningful (less than 1) when the divergence
$\varepsilon$ is larger than $(k-1)/n$, whereas the standard method of types
bound requires $\varepsilon > \frac{1}{n} \cdot \log{\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}} \geq
(k-1)/n \cdot \log(1 + n/(k-1))$, thus saving a factor of order $\log(n/k)$ in
the standard regime of parameters where $n\gg k$. As a consequence, we also
obtain finite-sample bounds on all the moments of the empirical divergence
(equivalently, the discrete likelihood-ratio statistic), which are within
constant factors (depending on the moment) of their asymptotic values. Our
proof proceeds via a simple reduction to the case $k = 2$ of a binary alphabet
(i.e. a binomial distribution), and has the property that improvements in the
case of $k = 2$ directly translate to improvements for general $k$. In
particular, we conjecture a bound on the binomial moment generating function

the asymptotic moment generating function bound from Wilks' theorem (which does
not hold for finite samples).

CO(3-2) in the literature. Adopting a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion

places the host in a sequence of normal star-forming galaxies in a
Mgas-star-formation rate (SFR) plane. A modified blackbody fit to the
far-infrared--millimeter photometry results in a dust temperature of 37 K and a
dust mass of Mdust = 1.5 x 10^8 Modot. The spatially-resolving CO(4-3)

field shows a clear rotation and is reproduced by a rotation-dominated disk

The CO spectral line energy distribution derived from the four CO transitions
is similar to that of starburst galaxies, suggesting a high excitation

(main-sequence) galaxies at similar redshifts shows that they share common
properties such as gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, gas-to-dust

have emerged as an effective approach in style transfer by adversarially
training the generator to synthesize convincing counterfeits. However,
traditional GAN suffers from the mode collapse issue, resulting in unstable
training and making style transfer quality difficult to guarantee. In addition,
the GAN generator is only compatible with one style, so a series of GANs must
be trained to provide users with choices to transfer more than one kind of
style. In this paper, we focus on tackling these challenges and limitations to
improve style transfer. We propose adversarial gated networks (Gated GAN) to
transfer multiple styles in a single model. The generative networks have three
modules: an encoder, a gated transformer, and a decoder. Different styles can
be achieved by passing input images through different branches of the gated
transformer. To stabilize training, the encoder and decoder are combined as an
autoencoder to reconstruct the input images. The discriminative networks are
used to distinguish whether the input image is a stylized or genuine image. An
auxiliary classifier is used to recognize the style categories of transferred
images, thereby helping the generative networks generate images in multiple
styles. In addition, Gated GAN makes it possible to explore a new style by
investigating styles learned from artists or genres. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed model for

principle separately from the spin-0 and spin-2 modes for a GW source in
particular sky positions [Hagihara et al., Phys. Rev. D 98, 064035 (2018)].
They have found particular sky positions that satisfy a condition of killing
completely the spin-0 modes in a so-called null stream which is a linear
combination of the signal outputs to kill the spin-2 modes. The present paper
expands the method to discuss a possibility that the spin-0 modes are not
completely but effectively suppressed in the null streams to test the spin-1
modes separately from the other modes, especially with an expected network of
Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA. We study also a possibility that the
spin-1 modes are substantially suppressed in the null streams to test the
spin-0 modes separately from the other modes, though the spin-1 modes for any
sky position cannot be completely killed in the null streams. Moreover, we find
that the coefficient of the spin-0 modes in the null stream is significantly
small for the GW170817 event, so that an upper bound can be placed on the

these supervised learning methods are data-hungry and time-consuming. This
restriction makes them unsuitable for limited data and urgent tasks, especially
in the applications of remote sensing. Inspired by the ability of humans to
quickly learn new visual concepts from very few examples, we propose a
training-free, one-shot geospatial object detection framework for remote
sensing images. It consists of (1) a feature extractor with remote sensing
domain knowledge, (2) a multi-level feature fusion method, (3) a novel
similarity metric method, and (4) a 2-stage object detection pipeline.
Experiments on sewage treatment plant and airport detections show that proposed
method has achieved a certain effect. Our method can serve as a baseline for
training-free, one-shot geospatial object detection.

metric spaces to which this theory applies include nonabelian Carnot groups and
Laakso spaces. In search of a metric characterization of the RNP, Ostrovskii
found another class of spaces that do not biLipschitz embed into RNP spaces,

any metric space containing a thick family of geodesics also contains a subset
and a probability measure on that subset which satisfies a weakened form of RNP
Lipschitz differentiability. A corollary is a new nonembeddability result. Our
second main result is that, if the metric space is a nonRNP Banach space, a
subset consisting of a thick family of geodesics can be constructed to satisfy
true RNP differentiability. An intriguing question is whether this

of marginal probabilities. A two-stage detector for OSCD is introduced to
compare the extracted query and target features with the learnable metric to
approach the optimized non-linear conditional probability. Once trained,
ComparisonNet can detect objects of both seen and unseen classes without

photo-ionisation detectors (PIDs). A stationary PID is positioned at the plume
centreline, while the second PID traverses across the plume in the wall-normal
direction. Similar to the large-scale coherence observed in the two-point
correlation map of streamwise velocity fluctuations \citep[e.g. Marusic et
al.][]{marusic2007reynolds}, the two-point correlation results of concentration
also indicate coherence in the scalar field. Particularly, the iso-contours of
correlation indicate an inclination of scalar structures in the direction of
the flow. The corresponding inclination angle is found to be a weak function of
the location of the plume within the boundary layer. However, the inclination
angle is observed to be invariant near 30$^\circ$ for all source heights that

understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a
fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions
for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or
neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are
optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger
picture. We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and
systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model
has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit
introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation
aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation
identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques
to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial
neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes.
Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and
leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help
users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive
visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit
helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale
image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network
architecture design. The Summit visualization runs in modern web browsers and
is open-sourced.

for large-scale image retrieval. Most deep hashing approaches use the high
layer to extract the powerful semantic representations. However, these methods
have limited ability for fine-grained image retrieval because the semantic
features extracted from the high layer are difficult in capturing the subtle
differences. To this end, we propose a novel two-pyramid hashing architecture
to learn both the semantic information and the subtle appearance details for
fine-grained image search. Inspired by the feature pyramids of convolutional
neural network, a vertical pyramid is proposed to capture the high-layer
features and a horizontal pyramid combines multiple low-layer features with
structural information to capture the subtle differences. To fuse the low-level
features, a novel combination strategy, called consensus fusion, is proposed to
capture all subtle information from several low-layers for finer retrieval.
Extensive evaluation on two fine-grained datasets CUB-200-2011 and Stanford

propose to concatenate multiple SC decoders with an SCL decoder, in which the
numbers of SC/SCL decoders are balanced with respect to their area and latency.
In addition, a novel unequal-quantization technique is adopted. The two
optimizations are crucial for improving SCL throughput within limited chip

measure ultra-low FERs of 3GPP NR Polar codes (with parity-check and CRC bits).
It is flexible to support all list sizes up to $8$, code lengths up to $1024$

times faster than a CPU core. For the first time, FER as low as $10^{-12}$ is

simply taken as a synonym for thermalization. Here we show, in an elementary

equivalent to ETH. In turn, ergodicity is equivalent to thermalization, thus
implying the equivalence of thermalization and ETH. This result previously

monolingual embedding spaces as probability densities defined by a Gaussian
mixture model, and matches the two densities using a method called normalizing
flow. The method requires no explicit supervision, and can be learned with only
a seed dictionary of words that have identical strings. We argue that this
formulation has several intuitively attractive properties, particularly with
the respect to improving robustness and generalization to mappings between
difficult language pairs or word pairs. On a benchmark data set of bilingual
lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity, our approach can achieve
competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art published

three parts, the texture estimation layer for spatial information extraction,
the motion detection layer for temporal information extraction and the decoding

produces responses largely independent of the spatial frequency and contrast in

sequences to guide object segmentation. The spatial segmentation branch focuses
on segmenting objects accurately based on the learned appearance and motion
cues. To obtain accurate segmentation results, we design a coarse-to-fine
process to sequentially apply a designed attention module on multi-scale
feature maps, and concatenate them to produce the final prediction. In this
way, the spatial segmentation branch is enforced to gradually concentrate on
object regions. These two branches are jointly fine-tuned on video segmentation
sequences in an end-to-end manner. Several experiments are carried out on three
challenging datasets (i.e., DAVIS-2016, DAVIS-2017 and Youtube-Object) to show
that our method achieves favorable performance against the state-of-the-arts.

assumptions on light sources must be satisfied. For example, each random bit
information is precisely encoded on an optical pulse and the photon-number
probability distribution of the pulse is exactly known. Unfortunately, however,
it is hard to check if all the assumptions are really met in practice, and it
is preferable that we have minimal number of device assumptions. In this paper,
we adopt the differential-phase-shift (DPS) QKD protocol and drastically
mitigate the requirements on light sources. Specifically, we only assume the
independence among emitted pulses, the independence of the vacuum emission
probability from a chosen bit, and upper bounds on the tail distribution
function of the total photon number in a single block of pulses for single, two

amount of phase modulation, are required. Our security proof significantly
relaxes demands for light sources, which paves a route to guarantee
implementation security with simple verification of the devices.

undergoes unitary evolution in between periodic measurements, leading to hybrid
quantum dynamics with random jumps at discrete time instances along a
continuous orbit. The measurements either act on the entire network of qubits,
or only a subset of qubits. First of all, we reveal that this type of hybrid
quantum dynamics induces probabilistic Boolean recursions representing the
measurement outcomes. With global measurements, it is shown that such resulting
Boolean recursions define Markov chains whose state-transitions are fully
determined by the network Hamiltonian and the measurement observables.
Particularly, we establish an explicit and algebraic representation of the
underlying recursive random mapping driving such induced Markov chains. Next,
with local measurements, the resulting probabilistic Boolean dynamics is shown
to be no longer Markovian. The state transition probability at any given time
becomes dependent on the entire history of the sample path, for which we
establish a recursive way of computing such non-Markovian probability
transitions. Finally, we adopt the classical bilinear control model for the
continuous Schr\""odinger evolution, and show how the measurements affect the

than the characteristic radius of the curvature of the background geometry, and
we can ignore nonlocal contributions. Explicit analytic expressions are
obtained for a general curvature coupling parameter, and specified to the more

vorticity. 1. Introdution This article studies the pinning phenomenon in
type-II superconducting composites. Superconductivity is a property that
appears in certain materials cooled below a critical temperature. These
materials are called superconductors. Superconductivity is characterized by a
total absence of electrical resistance and a perfect diamagnetism.
Unfortunately, when the imposed conditions are too intense, superconductivity
is destroyed in certain areas of the material called vorticity defects. We are
interested in type II superconductors which are characterized by the fact that
the vorticity defects first appear in small areas. Their number increases with
the intensity of the conditions imposed until filling the material. For
example, when the intensity h ex of an applied magnetic field exceeds a first
threshold, the first vorticity defects appear: the magnetic field begins to
penetrate the superconductor. The penetration is done along thin wires and may
move resulting an energy dissipation. These motions may be limited by trapping
the vorticity defects in small areas. The behavior of a superconductor is
modeled by minimizers of a Ginzburg-Landau type energy. In order to study the
presence of traps for the vorticity defects we consider an energy including a
pinning term that models impurities in the supercon-ductor. These impurities
would play the role of traps for the vorticity defects. We are thus lead to the
subject of this article: the type-II superconducting composites with
impurities.

further divided into three different types, ""conservative,"" ""radical,"" and

the dominant force for the social network to learn the real state, while the

However, since GAN is very hard to train, we make an empirical research and
present the relationship between training performance and hyperparameter values

results illustrate that the proposed model trained by adversarial learning can
achieve a better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art models

evidence for mass segregation is found, in contrast to the strong mass
segregation found in the Arches cluster, a second and slightly younger massive

minimizes the distance between the marginal distribution and the prior directly

is discretized with finite elements in time and finite differences in time. The
resulting nonlinear and linear systems of equations are large and show a very

exploiting the velocity-deformation relation $d_t u = v$. Second, the Jacobian
of the fluid-structure interaction system is simplified by neglecting all
derivatives with respect to the ALE deformation, an approximation that has
shown to have little impact. The resulting system of equation decouples into a
joint momentum equation and into two separated equations for the deformation
fields in solid and fluid. Besides a reduction of the problem sizes, the
approximation has a positive effect on the conditioning of the systems such
that multigrid solvers with simple smoothers like a parallel Vanka-iteration
can be applied. We demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting solver
infrastructure on a well-studied 2d test-case and we also introduce a

that the $k$-skeleton of an $n$-simplex $\Delta_n^{(k)}$ does not embed into a
compact PL $2k$-manifold $M$ by showing that if $\Delta_n^{(k)}$ embeds into
$M$, then $n\leq (2k+1)+(k+1)\beta_k(M;\mathbb Z_2)$. As a consequence we
obtain improved Radon and Helly type results for set systems in such manifolds.
  Our main tool is a new description of an obstruction for embeddability of a
$k$-complex $K$ into a compact PL $2k$-manifold $M$ via the intersection form
on $M$. In our approach we need that for every map $f\colon K\to M$ the
restriction to the $(k-1)$-skeleton of $K$ is nullhomotopic. In particular,
this condition is satisfied in interesting cases if $K$ is $(k-1)$-connected,
for example a $k$-skeleton of $n$-simplex, or if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected. In
addition, if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected and $k\geq 3$, the obstruction is
complete, meaning that a $k$-complex $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if the
obstruction vanishes. For trivial intersection forms, our obstruction coincides
with the standard van Kampen obstruction. However, if the form is non-trivial,
the obstruction is not linear but rather 'quadratic' in a sense that it
vanishes if and only if certain system of quadratic diophantine equations is
solvable. This may potentially be useful in attacking algorithmic decidability
of embeddability of $k$-complexes into PL $2k$-manifolds.

Moreover, recent geochemical evidence suggests that the Earth's mantle
preserves ancient (or ""primordial"") heterogeneity that predates the
Moon-forming giant impact. Using a new hydrodynamical method, we here show that
Moon-forming giant impacts lead to a stratified starting condition for the
evolution of the terrestrial mantle. The upper layer of the Earth is
compositionally similar to the disk, out of which the Moon evolves, whereas the
lower layer preserves proto-Earth characteristics. As long as this predicted
compositional stratification can at least partially be preserved over the
subsequent billions of years of Earth mantle convection, the compositional
similarity between the Moon and the accessible Earth's mantle is a natural
outcome of realistic and high-probability Moon-forming impact scenarios. The
preservation of primordial heterogeneity in the modern Earth not only
reconciles geochemical constraints but is also consistent with recent
geophysical observations. Furthermore, for significant preservation of a
proto-Earth reservoir, the bulk composition of the Earth-Moon system may be
systematically shifted towards chondritic values.

high-sensitivity continuum ALMA observations of 43 Class II young stellar
objects in CrA at 1.3 mm (230 GHz). The typical spatial resolution is 0.3"". The
continuum fluxes are used to estimate the dust masses of the disks, and a
survival analysis is performed to estimate the average dust mass. We also
obtained new VLT/X-Shooter spectra for 12 of the objects in our sample. 24
disks are detected, and stringent limits have been put on the average dust mass
of the non-detections. Accounting for the upper limits, the average disk mass
in CrA is $6\pm3\,\rm M_\oplus$, significantly lower than that of disks in
other young (1-3 Myr) star forming regions (e.g. Lupus) and appears consistent
with the 5-10 Myr old Upper Sco. The position of the stars in our sample on the
HR diagram, however, seems to confirm that that CrA has age similar to Lupus.
Neither external photoevaporation nor a lower than usual stellar mass
distribution can explain the low disk masses. On the other hand, a low-mass
disk population could be explained if the disks are small, which could happen
if the parent cloud has a low temperature or intrinsic angular momentum, or if
the the angular momentum of the cloud is removed by some physical mechanism
such as magnetic braking. In order to fully explain and understand the dust
mass distribution of protoplanetary disks and their evolution, it may also be
necessary to take into consideration the initial conditions of star and disk
formation process, which may vary from region to region, and affect planet
formation.

attention from diverse research fields. To address this reconstruction problem,
based on static similarity metrics commonly used in the link prediction
literature, we introduce new node-node temporal similarity metrics. The new
metrics take as input the time-series of multiple independent spreading
processes, based on the hypothesis that two nodes are more likely to be
connected if they were often infected at similar points in time. This
hypothesis is implemented by introducing a time-lag function which penalizes
distant infection times. We find that the choice of this time-lag strongly
affects the metrics' reconstruction accuracy, depending on the network's

static and temporal similarity metrics for network reconstruction. Our findings

employed as a good technique to transform the $m$-variate problem into a
univariate problem. Then the Dirichlet process is used as a prior on the
distribution of the Mahalanobis distance. The concentration of the distribution
of the distance between the posterior process and the chi-square distribution
with $m$ degrees of freedom is compared to the concentration of the
distribution of the distance between the prior process and the chi-square
distribution with $m$ degrees of freedom via a relative belief ratio. The
distance between the Dirichlet process and the chi-square distribution is
established based on the Anderson-Darling distance. Key theoretical results of
the approach are derived. The procedure is illustrated through several
examples, in which the proposed approach shows excellent performance.

of the effects of stellar rotation on the outcome of a TDE, we have performed
hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a rotating star whose spin axis
is opposite to the orbital axis. Such a retrograde rotation makes the star more
resilient to tidal disruption, so that, even if its orbit reaches the formal
tidal radius, it actually stays intact after the tidal encounter. However, the
outer layers of the star are initially stripped away from the core, but then
fall back onto the star itself, producing a newly formed accretion disc around
the star. We estimate that the accretion rate onto the star would be strongly
super-Eddington (for the star) and would result in an X-ray flare with
luminosity of the order of $\approx 10^{40}$ ergs/sec and duration of a few
months. We speculate that such events might be responsible for the known X-ray

particles. It is demonstrated that the twisted photon defined by the
Laguerre-Gauss wave function is luminal. Its apparent subluminality takes place
because the photon energy is contributed by the hidden transversal motion while
the average transversal momentum vanishes. Nevertheless, the Laguerre-Gauss
photon can be self-consistently modeled by a subluminal centroid with a nonzero
kinematic (Lorentz-invariant) mass. An applicability of this model is a
consequence of independence of centroid parameters from the longitudinal
coordinate. All twisted and untwisted Laguerre-Gauss modes are subliminal. The
Laguerre-Gauss electron has similar properties. The new effect of a
quantization of the velocity and mass of the Laguerre-Gauss photon and electron
is predicted. This effect is observable for the photon. The twisted photon and
electron modeled by the centroids are considered in the general noninertial
frame. Their inertial masses coinciding with kinematic ones are determined. The
orbital magnetic moment of the Laguerre-Gauss electron does not depend on the
radial quantum number.

learn a model of their environment which can be transferred to solve other
problems in a world with the same underlying rules. One reason this is
difficult is the challenge of learning accurate models of an environment. If
such a model is inaccurate, the agent's plans and actions will likely be
sub-optimal, and likely lead to the wrong outcomes. Recent progress in
model-based reinforcement learning has improved the ability for agents to learn
and use predictive models. In this paper, we extend a recent deep learning
architecture which learns a predictive model of the environment that aims to
predict only the value of a few key measurements, which are be indicative of an
agent's performance. Predicting only a few measurements rather than the entire
future state of an environment makes it more feasible to learn a valuable
predictive model. We extend this predictive model with a small, evolving neural
network that suggests the best goals to pursue in the current state. We
demonstrate that this allows the predictive model to transfer to new scenarios
where goals are different, and that the adaptive goals can even adjust agent
behavior on-line, changing its strategy to fit the current context.

observe that for many brain structures, a small number of training examples,

suffice as training data to achieve high performance, achieving an overall mean
Dice coefficient of $0.84 \pm 0.12$ compared to Freesurfer over 28 brain
structures in T1-weighted images of $\approx 4000$ 9-10 year-olds from the

existing proposal by Kendall and Gal, which uses Monte-Carlo inference to learn
to predict the variance of each prediction, yields an overall mean Dice of
$0.85 \pm 0.14$ and showed statistically significant improvements over 25 brain
structures. Meanwhile a novel heteroscedastic network which directly learns the
probability that an example has been mislabeled yielded an overall mean Dice of

efficiency, hashing has recently received increasing attention. In
particular,cross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in

employing cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their
ignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains
richer semantic information, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance.
In this paper, we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for
cross-modal retrieval. First, we utilize the triplet labels, which describes
the relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to
capture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We
then establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal
view to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally, graph
regularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the
original semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space. Experimental
results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art
approaches on two popular cross-modal datasets.

A well known problem with nested polar codes for binary DP is the existence of

need to be retransmitted in a second phase of the scheme, thus reducing
transmission rate. We observe that the number of these bits is typically either

efficient deep neural network (DNN) mostly relies on a large number of labeled
samples being available. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified
deep network, combined with active transfer learning that can be well-trained
for HSIs classification using only minimally labeled training data. More
specifically, deep joint spectral-spatial feature is first extracted through
hierarchical stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) networks. Active transfer
learning is then exploited to transfer the pre-trained SSAE network and the
limited training samples from the source domain to the target domain, where the
SSAE network is subsequently fine-tuned using the limited labeled samples
selected from both source and target domain by corresponding active learning
strategies. The advantages of our proposed method are threefold: 1) the network
can be effectively trained using only limited labeled samples with the help of
novel active learning strategies; 2) the network is flexible and scalable
enough to function across various transfer situations, including cross-dataset
and intra-image; 3) the learned deep joint spectral-spatial feature
representation is more generic and robust than many joint spectral-spatial
feature representation. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate that our

global signal at the epoch of cosmic dawn on the evolutions of a class of
dynamically interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We firstly summarize two
dynamical mechanisms in which different background evolutions can exert
considerable effects on the 21-cm line global signal. One is the decoupling
time of Compton scattering heating, the other stems from the direct change of
optical depth due to the different expansion rate of the Universe. After that,
we investigate the IDE models to illustrate the tension between the results of
Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of reionization Signature (EDGES) and
other experiments. To apply the analyses of these two mechanisms to IDE models,
we find that only the optical depth can be significantly changed. Accordingly,
in order to relieve the tension by including the effects of the decoupling time
of Compton scattering heating, we deduce a possible evolution form for the
Hubble parameter within IDE that begins at an early stage around $z\sim 100$
and then smoothly evolves to a value at $z\sim 17$ which is smaller than that
obtained in the standard paradigm. Eventually, we fulfill this scenario by
adding an early dark energy dominated stage to the cosmological paradigm
described by IDE models, which can alleviate the tension between EDGES and
other cosmological observations but cannot completely solve it.

manner, we collect a large `in the wild' dataset containing 1,54,251 images
from the web. For the images in the database, we divide the gaze into three
regions based on an automatic technique based on pupil-centers localization and
then use a feature-based technique to determine the gaze region. The
performance is evaluated on the Tablet Gaze and CAVE datasets by fine-tuning
results of Ize-Net for the task of eye gaze estimation. The feature
representation learned is also used to train traditional machine learning
algorithms for eye gaze estimation. The results demonstrate that the proposed
method learns a rich data representation, which can be efficiently fine-tuned
for any eye gaze estimation dataset.

of the tools were given to teams in Company A (N = 30). The questions were
grouped into agile practices which were checked for correlation in order to
establish convergent validity. In addition, we checked whether the questions
identified to be the same among the tools would be given the same replies by
the respondents. We could not establish convergent validity since the

Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere, Majorana's stellar representation provides an
intuitive geometric perspective to comprehend a quantum system with
high-dimensional Hilbert space. However, the problem of the representation of a
two-spin coupling system on a Bloch sphere has not been solved satisfactorily
yet. Here, we present a practical method to resolve the problem for the
mixed-spin $(s, 1/2)$ system. The system can be decomposed into two spins:
spin-$(s+1/2)$ and spin-$(s-1/2)$ at the coupling bases, which can be regarded
as independent spins. Besides, we may write any pure state as a superposition
of two orthonormal states with one spin-$(s+1/2)$ state and the other
spin-$(s-1/2)$ state. Thus, the whole state can be regarded as a state of a
pseudo spin-$1/2$. In this way, the mixed spin decomposes into three spins.
Therefore, we can represent the state by $(2s+1)+(2s-1)+1=4s+1$ sets of stars
on a Bloch sphere. Finally, to demonstrate our theory, we give some examples
that indeed show laconic and symmetric patterns on the Bloch sphere, and unveil
the properties of the high-spin system by analyzing the trajectories of the
Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere.

task: the modeling of semantic relations between a pair of textual elements. A
popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors,
and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as
features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has
been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)
whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge
base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation
prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models.
We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks
(e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address
textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can
alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly
improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation

featuring a sliding bead on top, and with the lower substrate layers
thermostatted to control temperature. A challenge is dealing with phonons that
backreflect from the substrate lower boundary, as these will artificially
reduce the friction FR acting on the sliding bead. One proposed solution is to
use a Langevin thermostat, operating at temperature TLAN, and with the
corresponding damping parameter, GAMMA, optimally tuned such that FR is
maximized [Benassi etal, PHYSREVB, V82, P081401, 2010]. In this paper, the
method is revisited, and related to the substrate phonon lifetime, the
substrate temperature TSUB, and the sliding speed. At low sliding speed, where
the time between stick-slip events is large compared to the phonon lifetime, we
do not observe much dependence of FR on GAMMA, and here thermostat tuning is
not required. At high sliding speed, upon varying GAMMA, we confirm the
aforementioned friction maximum, but also observe a pronounced minimum in TSUB,
which here deviates from TLAN. For substrate particle interactions that are
strongly anharmonic, the variation of FR with GAMMA can be understood as a
manifestation of thermolubricity, backreflections being essentially
unimportant. In contrast, for harmonic interactions, where phonon lifetimes
become very long, FR is strongly affected by backreflecting phonons, though not
enough to overturn thermolubricity.

integrated where the conventional C-RAN functions are diverged to the edge
devices of radio access networks. F-RAN is adopted to mitigate the burden of
front-haul and improve the end to end (E2E) latency. On other hand,
virtualization and network function virtualization (NFV) are IT techniques that
aim to convert the functions from hardware to software based functions. Many
merits could be brought by the employment of NFV in mobile networks including a
high degree of reliability, flexibility and energy efficiency. In this paper, a
virtualization framework is introduced for F-RAN to improve the energy
efficiency in 5G networks. In this framework, a gigabit passive optical network
(GPON) is leveraged as a backbone network for the proposed F-RAN architecture
where it connects several evolved nodes B (eNodeBs) via fibre cables. The
energy-efficiency of the proposed F-RAN architecture has been investigated and
compared with the conventional C-RAN architecture in two different scenarios
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. The MILP results indicate
that on average a 30% power saving can be achieved by the F-RAN architecture
compared with the C-RAN architecture.

we make a list of all possible allowed and disallowed texture zeros in Dirac

possible texture zeros in light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$, Dirac neutrino

anisotropic wave dispersion. Ship waves for motion across a sub--surface
current on a still surface exhibit striking asymmetry about the ship's line of
motion, and large differences in wake angle and transverse wavelength for
upstream vs downstream motion are demonstrated, all of which in good agreement
with theoretical predictions. Neither of these phenomena can occur on a
depth-uniform current. A quantitative comparison of measured vs predicted
average phase shift for a ring wave is grossly mispredicted by no-shear theory,
but in good agreement with predictions for the measured shear current. A clear
difference in wave frequency within the ring wave packet is observed in the
upstream vs downstream direction for all shear flows, while it conforms with
theory for quiescent water for propagation normal to the shear current, as
expected. Peak values of the measured 2-dimensional Fourier spectrum for ship
waves are shown to agree well with the predicted criterion of stationary ship
waves, with the exception of some cases where results are imperfect due to the
limited wave-number resolution, transient effects and/or experimental noise.

computed based on the current particle positions suffers from the tensile

the kernel functions are calculated in the reference configurations. In this
work, the metals are modelled using the Johnson-Cook constitutive model, which
can capture strain hardening and thermal softening in metals. The
processing/cutting tools are modelled as rigid bodies, while the metal-tool
contact forces are considered using the standard SPH interaction and the
particle-particle pinball contact in ESPH and TLSPH, respectively. The two
methods are employed to model several cases with impact, pressing, and cutting;
the results are compared with reference experimental and numerical results. It
is found that both the two SPH methods can capture the salient phenomena in

localisation and chip morphology. This work shows that the TLSPH method has the

parameter selection stage. The selection stage has an impact on subsequent
estimation, for example by introducing a selection bias. The post-selection
maximum likelihood (PSML) estimator is shown to reduce the selection bias and
the post-selection mean-squared-error (PSMSE) compared with conventional
estimators, such as the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator.
  However, the computational complexity of the PSML is usually high due to the
multi-dimensional exhaustive search for a global maximum of the post-selection
log-likelihood (PSLL) function. Moreover, the PSLL involves the probability of
selection that, in general, does not have an analytical form. In this paper, we
develop new low-complexity post-selection estimation methods for a two-stage
estimation after parameter selection architecture.
  The methods are based on implementing the iterative maximization by parts
(MBP) approach, which is based on the decomposition of the PSLL function into
""easily-optimized"" and complicated parts.
  The proposed second-best PSML method applies the MBP-PSML algorithm with a
pairwise probability of selection between the two highest-ranked parameters
w.r.t. the selection rule.
  The proposed SA-PSML method is based on using stochastic approximation (SA)
and Monte Carlo integrations to obtain a non-parametric estimation of the
gradient of the probability of selection and then applying the MBP-PSML
algorithm on this approximation. For low-complexity performance analysis, we
develop the empirical post-selection Cramer-Rao-type lower bound.
  Simulations demonstrate that the proposed post-selection estimation methods
are tractable and reduce both the bias and the PSMSE, compared with the ML

bounded model checking procedure. We also combine an interval invariant
generator and bkind to significantly improve the number of correct verification
results. Experimental results show that bkind can considerably reduce the
verification time compared to the naive k-induction proof rule, since it only
requires half the number of steps to find a given safety property violation in
an unsafe program. The bkind algorithm outperforms 2LS, another
state-of-the-art k-induction verifier, and produces more than twice correct
proofs and about 35% more correct alarms than when analysing a large set of

let $R^+_1$ be the region of the plane that lies to the positive side of both

asymptotically correct in the large-data limit. However, these results are
inappropriate for computational purposes since they only hold over most, and
not all, datasets and involve hard-to-estimate constants. In this article, I
present a new BvM theorem which bounds the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between a fixed log-concave density $f\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)$ and its
Laplace approximation. The bound goes to $0$ as the higher-derivatives of
$f\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)$ tend to $0$ and
$f\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)$ becomes increasingly Gaussian. The
classical BvM theorem in the IID large-data asymptote is recovered as a
corollary.
  Critically, this theorem further suggests a number of computable
approximations of the KL divergence with the most promising being: \[
KL\left(g_{LAP},f\right)\approx\frac{1}{2}\text{Var}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}\sim
g\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)}\left(\log\left[f\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)\right]-\log\left[g_{LAP}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)\right]\right)

a path towards rigorously controlling the error due to the Laplace

to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can

model for interpolation of hydrological data of different spatial support. That
is, streamflow observations from catchments (areal data), and precipitation and
evaporation data (point data). The model contains one climatic spatial effect
that is common for all years under study, and one year specific spatial effect.
Hence, the framework enables a quantification of the spatial variability that
is due to long-term weather patterns and processes. This can contribute to a
better understanding of biases and uncertainties in environmental modeling. By
using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and the stochastic
partial differential equation approach (SPDE) to spatial modeling, the two
field model is computationally feasible and fast. The suggested model is tested
by predicting 10 years of annual runoff around Voss in Norway and through a
simulation study. We find that on average we benefit from combining point and
areal data compared to using only one of the data types, and that the
interaction between nested areal data and point data gives a spatial model that
takes us beyond smoothing. Another finding is that when climatic effects
dominate over annual effects, systematic under- and overestimation of runoff
over time can be expected. On the other hand, a dominating climatic spatial
effect implies that short records of runoff from an otherwise ungauged

  Forensics",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As JPEG is the most widely used image format, the importance of tampering
detection for JPEG images in blind forensics is self-evident. In this area,
extracting effective statistical characteristics from a JPEG image for
classification remains a challenge. Effective features are designed manually in
traditional methods, suggesting that extensive labor-consuming research and
derivation is required. In this paper, we propose a novel image tampering
detection method based on deep multi-scale discriminative networks (MSD-Nets).
The multi-scale module is designed to automatically extract multiple features
from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficient histograms of the JPEG
image. This module can capture the characteristic information in different
scale spaces. In addition, a discriminative module is also utilized to improve
the detection effect of the networks in those difficult situations when the
first compression quality (QF1) is higher than the second one (QF2). A special
network in this module is designed to distinguish the small statistical
difference between authentic and tampered regions in these cases. Finally, a
probability map can be obtained and the specific tampering area is located
using the last classification results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in both quantitative and qualitative metrics
when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

can transform into a Fermi liquid, depending on the composition $x$ and the
impurity level. Near the nematic end point, we find an extended temperature
regime with $T^{1.5}$ resistivity. The transverse magnetoresistance inside the
nematic phase has as a $H^{1.55}$ dependence over a large magnetic field range

performance. However, challenges such as occlusion and view change remain
obstacles in real world deployment. A natural solution to these challenges is
to use multiple cameras with multiview inputs, though existing systems are
mostly limited to specific targets (e.g. human), static cameras, and/or camera
calibration. To break through these limitations, we propose a generic multiview
tracking (GMT) framework that allows camera movement, while requiring neither
specific object model nor camera calibration. A key innovation in our framework
is a cross-camera trajectory prediction network (TPN), which implicitly and
dynamically encodes camera geometric relations, and hence addresses missing
target issues such as occlusion. Moreover, during tracking, we assemble
information across different cameras to dynamically update a novel
collaborative correlation filter (CCF), which is shared among cameras to
achieve robustness against view change. The two components are integrated into
a correlation filter tracking framework, where the features are trained offline
using existing single view tracking datasets. For evaluation, we first
contribute a new generic multiview tracking dataset (GMTD) with careful
annotations, and then run experiments on GMTD and the PETS2009 datasets. On
both datasets, the proposed GMT algorithm shows clear advantages over
state-of-the-art ones.

computed the electronic and transport properties of single (F centers) and
paired (M centers) oxygen vacancies using density functional theory. These
point defects can generate barrier heights as low as 0.4V for FeCo electrodes
irrespective of the defect's spatial position within the barrier, and of the
orientation of the M center. These defects promote a strong decrease in the
conductance of the spin up channel in the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)'s
parallel (P) magnetic state that mainly accounts for an order-of-magnitude drop
in TMR, from about 10000$\%$ in the ideal case toward values more in line with
experiment. When placed in the middle layer of the MgO barrier, the F center
introduces additional P $\uparrow$ transmission away from the $\Gamma$ point.
This scattering lowers TMR to 145$\%$. In contrast, the M center merely
broadens this transmission around $\Gamma$, thereby boosting TMR to 315$\%$.
Rotating a M center so as to partly point along the transmission direction
sharpens transmission around $\Gamma$, further increasing TMR to 1423$\%$. When
these defects are placed at the MTJ interface, the transmission and ensuing
TMR, which reaches $\approx$ 4000$\%$, suggest that such junctions behave as
would an ideal MTJ, only with a much lower barrier height. Our results thus
theoretically reconcile the concurrent observations of high TMR and low barrier
heights, such as post-deposition oxidation of metallic Mg, which can generate
oxygen vacancies at the lower MTJ interface, and annealing which can promote M
centers over F centers.

uniquely specified for any given inhomogeneous space-time, and that the

This would appear to limit the applicability of Green & Wald's formalism to the

comparison of these averaging formalisms, and determine whether the same
difficulties exist, in less idealized space-time geometries.

reassigning an ongoing session handled by one cell into another. In order to
support increased capacity requirement and to enable newer use cases, the next

beam-forming capability. In such systems, providing a better mobility along
with enhanced throughput performance requires an improved handover strategy. In
this paper, we will detail a novel method for handover optimization in a 5G
cellular network using reinforcement learning (RL). In contrast to the
conventional method, we propose to control the handovers between base-stations
(BSs) using a centralized RL agent. This agent handles the radio measurement
reports from the UEs and choose appropriate handover actions in accordance with
the RL framework to maximize a long-term utility. We show that the handover
mechanism can be posed as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem and solve it
using Q-learning method. We analyze the performance of the methods using
different propagation and deployment environment and compare the results with
the state-of-the-art algorithms. Results indicate a link-beam performance gain
of about 0.3 to 0.7 dB for practical propagation environments.

stacking interactions. However, variations from steady-state conformations
result from mechanical perturbations in cells. These different topologies have
physiological relevance but their dependence on sequence remains unclear. Here,
we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that sequence differences result
in markedly different structural motifs upon physiological twisting and
stretching. We simulated overextension on four different sequences of DNA
((AA)12, (AT)12, (GG)12 and (GC)12) with supercoiling densities within the
physiological range. We found that DNA denatures in the majority of stretching
simulations, surprisingly including those with overtwisted DNA. GC-rich
sequences were observed to be more stable than AT-rich, with the specific
response dependent on base pair ordering. Furthermore, we found that (AT)12
forms stable periodic structures with non-canonical hydrogen bonds in some
regions and non-canonical stacking in others, whereas (GC)12 forms a stacking
motif of four base pairs independent of supercoiling density. Our results
demonstrate that 20-30% DNA extension is sufficient for breaking B-DNA around

crucial for understanding structural changes under mechanical stress. Our
findings have important implications for the activities of protein machinery

differintegrals to assorted special functions. Recently, a new variant of
fractional calculus has arisen, namely incomplete fractional calculus. In two
very recent papers, incomplete versions of the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo
fractional differintegrals have been formulated and applied to several
important special functions.
  In the current work, we develop the theory of incomplete fractional calculus
in more depth, investigating further properties of the incomplete
Riemann-Liouville fractional differintegrals and answering some fundamental
questions about these operators. By considering appropriate function spaces, we
formulate rigorously the definitions of incomplete Riemann-Liouville fractional
integration, and justify how this model may be used to analyse a wider class of
functions than classical fractional calculus. By using analytic continuation,
we formulate definitions for incomplete Riemann-Liouville fractional
differentiation, hence extending the incomplete integrals to a fully-fledged
model of fractional calculus.
  We also investigate and analyse these operators further, in order to prove
new properties. These include a Leibniz rule for incomplete differintegrals of
products, and composition properties of incomplete differintegrals with
classical calculus operations. These are natural and expected issues to
investigate in any new model of fractional calculus, and in the incomplete

applications in various data-driven disciplines. Still, many MF algorithms do
not adequately scale with the size of available datasets and/or lack
interpretability. To improve the computational efficiency of the method, an
online (streaming) MF algorithm was proposed in Mairal et al. [2010]. To enable
data interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was
introduced in Ding et al. [2010]. In the latter work, the basis vectors are
required to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that
every basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No
current algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is
challenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete
dataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF
algorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative
data samples needed for interpreting each of the basis (Ding et al. [2010]) and
has the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning
algorithm of Mairal et al. [2010]. Our proof techniques combine random
coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence
analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant
computational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to
classical convex MF. Since the proposed method maintains small representative
sets of data samples needed for convex interpretations, it is related to a body
of work in theoretical computer science, pertaining to generating point sets
(Blum et al. [2016]), and in computer vision, pertaining to archetypal analysis
(Mei et al. [2018]). Nevertheless, it differs from these lines of work both in

single-photon Lidar system provides additional spectral diversity, allowing the
discrimination of different materials. However, the main drawback of such
systems can be the long acquisition time needed to collect enough photons in
each spectral band. In this work, we tackle this problem in two ways: first, we
propose a Bayesian 3D reconstruction algorithm that is able to find multiple
surfaces per pixel, using few photons, i.e., shorter acquisitions. In contrast
to previous algorithms, the novel method processes the jointly all the spectral
bands, obtaining better reconstructions using less photon detections. The
proposed model promotes spatial correlation between neighbouring points within
a given surface using spatial point processes. Secondly, we account for
different spatial and spectral subsampling schemes, which reduce the total
number of measurements, without significant degradation of the reconstruction
performance. In this way, the total acquisition time, memory requirements and
computational time can be significantly reduced. The experiments performed
using both synthetic and real single-photon Lidar data demonstrate the
advantages of tailored sampling schemes over random alternatives. Furthermore,
the proposed algorithm yields better estimates than other existing methods for

a vehicular fog. The proposed vehicular fog architecture is connected to the

available in all vehicles, we study the software matching problem of task
assignments in vehicular fog. The goal of this paper is to examine the effect
of software packages variety in vehicles on the assignment decision and the
overall power consumption. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was
utilized to optimize the power consumption of the overall architecture,
considering different numbers of software packages in the vehicular fog. The
results reveal a power saving of up to 27% when vehicles are uploaded with four

role of argumentation as a context shared by evidence, proofs, and derivations.
The utility of argumentation theory, in general, and argumentation schemes, in
particular, as a methodology for the study of mathematical practice is thereby
demonstrated. Argumentation schemes represent an almost untapped resource for
mathematics education. Notably, they provide a consistent treatment of rigorous
and non-rigorous argumentation, thereby working to exhibit the continuity of
reasoning in mathematics with reasoning in other areas. Moreover, since
argumentation schemes are a comparatively mature methodology, there is a
substantial body of existing work to draw upon, including some increasingly
sophisticated software tools. Such tools have significant potential for the
analysis and evaluation of mathematical argumentation. The first four sections
of the paper address the relationships of evidence to proof, proof to
derivation, argument to proof, and argument to evidence, respectively. The
final section directly addresses some of the educational implications of an
argumentation scheme account of mathematical reasoning.

composite channel model including both large-scale and small-scale fading, the
UAV trajectory and in-flight transmit power are jointly optimized, subject to
constraints on UAV kinematics, tolerable interference, backhaul, and the total

roads and highways, few works have studied the driving strategy and trajectory
planning in low-speed driving scenarios, e.g., driving on a university campus
or driving through a housing or industrial estate. The study of planning in
these scenarios is crucial as these environments often cover the first or the
last one kilometer of a daily travel or logistic system. Additionally, it is
essential to treat these scenarios differently as, in most cases, the driving
environment is narrow, dynamic, and rich with obstacles, which also causes the
planning in such environments to continue to be a challenging task. This paper
proposes a hierarchical planning approach that separates the path planning and
the temporal planning. A path that satisfies the kinematic constraints is
generated through a modified bidirectional rapidly exploring random tree
(bi-RRT) approach. Following that, the timestamp of each node of the path is
optimized through sequential quadratic programming (SQP) with the feasible
searching bounds defined by safe intervals (SIs). Simulations and real tests in
different driving scenarios prove the effectiveness of this method.

entanglement entropy, between regions of space in excited states of many-body
systems formed by a finite number of particle excitations. In parts I and II of
the current series of papers, it has been shown in one-dimensional
free-particle models that, in the limit of large system's and regions' sizes,
the contribution from the particles is given by the entanglement of natural
qubit states, representing the uniform distribution of particles in space. We
show that the replica logarithmic negativity and R\'enyi entanglement entropy
of such qubit states are equal to the partition functions of certain graphs,
that encode the connectivity of the manifold induced by permutation twist
fields. Using this new connection to graph theory, we provide a general proof,
in the massive free boson model, that the qubit result holds in any
dimensionality, and for any regions' shapes and connectivity. The proof is
based on clustering and the permutation-twist exchange relations, and is
potentially generalisable to other situations, such as lattice models, particle
and hole excitations above generalised Gibbs ensembles, and interacting
integrable models.

clustering and retrieval tasks, has attracted extensive attention in recent
years. A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar
examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped
farther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss
functions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the
approaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance
metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of
image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR
distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we
analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic
similarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep
metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance
metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the
inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric,
we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative
feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted
benchmarks, including CARS196, CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10, our DSML has shown its
superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we extend our
SNR distance metric to deep hashing learning, and conduct experiments on two
benchmarks, including CIFAR10 and NUS-WIDE, to demonstrate the effectiveness
and generality of our SNR distance metric.

late-time measurements of the expansion rate and matter fluctuation amplitude.
Interestingly, CMB fits to this model either pick out a specific large value of
the neutrino interaction strength, or are consistent with the extremely weak
neutrino interaction found in $\Lambda$CDM, resulting in a bimodal posterior
distribution for the neutrino self-interaction cross section. In this paper, we
explore why current cosmological data select this particular large neutrino
self-interaction strength, and by consequence, disfavor intermediate values of
the self-interaction cross section. We show how it is the $\ell \gtrsim 1000$
CMB temperature anisotropies, most recently measured by the Planck satellite,
that produce this bimodality. We also establish that smaller scale temperature
data, and improved polarization data measuring the temperature-polarization
cross-correlation, will best constrain the neutrino self-interaction strength.

distinguishing between the models.

traditionally a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while the decoding (for
language generation) is done using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Current
state-of-the-art methods, however, train encoder and decoder separately. CNNs
are pretrained on object and/or action recognition tasks and used to encode
video-level features. The decoder is then optimised on such static features to
generate the video's description. This disjoint setup is arguably sub-optimal
for input (video) to output (description) mapping. In this work, we propose to
optimise both encoder and decoder simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion. In a
two-stage training setting, we first initialise our architecture using
pre-trained encoders and decoders -- then, the entire network is trained

orbiting/sliding, scattering, and hovering, with orbiting being favored for
lower curvature as in the literature. Surprisingly, it also shows backward
orbiting/sliding for sufficiently strong pushers, caused by fluid recirculation
in the gap between the squirmer and the obstacle leading to strong forces
opposing forward motion. Lubrication theory instead suggests that only hovering
is a stable point for the dynamics. We therefore employ lattice Boltzmann to
resolve this discrepancy and we qualitatively reproduce the richer far-field

applied to reuse knowledge from performance models trained in one environment
in another. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to understand the
effectiveness of different transfer learning strategies for building
performance models of DNN systems. Our results show that transferring
information on the most influential configuration options and their

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1901.09890",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot learning aims to learn classifiers for new classes with only a few
training examples per class. Most existing few-shot learning approaches belong
to either metric-based meta-learning or optimization-based meta-learning
category, both of which have achieved successes in the simplified ""$k$-shot
$N$-way"" image classification settings. Specifically, the optimization-based
approaches train a meta-learner to predict the parameters of the task-specific
classifiers. The task-specific classifiers are required to be
homogeneous-structured to ease the parameter prediction, so the meta-learning
approaches could only handle few-shot learning problems where the tasks share a
uniform number of classes. The metric-based approaches learn one task-invariant
metric for all the tasks. Even though the metric-learning approaches allow
different numbers of classes, they require the tasks all coming from a similar
domain such that there exists a uniform metric that could work across tasks. In
this work, we propose a hybrid meta-learning model called Meta-Metric-Learner
which combines the merits of both optimization- and metric-based approaches.
Our meta-metric-learning approach consists of two components, a task-specific
metric-based learner as a base model, and a meta-learner that learns and
specifies the base model. Thus our model is able to handle flexible numbers of
classes as well as generate more generalized metrics for classification across
tasks. We test our approach in the standard ""$k$-shot $N$-way"" few-shot
learning setting following previous works and a new realistic few-shot setting
with flexible class numbers in both single-source form and multi-source forms.
Experiments show that our approach can obtain superior performance in all
settings.

on transitions involving higher excited P states. In particular, the long-range
interaction of an excited hydrogen atom in a 4P state with a ground-state and
metastable hydrogen atom is studied, with a full resolution of the hyperfine
structure. It is found that the full inclusion of the 4P_1/2 and 4P_3/2
manifolds becomes necessary in order to obtain reliable theoretical
predictions, because the 1S ground state hyperfine frequency is commensurate
with the 4P fine-structure splitting. An even more complex problem is
encountered in the case of the 4P-2S interaction, where the inclusion of
quasi-degenerate 4S-2P_1/2 state becomes necessary in view of the dipole
couplings induced by the van der Waals Hamiltonian. Matrices of dimension up to
40 have to be treated despite all efforts to reduce the problem to irreducible
submanifolds within the quasi-degenerate basis. We focus on the
phenomenologically important second-order van der Waals shifts, proportional to
1/R^6 where R is the interatomic distance, and obtain results with full
resolution of the hyperfine structure. The magnitude of van der Waals
coefficients for hydrogen atom-atom collisions involving excited P states is
drastically enhanced due to energetic quasi-degeneracy; we find no such
enhancement for atom-molecule collisions involving atomic nP states, even if
the complex molecular spectrum involving ro-vibrational levels requires a
deeper analysis.

of electroencephalogram (EEG), classifiers are trained and tested using EEG
from the same subject. When physical disabilities bottleneck the natural
modality of performing a task, acquisition of ample training data is difficult
which practically obstructs classifier training. Previous works have tackled
this problem by generalizing the feature space amongst multiple subjects
including the test subject. This work aims at knowledge transfer to classify
EEG of the target subject using a classifier trained with the EEG of another
unit source subject. A many-objective optimization framework is proposed where
optimal weights are obtained for projecting features in another dimension such
that single source-trained target EEG classification performance is maximized
with the modified features. To validate the approach, motor imagery tasks from
the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa are classified using power spectral density
based features and linear support vector machine. Several performance metrics,
improvement in accuracy, sensitivity to the dimension of the projected space,
assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. Addressing single-source training
promotes independent living of differently-abled individuals by reducing
assistance from others. The proposed approach eliminates the requirement of EEG
from multiple source subjects and is applicable to any existing feature

spheres have a symmetry derived via a stereographic projection from a 4D finite
reflection group, then this is a solvable generalization of the familiar
problem of a charge inside a spherical cavity. There are 19 three-parametric
families of finite groups formed by inversions relative to at most four
spheres, each member of each family giving a solvable problem. We solve a
sample problem which derives from the reflection group $\mathbf{D}_{4}$ and
requires 191 image charges.

economics and cognitive psychology that captures subjective decision making of
individuals under risk or uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
pricing strategy for Shared Mobility on Demand Services (SMoDSs) using a
passenger behavioral model based on CPT. This dynamic pricing strategy together
with dynamic routing via a constrained optimization algorithm that we have
developed earlier, provide a complete solution customized for SMoDS of
multi-passenger transportation. The basic principles of CPT and the derivation
of the passenger behavioral model in the SMoDS context are described in detail.
The implications of CPT on dynamic pricing of the SMoDS are delineated using
computational experiments involving passenger preferences. These implications
include interpretation of the classic fourfold pattern of risk attitudes,
strong risk aversion over mixed prospects, and behavioral preferences of self
reference. Overall, it is argued that the use of the CPT framework corresponds
to a crucial building block in designing socio-technical systems by allowing
quantification of subjective decision making under risk or uncertainty that is
perceived to be otherwise qualitative.

highly valuable, its value has also experienced a steep increase, from around 1
dollar in 2010 to around 18000 in 2017. Then, in recent years, it has attracted
considerable attention in a diverse set of fields, including economics and
computer science. The former mainly focuses on studying how it affects the
market, determining reasons behinds its price fluctuations, and predicting its
future prices. The latter mainly focuses on its vulnerabilities, scalability,
and other techno-crypto-economic issues. Here, we aim at revealing the
usefulness of traditional autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA)
model in predicting the future value of bitcoin by analyzing the price time
series in a 3-years-long time period. On the one hand, our empirical studies
reveal that this simple scheme is efficient in sub-periods in which the
behavior of the time-series is almost unchanged, especially when it is used for
short-term prediction, e.g. 1-day. On the other hand, when we try to train the
ARIMA model to a 3-years-long period, during which the bitcoin price has
experienced different behaviors, or when we try to use it for a long-term
prediction, we observe that it introduces large prediction errors. Especially,
the ARIMA model is unable to capture the sharp fluctuations in the price, e.g.
the volatility at the end of 2017. Then, it calls for more features to be
extracted and used along with the price for a more accurate prediction of the
price. We have further investigated the bitcoin price prediction using an ARIMA
model, trained over a large dataset, and a limited test window of the bitcoin
price, with length $w$, as inputs. Our study sheds lights on the interaction of
the prediction accuracy, choice of ($p,q,d$), and window size $w$.

whereas the previous models have not fulfilled such an ability. To address this
issue, we propose a bio-plausible model for estimating the image motion
velocity based on behavioural experiments of the honeybee flying through
patterned tunnels. The proposed model contains mainly three parts, the texture
estimation layer for spatial information extraction, the delay-and-correlate
layer for temporal information extraction and the decoding layer for angular
velocity estimation. This model produces responses that are largely independent
of the spatial frequency in grating experiments. And the model has been
implemented in a virtual bee for tunnel centring simulations. The results
coincide with both electro-physiological neuron spike and behavioural path
recordings, which indicates our proposed method provides a better explanation
of the honeybee's image motion detection mechanism guiding the tunnel centring
behaviour.

regulatory agencies, and health care providers. Electronic health records are
valuable sources of real world evidence to assess device safety and track
device-related patient outcomes over time. However, distilling this evidence
remains challenging, as information is fractured across clinical notes and
structured records. Modern machine learning methods for machine reading promise
to unlock increasingly complex information from text, but face barriers due to
their reliance on large and expensive hand-labeled training sets. To address
these challenges, we developed and validated state-of-the-art deep learning
methods that identify patient outcomes from clinical notes without requiring
hand-labeled training data. Using hip replacements as a test case, our methods
accurately extracted implant details and reports of complications and pain from
electronic health records with up to 96.3% precision, 98.5% recall, and 97.4%
F1, improved classification performance by 12.7- 53.0% over rule-based methods,
and detected over 6 times as many complication events compared to using
structured data alone. Using these events to assess complication-free
survivorship of different implant systems, we found significant variation
between implants, including for risk of revision surgery, which could not be
detected using coded data alone. Patients with revision surgeries had more hip
pain mentions in the post-hip replacement, pre-revision period compared to
patients with no evidence of revision surgery (mean hip pain mentions 4.97 vs.
3.23; t = 5.14; p < 0.001). Some implant models were associated with higher or
lower rates of hip pain mentions. Our methods complement existing surveillance
mechanisms by requiring orders of magnitude less hand-labeled training data,
offering a scalable solution for national medical device surveillance.

overview summarizes one component of my research: combining computer vision

the perspectives of efficacy, reliability and resiliency to formulate threat
detection as computer vision problems and develop state-of-the-art image-based
malware classification. Representing malware binary as images provides a direct
visualization of data samples, reduces the efforts for feature extraction, and
consumes the whole binary for holistic structural analysis. Employing transfer
learning of deep neural networks effective for large scale image classification
to malware classification demonstrates superior classification efficacy
compared with classical machine learning algorithms. To enhance reliability of
these vision-based malware detectors, interpretation frameworks can be
constructed on the malware visual representations and useful for extracting
faithful explanation, so that security practitioners have confidence in the
model before deployment. In cyber-security applications, we should always
assume that a malware writer constantly modifies code to bypass detection.
Addressing the resiliency of the malware detectors is equivalently important as
efficacy and reliability. Via understanding the attack surfaces of machine
learning models used for malware detection, we can greatly improve the
robustness of the algorithms to combat malware adversaries in the wild. Finally
I will discuss future research directions worth pursuing in this research

their modelling and understanding is of vital importance. In contrast to direct
acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) images of such medium, obtaining its
sub-region (s) like two-dimensional (2D) images or several small areas could be
much feasible. Therefore, reconstructing whole images from the limited
information is a primary technique in such cases. Specially, in practice the
given data cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or
partially informed, thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or
even ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study we proposed a
deep learning-based framework for reconstructing full image from its much
smaller sub-area(s). Particularly, conditional generative adversarial network
(CGAN) is utilized to learn the mapping between input (partial image) and
output (full image). To preserve the reconstruction accuracy, two simple but
effective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two
functions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Due to the inherent
essence of this ill-posed problem, a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing
reconstruction diversity, thus allowing for providing multiple candidate
outputs. Extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and demonstrated
by both visual inspection and quantitative comparison, the method is shown to
be accurate, stable yet fast ($\sim0.08s$ for a $128 \times 128$ image
reconstruction). We highlight that the proposed approach can be readily
extended, such as incorporating any user-define conditional data and an
arbitrary number of object functions into reconstruction, and being coupled
