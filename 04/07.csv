type safety and normalization for typeable programs. Our program verifier is

  Registration without Correspondences","Accepted to CVPR 2019 (Oral)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel randomized algorithm for robust point cloud
registration without correspondences. Most existing registration approaches
require a set of putative correspondences obtained by extracting invariant
descriptors. However, such descriptors could become unreliable in noisy and
contaminated settings. In these settings, methods that directly handle input
point sets are preferable. Without correspondences, however, conventional
randomized techniques require a very large number of samples in order to reach
satisfactory solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address
this problem. In particular, our work enables the use of randomized methods for
point cloud registration without the need of putative correspondences. By
considering point cloud alignment as a special instance of graph matching and
employing an efficient semi-definite relaxation, we propose a novel sampling
mechanism, in which the size of the sampled subsets can be larger-than-minimal.
Our tight relaxation scheme enables fast rejection of the outliers in the
sampled sets, resulting in high-quality hypotheses. We conduct extensive
experiments to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods. Importantly, our proposed method serves as a generic framework which
can be extended to problems with known correspondences.

The synthetic noises adopted in most previous work are pixel-independent, but
real noises are mostly spatially/channel-correlated and

we propose a novel approach to boost the performance of a real image denoiser

denoiser with mixed AWGN and Random Value Impulse Noise (RVIN). We then
investigate Pixel-shuffle Down-sampling (PD) strategy to adapt the trained

the user to tasks and goals defined by organizations, often commercial ones. It
is the point at which the structures of the user interface are defined by

the user's wants and needs that cyclically reinforce, through the actual use of
the interface, the user's own construction of her wants and needs. To alleviate

we propose Rectified Local Phase Volume (ReLPV) block, an efficient alternative
to the standard 3D convolutional layer. The ReLPV block extracts the phase in a
3D local neighborhood (e.g., 3x3x3) of each position of the input map to obtain
the feature maps. The phase is extracted by computing 3D Short Term Fourier
Transform (STFT) at multiple fixed low frequency points in the 3D local
neighborhood of each position. These feature maps at different frequency points
are then linearly combined after passing them through an activation function.
The ReLPV block provides significant parameter savings of at least, 3^3 to 13^3

of infinitely many $k$-quasi-$X$-Ramanujan graphs for a variety of infinite

conjunction with a region proposal network. Particularly, we utilize a
dynamically scaled cross entropy loss to reduce the false positive rate and
combat the sample imbalance problem associated with nodule detection. We adopt
the squeeze-and-excitation structure to learn effective image features and
utilize inter-dependency information of different feature maps. We have
validated our method based on publicly available CT scans with manually
labelled ground-truth obtained from LIDC/IDRI dataset and its subset LUNA16

power-law accelerating expansion, the time dependence of the cosmological

dominant instability of de Sitter space. We conjecture that a similar
instability does not afflict a space sourced by PBHRs. We find that the PBHR
model satisfies the upper limits on $\beta$, the fraction of the Universe's
mass in PBHs at their formation time, for a fair range of initial PBH masses.
We derive information on the present day gravitational wave background due to

we propose a structured neural architecture that reflects this dual nature of
entity evolution. The model tracks each entity recurrently, updating its hidden

The global discrete state structure is explicitly modeled with a neural CRF
over the changing hidden representation of the entity. This CRF can explicitly
capture constraints on entity states over time, enforcing that, for example, an

languages. However, to date, such systems are not precise enough when types
depend on values, which often arises when using certain Ruby libraries. For
example, the type safety of a database query in Ruby on Rails depends on the
table and column names used in the query. To address this issue, we introduce
CompRDL, a type system for Ruby that allows library method type signatures to
include type-level computations (or comp types for short). Combined with
singleton types for table and column names, comp types let us give database
query methods type signatures that compute a table's schema to yield very
precise type information. Comp types for hash, array, and string libraries can
also increase precision and thereby reduce the need for type casts. We
formalize CompRDL and prove its type system sound. Rather than type check the
bodies of library methods with comp types---those methods may include native
code or be complex---CompRDL inserts run-time checks to ensure library methods
abide by their computed types. We evaluated CompRDL by writing annotations with
type-level computations for several Ruby core libraries and database query
APIs. We then used those annotations to type check two popular Ruby libraries
and four Ruby on Rails web apps. We found the annotations were relatively
compact and could successfully type check 132 methods across our subject
programs. Moreover, the use of type-level computations allowed us to check more
expressive properties, with fewer manually inserted casts, than was possible
without type-level computations. In the process, we found two type errors and a
documentation error that were confirmed by the developers. Thus, we believe
CompRDL is an important step forward in bringing precise static type checking
to dynamic languages.

to the spin-orbit coupling the Weyl nodes originate from the splitting of
4-fold degenerate band-crossing points with Chern numbers C = $\pm$2 induced by
the crystal symmetries of WP2, which is unique among all the discovered WSMs.
Our finding also provides a guiding line to observe the chiral anomaly which
could manifest in novel transport properties.

the US, creating an unprecedented national crisis. This has been exacerbated
partly due to the lack of tools for physicians to help predict the risk of
whether a patient will develop opioid use disorder. Little is known about how
machine learning can be applied to a big-data platform to ensure an informed,
sustained and judicious prescribing of opioids, in particular for commercially
insured population. This study explores Massachusetts All Payer Claims Data, a
de-identified healthcare dataset, and proposes a machine learning framework to
examine how na\""ive users develop opioid use disorder. We perform several
feature selections techniques to identify influential demographic and clinical
features associated with opioid use disorder from a class imbalanced analytic
sample. We then compare the predictive power of four well-known machine
learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and
Gradient Boosting to predict the risk of opioid use disorder. The study results
show that the Random Forest model outperforms the other three algorithms while
determining the features, some of which are consistent with prior clinical
findings. Moreover, alongside the higher predictive accuracy, the proposed
framework is capable of extracting some risk factors that will add significant
knowledge to what is already known in the extant literature. We anticipate that
this study will help healthcare practitioners improve the current prescribing
practice of opioids and contribute to curb the increasing rate of opioid
addiction and overdose.

detecting a change in the distribution of an i.p.i.d. process. It is shown that
the Bayesian change point problem can be expressed as a problem of optimal
control of a Markov decision process (MDP) with periodic transition and cost
structures. Optimal control theory is developed for periodic MDPs for
discounted and undiscounted total cost criteria. A fixed-point equation is
obtained that is satisfied by the optimal cost function. It is shown that the
optimal policy for the MDP is nonstationary but periodic in nature. A value
iteration algorithm is obtained to compute the optimal cost function. The
results from the MDP theory are then applied to detect changes in i.p.i.d.
processes. It is shown that while the optimal change point algorithm is a
stopping rule based on a periodic sequence of thresholds, a single-threshold
policy is asymptotically optimal, as the probability of false alarm goes to
zero. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the asymptotically
optimal policy is not strictly optimal.

perfect test accuracy (99%) and extremely low false positive rate (under 0.1%),
it has been shown that even a simple adversary can evade them. A practically
useful malware classifier must be robust against evasion attacks. However,
achieving such robustness is an extremely challenging task.
  In this paper, we take the first steps towards training robust PDF malware
classifiers with verifiable robustness properties. For instance, a robustness
property can enforce that no matter how many pages from benign documents are
inserted into a PDF malware, the classifier must still classify it as
malicious. We demonstrate how the worst-case behavior of a malware classifier
with respect to specific robustness properties can be formally verified.
Furthermore, we find that training classifiers that satisfy formally verified
robustness properties can increase the evasion cost of unbounded (i.e., not
bounded by the robustness properties) attackers by eliminating simple evasion
attacks.
  Specifically, we propose a new distance metric that operates on the PDF tree
structure and specify two classes of robustness properties including subtree
insertions and deletions. We utilize state-of-the-art verifiably robust
training method to build robust PDF malware classifiers. Our results show that,
we can achieve 92.27% average verified robust accuracy over three properties,

robustness properties, our robust model maintains 7% higher robust accuracy
than all the baseline models against unrestricted whitebox attacks. Moreover,
the state-of-the-art and new adaptive evolutionary attackers need up to 10

the theorem of Fermat, the famous conjecture that $x^n + y^n = z^n$ is
impossible for nonzero integral values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, when $n > 2$. At
that time, this was an open question since nobody knew whether Fermat's
assertion was true. Euler had proved it for $n = 3$ and $n = 4$. However, no
one else had demonstrated the general case. Then Sophie Germain valiantly
entered the world of mathematics in 1804, reaching out to Gauss (writing under
the assumed name Monsieur Le Blanc) boldly stating that she could do it.
Eventually, Germain conceived a formidable plan for proving Fermat's Last
Theorem in its entirety, and in the process she obtained proofs of Case 1 for
particular families of exponents. Her efforts resulted in Sophie Germain's
Theorem that proves Case 1 of FLT for an odd prime exponent $p$ whenever $2p +
1$ is prime. Today, a prime $p$ is called a Sophie Germain prime if $2p + 1$ is
also prime. It remains an unanswered question whether there are an infinite
number of Sophie Germain primes. But there is more that Germain did in number
theory, much of which was veiled by the mathematicians with whom she shared her
work. This article provides historical details of Sophie Germain's efforts,
written with the sole intention of paying homage to the only woman
mathematician who contributed to proving the most famous assertion of Fermat.

ordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method, FSDH uses
a very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples
to the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional
SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems, with the most critical
sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using
iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC), which is time-consuming.
However, FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than
iterative hash code-solving step, which is highly efficient. Furthermore, FSDH
is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares
regression, making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example, our results
show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing
bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base, and FSDH is about 151-times faster than
FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base. Our

First, we
focus on the difference between fully interactive and sequentially interactive

sequence, but they cannot return to previously queried users. The vast majority
of existing lower bounds for local differential privacy apply only to
sequentially interactive protocols, and before this paper it was not known
whether fully interactive protocols were more powerful. We resolve this
question. First, we classify locally private protocols by their
compositionality, the multiplicative factor $k \geq 1$ by which the sum of a
protocol's single-round privacy parameters exceeds its overall privacy
guarantee. We then show how to efficiently transform any fully interactive
$k$-compositional protocol into an equivalent sequentially interactive protocol
with an $O(k)$ blowup in sample complexity. Next, we show that our reduction is
tight by exhibiting a family of problems such that for any $k$, there is a
fully interactive $k$-compositional protocol which solves the problem, while no
sequentially interactive protocol can solve the problem without at least an
$\tilde \Omega(k)$ factor more examples. We then turn our attention to
hypothesis testing problems. We show that for a large class of compound
hypothesis testing problems --- which include all simple hypothesis testing

rely on the framework of robust hybrid dynamical systems and a class of

provide a partial solution to the question: Specifically, we show that one can
achieve robust global synchronization with no purely discrete-time solutions in
any networked system whose underlying information flow topology is a rooted
acyclic digraph. Such a result is complementary to the existing result [1] in
which strongly connected digraphs are considered as the underlying information
flow topologies of the networked systems. We have further computed in the paper

effective in both reducing the ``chattering"" phenomenon and improving the

possible direction to approach the next improvement is to fully characterize
the multi-scale saliency-influential factors with a computationally-friendly
module in DCNN architectures. In this work, we proposed an end-to-end dilated
inception network (DINet) for visual saliency prediction. It captures
multi-scale contextual features effectively with very limited extra parameters.
Instead of utilizing parallel standard convolutions with different kernel sizes
as the existing inception module, our proposed dilated inception module (DIM)
uses parallel dilated convolutions with different dilation rates which can
significantly reduce the computation load while enriching the diversity of
receptive fields in feature maps. Moreover, the performance of our saliency
model is further improved by using a set of linear normalization-based
probability distribution distance metrics as loss functions. As such, we can
formulate saliency prediction as a probability distribution prediction task for
global saliency inference instead of a typical pixel-wise regression problem.
Experimental results on several challenging saliency benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our DINet with proposed loss functions can achieve
state-of-the-art performance with shorter inference time.

several complex variables. It states that for any open set $U$ of ${\mathbb
C}^k$, the following conditions are equivalent: (a) $U$ is a domain of
existence, (b) $U$ is a domain of holomorphy and (c) $U$ is holomorphically
convex. On the other hand, when $f \, (\, =(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n)\, )$ is a
$\mathbb C^n$-valued function on an open set $U$ of $\mathbb
C^{k_1}\times\mathbb C^{k_2}\times\cdots\times\mathbb C^{k_n}$, $f$ is said to
be $\mathbb C^n$-analytic, if $f$ is complex analytic and for any $i$ and $j$,
$i\not=j$ implies $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial z_j}=0$. Here,
$(z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n) \in \mathbb C^{k_1}\times\mathbb
C^{k_2}\times\cdots\times\mathbb C^{k_n}$ holds. We note that a $\mathbb
C^n$-analytic mapping and a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic manifold can be easily
defined.
  In this paper, we show an analogue of Cartan-Thullen theorem for a $\mathbb
C^n$-analytic function. For $n=1$, it gives Cartan-Thullen theorem itself. Our
proof is almost the same as Cartan-Thullen theorem. Thus, our generalization
seems to be natural. On the other hand, our result is partial, because we do
not answer the following question. That is, does a connected open $\mathbb
C^n$-holomorphically convex set $U$ exist such that $U$ is not the direct
product of any holomorphically convex sets $U_1, U_2, \cdots, U_{n-1}$ and
$U_n$ ? As a corollary of our generalization, we give the following partial
result. If $U$ is convex, then $U$ is the direct product of some
holomorphically convex sets.
  Also, $f$ is said to be $\mathbb C^n$-triangular, if $f$ is complex analytic
and for any $i$ and $j$, $i<j$ implies $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial z_j}=0$.
Kasuya suggested that a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic manifold and a $\mathbb
C^n$-triangular manifold might, for example, be related to a holomorphic web
and a holomorphic foliation.

symmetries. Furthermore, polarization-resolved measurements revealed the
underlying C2h symmetry, and thus monoclinic stacking order in CrI3 bilayers,

Usually, children learn to discriminate various objects from coarse to
fine-grained with limited supervision. Inspired by this learning process, we
propose a simple yet effective model for the Few-Shot Fine-Grained (FSFG)
recognition, which tries to tackle the challenging fine-grained recognition
task using meta-learning. The proposed method, named Pairwise Alignment
Bilinear Network (PABN), is an end-to-end deep neural network. Unlike
traditional deep bilinear networks for fine-grained classification, which adopt
the self-bilinear pooling to capture the subtle features of images, the
proposed model uses a novel pairwise bilinear pooling to compare the nuanced
differences between base images and query images for learning a deep distance
metric. In order to match base image features with query image features, we
design feature alignment losses before the proposed pairwise bilinear pooling.
Experiment results on four fine-grained classification datasets and one generic
few-shot dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both the
state-ofthe-art few-shot fine-grained and general few-shot methods.

labels that present in an image. As objects normally co-occur in an image, it
is desirable to model the label dependencies to improve the recognition
performance. To capture and explore such important dependencies, we propose a
multi-label classification model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
The model builds a directed graph over the object labels, where each node
(label) is represented by word embeddings of a label, and GCN is learned to map
this label graph into a set of inter-dependent object classifiers. These
classifiers are applied to the image descriptors extracted by another sub-net,
enabling the whole network to be end-to-end trainable. Furthermore, we propose
a novel re-weighted scheme to create an effective label correlation matrix to
guide information propagation among the nodes in GCN. Experiments on two
multi-label image recognition datasets show that our approach obviously
outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, visualization
analyses reveal that the classifiers learned by our model maintain meaningful

different fluxes, and even be topologically distinct manifolds. T-duality is a
uniquely `stringy' phenomenon, since it does not occur in a theory of point
particles, and together with other dualities has been incredibly useful in
elucidating the nature of string theory and M-theory.
  There exist various generalisations of the usual T-duality, some of which are
still putative, and none of which are fully understood. Some of these dualities
are inspired by mathematics and some are inspired by physics. These
generalisations include non-abelian T-duality, Poisson-Lie T-duality,
non-isometric T-duality, and spherical T-duality. In this thesis we review
T-duality and its various generalisations, studying the geometric, topological,

together related information so the analyst can see a bigger picture of what is

  The core ideas are to 1) detect fundamental campaign behaviors by following

what activities are expected and consistent for each individual network. We
call this approach campaign analytics because it focuses on the threat actor's
campaign goals and the intrinsic steps to achieve them. Linking different
campaign behaviors (internal reconnaissance, collection, exfiltration) reduces
false positives from business-as-usual activities and creates opportunities to
detect threats before a large exfiltration occurs. Machine learning makes it
practical to deploy this approach by reducing the amount of tuning needed.

To achieve high grounding precision, current textual grounding methods heavily

Such annotations are expensive to obtain and thus severely narrow the model's
scope of real-world applications. Moreover, most of these methods sacrifice
interpretability, generalizability, and they neglect the importance of being
resilient to counterfactual inputs. To address these issues, we propose a
visual grounding system which is 1) end-to-end trainable in a weakly supervised

into three levels: entity, semantic attribute, color information, and perform
compositional grounding progressively. We validate our model through a series

weakly/un-supervised methods and even approaches the strongly supervised ones,
but also is interpretable for decision making and performs much better in face

\cite{Li:2018} both ``from exponential to phase-type"" service times and ``from

to various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial random
factors, for example, the mining processes, the block-generations, the

\cite{Li:2018}, analysis of the transaction-confirmation time becomes very
difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To
overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first
passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the
$RG$-factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in

  worlds",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider online algorithms under both the competitive ratio criteria and
the regret minimization one. Our main goal is to build a unified methodology
that would be able to guarantee both criteria simultaneously.
  For a general class of online algorithms, namely any Metrical Task System
(MTS), we show that one can simultaneously guarantee the best known competitive
ratio and a natural regret bound. For the paging problem we further show an
efficient online algorithm (polynomial in the number of pages) with this
guarantee.
  To this end, we extend an existing regret minimization algorithm
(specifically, Kapralov and Panigrahy) to handle movement cost (the cost of
switching between states of the online system). We then show how to use the
extended regret minimization algorithm to combine multiple online algorithms.
Our end result is an online algorithm that can combine a ""base"" online
algorithm, having a guaranteed competitive ratio, with a range of online
algorithms that guarantee a small regret over any interval of time. The
combined algorithm guarantees both that the competitive ratio matches that of
the base algorithm and a low regret over any time interval.
  As a by product, we obtain an expert algorithm with close to optimal regret
bound on every time interval, even in the presence of switching costs. This
result is of independent interest.

  Learning for Epileptic Seizure Prediction",,,,,"cs.NE q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and reliable
epileptic seizure prediction system using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data,
especially for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. The prediction procedure
should yield accurate results in a fast enough fashion to alert patients of
impending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to
obtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic
seizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the
data size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format
that can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we
propose a seizure prediction algorithm that uses cooperative multi-scale CNNs
for automatic feature learning of iEEG data. Results: 1) iEEG channels contain
complementary information and excluding individual channels is not advisable to
retain the spatial information needed for accurate prediction of epileptic
seizures. 2) The traditional PCA is not a reliable method for iEEG data
reduction in seizure prediction. 3) Hand-crafted iEEG features may not be
suitable for reliable seizure prediction performance as the iEEG data varies
between patients and over time for the same patient. 4) Seizure prediction
results show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods by achieving an
average sensitivity of 87.85% and AUC score of 0.84. Conclusion: Understanding
how the human brain behaves before seizure attacks and far from them
facilitates better designs of epileptic seizure predictors. Significance:
Accurate seizure prediction algorithms can warn patients about the next seizure
attack so they could avoid dangerous activities. Medications could then be
administered to abort the impending seizure and minimize the risk of injury.

the lack of Galilean invariance and considerable numerical errors in many cases

model eliminates the error terms and therefore improves the numerical accuracy
and enhances the Galilean invariance. To validate the proposed model, numerical
simulation are performed. First, the test of a moving droplet in a uniform flow
field is employed to verify the Galilean invariance of the improved model.
Subsequently, numerical simulations are carried out for the layered two-phase
flow and three-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instability. It is shown that, using
the improved model, the numerical accuracy can be significantly improved in
comparison with the color-gradient LB model without the improvements. Finally,
the capability of the improved color-gradient LB model for simulating dynamic
multiphase flows at a relatively large density ratio is demonstrated via the

widely used in many applications such as image retrieval and face recognition.
In this paper, we propose to use network distillation to efficiently compute
image embeddings with small networks. Network distillation has been
successfully applied to improve image classification, but has hardly been
explored for metric learning. To do so, we propose two new loss functions that
model the communication of a deep teacher network to a small student network.
We evaluate our system in several datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Cars-196,
Stanford Online Products and show that embeddings computed using small student
networks perform significantly better than those computed using standard
networks of similar size. Results on a very compact network (MobileNet-0.25),
which can be used on mobile devices, show that the proposed method can greatly
improve Recall@1 results from 27.5\% to 44.6\%. Furthermore, we investigate
various aspects of distillation for embeddings, including hint and attention
layers, semi-supervised learning and cross quality distillation. (Code is

electrical processes. Here we ask: to what extent can the course of
morphogenesis be modulated and controlled by an external electric field? We
show that above a critical amplitude, an external electric field can halt
morphogenesis in Hydra regeneration. Moreover, above this critical amplitude,
the electric field can even lead to reversal dynamics: a fully developed Hydra
folds back into its incipient spheroid morphology. The potential to renew
morphogenesis is re-exposed when the field is reduced back to amplitudes below
criticality. These dynamics are accompanied by modulations of the Wnt3
activity, a central component of the head organizer in Hydra. Reversal of
morphogenesis is shown to be triggered by enhanced epithelial electrical
excitations, accompanied by intensified calcium activity, indicating that
electrical processes play an instructive role to a level that can direct
developmental trajectories. Reversal of morphogenesis by external fields, calls
for extending its framework beyond programmatic, forward-driven, hierarchical
processes.

random mini-batches sampled uniformly from the entire training data. In this
work, we analyze the effect of curriculum learning, which involves the
non-uniform sampling of mini-batches, on the training of deep networks, and
specifically CNNs trained for image recognition. To employ curriculum learning,
the training algorithm must resolve 2 problems: (i) sort the training examples
by difficulty; (ii) compute a series of mini-batches that exhibit an increasing
level of difficulty. We address challenge (i) using two methods: transfer
learning from some competitive ``teacher"" network, and bootstrapping. In our
empirical evaluation, both methods show similar benefits in terms of increased
learning speed and improved final performance on test data. We address
challenge (ii) by investigating different pacing functions to guide the
sampling. The empirical investigation includes a variety of network
architectures, using images from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and subsets of ImageNet.
We conclude with a novel theoretical analysis of curriculum learning, where we
show how it effectively modifies the optimization landscape. We then define the
concept of an ideal curriculum, and show that under mild conditions it does not
change the corresponding global minimum of the optimization function.

accreted material. One of the most prominent time scales is the strong
pulsation, i.e., the rotation period of the neutron star itself. Over one
rotation, our view of the accretion column and the X-ray producing region
changes significantly. This allows us to sample different physical conditions

viewing-angle-resolved models to properly describe them. In wind-fed high-mass
X-ray binaries, the main source of aperiodic variability is the clumpy stellar
wind, which leads to changes in the accretion rate (i.e., luminosity) as well

accretion column as a function of luminosity, as well as to investigate the
structure and physical properties of the wind, which we can compare to winds in

relations among people from both interactions and encode the relation feature
from the importance relations. In this way, POINT automatically learns several

practically no compromises in predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address
two critical gaps concerning the usage and understanding of VB for MMNL. First,
extant VB methods are limited to utility specifications involving only
individual-specific taste parameters. Second, the finite-sample properties of
VB estimators and the relative performance of VB, MCMC and maximum simulated

extends several VB methods for MMNL to admit utility specifications including
both fixed and random utility parameters. To address the latter, we conduct an
extensive simulation-based evaluation to benchmark the extended VB methods
against MCMC and MSLE in terms of estimation times, parameter recovery and
predictive accuracy. The results suggest that all VB variants with the
exception of the ones relying on an alternative variational lower bound
constructed with the help of the modified Jensen's inequality perform as well
as MCMC and MSLE at prediction and parameter recovery. In particular, VB with
nonconjugate variational message passing and the delta-method (VB-NCVMP-Delta)
is up to 16 times faster than MCMC and MSLE. Thus, VB-NCVMP-Delta can be an
attractive alternative to MCMC and MSLE for fast, scalable and accurate

technologies, which can be embedded at the core of CMOS, and which could be
ideal for the in-memory implementation of deep neural networks. A particularly
exciting vision is using them for implementing Binarized Neural Networks
(BNNs), a class of deep neural networks with a highly reduced memory footprint.
The challenge of resistive memory, however, is that they are prone to device
variation, which can lead to bit errors. In this work we show that BNNs can
tolerate these bit errors to an outstanding level, through simulations of
networks on the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks. If a standard BNN is used, up to 10^-4
bit error rate can be tolerated with little impact on recognition performance
on both MNIST and CIFAR10. We then show that by adapting the training procedure
to the fact that the BNN will be operated on error-prone hardware, this
tolerance can be extended to a bit error rate of 4x10^-2. The requirements for
RRAM are therefore a lot less stringent for BNNs than more traditional
applications. We show, based on experimental measurements on a RRAM HfO2
technology, that this result can allow reduce RRAM programming energy by a
factor 30.

  Systems",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-speed and high-acceleration movements are inherently hard to control.
Applying learning to the control of such motions on anthropomorphic robot arms
can improve the accuracy of the control but might damage the system. The
inherent exploration of learning approaches can lead to instabilities and the
robot reaching joint limits at high speeds. Having hardware that enables safe
exploration of high-speed and high-acceleration movements is therefore
desirable. To address this issue, we propose to use robots actuated by
Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs). In this paper, we present a four degrees
of freedom (DoFs) robot arm that reaches high joint angle accelerations of up
to 28000 deg/s^2 while avoiding dangerous joint limits thanks to the
antagonistic actuation and limits on the air pressure ranges. With this robot
arm, we are able to tune control parameters using Bayesian optimization
directly on the hardware without additional safety considerations. The achieved
tracking performance on a fast trajectory exceeds previous results on
comparable PAM-driven robots. We also show that our system can be controlled
well on slow trajectories with PID controllers due to careful construction
considerations such as minimal bending of cables, lightweight kinematics and
minimal contact between PAMs and PAMs with the links. Finally, we propose a
novel technique to control the the co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs.
Experimental results illustrate that choosing the optimal co-contraction level
is vital to reach better tracking performance. Through the use of PAM-driven
robots and learning, we do a small step towards the future development of
robots capable of more human-like motions.

a model that assume electrons are confined to a spherical potential well and
the clusters are made of some basic units. A formula is given for the lowest

we introduce the Sparse Identification of Truncation Errors (SITE) framework to
automatically identify the terms of the modified differential equation from
simulation data. We build on recent advances in the field of data-driven
discovery and control of complex systems and combine it with classical work on
modified differential equation analysis of Warming, Hyett, Lerat and Peyret. We
augment a sparse regression-rooted approach with appropriate preconditioning
routines to aid in the identification of the individual modified differential
equation terms. The construction of such a custom algorithm pipeline allows
attenuating of multicollinearity effects as well as automatic tuning of the
sparse regression hyperparameters using the Bayesian information criterion
(BIC). As proof of concept, we constrain the analysis to finite difference
schemes and leave other numerical schemes open for future inquiry. Test cases
include the linear advection equation with a forward-time, backward-space
discretization, the Burgers' equation with a MacCormack predictor-corrector
scheme and the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a Zabusky and Kruska
discretization scheme. Based on variation studies, we derive guidelines for the
selection of discretization parameters, preconditioning approaches and sparse

how superconductivity and CDW are interrelated through electron-phonon coupling
(EPC), which is important to the understanding of 2-dimensional
superconductivity. This work investigates the superconductivity of monolayer
NbSe2 in CDW phase using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism based on

coexistence of the superconductivity and CDW is studied in detail by analyzing
EPC. It is found that the intra-pocket scattering is related to
superconductivity, leading to almost constant value of superconducting gaps on
parts of the Fermi surface. The inter-pocket scattering is found to be
responsible for CDW, leading to partial or full bandgap on the remaining Fermi
surface. Recent experiment indicates that there is transitioning from regular
superconductivity in thin-film NbSe2 to two-gap superconductivity in the bulk,
which is shown here to have its origin in the extent of Fermi surface gapping
of K and K' pockets induced by CDW. Overall blue shifts of the phonons and
sharp decrease of Eliashberg spectrum are found when the CDW forms.

composed of an autoencoder with residual block-embedded skip connections, is
designed to transfer feature maps of stylized images to the feature maps of the

output aligned realistic face images. To ensure the identity preservation, we
promote the recovered and ground truth faces to share similar visual features
via a distance measure which compares features of recovered and ground truth

faces to be similar to authentic faces. Thus, we can recover high-quality
photorealistic faces from unaligned portraits while preserving the identity of
the face in an image. By conducting extensive evaluations on a large-scale

actin filaments or microtubules, all employ flexible filaments moving in

filament-driven propulsion in the asymptotic limit of stiff filaments. Motion
in the rigid limit leads to hydrodynamic loads which deform the filament and
impact the filament propulsion. We first derive the general mathematical
formulation and then apply it to the case of a helical filament, a situation

artificial, magnetically actuated motors. We find that, as a result of

  Features","12",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The cursive nature of multilingual characters segmentation and recognition of
Arabic, Persian, Urdu languages have attracted researchers from academia and
industry. However, despite several decades of research, still multilingual
characters classification accuracy is not up to the mark. This paper presents
an automated approach for multilingual characters segmentation and recognition.
The proposed methodology explores character based on their geometric features.
However, due to uncertainty and without dictionary support few characters are
over-divided. To expand the productivity of the proposed methodology a BPN is
prepared with countless division focuses for cursive multilingual characters.
Prepared BPN separates off base portioned indicates effectively with rapid
upgrade character acknowledgment precision. For reasonable examination, only
benchmark dataset is utilized.

  linear predictor without intercept","18 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables",,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gamma model is a generalized linear model for gamma-distributed outcomes.
The model is widely applied in psychology, ecology or medicine. In this paper
we focus on gamma models having a linear predictor without intercept. For a
specific scenario sets of locally D- and A-optimal designs are to be developed.
Recently, Gaffke et al. (2018) established a complete class and an essentially
complete class of designs for gamma models to obtain locally D-optimal designs.
However to extend this approach to gamma model without an intercept term is
complicated. To solve that further techniques have to be developed in the
current work. Further, by a suitable transformation between gamma models with
and without intercept optimality results may be transferred from one model to
the other. Additionally by means of The General Equivalence Theorem optimality
can be characterized for multiple regression by a system of polynomial
inequalities which can be solved analytically or by computer algebra. By this
necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameter values can be obtained for
the local D-optimality of particular designs. The robustness of the derived
designs with respect to misspecifications of the initial parameter values is
examined by means of their local D-efficiencies.

the hybrid of two-positon and two-positon solutions, and (3) the hybrid of
one-soliton and three-positon solutions are presented and their rather
complicated dynamics are revealed.

  Cursive Script","15 Pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precise character segmentation is the only solution towards higher Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) accuracy. In cursive script, overlapped characters
are serious issue in the process of character segmentations as characters are
deprived from their discriminative parts using conventional linear segmentation
strategy. Hence, non-linear segmentation is an utmost need to avoid loss of
characters parts and to enhance character/script recognition accuracy. This
paper presents an improved approach for non-linear segmentation of the
overlapped characters in handwritten roman script. The proposed technique is
composed of a sequence of heuristic rules based on geometrical features of
characters to locate possible non-linear character boundaries in a cursive
script word. However, to enhance efficiency, heuristic approach is integrated
with trained ensemble neural network validation strategy for verification of
character boundaries. Accordingly, correct boundaries are retained and
incorrect are removed based on ensemble neural networks vote. Finally, based on
verified valid segmentation points, characters are segmented non-linearly. For
fair comparison CEDAR benchmark database is experimented. The experimental
results are much better than conventional linear character segmentation
techniques reported in the state of art. Ensemble neural network play vital
role to enhance character segmentation accuracy as compared to individual
neural networks.
