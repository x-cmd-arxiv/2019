the generalization of the Wiedemann-Franz law (WF) to optimize the
dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. This is done by optimizing the
Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity.
In the calculation of the thermal conductivity, both electronic and phononic

This is done by training a neural network to generate samples from the data
distribution using a recent deep learning technique called generative
adversarial networks. By emulating the data generating process, the relevant
statistics of the data are replicated. The method is assessed in subsurface
flow problems, where effective parametrization of underground properties such
as permeability is important due to the high dimensionality and presence of
high spatial correlations. We experiment with realizations of binary
channelized subsurface permeability and perform uncertainty quantification and
parameter estimation. Results show that the parametrization using generative

high order statistics of the flow responses, while achieving a dimensionality
reduction of two orders of magnitude.

  Energy-Transportation- Communication Infrastructure in Smart and Connected
  Communities",,,,,"cs.SY cs.CE cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Infrastructure in future smart and connected communities is envisioned as an
aggregate of public services, including the energy, transportation and
communication systems, all intertwined with each other. The intrinsic
interdependency among these systems may exert underlying influence on both
design and operation of the heterogeneous infrastructures. However, few prior
studies have tapped into the interdependency among the three systems in order
to quantify their potential impacts during standard operation. In response to
this, this paper proposes an open source, flexible, integrated modeling
framework suitable for designing coupled energy, transportation, and
communication systems and for assessing the impact of their interdependencies.
First, a novel multi-level, multi-layer, multi-agent approach is proposed to
enable flexible modeling of the interconnected energy, transportation, and
communication systems. Then, for the framework's proof-of-concept, preliminary
component and system-level models for different systems are designed and
implemented using Modelica, an equation-based object-oriented modeling
language. Finally, three case studies of gradually increasing complexity are
presented (energy, energy + transportation, energy + transportation +
communication) to evaluate the interdependencies among the three systems.
Quantitative analyses show that the deviation of the average velocity on the
road can be 10.5\% and the deviation of the power draw from the grid can be 7\%
with or without considering the transportation and communication system at the
peak commute time, indicating the presence of notable interdependencies. The
proposed modeling framework also has the potential to be further extended for
various modeling purposes and use cases, such as dynamic modeling and
optimization, resilience analysis, and integrated decision making in future
connected communities.

more slowly than was previously reported. A possible lightcurve asymmetry
suggests a double-peaked period of P = 22.8266$\pm$0.0001~h. A small
peak-to-peak lightcurve amplitude in R-filter A = 0.032$\pm$0.005 mag implies
an almost spherical shape or near pole-on orientation. We also measured BVRI
colours and the R-filter phase-angle slope and revised the absolute magnitudes.

support vector machines which is able to produce sparse solutions by linearly
weighting a small number of basis functions instead using all of them.
Regardless of a few merits of RVM such as giving probabilistic predictions and
relax of parameter tuning, it has poor prediction for test instances that are
far away from the relevance vectors. As a solution, we propose a new
combination of RVM and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule which resolves this issue
with regionally dealing with every test instance. In our settings, we obtain
the relevance vectors for each test instance in the local area given by k-NN
rule. In this way, relevance vectors are closer and more relevant to the test
instance which results in a more accurate model. This can be seen as a
piece-wise learner which locally classifies test instances. The model is hence
called localized relevance vector machine (LRVM). The LRVM is examined on
several datasets of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository.
Results supported by statistical tests indicate that the performance of LRVM is
competitive as compared with a few state-of-the-art classifiers.

increasing periods but for V1 and V2 the rate of period increase does not
appear to be constant over the 118 years of observation. The observed rates of
period increase are in good agreement with the predictions of the Pisa
theoretical models with helium abundance $Y = 0.25$. Theory suggests V1 and V6
have masses of $\sim0.57\,M_\odot$ and are in the redward-evolving final stage
of the ``blue loop'' evolutionary phase that is produced when helium-shell
ignition occurs. The larger period and period change rate for V2 indicate it
has a mass of $\sim0.52\,M_\odot$. A study of eighteen metal-poor BL Her stars
shows the observed period changes for such objects in general can be reasonably
well explained using the predictions from horizontal branch evolutionary
tracks. BL Her stars with periods less than $\sim$3 d and relatively large
secular period change rates ($dP/dt\approx5-15$ d/Myr) are in the evolutionary
stage before He-shell ignition; the remaining cases are stars that have already
experienced He-shell ignition. Moreover, an analysis of crossing time through

paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for

annotations and updating the parameters of our designed multispectral
pedestrian detector on target domain. Pseudo annotations are generated using
the detector trained on source domain, and then updated by fixing the
parameters of detector and minimizing the cross entropy loss without
back-propagation. Training labels are generated using the pseudo annotations by
considering the characteristics of similarity and complementarity between
well-aligned visible and infrared image pairs. The parameters of detector are
updated using the generated labels by minimizing our defined multi-detection
loss function with back-propagation. The optimal parameters of detector can be
obtained after iteratively updating the pseudo annotations and parameters.
Experimental results show that our proposed unsupervised multimodal domain

galaxies (BCS40 sample). The sample was selected from the Swift/BAT nine month
catalog. We use high angular resolution nuclear infrared (IR) photometry and
N-band spectroscopy, the CLUMPY torus models and a Bayesian tool to
characterize the properties of the nuclear dust. In the case of the Sy1s we
estimate the accretion disk contribution to the subarcsecond resolution nuclear
IR SEDs (~0.4'') which is, on average, 46+-28, 23+-13 and 11+-5% in the J-, H-
and K-bands, respectively. This indicates that the accretion disk templates
that assume a steep fall for longer wavelengths than 1 micron might
underestimate its contribution to the near-IR emission. Using both optical
(broad vs narrow lines) and X-ray (unabsorbed vs absorbed) classifications, we
compare the global posterior distribution of the torus model parameters. We
confirm that Sy2s have larger values of the torus covering factor (CT~0.95)
than Sy1s (CT~0.65) in our volume-limited Seyfert sample. These findings are
independent of whether we use an optical or X-ray classification. We find that
the torus covering factor remains essentially constant within the errors in our
luminosity range and there is no clear dependence with the Eddington ratio.
Finally, we find tentative evidence that even an ultra hard X-ray selection is
missing a significant fraction of highly absorbed type 2 sources with very high
covering factor tori.

provides ease of multithreading to the programmer without worrying about
concurrency issues such as deadlock, livelock, priority inversion, etc. Most of
the STMs works on read-write operations known as RWSTMs. Some STMs work at
high-level operations and ensure greater concurrency than RWSTMs. Such STMs are
known as Object-Based STMs (OSTMs). The transactions of OSTMs can return commit
or abort. Aborted OSTMs transactions retry. But in the current setting of
OSTMs, transactions may starve. So, we proposed a Starvation-Free OSTM

This paper applies the theory of sequential testing to design a statistical

testing procedure can be expected to work in practice. We find that, if
emissions are reported faithfully, the test is correctly sized, while, if
emissions are under-reported, detection time can be sufficiently fast to help
inform the $5$ yearly global ""stocktake"" of the Paris Agreement. We recommend

realistic tool for surgical training, a commercial simulator was augmented by
flexible patient-specific mitral valve replica. In an elaborated production
pipeline, finalized after many optimization cycles, models were segmented from
3D ultrasound and then 3D-printable molds were computed automatically and
printed in rigid material, the lower part being water-soluble. After silicone
injection, the silicone model was dissolved from the mold and anchored in the

manufactured. A material test revealed that Ecoflex\textsuperscript{TM} 00-30

Although there are simple ways to check about leverage points in independent

extend these ideas to models for dependent data and with non-normal probability
distributions such as time series, spatial models and generalized linear
models. We also propose a strategy to rescale the functional Bregman divergence

This is accomplished with a minimal computational effort and maintaining all
theoretical properties. For computational efficiency, we take advantage of
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to draw samples from the posterior distribution

dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. The main idea behind the method is
to treat each bead as a dumb-bell, i.e. two sub-beads (the sub-beads can bear
charges) kept at a fixed distance, instead of a point-like particle. It was
shown that at small enough separations the composite beads act essentially as
conventional point-like beads. Next, the relation between the bead dipole
moment and the bulk dielectric permittivity was obtained. The interaction of
single charges in polar liquid showed that the observed dielectric permittivity
is somewhat smaller than that obtained for the bulk case at large separation
between the charges; at distances comparable to the bead size the solvation
shells of the charges start to interfere and oscillations in the observed
permittivity occur. Such oriented molecules effectively have smaller
polarizability compared to the bulk liquid, so the field of one charge in the
vicinity of another charge is reduced not as strong as in the bulk. Finally, we
showed why it is necessary to treat the polar species in DPD explicitly instead
of implicitly by calculating the local polarizability based on the local
species concentrations: the latter leads to the violation of the Newton's third
law resulting in simulation artifacts. We investigated the behavior of a
charged colloidal particle at an interface of polar and non-polar liquids. We
obtained that when the polar molecules are treated explicitly, the charged
colloidal particle moved into the polar liquid since it is energetically more
favorable for the charged molecules to be immersed in a polar medium; however,
within the ""implicit polarity"" method the colloidal particle is found on top of
a ""bump"" formed by the molecules of the non-polar liquid, which increases the
interface area between the liquids instead of decreasing it.

develop an unsupervised transfer learning algorithm based on a multivariate

adjusting to sleep pattern shift by training on dynamics of sleep/wake states.
The proposed algorithm operates, without requiring a priori information about
true sleep/wake states, by establishing an initial training set with hidden
Markov model and leveraging a taper window mechanism to learn the sleep pattern
in an incremental fashion. Our domain-adaptation algorithm is applied to a
dataset collected in a human viral challenge study to identify sleep/wake
periods of both uninfected and infected participants. Results: The algorithm
successfully detects sleep/wake sessions in subjects whose sleep patterns are
disrupted by respiratory infection (H3N2 flu virus). Pre-symptomatic features
based on the detected periods are found to be strongly predictive of both
infection status (AUC = 0.844) and infection onset time (AUC = 0.885),

1.5--4 years, the so-called quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs), in addition to
the well-known 11-year Schwabe cycles. Solar dynamo is thought to be the
responsible mechanism for generation of the QBOs.
  Aims: In this work, we analyse sunspot areas to investigate the spatial and
temporal behaviour of the QBO signal and study the responsible physical
mechanisms using simulations from fully nonlinear mean-field flux-transport
dynamos.
  Methods: We investigated the behaviour of the QBOs in the sunspot area data
in full disk, and northern and southern hemispheres, using wavelet and Fourier
analyses. We also ran solar dynamos with two different approaches to generating
a poloidal field from an existing toroidal field, Babcock-Leighton and
turbulent $\alpha$ mechanisms. We then studied the simulated magnetic field
strengths as well as meridional circulation and differential rotation rates
using the same methods.
  Results: The results from the sunspot areas show that the QBOs are present in
the full disk and hemispheric sunspot areas and they show slightly different
spatial and temporal behaviours, indicating a slightly decoupled solar
hemispheres. The QBO signal is generally intermittent and in-phase with the
sunspot area data, surfacing when the solar activity is in maximum. The results
from the BL-dynamos showed that they are neither capable of generating the
slightly decoupled behaviour of solar hemispheres nor can they generate
QBO-like signals. The turbulent $\alpha$-dynamos, on the other hand, generated
decoupled hemispheres and some QBO-like shorter cycles.
  Conclusions: In conclusion, our simulations show that the turbulent
$\alpha$-dynamos with the Lorentz force seems more efficient in generating the
observed temporal and spatial behaviour of the QBO signal compared with those
from the BL-dynamos.

explained using classic expressions and with no fitting parameters. However
when the electrodes are separated by a film of electrolyte, an alternating

Furthermore, the approach to steady state in electrolyte takes place over

nuclei during the r-process nucleosynthesis occurring in neutron-star mergers.
Abundance patterns and rates of nuclear energy production are obtained for
different ejecta conditions using three sets of stellar reaction rates, one of
which is based on microscopic and consistent calculations of nuclear masses,
fission barriers, and collective inertias. We show that the accumulation of
fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron
abundance after the r-process freeze-out. This leads to a significant impact on
the abundances of heavy nuclei that undergo $\alpha$ decay or spontaneous
fission, affecting the radioactive energy production by the ejecta at
timescales relevant for kilonova emission.

the use of psychophysics, are important clues to the internal workings of
visual recognition. For instance, measured reaction time can indicate whether a
visual stimulus is easy for a subject to recognize, or whether it is hard. In
this paper, we consider how to incorporate psychophysical measurements of
visual perception into the loss function of a deep neural network being trained
for a recognition task, under the assumption that such information can enforce
consistency with human behavior. As a case study to assess the viability of
this approach, we look at the problem of handwritten document transcription.
While good progress has been made towards automatically transcribing modern
handwriting, significant challenges remain in transcribing historical
documents. Here we describe a general enhancement strategy, underpinned by the
new loss formulation, which can be applied to the training regime of any deep
learning-based document transcription system. Through experimentation, reliable
performance improvement is demonstrated for the standard IAM and RIMES datasets
for three different network architectures. Further, we go on to show
feasibility for our approach on a new dataset of digitized Latin manuscripts,
originally produced by scribes in the Cloister of St. Gall in the the 9th
century.

detecting whether an $n$ node host graph contains a not necessarily induced
copy of $H$ requires at least the time for detecting whether an $n$ node graph
contains a $k$-clique. The previous result of this nature required that $H$
contains a $k$-clique which is disjoint from all other $k$-cliques of $H$.
  * We show that if the famous Hadwiger conjecture from graph theory is true,
then detecting whether an $n$ node host graph contains a not necessarily
induced copy of a pattern with chromatic number $t$ requires at least the time
for detecting whether an $n$ node graph contains a $t$-clique. This implies
that: (1) under Hadwiger's conjecture for every $k$-node pattern $H$, finding
an induced copy of $H$ requires at least the time of $\sqrt k$-clique
detection, and at least size $\omega(n^{\sqrt{k}/4})$ for any constant depth
circuit, and (2) unconditionally, detecting an induced copy of a random

highly-sophisticated neural network architectures. In particular, so-called
adversarial examples, constructed from perturbations of input data that are
small or imperceptible to humans but lead to different predictions, may lead to
an enormous risk in certain critical applications. In light of this, there has
been a great deal of work on developing adversarial training strategies to
improve model robustness. These training strategies are very expensive, in both
human and computational time. To complement these approaches, we propose a very
simple and inexpensive strategy which can be used to ``retrofit'' a
previously-trained network to improve its resilience to adversarial attacks.
More concretely, we propose a new activation function---the JumpReLU---which,
when used in place of a ReLU in an already-trained model, leads to a trade-off
between predictive accuracy and robustness. This trade-off is controlled by the
jump size, a hyper-parameter which can be tuned during the validation stage.
Our empirical results demonstrate that this increases model robustness,

  presentation",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve impressive performance in a wide
variety of fields. Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep
CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to
properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge,
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean
data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show
promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to
the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models
are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to
successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs,
specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting
them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of
these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very
deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7% mIoU
over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation. We
believe that the community can greatly benefit from this work, as it opens up
many opportunities for advancing GCN-based research.

for both frequency and DOA estimation based on Diophantine equation, which is
essentially to estimate the autocorrelation with higher order statistics
instead of the second order one. We prove that, given arbitrarily high
down-sampling rates, there exist sampling schemes with samples to estimate
autocorrelation only proportional to the sum of degrees of freedom (DOF) and
the number of snapshots required. In the scenario of DOA estimation, we show

Additional assumptions combine with this theorem to give simple

  Important aspects of quantum and classical thermodynamics and of query

the same class of Jordan-algebraic convex sets by Barnum, Mueller, and Ududec

fraction of lost customer requests due to vehicle unavailability and the
fraction of time when vehicles drive empty during load balancing operations. In
order to bypass the intractability of a globally optimal solution to this
stochastic dynamic optimization problem, we propose a parametric
threshold-based control driven by the known relative abundance of vehicles

optimization problem for which one often resorts to trial-and-error methods
where multiple sample paths are generated through simulation or from actual

concurrent estimation methods to simultaneously construct many sample paths

type of solution, similarly to neutron stars described by a polytropic
equations of state. The highest increase of the maximum mass (compared to the
value for a non-rotating star) is obtained for models with a low degree of
differential rotation. This highest mass is over four times larger than that of
the equivalent non rotating configuration. Comparing our results with
calculations done for realistic models of neutron stars, we conclude that with
the help of differential rotation, strange stars can sustain masses much larger
than stars made from nuclear matter for low degree of differential rotation

absence of imaginary frequency in phonon spectra. Then, kinetically, we
identify the atomistic pathways for a preferred 2D growth mode over 3D growth,
and reveal a growth transition from 2D compact islands to h-borophene at
~13-atom cluster size, indicating the feasibility of epitaxial growth of
h-borophene on Mg2O. The h-borophene is found to be stabilized by nearly one
electron transfer from Mg2O to h-borophene based on the Bader charge analysis.
Moreover, the intrinsic band structure of the free-standing h-borophene is only
weakly perturbed by the Mg2O substrate, a significant advantage over metal
substrate. We envision that layered electrides provide an attractive family of
substrates for epitaxial growth of a range of 2D materials that can otherwise
only be grown on undesirable metal substrates.

matrix reduction, this algorithm is a cornerstone of the emergent area of
topological data analysis. Its input is a simplicial filtration defined over
the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ giving rise to a $1$-parameter persistence module. It
has been recognized that multiparameter version of persistence modules given by
simplicial filtrations over $d$-dimensional integer grids $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is
equally or perhaps more important in data science applications. However, in the
multiparameter setting, one of the main challenges is that topological
summaries based on algebraic structure such as decompositions and bottleneck
distances cannot be as efficiently computed as in the $1$-parameter case
because there is no known extension of the persistence algorithm to
multiparameter persistence modules. We present an efficient algorithm to
compute the unique decomposition of a finitely presented persistence module $M$
defined over the multiparameter $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The algorithm first assumes
that the module is presented with a set of $N$ generators and relations that
are \emph{distinctly graded}. Based on a generalized matrix reduction technique
it runs in $O(N^{2\omega+1})$ time where $\omega<2.373$ is the exponent for
matrix multiplication. This is much better than the well known algorithm called
Meataxe which runs in $\tilde{O}(N^{6(d+1)})$ time on such an input. In
practice, persistence modules are usually induced by simplicial filtrations.
With such an input consisting of $n$ simplices, our algorithm runs in

literature based on numerical approximation, $\mu_{\text{num}}\simeq3.627$.
Remarkably, this numerical result for the critical exponent, $\beta$, can be
analytically approximated (within only $0.028\%$) leading to the closed-form
expression for the scaling exponent
$\mu\simeq2+\varphi=2+1.618\ldots\simeq3.618$, where
$\varphi\triangleq(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the ubiquitous golden ratio. As the
ultimate achievable scaling exponent is quadratic, this implies that the
penalty for polar codes in BEC, in terms of the scaling exponent, can be very
well estimated by the golden ratio, $\varphi$, itself.

profile of equilibrium simulated dark matter halos, $\rho(r)/\sigma^3(r)$, is
well described by a power law over 3 decades in radius, even though both the
density $\rho(r)$, and the velocity dispersion $\sigma(r)$ deviate
significantly from power laws. The origin of this scale-free behavior is not
understood. It could be an inherent property of self-gravitating collisionless
systems, or it could be a mere coincidence. To address the question we work
with equilibrium halos, and more specifically, the second derivative of the
Jeans equation, which, under the assumptions of (i) Einasto density profile,
(ii) linear velocity anisotropy - density slope relation, and (iii)
$\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-\alpha}$, can be transformed from a differential
equation to a cubic algebraic equation. Relations (i)-(iii) are all observed in
numerical simulations, and are well parametrized by a total of 4 or 6 model
parameters. We do not consider dynamical evolution of halos; instead, taking
advantage of the fact that the algebraic Jeans equation for equilibrium halos
puts relations (i)-(iii) on the same footing, we study the (approximate)
solutions of this equation in the 4 and 6 dimensional spaces. We argue that the
distribution of best solutions in these parameter spaces is inconsistent with
$\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-\alpha}$ being an fundamental property of
gravitational evolution, and conclude that the scale-free nature of this
quantity is likely to be a fluke.

its significance and validity in the field. However, while customers and
products aggregate into interacted clusters, state-of-the-art model-based 1-bit
recommender systems do not take the consideration of grouping bias. To tackle
the gap, this paper introduced Group-Specific 1-bit Matrix Completion (GS1MC)
by first-time consolidating group-specific effects into 1-bit recommender
systems under the low-rank latent variable framework. Additionally, to empower
GS1MC even when grouping information is unobtainable, Cluster Developing Matrix
Completion (CDMC) was proposed by integrating the sparse subspace clustering
technique into GS1MC. Namely, CDMC allows clustering users/items and to
leverage their group effects into matrix completion at the same time.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that GS1MC outperforms the
current 1-bit matrix completion methods. Meanwhile, it is compelling that CDMC
can successfully capture items' genre features only based on sparse binary
user-item interactive data. Notably, GS1MC provides a new insight to
incorporate and evaluate the efficacy of clustering methods while CDMC can be
served as a new tool to explore unrevealed social behavior or market

initially Salpeter stellar remnant distribution, and model the binary
population by evolving synthesized binary remnant distributions, published
before LIGO's first measurements. We find that a GEODE produced between $20

amplified by $\sim 20-140\times$. This can relieve tension between
accretion-only growth models and the inferred masses of BHs in quasars at $z
\gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that merger rates of GEODE binaries increase by a
factor of $\sim 2\times$ relative to classical BHs. The resulting GEODE mass
function is consistent with the most recent LIGO constraints at $< 0.5\sigma$.
In contrast, a Salpeter stellar distribution that evolves into classical
remnants is in tension at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. This agreement occurs without
low-metallicity regions, abnormally massive progenitor stars, novel formation
channels, or primordial object formation at extreme rates. In particular, we
find that solar metallicity progenitors, which produce

as an extension of quasiconformality. These are homeomorphisms $h:X \to Y$
between domains $ X, Y \subset \mathbb R^n$ of the Sobolev class $W^{1,n}_{loc}
(X, Y)$ whose inverse $f =h^{-1}:Y \to X$ also belongs to $W^{1,n}_{loc}(Y,
X)$. Thus the paper opens new topics in Geometric Function Theory with
connections to mathematical models of Nonlinear Elasticity. In seeking
differences and similarities with quasiconformal mappings we examine closely
the modulus of continuity of deformations of bi-conformal energy. This leads us
to a new characterization of quasiconformality. Specifically, it is observed
that quasiconformal mappings behave locally at every point like radial
stretchings. Without going into detail, if a quasiconformal map $h$ admits a
function $\phi$ as its optimal modulus of continuity at a point $x_0$, then $f
= h^{-1}$ admits the inverse function $\psi = \phi^{-1}$ as its modulus of
continuity at $y_0 = h(x_0)$. That is to say; a poor continuity of $h$ at a
given point $x_0$ is always compensated by a better continuity of $f$ at $y_0$,
and vice versa. Such a gain/loss property, seemingly overlooked by many
authors, is actually characteristic of quasiconformal mappings.
  It turns out that the elastic deformations of bi-conformal energy are very
different in this respect. Unexpectedly, such a map may have the same optimal
modulus of continuity as its inverse deformation. In line with Hooke's Law,
when trying to restore the original shape of the body (by the inverse
transformation) the modulus of continuity may neither be improved nor become
worse. However, examples to confirm this phenomenon are far from being obvious.
We eventually hope that our examples will gain an interest in the materials
science, particularly in mathematical models of hyperelasticity.

time. Partial monitoring by an observer implies that there may exist records
unobserved by that observer. It was shown that, given only the observed record,
the observer can better estimate the underlying true quantum states, by
inferring the unobserved record and using quantum state smoothing, rather than
the usual quantum filtering approach. However, the improvement in estimation
fidelity, originally examined for a resonantly driven qubit coupled to two
vacuum baths, was also shown to vary depending on the types of detection used
for the qubit's fluorescence. In this work, we analyse this variation in a
systematic way for the first time. We first define smoothing power using an
average purity recovery and a relative average purity recovery, of smoothing
over filtering. Then, we explore the power for various combinations of
fluorescence detection for both observed and unobserved channels. We next
propose a method to explain the variation of the smoothing power, based on
multi-time correlation strength between fluorescence detection records. The

robust version, MEB with outliers, in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Though
the problem has been extensively studied before, most of the existing
algorithms need at least linear time (in the number of input points $n$ and the
dimensionality $d$) to achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. Motivated by
some recent developments on beyond worst-case analysis, we introduce the notion
of stability for MEB (with outliers), which is natural and easy to understand.
Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of the resulting
ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction of the input
points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling algorithms for
computing approximate MEB with sample complexities independent of the number of
input points $n$. In particular, the second algorithm has the sample complexity
even independent of the dimensionality $d$. Further, we extend the idea to
achieve a sub-linear time approximation algorithm for the MEB with outliers
problem. Note that most existing sub-linear time algorithms for the problems of
MEB and MEB with outliers usually result in bi-criteria approximations, where
the ""bi-criteria"" means that the solution has to allow the approximations on
the radius and the number of covered points. Differently, all the algorithms
proposed in this paper yield single-criterion approximations (with respect to
radius). We expect that our proposed notion of stability and techniques will be
applicable to design sub-linear time algorithms for other optimization
problems.

antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at $T\rm_N$ = 9.3 K. Upon cooling, an anisotropy
crossover from Heisenberg to $XY$ behavior is observed below 7.5 K from the
anisotropic magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic field applied within the $XY$
plane induces a spin-flop transition of Cu$^{2+}$ ions between 4.9 T and 5.3 T.
With further increasing fields, the magnetic moment is gradually increased but
is only about half of the saturation of a Cu$^{2+}$ ion even in 30 T. The
individual reorientation of the inequivalent Cu$^{2+}$ spins under field is
proposed to account for the magnetization behavior. The observed spin-flop
transition is likely related to one Cu site, and the AFM coupling among the
rest Cu spins is so strong that the 30-T field cannot overcome the anisotropy.
The temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat, which is well
described by a sum of two gapped AFM contributions, is a further support for
the proposed scenario.

performance when processing large volumes of data under tight latency

have proposed managing concurrent state access during stream processing by
modeling state accesses as transactions. However, these are realized with locks
involving serious contention overhead. Their coarse-grained processing paradigm
further magnifies contention issues and tends to poorly utilize modern

supporting efficient concurrent state access on multicore processors.
Transactional semantics is employed like previous work, but scalability is
greatly improved due to two novel designs: 1) dual-mode scheduling, which
exposes more parallelism opportunities, 2) dynamic restructuring execution,
which aggressively exploits the parallelism opportunities from dual-mode
scheduling without centralized lock contentions. To validate our proposal, we
evaluate TStream with a benchmark of four applications on a modern multicore
machine. The experimental results show that 1) TStream achieves up to 4.8 times
higher throughput with similar processing latency compared to the
state-of-the-art and 2) unlike prior solutions, TStream is highly tolerant of

the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is proposed with the assumption of
perfect and global channel state information (CSI) at the BS. This multi-user
detector, however, is not practical due to the unrealistic CSI assumption and
the overwhelming detection complexity. These limitations are addressed by
presenting a novel detection framework inspired by supervised-learning. The key
idea is to model the complicated multihop MU-MIMO channel as a simplified
channel with much fewer and learnable parameters. One major finding is that,
even using the simplified channel model, a near ML detection performance is
achievable with a reasonable amount of pilot overheads in a certain condition.
In addition, an online supervised-learning detector is proposed, which
adaptively tracks channel variations. The idea is to update the model
parameters with a reliably detected data symbol by treating it as a new
training (labelled) data. Lastly, a multi-user detector using a deep neural
network is proposed. Unlike the model-based approaches, this model-free
approach enables to remove the errors in the simplified channel model, while
increasing the computational complexity for parameter learning. Via
simulations, the detection performances of classical, model-based, and
model-free detectors are thoroughly compared to demonstrate the effectiveness

of donor/acceptor. In our theoretical framework, two uncoupled particles are
jointly excited by the temporally entangled field associated with two virtual
photons that are produced by three-level radiative cascade decay in a donor
particle. The temporal entanglement leads to frequency anticorrelation in the
virtual photon's field, and vanishing of one of the time-ordered excitation
pathways. The underlying mechanism leads to more than three orders of magnitude
enhancement in the E2P-RET rate compared with the uncorrelated photon case.
With the power of our new formulation, we propose a way to characterize E2P-RET

many hard materials under small elastic deformation and large plastic

numerical methods tailor-made for this physical regime. In this work, we extend
to three dimensions a recent projection method for simulating quasi-static
hypo-elastoplastic materials. The method is based on a mathematical
correspondence to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, where the
projection method of Chorin (1968) is an established numerical technique. We
develop and utilize a three-dimensional parallel geometric multigrid solver
employed to solve a linear system for the quasi-static projection. Our method
is tested through simulation of three-dimensional shear band nucleation and
growth, a precursor to failure in many materials. As an example system, we
employ a physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear
transformation zone theory, but the method can be applied to any
elastoplasticity model. We consider several examples of three-dimensional shear
banding, and examine shear band formation in physically realistic materials
with heterogeneous initial conditions under both simple shear deformation and
boundary conditions inspired by friction welding.

sequence ignoring the labeling difficulties of different examples. To remedy
above defects, this paper proposes a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid
diffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically, HyDEnT integrates
multiple propagation methods as base learners to fully exploit their individual
wisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging
results. More importantly, HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an
ensemble of teachers. That is to say, in every propagation round the simplest
curriculum examples are wisely designated by a teaching algorithm, so that
their labels can be reliably and accurately decided by the learners. To
optimally choose these simplest examples, every teacher in the ensemble should
comprehensively consider the examples' difficulties from its own viewpoint, as
well as the common knowledge shared by all the teachers. This is accomplished
by a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the
block coordinate descent method. Thanks to the efforts of the teachers, all the
unlabeled examples are logically propagated from simple to difficult, leading

  DNN-based Speech Recognition Models","Submitted to RAID2019",,,,"cs.CR cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Audio is an important medium in people's daily life, hidden information can
be embedded into audio for covert communication. Current audio information
hiding techniques can be roughly classed into time domain-based and transform
domain-based techniques. Time domain-based techniques have large hiding
capacity but low imperceptibility. Transform domain-based techniques have
better imperceptibility, but the hiding capacity is poor. This paper proposes a
new audio information hiding technique which shows high hiding capacity and
good imperceptibility. The proposed audio information hiding method takes the
original audio signal as input and obtains the audio signal embedded with
hidden information (called stego audio) through the training of our private
automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Without knowing the internal
parameters and structure of the private model, the hidden information can be
extracted by the private model but cannot be extracted by public models. We use
four other ASR models to extract the hidden information on the stego audios to
evaluate the security of the private model. The experimental results show that
the proposed audio information hiding technique has a high hiding capacity of
48 cps with good imperceptibility and high security. In addition, our proposed
adversarial audio can be used to activate an intrinsic backdoor of DNN-based
ASR models, which brings a serious threat to intelligent speakers.

specifications. In order to capture the various modes of UAV operation, we
utilize a hybrid model for the system with linearized dynamics around different
operating points. We divide the mission into several sub-tasks by exploiting
the invariant nature of various task specifications i.e., the mutual
independence of safety and timing constraints along the way, and the different
modes (i,e., dynamics) of the robot. For each sub-task, we translate the MTL
formulae into linear constraints, and solve the associated optimal control
problem for desired path using a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver.
The complete path is constructed by the composition of individual optimal
sub-paths. We show that the resulting trajectory satisfies the task
specifications, and the proposed approach leads to significant reduction in
computational complexity of the problem, making it possible to implement in
real-time.

the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images
into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This
greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a
large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$

this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the

pattern recognition. To learn a robust distance metric for a target task, we
need abundant side information (i.e., the similarity/dissimilarity pairwise
constraints over the labeled data), which is usually unavailable in practice
due to the high labeling cost. This paper considers the transfer learning
setting by exploiting the large quantity of side information from certain
related, but different source tasks to help with target metric learning (with
only a little side information). The state-of-the-art metric learning
algorithms usually fail in this setting because the data distributions of the
source task and target task are often quite different. We address this problem
by assuming that the target distance metric lies in the space spanned by the
eigenvectors of the source metrics (or other randomly generated bases). The
target metric is represented as a combination of the base metrics, which are
computed using the decomposed components of the source metrics (or simply a set
of random bases); we call the proposed method, decomposition-based transfer DML
(DTDML). In particular, DTDML learns a sparse combination of the base metrics
to construct the target metric by forcing the target metric to be close to an
integration of the source metrics. The main advantage of the proposed method
compared with existing transfer metric learning approaches is that we directly
learn the base metric coefficients instead of the target metric. To this end,
far fewer variables need to be learned. We therefore obtain more reliable
solutions given the limited side information and the optimization tends to be
faster. Experiments on the popular handwritten image (digit, letter)
classification and challenge natural image annotation tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

velocity relaxation of colloidal particles immersed in a fluid, sufficiently
close that their flow patterns interfere. The interactions are also important
for periodic motions, such as occur in swimming. Analytic expressions are
derived for the set of scalar mobility functions of a pair of spheres. Mutual
hydrodynamic interactions are evaluated in one-propagator approximation,
characterized by a single Green function acting between the two spheres.
Self-mobility functions are evaluated in a two-propagator approximation,
characterized by a single reflection between the two spheres. The
approximations should yield accurate results for intermediate and long
distances between the spheres. Both translations and rotations are considered.
For motions perpendicular to the line of centers there is translation-rotation
coupling. Extensive use is made of Fax\'en theorems which yield the
hydrodynamic force and torque acting on a sphere in an incident oscillating
flow.

not been observed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). LaFePO$_{0.9}$ is an
iron-based superconductor with a low superconducting transition temperature

Evolutionary optimization using simulations is a promising way to automatically

dysfunctional real-world behaviors. In this paper, we address this challenge by
considering embodied phase coordination in the evolutionary optimization of a

method, leg phases, and indirectly also inter-leg coordination, are influenced
by sensor feedback.By comparing two very similar control systems we gain
insight into how the sensory feedback approach affects the evolved parameters

transferal to the real world, and to different real-world environments. We show
that evolution enables the design of a control system with embodied phase
coordination which is more complex than previously seen approaches, and that
this system is capable of controlling a real-world multi-jointed quadruped
robot.The approach reduces the performance discrepancy between simulation and
the real world, and displays robustness towards new environments.

hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our
hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead
inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief
propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm
can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of
$\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our
algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes
the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies.
  It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has
substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we
'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a
polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also
yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these
achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and
statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also
apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results
we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR
when $k$ is even.
  Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal
algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step
toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to
algorithm design.

measures such as Hellinger distance. For sensitivity analysis of complex
models, these divergence-based indices can be estimated by Monte-Carlo sampling
(MCS) in combination with kernel density estimation (KDE). In a direct
approach, the complex model must be evaluated at every input point generated by
MCS, resulting in samples in the input-output space that can be used for
density estimation. However, if the computational cost of the complex model
strongly limits the number of model evaluations, this direct method gives large
errors. We propose to use Gaussian process (GP) surrogates to increase the
number of samples in the combined input-output space. By enlarging this sample
set, the KDE becomes more accurate, leading to improved estimates. To compare
the GP surrogates, we use a surrogate constructed by samples obtained with
stochastic collocation, combined with Lagrange interpolation. Furthermore, we
propose a new estimation method for these sensitivity indices based on minimum
spanning trees. Finally, we also propose a new type of sensitivity indices
based on divergence measures, namely direct sensitivity indices. These are
useful when the input data is dependent.

have successfully detected polarization emission from its circumstellar disk.
The polarization pattern observed at 0.87 mm is uniform and parallel to the
disk's minor axis, consistent with the self-scattering of thermal emission by
dust particles whose maximum radius is $\approx 100~\mu m$. However, this
maximum size is considerably smaller than anticipated from dust evolution
models that assume a high sticking efficiency for icy particles. Here, we
propose that the unexpectedly small particle size can be explained if CO$_2$
ice covers the particles in the outer region of the HL Tau disk. CO$_2$ ice is
one of the most major interstellar ices, and laboratory experiments show that
it is poorly sticky. Based on dust evolution models accounting for CO$_2$ ice
mantles as well as aggregate sintering and post-processing radiative transfer,
we simulate the polarimetric observation of HL Tau at 0.87 mm. We find that the
models with CO$_2$ ice mantles better match the observation. These models also
predict that only particles lying between the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ snow lines can
grow to millimeter to centimeter sizes, and that their rapid inward drift
results in a local dust gap similar to the 10 au gap of the HL Tau disk. We
also suggest that the millimeter spectral index for the outer part of the HL
Tau disk is largely controlled by the optical thickness of this region and does
not necessarily indicate dust growth to millimeter sizes.

coherent description of events in a video requires holistic understanding of
video contents as well as contextual reasoning of individual events. Most
existing approaches handle this problem by first detecting event proposals from
a video and then captioning on a subset of the proposals. As a result, the
generated sentences are prone to be redundant or inconsistent since they fail
to consider temporal dependency between events. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, which models temporal
dependency across events in a video explicitly and leverages visual and
linguistic context from prior events for coherent storytelling. This objective
is achieved by 1) integrating an event sequence generation network to select a
sequence of event proposals adaptively, and 2) feeding the sequence of event
proposals to our sequential video captioning network, which is trained by
reinforcement learning with two-level rewards at both event and episode levels
for better context modeling. The proposed technique achieves outstanding
performances on ActivityNet Captions dataset in most metrics.

Universe is one of the basic assumptions of physics. Astronomical observations
provide the only means to test this basic assumption on cosmological time and
distance scales. The possibility of variations in the dimensionless physical
constant {\mu} - the proton-to-electron mass ratio, can be tested by comparing
astronomical measurements of the rest frequency of certain spectral lines at
radio wavelengths with laboratory determinations. Different types of molecular
transitions have different dependencies on {\mu} and so observations of two or
more spectral lines towards the same astronomical source can be used to test
whether there is any evidence for either temporal or spatial changes in the
physical fundamental constants. {\mu} will change if the relative strength of
the strong nuclear force compared to the electromagnetic force varies.
Theoretical studies have shown that the rotational transitions of some
molecules which have transitions in the frequency range that will be covered by
FAST (e.g., CH3OH, OH and CH) are sensitive to changes in {\mu}. A number of
studies looking for possible variations in {\mu} have been undertaken with
existing telescopes, however, the greater sensitivity of FAST means it will
open new opportunities to significantly improve upon measurements made to date.
In this paper, we discuss which molecular transitions and sources (both in the
Galaxy and external galaxies) are likely targets for providing improved
constraints on {\mu} with FAST.

examples are certain power management problems, which are modeled as metrical
task systems with $m=2$. We characterize the competitive ratio in terms of the
parameter $m$ for both deterministic and randomized algorithms on
hierarchically separated trees. Our findings uncover a rich and unexpected
picture that differs substantially from what is known or conjectured about the
unparametrized versions of these problems. For metrical task systems, we show
that deterministic algorithms do not exhibit any asymptotic gain beyond
one-level trees (namely, uniform metric spaces), whereas randomized algorithms
do not exhibit any asymptotic gain even for one-level trees. In contrast, the
special case of metrical service systems (subset chasing) behaves very
differently. Both deterministic and randomized algorithms exhibit gain, for $m$
sufficiently small compared to $n$, for any number of levels. Most
significantly, they exhibit a large gain for uniform metric spaces and a
smaller gain for two-level trees. Moreover, it turns out that in these cases
(as well as in the case of metrical task systems for uniform metric spaces with
$m$ being an absolute constant), deterministic algorithms are essentially as
powerful as randomized algorithms. This is surprising and runs counter to the
ubiquitous intuition/conjecture that, for most problems that can be modeled as

viscoelastic modulus is very important. However, the experimental
characterization of the frequency dependent modulus, carried out through
different standard procedures, still presents some complexities, then possible
alternative approaches are desirable. For example, the experimental
investigation of viscoelastic beam dynamics would be challenging, especially
for the intrinsic simplicity of this kind of test. This is why, a deep
understanding of damping mechanisms in viscoelastic beams results to be a quite
important task to better predict their dynamics. With the aim to enlighten
damping properties in such structures, an analytical study of the transversal
vibrations of a viscoelastic beam is presented in this paper. Some
dimensionless parameters are defined, depending on the material properties and
the beam geometry, which enable to shrewdly design the beam dynamics. In this
way, by properly tuning such disclosed parameters, for example the
dimensionless beam length or a chosen material, it is possible to enhance or
suppress some resonant peaks, one at a time or more simultaneously. This is a
remarkable possibility to efficiently control damping in these structures, and
the results presented in this paper may help in elucidating experimental

  Media (ICWSM-2019)",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Every day, thousands of users sign up as new Wikipedia contributors. Once
joined, these users have to decide which articles to contribute to, which users
to seek out and learn from or collaborate with, etc. Any such task is a hard
and potentially frustrating one given the sheer size of Wikipedia. Supporting
newcomers in their first steps by recommending articles they would enjoy
editing or editors they would enjoy collaborating with is thus a promising
route toward converting them into long-term contributors. Standard recommender
systems, however, rely on users' histories of previous interactions with the
platform. As such, these systems cannot make high-quality recommendations to
newcomers without any previous interactions -- the so-called cold-start
problem. The present paper addresses the cold-start problem on Wikipedia by
developing a method for automatically building short questionnaires that, when
completed by a newly registered Wikipedia user, can be used for a variety of
purposes, including article recommendations that can help new editors get
started. Our questionnaires are constructed based on the text of Wikipedia
articles as well as the history of contributions by the already onboarded
Wikipedia editors. We assess the quality of our questionnaire-based
recommendations in an offline evaluation using historical data, as well as an
online evaluation with hundreds of real Wikipedia newcomers, concluding that
our method provides cohesive, human-readable questions that perform well
against several baselines. By addressing the cold-start problem, this work can
help with the sustainable growth and maintenance of Wikipedia's diverse editor
community.

combinatorial problem that has been the subject of intense theoretical and
empirical study since its introduction in 1962 in a seminal paper by Gale and
Shapley, who designed the celebrated ``deferred acceptance'' algorithm for the
problem.
  In the input, each participant ranks participants of the opposite type, so
the input consists of a collection of permutations, representing the preference
lists. A bipartite matching is unstable if some man-woman pair is blocking:
both strictly prefer each other to their partner in the matching. Stability is
an important economics concept in matching markets from the viewpoint of
manipulability. The unicity of a stable matching implies non-manipulability,
and near-unicity implies limited manipulability, thus these are mathematical
properties related to the quality of stable matching algorithms.
  This paper is a theoretical study of the effect of correlations on
approximate manipulability of stable matching algorithms. Our approach is to go
beyond worst case, assuming that some of the input preference lists are drawn
from a distribution. Our model encompasses a discrete probabilistic process
inspired by a popularity model introduced by Immorlica and Mahdian, that
provides a way to capture correlation between preference lists. Approximate
manipulability is approached from several angles : when all stable partners of
a person have approximately the same rank; or when most persons have a unique
stable partner. Another quantity of interest is a person's number of stable
partners. Our results aim to paint a picture of the manipulability of stable
matchings in a ``beyond worst case'' setting.

appropriate training, a requirement that is difficult to satisfy in the medical
field. This issue can usually be avoided with a proper initialization of the
weights. On the task of medical image segmentation in general, two techniques
are oftentimes employed to tackle the training of a deep network $f_T$. The
first one consists in reusing some weights of a network $f_S$ pre-trained on a
large scale database ($e.g.$ ImageNet). This procedure, also known as
$transfer$ $learning$, happens to reduce the flexibility when it comes to new
network design since $f_T$ is constrained to match some parts of $f_S$. The
second commonly used technique consists in working on image patches to benefit
from the large number of available patches. This paper brings together these
two techniques and propose to train $arbitrarily$ $designed$ $networks$ that
segment an image in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small
databases. An experimental work have been carried out on the tasks of retinal
blood vessel segmentation and the optic disc one, using four publicly available
databases. Furthermore, three types of network are considered, going from a
very light weighted network to a densely connected one. The final results show
the efficiency of the proposed framework along with state of the art results on
all the databases.

in an environment moves to a target according to an instruction. To deploy a
robot for navigation in the physical world, lots of training data is required
to learn an effective policy. It is quite labour intensive to obtain sufficient
real environment data for training robots while synthetic data is much easier
to construct by rendering. Though it is promising to utilize the synthetic
environments to facilitate navigation training in the real world, real
environment are heterogeneous from synthetic environment in two aspects. First,
the visual representation of the two environments have significant variances.
Second, the houseplans of these two environments are quite different. Therefore
two types of information, i.e. visual representation and policy behavior, need
to be adapted in the reinforcement model. The learning procedure of visual
representation and that of policy behavior are presumably reciprocal. We
propose to jointly adapt visual representation and policy behavior to leverage
the mutual impacts of environment and policy. Specifically, our method employs
an adversarial feature adaptation model for visual representation transfer and
a policy mimic strategy for policy behavior imitation. Experiment shows that
our method outperforms the baseline by 19.47% without any additional human

the total orbital energy, the initial value of the $z$-coordinate and the

  Architecture and Ambient Backscattering Augmented Communications","30 pages, 13 figures, journal paper",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With conventional anti-jamming solutions like frequency hopping or spread
spectrum, legitimate transceivers often tend to ""escape"" or ""hide"" themselves
from jammers. These reactive anti-jamming approaches are constrained by the
lack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together the latest
advances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering
communications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively ""face"" the
jammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or
transmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically, to deal
with unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement
learning algorithms, e.g., Q-learning. However, the Q-learning algorithm is
notorious for its slow convergence to the optimal policy, especially when the
system state and action spaces are large. This makes the Q-learning algorithm
pragmatically inapplicable. To overcome this problem, we design a novel deep
reinforcement learning algorithm using the recent dueling neural network
architecture. Our proposed algorithm allows the transmitter to effectively
learn about the jammer and attain the optimal countermeasures thousand times
faster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Through extensive
simulation results, we show that our design (using ambient backscattering and
the deep dueling neural network architecture) can improve the average
throughput by up to 426% and reduce the packet loss by 24%. By augmenting the
ambient backscattering capability on devices and using our algorithm, it is
interesting to observe that the (successful) transmission rate increases with
the jamming power. Our proposed solution can find its applications in both
civil (e.g., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications or URLLC) and
military scenarios (to combat both inadvertent and deliberate jamming).

critical role in web-based image analytics-based applications, such as
large-scale image retrieval and browsing. Matrix completion has recently been
introduced as a method for transductive (semi-supervised) multi-label
classification, and has several distinct advantages, including robustness to
missing data and background noise in both feature and label space. However, it
is limited by only considering data represented by a single-view feature, which
cannot precisely characterize images containing several semantic concepts. To
utilize multiple features taken from different views, we have to concatenate
the different features as a long vector. But this concatenation is prone to
over-fitting and often leads to very high time complexity in MC based image
classification. Therefore, we propose to weightedly combine the MC outputs of
different views, and present the multi-view matrix completion (MVMC) framework
for transductive multi-label image classification. To learn the view
combination weights effectively, we apply a cross validation strategy on the
labeled set. In the learning process, we adopt the average precision (AP) loss,
which is particular suitable for multi-label image classification. A least
squares loss formulation is also presented for the sake of efficiency, and the
robustness of the algorithm based on the AP loss compared with the other losses
is investigated. Experimental evaluation on two real world datasets (PASCAL
VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr) demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMC for transductive
(semi-supervised) multi-label image classification, and show that MVMC can
exploit complementary properties of different features and output-consistent
labels for improved multi-label image classification.

and generalizable models which are effective for classifying unseen classes. In
this paper, a novel noise tolerant deep metric learning algorithm is proposed.
The proposed method, termed as Density Aware Metric Learning, enforces the
model to learn embeddings that are pulled towards the most dense region of the
clusters for each class. It is achieved by iteratively shifting the estimate of
the center towards the dense region of the cluster thereby leading to faster
convergence and higher generalizability. In addition to this, the approach is
robust to noisy samples in the training data, often present as outliers.
Detailed experiments and analysis on two challenging cross-modal face
recognition databases and two popular object recognition databases exhibit the
efficacy of the proposed approach. It has superior convergence, requires lesser
training time, and yields better accuracies than several popular deep metric
learning methods.

the context of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Here we provide a
concrete illustration of this trade-off by theoretically investigating the
operation of a quantum point contact (QPC) with an energy-dependent
transmission function as a steady-state thermoelectric heat engine. As a
starting point, we review and extend previous analysis of the power production
and efficiency. Thereafter the power fluctuations and the bound jointly imposed
on the power, efficiency and fluctuations by the TURs are analyzed as
additional performance quantifiers. We allow for arbitrary smoothness of the
transmission probability of the QPC, which exhibits a close to step-like
dependence in energy, and consider both the linear and the non-linear regime of
operation. It is found that for a broad range of parameters, the power
production reaches nearly its theoretical maximum value, with efficiencies more
than half of the Carnot efficiency and at the same time with rather small
fluctuations. Moreover, we show that by demanding a non-zero power production,
in the linear regime a stronger TUR can be formulated in terms of the
thermoelectric figure of merit. Interestingly, this bound holds also in a wide
parameter regime beyond linear response for our QPC device.

friction. We report that the relationship between force and terminal velocity

dominant, which eventually explains the matchless mobility of water. Our
results are finally extended to viscous liquids, also known to be unusually

all quasars but one the polarization degree is lower than 1%. This suggests
that the disappearance of the broad emission lines cannot be attributed to dust
obscuration, and supports the scenario in which changes of look are caused by a
change in the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Such low
polarization degrees also indicate that these quasars are seen under
inclinations close to the system axis. One type 1.9-2 quasar in our sample
shows a high polarization degree of 6.8%. While this polarization could be
ascribed to obscuration by a moving dusty cloud, we argue that this is unlikely

due to the echo of a past bright phase seen in polar-scattered light. This

materials. This property, by allowing metastable states, can potentially yield
catastrophic phenomena such as earthquakes or aerial landslides. The origin of
hysteresis in granular flows is still debated. However, most mechanisms put
forward so far rely on the presence of inertia at the particle level. In this
paper, we study the avalanche dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions in slowly
rotating drums and reveal large hysteresis of the avalanche angle even in the
absence of inertia. By using micro-silica particles whose interparticle
friction coefficient can be turned off, we show that microscopic friction,
conversely to inertia, is key to triggering hysteresis in granular suspensions.
To understand this link between friction and hysteresis, we use the rotating
drum as a rheometer to extract the suspension rheology close to the flow onset
for both frictional and frictionless suspensions. This analysis shows that the
flow rule for frictionless particles is monotonous and follows a power law of
exponent $\alpha \!= \! 0.37 \pm 0.05$, in close agreement with the previous
theoretical prediction, $\alpha\!=\! 0.35$. By contrast, the flow rule for
frictional particles suggests a velocity-weakening behavior, thereby explaining
the flow instability and the emergence of hysteresis. These findings show that
hysteresis can also occur in particulate media without inertia, questioning the
intimate nature of this phenomenon. By highlighting the role of microscopic
friction, our results may be of interest in the geophysical context to
understand the failure mechanism at the origin of undersea landslides.

deglaciated ocean present in the northern hemisphere of Mars. Here we show that
the presence of such a late ocean faces a paradox. If cold, the ocean should
have been entirely frozen shortly after its formation, thus preventing the
formation of tsunami events. If warm, the ice-free ocean should have produced
fluvial erosion of Hesperian Mars terrains much more extensively than
previously reported. To solve this apparent paradox, we suggest a list of

a multilingual corpus where the same concept is covered in multiple languages

Cr5 (Crosslingual reduced-rank ridge regression), starts by training a
ridge-regression-based classifier that uses language-specific bag-of-word

show that, when constraining the learned weight matrix to be of low rank, it
can be factored to obtain the desired mappings from language-specific
bags-of-words to language-independent embeddings. As opposed to most prior
methods, which use pretrained monolingual word vectors, postprocess them to
make them crosslingual, and finally average word vectors to obtain document
vectors, Cr5 is trained end-to-end and is thus natively crosslingual as well as
document-level. Moreover, since our algorithm uses the singular value
decomposition as its core operation, it is highly scalable. Experiments show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a crosslingual

eruptions scale linearly in a logarithmic plot. We find that the eruptions are
triggered earlier for higher $B_0$ and that $B_0$ is not directly correlated to
the frequency of occurrence of the eruptions. Using large numerical domains, we
show the initial stage of the partial merging of two colliding erupting fields.
The partial merging occurs partly by the reconnection between the field lines

finite and affine type generalises naturally to non-integer quivers. In
particular, exchange graphs of finite type quivers are finite, while exchange
graphs of affine quivers are finite modulo the action of a finite-dimensional

The presence of inflows of metal-poor gas that trigger star formation bursts of
low metallicity has been proposed as an explanation for the local
anti-correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas-phase metallicity
($\rm Z_g$) found in the literature. In the present study, we show how the
anti-correlation is also present as part of a diversified range of behaviours
for a sample of more than 700 nearby spiral galaxies from the SDSS IV MaNGA
survey. We have characterized the local relation between SFR and $\rm Z_g$
after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities.
$60\%$ of the analyzed galaxies display a $\rm SFR-Z_g$ anti-correlation, with
the remaining $40\%$ showing no correlation ($19\%$) or positive correlation
($21\%$). Applying a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we obtain that
the slope of the correlation is mainly determined by the average gas-phase
metallicity of the galaxy. Galaxy mass, $g-r$ colors, stellar age, and mass
density seem to play a less significant role. This result is supported by the
performed 2nd-order polynomial regression analysis. Thus, the local $\rm
SFR-Z_g$ slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor
galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest $\rm SFR-Z_g$
anti-correlations), and reversing the relation for more metal-rich systems. Our
results suggest that external gas accretion fuels star-formation in metal-poor
galaxies, whereas in metal-rich systems the gas comes from previous star
formation episodes.

effect of the superthermal electron population on the dust ion acoustic
solitary wave has been explored. The plasma is considered un-magnetized and
composed of two components of superthermal electrons (of two distinct

the dust charge has been considered as a variable and a detailed analysis has

such systems have resulted in point-dipole approximations to resonators that
are computationally efficient for large resonator ensembles. Here we provide a
detailed study for the validity of point dipole approximations in small systems
of strongly coupled plasmonic nanorods, including the cases of both
super-radiant and subradiant excitations, where the characteristics of the
excitation depends on the spatial separation between the nanorods. We show that
over an appreciable range of rod lengths centered on $210~\text{nm}$, when the
relative separation $kl$ in terms of the resonance wave number of light $k$
satisfies $kl \gtrsim \pi/2$, the point electric dipole model becomes accurate.
However, when the resonators are closer, the finite-size and geometry of the
resonators modifies the excitation modes, in particular the cooperative mode
line shifts of the point dipole approximation begin to rapidly diverge at small
separations. We also construct simplified effective models by describing a pair
of nanorods as a single effective metamolecule.

discovered with a statistical significance of $7.3\sigma$ in a data sample of
${\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-}$ decays which is an order of magnitude larger
than that previously analyzed by the LHCb collaboration. The $P_c(4450)^+$
pentaquark structure formerly reported by LHCb is confirmed and observed to
consist of two narrow overlapping peaks, $P_c(4440)^+$ and $P_c(4457)^+$, where
the statistical significance of this two-peak interpretation is $5.4\sigma$.
Proximity of the $\Sigma_c^+\bar{D}^{0}$ and $\Sigma_c^+\bar{D}^{*0}$
thresholds to the observed narrow peaks suggests that they play an important

organizations are looking for ways to use DDDM to improve their decisions.
However, few studies have looked into the practitioners view of DDDM, in
particular for agile organizations. In this paper we investigated the
experiences of using DDDM, and how data can improve decision making. An emailed
questionnaire was sent out to 124 industry practitioners in agile software
developing companies, of which 84 answered. The results show that few
practitioners indicated a widespread use of DDDM in their current decision
making practices. The practitioners were more positive to its future use for
higher-level and more general decision making, fairly positive to its use for
requirements elicitation and prioritization decisions, while being less
positive to its future use at the team level. The practitioners do see a lot of
potential for DDDM in an agile context; however, currently unfulfilled.

  Fine-Tuning","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1705.02406 by other authors",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image quality plays a big role in CNN-based image classification performance.
Fine-tuning the network with distorted samples may be too costly for large
networks. To solve this issue, we propose a transfer learning approach
optimized to keep into account that in each layer of a CNN some filters are
more susceptible to image distortion than others. Our method identifies the
most susceptible filters and applies retraining only to the filters that show
the highest activation maps distance between clean and distorted images.
Filters are ranked using the Borda count election method and then only the most
affected filters are fine-tuned. This significantly reduces the number of
parameters to retrain. We evaluate this approach on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, testing it on two different models and two different types of
distortion. Results show that the proposed transfer learning technique recovers
most of the lost performance due to input data distortion, at a considerably
faster pace with respect to existing methods, thanks to the reduced number of
parameters to fine-tune. When few noisy samples are provided for training, our
filter-level fine tuning performs particularly well, also outperforming state
of the art layer-level transfer learning approaches.

spaces, in the context of perfect matchings (FCT 1979). A similar connection
between bipartite graphs and matrix spaces plays a key role in the recent
resolutions of the non-commutative rank problem
(Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson, FOCS 2016; Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam, ITCS
2017). In this paper, we lay the foundation for another bridge between graphs
and alternating matrix spaces, in the context of independent sets and vertex
colorings. The corresponding structures in alternating matrix spaces are
isotropic spaces and isotropic decompositions, both useful structures in group
theory and manifold theory.
  We first show that the maximum independent set problem and the vertex
c-coloring problem reduce to the maximum isotropic space problem and the
isotropic c-decomposition problem, respectively. Next, we show that several
topics and results about independent sets and vertex colorings have natural
correspondences for isotropic spaces and decompositions. These include
algorithmic problems, such as the maximum independent set problem for bipartite
graphs, and exact exponential-time algorithms for the chromatic number, as well
as mathematical questions, such as the number of maximal independent sets, and
the relation between the maximum degree and the chromatic number. These
connections lead to new interactions between graph theory and algebra. Some
results have concrete applications to group theory and manifold theory, and we
initiate a variant of these structures in the context of quantum information
theory. Finally, we propose several open questions for further exploration.

magnetoresistive (CMR) manganite ferromagnets LaXMnO3 (X: Ca or Sr). We
demonstrate that in a broad temperature range the magnetization of a manganite
nanoparticle, forming the junction interface, switches abruptly in a
mono-domain manner. The CMR phenomenon translates the magnetization loop into a
hysteretic magnetoresistance loop. The latter facilitates a memory
functionality of such a junction with just a single CMR ferromagnetic layer.
The orientation of the magnetization (stored information) can be read out by
simply measuring the junction resistance in an applied magnetic field. The CMR
facilitates a large read-out signal in a small applied field. We argue that
such a simple single layer CMR junction can operate as a memory cell both in
the superconducting state at cryogenic temperatures and in the normal state up
to room temperature.

  Poisson point process",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a model of spatial random permutations over a discrete set of
points. Formally, a permutation $\sigma$ is sampled proportionally to the
weight $\exp\{-\alpha \sum_x V(\sigma(x)-x)\},$ where $\alpha>0$ is the
temperature and $V$ is a non-negative and continuous potential. The most
relevant case for physics is when $V(x)=\|x\|^2$, since it is related to
Bose-Einstein condensation through a representation introduced by Feynman in
1953. In the context of statistical mechanics, the weights define a probability
when the set of points is finite, but the construction associated to an
infinite set is not trivial and may fail without appropriate hypotheses. The
first problem is to establish conditions for the existence of such a measure at
infinite volume when the set of points is infinite. Once existence is derived,
we are interested in establishing its uniqueness and the cycle structure of a
typical permutation. We here consider the large temperature regime when the set
of points is a Poisson point process in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with intensity $\rho
\in(0,1/2)$, and the potential verifies some regularity conditions. In
particular, we prove that if $\alpha$ is large enough, for almost every
realization of the point process, there exists a unique Gibbs measure that
concentrates on finite cycle permutations. We then extend these results to the
continuous setting, when the set of points is given by a Poisson point process
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with low enough intensity.

Understanding the mysteries of this phenomena is a very fascinating fundamental

viewpoint, and propose the AdaBoost+SVM algorithm, which can explain the
resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost directly and easily to understand.
Firstly, we adopt the AdaBoost algorithm to learn the base classifiers. Then,
instead of directly weighted combination the base classifiers, we regard them
as features and input them to SVM classifier. With this, the new coefficient
and bias can be obtained, which can be used to construct the final classifier.
We explain the rationality of this and illustrate the theorem that when the
dimension of these features increases, the performance of SVM would not be
worse, which can explain the resistant to overfitting of AdaBoost.

different kind of star than our Sun: smaller red dwarf stars. Such stars can
flare frequently, bombarding their planets with biologically damaging
high-energy UV radiation, placing planetary atmospheres at risk of erosion and
bringing the habitability of these worlds into question. However, the surface
UV flux on these worlds is unknown. Here we show the first models of the
surface UV environments of the four closest potentially habitable exoplanets:
Proxima-b, TRAPPIST-1e, Ross-128b, and LHS-1140b assuming different atmospheric
compositions, spanning Earth-analogue to eroded and anoxic atmospheres and
compare them to levels for Earth throughout its geological evolution. Even for
planet models with eroded and anoxic atmospheres, surface UV radiation remains
below early Earth levels, even during flares. Given that the early Earth was
inhabited, we show that UV radiation should not be a limiting factor for the
habitability of planets orbiting M stars. Our closest neighbouring worlds
remain intriguing targets for the search for life beyond our Solar system.

Galactic center (GC) should occur regularly. The energy released and dissipated
by this processes will affect both the ambient environment of the GC and the
Galactic halo. A single star of super-Eddington eruption generates a subsonic
out ow with an energy release of more than $10^{52}$ erg, which still is not
high enough to push shock heated gas into the halo. Only routine tidal
disruption of stars near the GC can provide enough cumulative energy to form
and maintain large scale structures like the Fermi Bubbles. The average rate of
disruption events is expected to be $10^{-4}$ ~ $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, providing
the average power of energy release from the GC into the halo of dW/dt ~
3*10$^{41}$ erg/s, which is needed to support the Fermi Bubbles. The GC black
hole is surrounded by molecular clouds in the disk, but their overall mass and
filling factor is too low to stall the shocks from tidal disruption events
significantly. The de facto continuous energy injection on timescales of Myr
will lead to the propagation of strong shocks in a density stratified Galactic
halo and thus create elongated bubble-like features, which are symmetric to the
Galactic midplane.

networks. Existing methods show that updating the previous pruned filter would
enable large model capacity and achieve better performance. However, during the
iterative pruning process, even if the network weights are updated to new
values, the pruning criterion remains the same. In addition, when evaluating
the filter importance, only the magnitude information of the filters is
considered. However, in neural networks, filters do not work individually, but
they would affect other filters. As a result, the magnitude information of each
filter, which merely reflects the information of an individual filter itself,
is not enough to judge the filter importance. To solve the above problems, we
propose Meta-attribute-based Filter Pruning (MFP). First, to expand the
existing magnitude information based pruning criteria, we introduce a new set
of criteria to consider the geometric distance of filters. Additionally, to
explicitly assess the current state of the network, we adaptively select the
most suitable criteria for pruning via a meta-attribute, a property of the
neural network at the current state. Experiments on two image classification
benchmarks validate our method. For ResNet-50 on ILSVRC-2012, we could reduce
more than 50% FLOPs with only 0.44% top-5 accuracy loss.

uncertainty that can be reduced is limited by the amount of available
computational resources. Here, we introduce the notion of elementary
computation based on a fundamental principle for probability transfers that
reduce uncertainty. Elementary computations can be considered as the inverse of
Pigou-Dalton transfers applied to probability distributions, closely related to
the concepts of majorization, T-transforms, and generalized entropies that
induce a preorder on the space of probability distributions. As a consequence
we can define resource cost functions that are order-preserving and therefore
monotonic with respect to the uncertainty reduction. This leads to a
comprehensive notion of decision-making processes with limited resources. Along
the way, we prove several new results on majorization theory, as well as on
entropy and divergence measures.

security vulnerabilities have raised serious privacy and safety issues.
Traditional efforts to secure these devices against impersonation attacks
mainly rely on either dedicated sensors or specified user motions, impeding
their wide-scale adoption. This paper transcends these limitations with a
general security solution by leveraging ubiquitous wireless chips available in
IoT devices. Particularly, representative time and frequency features are first
extracted from received signal strengths (RSSs) to characterize radio
propagation profiles. Then, an adversarial multi-player network is developed to
recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device
authentication. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract
all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant
information caused by motion variances. We build a prototype of our system
using universal software radio peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive
experiments with both static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and
outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an
average authentication accuracy of 90.4%, with a high area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.958 and better generalization
performance in comparison with the conventional non-adversarial-based approach.

we propose metrics to evaluate both the quality and diversity simultaneously by
approximating the distance of the learned generative model and the real data
distribution. For this purpose, we first introduce a metric that approximates
this distance using n-gram based measures. Then, a feature-based measure which
is based on a recent highly deep model trained on a large text corpus called

found to be stoichiometric (ZrO2) and off-stoichiometric (ZrO1.7) respectively
by Resonant Rutherford back-scattering spectroscopy. While the 660 nm
as-deposited films were in the cubic phase, as indicated by X-ray diffraction
and Raman spectroscopy measurements, the 140 nm as-deposited films were
amorphous and the transformation to cubic phase was obtained after thermal
annealing. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed the
existence of Oxygen vacancies in the local structure surrounding Zirconium for
all films. However, the amount of these Oxygen vacancies was found to be
significantly higher for the amorphous films as compared to the films in the
cubic phase (both 660 nm as-deposited and 140 nm annealed films). The cubic
phase stabilization is explained on the basis of suppression of the soft X2-
mode of vibration of the Oxygen sub-lattice due to the presence of the Oxygen
vacancies. Our first-principles modeling under the framework of density
functional theory shows that the cubic structure with Oxygen vacancies is
indeed more stable at ambient conditions than its pristine (without vacancies)

segmentation algorithms such as watershed transform and power watershed as it
is able to filter seeds (regional minima) to reduce over-segmentation. However,
MR might mistakenly filter meaningful seeds that are required for generating
accurate segmentation and it is also sensitive to the scale because a
single-scale structuring element is employed. In this paper, a novel adaptive
morphological reconstruction (AMR) operation is proposed that has three
advantages. Firstly, AMR can adaptively filter useless seeds while preserving
meaningful ones. Secondly, AMR is insensitive to the scale of structuring
elements because multiscale structuring elements are employed. Finally, AMR has
two attractive properties: monotonic increasingness and convergence that help
seeded segmentation algorithms to achieve a hierarchical segmentation.
Experiments clearly demonstrate that AMR is useful for improving algorithms of
seeded image segmentation and seed-based spectral segmentation. Compared to
several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithms provide better
segmentation results requiring less computing time. Source code is available at

extending up to 5 Msun in the case of mild barium stars. This high-mass tail
comprises mostly high-metallicity objects ([Fe/H] >= -0.1). Mass functions are
compatible with WD companions and we derive their mass distribution which
ranges from 0.5 to 1 Msun. Using the initial - final mass relationship
established for field WDs, we derived the distribution of the mass ratio q' =
MAGB,ini / MBa (where MAGB, ini is the WD progenitor initial mass, i.e., the
mass of the system former primary component) which is a proxy for the initial
mass ratio. It appears that the distribution of q' is highly non uniform, and
significantly different for mild and strong barium stars, the latter being
characterized by values mostly in excess of 1.4, whereas mild barium stars
occupy the range 1 - 1.4. We investigate as well the correlation between
abundances, orbital periods, metallicities, and masses (barium star and WD
companion). The 105 orbits of post-mass-transfer systems presented in this
paper pave the way for a comparison with binary-evolution models.

account of both spectral and spatial information, such as the spectral

performances, e.g., the image classification accuracy. In a feature
representation point of view, a nature approach to handle this situation is to
concatenate the spectral and spatial features into a single but high
dimensional vector and then apply a certain dimension reduction technique
directly on that concatenated vector before feed it into the subsequent
classifier. However, multiple features from various domains definitely have
different physical meanings and statistical properties, and thus such

different features, which should benefit for boost the feature
discriminability. Furthermore, it is also difficult to interpret the

simultaneous spectral-spatial feature selection and extraction algorithm, for
hyperspectral images spectral-spatial feature representation and

orbits using an effective potential based formalism derived in [M. Kesden et
al., PRL {\bf 114}, 081103 (2015)]. This effective potential is used to
classify binary black holes into three mutually exclusive spin morphologies.
During the inspiral phase, binaries make transitions from one morphology to
others. We evolve a population of binary black holes from an initial separation
of $1000\mathbf{M}$ to a final separation of $10\mathbf{M}$ using
post-Newtonian accurate evolution equations. We find that, given suitable
initial conditions, a binary's eccentricity can follow one of three distinct
evolutionary patterns: (i) eccentricity monotonically increasing until final
separation, (ii) eccentricity rising after decaying to a minimum value, and
(iii) eccentricity monotonically decreasing throughout the inspiral. The
monotonic growth or growth after reaching a certain minimum of eccentricity is
due to the effect of 2PN spin-spin coupling. Further, we investigate the
morphology transitions in eccentric binaries and find that the probability of
such binaries transiting from one to other is similar to those in circular
orbits, implying that eccentricity plays a sub-dominant role in spin morphology
evolution of a precessing binary black hole. We, hence, argue that the
morphological classification of spin precession dynamics is a robust tool to
constrain the formation channels of binaries with arbitrary eccentricity as
well.

the spatial variation of such polarization signal would allow us to study the
properties of the magnetic fields at subgranular region. But, the observations

robustness of complex socio technical systems. It has been extensively studied
from an ethnomethodological point of view and empirically reproduced by multi
agent simulations. Whilst such simulations have been used to design real work
settings the underlying theoretical grounding for the process is vague. The aim
of this paper is to investigate whether the emergence of mutual knowledge (MK)
in a group of co-located individuals can be explained as a percolation
phenomenon. The followed methodology consists in coupling agent-based
simulation with dynamic networks analysis to study information propagation
phenomena: after using an agent-based simulation we generated and then analysed
its traces as networks where agents met and exchanged knowledge. Deep analysis
of the resulting networks clearly shows that the emergence of MK is comparable
to a percolation process. We specifically focus on how changes at the
microscopic level in our agent based simulator affect percolation and
robustness. These results therefore provides theoretical basis for the analysis
of social organizations.

low metallicity, when mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and the surface
enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes relatively more pronounced than at
high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation and metallicity
on stellar evolution. Using a similar physics as in our previous large grids of
models at Z=0.002 and Z=0.014, we compute stellar evolution models with the
Geneva code for rotating and nonrotating stars with initial masses (Mini)
between 1.7 and 120 Msun and Z=0.0004 (1/35 solar). This is comparable to the
metallicities of the most metal poor galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18.
Concerning massive stars, both rotating and nonrotating models spend most of
their core-helium burning phase with an effective temperature higher than 8000
K. Stars become red supergiants only at the end of their lifetimes, and few
RSGs are expected. Our models predict very few to no classical Wolf-Rayet stars
as a results of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars
end their lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a
feature that is not predicted by models with higher metallicities.
Interestingly, due to the behavior of the intermediate convective zone, the
mass domain of stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at
Z=0.0004 than at Z=0.002. We find that during the main sequence phase, the
ratio between nitrogen and carbon abundances (N/C) remains unchanged for
nonrotating models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating
models at the end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with Mini > 4-6 Msun
are beyond the core helium burning phase and spend little time in the
instability strip. Since they would evolve towards cooler effective
temperatures, these Cepheids should show an increase of the pulsation period as
a function of age.

  This paper presents an unsupervised, data-driven method for ranking process
elements according to the magnitude and novelty of their influence. Partial
bivariate transfer entropy estimation is used to infer a weighted directed
graph of process elements. Eigenvector centrality is applied to rank network
nodes according to their overall effect. As the ranking of process elements
rely on emerging properties that depend on the aggregate of many connections,
the results are robust to errors in the estimation of individual edge
properties and the inclusion of indirect connections that do not represent the
true causal structure of the process.
  A monitoring chart of continuously calculated process element importance
scores over multiple overlapping time regions can assist with incipient fault
detection. Ranking results combined with visual inspection of information
transfer networks is also useful for root cause analysis of known faults and
disturbances. A software implementation of the proposed method is available.

We present the first three-dimensional internal motions for individual
stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Methods. By combining first-epoch
$Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ observations and second-epoch $Gaia$ Data Release
2 positions, we measured the proper motions of $149$ sources in the direction
of Draco. We determined the line-of-sight velocities for a sub-sample of $81$
red giant branch stars using medium resolution spectra acquired with the DEIMOS
spectrograph at the Keck II telescope. Altogether, this resulted in a final
sample of $45$ Draco members with high-precision and accurate 3D motions, which
we present as a table in this paper. Results. Based on this high-quality
dataset, we determined the velocity dispersions at a projected distance of
$\sim120$ pc from the centre of Draco to be $\sigma_{R} =11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$
km/s, $\sigma_{T}=9.9^{+2.3}_{-3.1}$ km/s and $\sigma_{LOS}=9.0^{+1.1}_{-1.1}$
km/s in the projected radial, tangential, and line-of-sight directions. This
results in a velocity anisotropy $\beta=0.25^{+0.47}_{-1.38}$ at $r \gtrsim120$
pc. Tighter constraints may be obtained using the spherical Jeans equations and
assuming constant anisotropy and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) mass profiles, also
based on the assumption that the 3D velocity dispersion should be lower than
$\approx 1/3$ of the escape velocity of the system. In this case, we constrain
the maximum circular velocity $V_{max}$ of Draco to be in the range of
$10.2-17.0$ km/s. The corresponding mass range is in good agreement with
previous estimates based on line-of-sight velocities only. Conclusions. Our
Jeans modelling supports the case for a cuspy dark matter profile in this
galaxy. Firmer conclusions may be drawn by applying more sophisticated models
to this dataset and with new datasets from upcoming $Gaia$ releases.

symmetry where the gauge parameters are restricted by differential equations.
The examples of unfree gauge symmetries include volume preserving
diffeomorphisms in the unimodular gravity and various higher spin field
theories with transverse gauge symmetries. All the known examples of the models
with unfree gauge symmetry share one common feature. They admit local
quantities which vanish on shell, though they are not linear combinations of
Lagrangian equations and their derivatives. We term these quantities as mass
shell completion functions.
  In the case of usual gauge symmetry with unconstrained gauge parameters, the
irreducible gauge algebra involves the two basic constituents: the action
functional and gauge symmetry generators. For the case of unfree gauge
symmetry, we identify two more basic constituents: operators of gauge parameter
constraints and completion functions. These two extra constituents are involved
in the algebra of unfree gauge symmetry on equal footing with action and gauge
symmetry generators.
  Proceeding from the algebra, we adjust the Faddeev-Popov (FP) path integral
quantization scheme to the case of unfree gauge symmetry. The modified FP
action involves the operators of the constraints imposed on the gauge
parameters, while the corresponding BRST transformation involves the completion
functions. The BRST symmetry ensures gauge independence of the path integral.
We provide two examples which admit the alternative unconstrained
parametrization of gauge symmetry and demonstrate that they lead to the
equivalent FP path integral.

molecular bands of ZrO in addition to the TiO bands typical of M stars. Their
overabundance pattern shows the signature of s-process nucleosynthesis.
Intrinsic, technetium (Tc)-rich S stars are the first objects, on the
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), to undergo third dredge-up (TDU) events. Gaia
exquisite parallaxes now allow to precisely locate these stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Here we report on a population of low-mass,
Tc-rich S stars, previously unaccounted for by stellar evolution models. Aims-
Our aim is to derive parameters of a sample of low-mass Tc-rich S stars and
then, by comparing their location in the HR diagram with stellar evolution
tracks, to derive their masses and to compare their measured s-process
abundance profiles with recently derived STAREVOL nucleosynthetic predictions
for low-mass AGB stars. Methods- The stellar parameters were obtained using a
combination of HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate Gaia Data Release 2
(Gaia-DR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models and newly-designed MARCS model
atmospheres for S-type stars. Results- We report on 6 Tc-rich S stars lying
close to the 1 Msun (initial mass) tracks of AGB stars of the corresponding
metallicity and above the predicted onset of TDU, as expected. This provides
direct evidence for TDUs occurring in AGB stars with initial masses as low as ~
1 Msun and at low luminosity, i.e. at the start of the thermally-pulsing AGB.
We present AGB models producing TDU in those stars with [Fe/H] in the range
-0.25 to -0.5. There is a reasonable agreement between the measured and
predicted s-process abundance profiles. For 2 objects however (CD -29 5912 and
BD +34 1698), the predicted C/O ratio and s-process enhancements do not match
simultaneously the measured ones.

  Our algorithm can be seen as a natural generalization of previous work on Set

optimally exploiting the information present in the sets as well as their
complements, and doing so asymmetrically between queries and stored sets. Doing
so we improve upon the best previous work: MinHash [J. Discrete Algorithms
1998], SimHash [STOC 2002], Spherical LSF [SODA 2016, 2017] and Chosen Path
[STOC 2017] by as much as a factor $n^{0.14}$ in both time and space; or in the
near-constant time regime, in space, by an arbitrarily large polynomial factor.
  Turning the geometric concept, based on Boolean supermajority functions, into
a practical algorithm requires ideas from branching random walks on $\mathbb
Z^2$, for which we give the first non-asymptotic near tight analysis.
  Our lower bounds follow from new hypercontractive arguments, which can be
seen as characterizing the exact family of similarity search problems for which
supermajorities are optimal. The optimality holds for among all hashing based
data structures in the random setting, and by reductions, for 1 cell and 2 cell

various civilian applications, most of which only require a single UAV. In the
near future, it is expected that more and more applications will be enabled by
the cooperation of multiple UAVs. To facilitate such applications, it is
desirable to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However,
existing open-source control platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1)
they only support the leader-follower mode, which limits the design options for
fleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain UAVs and thus
lack of compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a
flight mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real flight.
To address these issues, we propose a general control and monitoring platform
for cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAV, which provides a set of core
cooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity
management, path planning, energy simulation, etc. To verify the applicability
of CoUAV, we design and develop a prototype and we use the new system to
perform an emergency search application that aims to complete a task with the
minimum flying time. To achieve this goal, we design and implement a path
planning service that takes both the UAV network connectivity and coverage into
consideration so as to maximize the efficiency of a fleet. Experimental results
by both simulation and field test demonstrate that the proposed system is
viable.

deficiency issue in the target DML. Most of the current Transfer DML (TDML)
methods are not applicable to the scenario where data are drawn from
heterogeneous domains. Some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL)
approaches can learn target distance metric by usually transforming the samples
of source and target domain into a common subspace. However, these approaches
lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations
are often restricted to be linear. This motivates us to develop a general
flexible heterogeneous TDML (HTDML) framework. In particular, any
(linear/nonlinear) DML algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric
beforehand. Then the pre-learned source metric is represented as a set of
knowledge fragments to help target metric learning. We show how generalization
error in the target domain could be reduced using the proposed transfer
strategy, and develop novel algorithm to learn either linear or nonlinear

fundamental task in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) operations, as
applications often need to know the position of other vehicles over a large
area. In such cases, inter-vehicular communications should be exploited to
satisfy application requirements, although congestion control mechanisms are
required to minimize the packet collision probability. In this work, we face
the issue of achieving accurate vehicle position estimation and prediction in a
VANET scenario. State of the art solutions to the problem try to broadcast the
positioning information periodically, so that vehicles can ensure that the
information their neighbors have about them is never older than the
inter-transmission period. However, the rate of decay of the information is not
deterministic in complex urban scenarios: the movements and maneuvers of
vehicles can often be erratic and unpredictable, making old positioning
information inaccurate or downright misleading. To address this problem, we
propose to use the Quality of Information (QoI) as the decision factor for
broadcasting. We implement a threshold-based strategy to distribute position
information whenever the positioning error passes a reference value, thereby
shifting the objective of the network to limiting the actual positioning error
and guaranteeing quality across the VANET. The threshold-based strategy can
reduce the network load by avoiding the transmission of redundant messages, as
well as improving the overall positioning accuracy by more than 20% in
realistic urban scenarios.

stellar objects (YSOs) by comparing the all-sky digitised photographic plate
surveys provided by SuperCOSMOS with the latest data release from Gaia (DR2).
The long mean baseline of 55 years along with a large sample of class II YSOs
($\simeq$15,000) allows us to study approximately 1 million YSO-years. We find
139 objects with $\Delta R\geq1$~mag, most of which are found at amplitudes
between 1 and 3 mag. The majority of YSOs in this group show irregular
variability or long-lasting fading events, which is best explained as hot spots
due to accretion or by variable extinction. There is a tail of YSOs at $\Delta
R\geq3$~mag and they seem to represent a different population. Surprisingly
many objects in this group show high-amplitude irregular variability over
timescales shorter than 10 years, in contrast with the view that high-amplitude
objects always have long outbursts. However, we find 6 objects that are
consistent with undergoing large, long lasting accretion events, 3 of them
previously unknown. This yields an outburst recurrence timescale of 112 kyr,
with a 68\% confidence interval [74 to 180] kyr. This represents the first
robust determination of the outburst rate in class II YSOs and shows that YSOs
in their planet-forming stage do in fact undergo large accretion events, and
with timescales of $\simeq$100,000 years. In addition, we find that outbursts
in the class II stage are $\simeq$10 times less frequent than during the class
I stage.

learning algorithms and applications. When the labeled information in target
domain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by
leveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multi-task
metric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML,
performs transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume
that the same feature representation is exploited for different domains.
However, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous
domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy
this drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across
different domains. But they are often limited in that only two domains can be
handled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel
heterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework. In HMTML, the
metrics of all different domains are learned together. The transformations
derived from the metrics are utilized to induce a common subspace, and the
high-order covariance among the predictive structures of these domains is
maximized in this subspace. There do exist a few heterogeneous transfer
learning approaches that deal with multiple domains, but the high-order
statistics (correlation information), which can only be exploited by
simultaneously examining all domains, is ignored in these approaches. Compared
with them, the proposed HMTML can effectively explore such high-order
information, thus obtaining more reliable feature transformations and metrics.
Effectiveness of our method is validated by the extensive and intensive
experiments on text categorization, scene classification, and social image
annotation.

formation history of the complex. The optical members of Serpens are
concentrated in three distinct groups located at 380 to 480 pc; the densest
clusters are still highly obscured by optically-thick dust and have few optical
members. The total population of young stars and protostars in Serpens is at
least 2000 stars, including past surveys that were most sensitive to protostars
and disks, and may be far higher. Distances to dark clouds measured from
deficits in star counts are consistent with the distances to the optical star
clusters. The Serpens Molecular Cloud is seen in the foreground of the Aquila
Rift, dark clouds located at 600 to 700 pc, and behind patchy extinction, here
called the Serpens Cirrus, located at ~250 pc. Based on the lack of a
distributed population of older stars, the star formation rate throughout the
Serpens Molecular Cloud increased by at least a factor of 20 within the past ~5
Myr. The optically bright stars in Serpens Northeast are visible because their
natal molecular cloud has been eroded and not because they were flung outwards
from a central factory of star formation. The separation between subclusters of

an external forcing was needed to trigger the active star formation.

It is shown that both approaches lead to different expressions for the

index differing by up to order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, which is within
precision demands for current CMB data. Thus, it is important to resolve this

the extent of this discrepancies by deriving a formula for the spectral index
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in each approach. In doing so, we find
disparities to be more noticeable in a regime where dissipation is comparable
with the expansion rate, which is a very important regime from a
phenomenological point of view. To determine the extent of the discrepancy,
several cases are examined, including quadratic, quartic and hybrid potentials

different modalities to further help reduce feature redundancy in each
modality. The large margin principle employed also helps to extract strongly

invariant side of generative zero-shot learning in this paper. A soul sample is
the meta-representation of one class. It visualizes the most

regularize that each generated sample (the varying side of generative ZSL)

CH giants. They are F- to G-type main-sequence stars polluted with heavy
elements by a binary companion when the latter was on the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB). This companion is now a white dwarf that in most cases cannot be
directly detected. We present a large systematic study of 60 objects classified
as Ba dwarfs or CH subgiants. Combining radial-velocity measurements from
HERMES and SALT high-resolution spectra with radial-velocity data from CORAVEL
and CORALIE, we determine the orbital parameters of 27 systems. We also derive
their masses by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
with evolutionary models. We confirm that Ba dwarfs and CH subgiants are not at
different evolutionary stages and have similar metallicities, despite their
different names. Additionally, Ba giants appear significantly more massive than
their main-sequence analogues. This is likely due to observational biases
against the detection of hotter main-sequence post-mass-transfer objects.
Combining our spectroscopic orbits with the Hipparcos astrometric data, we
derive the orbital inclinations and the mass of the WD companion for four
systems. Since this cannot be done for all systems in our sample yet (but
should be with upcoming Gaia data releases), we also analyse the mass-function
distribution of our binaries. We can model this distribution with very narrow
mass distributions for the two components and random orbital orientation on the
sky. Finally, based on BINSTAR evolutionary models, we suggest that the orbital
evolution of low-mass Ba systems can be affected by a second phase of
interaction along the Red Giant Branch of the Ba star, impacting on the
eccentricities and periods of the giants.

blockchain technology have attracted an increasing interest from both academia

technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental
modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative
consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve
the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other
specific application needs.
  In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the
state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion
of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in
the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for
further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus
protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation,
block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain
consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic
abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are
analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to
different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new
insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their
suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance,
scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide
blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the
state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing
future protocols.

magnetohydrodynamics is more challenging than in non-magnetized fluids due to
the complex interplay between kinetic, magnetic and internal energy at
different scales. Here we extend the sub-grid-scale gradient model, so far used
in the momentum and induction equations, to account also for the unresolved
scales in the energy evolution equation of a compressible ideal MHD fluid with
a generic equation of state. We assess the model by considering box simulations
of the turbulence triggered across a shear layer by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, testing cases where the small-scale dynamics cannot be fully
captured by the resolution considered, such that the efficiency of the
simulated dynamo effect depends on the resolution employed. This lack of
numerical convergence is actually a currently common issue in several
astrophysical problems, where the integral and fastest-growing-instability
scales are too far apart to be fully covered numerically. We perform a-priori
and a-posteriori tests of the extended gradient model. In the former, we find
that, for many different initial conditions and resolutions, the gradient model
outperforms other commonly used models in terms of correlation with the
residuals coming from the filtering of a high-resolution run. In the second
test, we show how a low-resolution run with the gradient model is able to
quantitatively reproduce the evolution of the magnetic energy (the integrated
value and the spectral distribution) coming from higher-resolution runs. This
extension is the first step towards the implementation in relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics.

constrain the underlying astrophysical parameters. Currently, this is mainly
done with Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Recently,
studies using neural networks trained to performed inverse modelling have shown
interesting results. We build on these by improving the accuracy of the
predictions using neural network and exploring other supervised learning
methods: the kernel and ridge regressions. Based on a large training set of
21-cm power spectra, we compare the performances of these supervised learning
methods. When using an un-noised signal as input, we improve on previous neural
network accuracy by one order of magnitude and, using local ridge kernel
regression, we gain another factor of a few. We then reach a rms prediction
error of a few percents of the 1-sigma confidence level due to SKA thermal
noise (as estimated with Bayesian inference). This last performance level
requires optimizing the hyper-parameters of the method: how to do that
perfectly in the case of an unknown signal remains an open question. For an
input signal altered by a SKA-type thermal noise, our neural network recovers
the astrophysical parameter values with an error within half of the 1$\sigma$
confidence level due to the SKA thermal noise. This accuracy improves to 10$\%$
of the 1$\sigma$ level when using the local ridge kernel regression (with
optimized hyper-parameters). We are thus reaching a performance level where
supervised learning methods are a viable alternative to determine the best-fit

proper adjustments of the interaction between the energy and matter currents
offer some important criteria for the performance characterizations of thermal
agents, regardless of the system types and transition protocols. The universal
thermodynamic coupling rule plays a critical role in irreversible processes. A
double quantum dot system is applied to demonstrate that the performances of
heat engines or refrigrators can be enhanced by suitably adjusting the coupling
strength between thermodynamic fluxes.

two datasets, extracted from Wind data in the period 2005-2015, that are
characterised by strong or weak expansion. Expansion affects measurements of
anisotropy because it breaks axisymmetry around the mean magnetic field.
Indeed, the small-scale three-dimensional local anisotropy of magnetic
fluctuations ({\delta}B) as measured by structure functions (SF_B) is
consistent with tube-like structures for strong expansion. When passing to weak
expansion, structures become ribbon-like because of the flattening of SFB along
one of the two perpendicular directions. The power-law index that is consistent
with a spectral slope -5/3 for strong expansion now becomes closer to -3/2.
This index is also characteristic of velocity fluctuations in the solar wind.
We study velocity fluctuations ({\delta}V) to understand if the anisotropy of
their structure functions (SF_V ) also changes with the strength of expansion
and if the difference with the magnetic spectral index is washed out once
anisotropy is accounted for. We find that SF_V is generally flatter than SF_B.
When expansion passes from strong to weak, a further flattening of the
perpendicular SF_V occurs and the small-scale anisotropy switches from
tube-like to ribbon-like structures. These two types of anisotropy, common to
SF_V and SF_B, are associated to distinct large-scale variance anisotropies of
{\delta}B in the strong- and weak-expansion datasets. We conclude that SF_V
shows anisotropic three-dimensional scaling similar to SF_B, with however
systematic flatter scalings, reflecting the difference between global spectral
slopes.

multiply the sky map with a mask that is 0 for the contaminated region and 1
elsewhere, which is also called a top-hat masking. Although it is easy to use,
such top-hat masking is known to suffer from various leakage problems.
Therefore, we want to extend the top-hat masking to a series of semi-analytic
functions called the P-filters. Most importantly, the P-filters can seamlessly
realize the core idea of masking in CMB science, and, meanwhile, guarantee
continuity up to the first derivative everywhere. The P-filters can
significantly reduce many leakage problems without additional cost, including
the leakages due to low-, high-, and band-pass filtering, and the E-to-E,
B-to-B, B-to-E, and E-to-B leakages. The workings of the P-filter are
illustrated by using the WMAP and Planck polarization sky maps. By comparison
to the corresponding WMAP/Planck masks, we show that the P-filter performs much
better than top-hat masking, and meanwhile, has the potential to supersede the
principal idea of masking in CMB science. Compared to mask apodization, the
P-filter is ``outward'', that tends to make proper use of the region that was
marked as 0; whereas apodization is ``inward'', that always kills more signal
in the region marked as 1.

stream, where the probability of inclusion of an item in the sample is
proportional to a weight associated with the item. The unweighted version,
where all weights are equal, is well studied, and admits tight upper and lower
bounds on message complexity. For weighted sampling with replacement, there is
a simple reduction to unweighted sampling with replacement. However, in many
applications the stream has only a few heavy items which may dominate a random
sample when chosen with replacement. Weighted sampling \textit{without
replacement} (weighted SWOR) eludes this issue, since such heavy items can be
sampled at most once.
  In this work, we present the first message-optimal algorithm for weighted
SWOR from a distributed stream. Our algorithm also has optimal space and time
complexity. As an application of our algorithm for weighted SWOR, we derive the
first distributed streaming algorithms for tracking \textit{heavy hitters with
residual error}. Here the goal is to identify stream items that contribute
significantly to the residual stream, once the heaviest items are removed.
Residual heavy hitters generalize the notion of $\ell_1$ heavy hitters and are
important in streams that have a skewed distribution of weights. In addition to
the upper bound, we also provide a lower bound on the message complexity that
is nearly tight up to a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor. Finally, we use our weighted
sampling algorithm to improve the message complexity of distributed $L_1$
tracking, also known as count tracking, which is a widely studied problem in
distributed streaming. We also derive a tight message lower bound, which closes
the message complexity of this fundamental problem.

determine in such a well-constrained system how bulk chemistry is best handled

the abundance of O$_3$ in the 5 K pure O$_2$ ice, as well as both the abundance

appropriately choosing the beam spot size at the diffuser plane, any

utilized to obtain high axial-resolution with large penetration depth and

irrespective of the source temporal coherence length. In addition, PTS could be
an attractive alternative light source for achieving high axial-resolution

of free energy is re-derived with a cut-off parameter and used to obtain the
specific heat of crystal lattices. The new dimensionless thermodynamical
variable is formed as the Planck's inverse temperature divided by the lattice
constant. The dimensionless constant, universal for a class of crystal
lattices, which determines the low temperature region of molar specific heat,
is introduced and tested with the data for diamond lattice crystals. The low
temperature asymptotics of specific heat is found to be the fourth power in
temperature instead of the cubic power law of the Debye theory. Experimental
data for the carbon group elements (silicon, germanium) and other materials
decisively confirm the quartic law. The true low temperature regime of specific
heat is defined by the surface heat, therefore, it depends on geometrical
characteristics of a body, while the absolute zero temperature limit is
geometrically forbidden. The limit on a growth of specific heat at temperatures
close to critical points, known as the Dulong-Petit law, appears from the
lattice constant cut-off. Its value depends on the lattice type and it is the
same for materials with the same crystal lattice. The Dulong-Petit values of
compounds are equal to those of elements with the same crystal lattice type, if
one mole of solid state matter were taken as the Avogadro number of the lattice

whose surface temperatures are above the prediction of the standard neutron
star cooling scenario, and thus require some heating mechanism. Motivated by
these observations, we study the non-equilibrium beta process in the minimal
cooling scenario of neutron stars, which inevitably occurs in pulsars. This
out-of-equilibrium process yields the late time heating in the core of a
neutron star, called the rotochemical heating, and significantly changes the
time evolution of the neutron star surface temperature. To perform a realistic
analysis of this heating effect, we include the singlet proton and triplet
neutron pairing gaps simultaneously in the calculation of the rate and
emissivity of this process, where the dependence of these pairing gaps on the
nucleon density is also taken into account. We then compare the predicted
surface temperature of neutron stars with the latest observational data. We
show the simultaneous inclusion of both proton and neutron gaps is advantageous
for the explanation of the old warm neutron stars since it enhances the heating
effect. It is then found that the observed surface temperatures of the old warm
millisecond pulsars, J2124-3358 and J0437-4715, are explained for various
choices of nucleon gap models. The same setup is compatible with the observed
temperatures of ordinary pulsars including old warm ones, J0108-1431 and

vision, as they are used for defect detection and classification in the
manufacturing industry. Existing systems use hand-crafted features which
require extensive domain knowledge to create. Even though Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have proven successful in many large-scale challenges,
industrial inspection systems have yet barely realized their potential due to
two significant challenges: real-time processing speed requirements and
specialized narrow domain-specific datasets which are sometimes limited in
size. In this paper, we propose CNN models that are specifically designed to
handle capacity and real-time speed requirements of surface inspection systems.
To train and evaluate our network models, we created a surface image dataset
containing more than 22000 labeled images with many types of surface materials
and achieved 98.0% accuracy in binary defect classification. To solve the class
imbalance problem in our datasets, we introduce neural data augmentation
methods which are also applicable to similar domains that suffer from the same
problem. Our results show that deep learning based methods are feasible to be
used in surface inspection systems and outperform traditional methods in
accuracy and inference time by considerable margins.

array of STNOs (first for two and then for 100 oscillators) by means of
injection locking which represents locking the oscillations to a common

the locking of STNOs through both first and second harmonic lockings in an

also show that oscillating microwave current can induce integer harmonic

raising air pollution) and also cooperate with others agents by altering their
emission rate according to the air quality. The agents play an adapted version
of the evolutionary N-Person Prisoners' Dilemma game in a non-deterministic

rewards/penalties are influenced by the pollutant concentration which is, in

the pollution level exceeds the maximum allowed level, agents are penalised
according to their participation. The system has been tested using real data

the regulations enhance the cooperation and may help controlling the air

intertwined black and white clusters. The two-dimensional character of the

a probability $q$, in which case the crossing white pair of sites are deemed
disjoint. If the black pair is disjoint, the white pair is considered
connected. In this scenario we investigate (i) the variation of the Euler
number $\chi(p) \ [=N_B(p)-N_W(p)]$ versus $p$ graph for varying $q$, (ii)
variation of the site percolation threshold with $q$ and (iii) size

in recent years. Modularity and its application have been generating
controversy since some authors argue it is not a metric without disadvantages.
It has been shown that algorithms that use modularity to detect communities
suffer a resolution limit and, therefore, it is unable to identify small
communities in some situations. In this work, we try to apply a density
optimization of communities found by the label propagation algorithm and study
what happens regarding modularity of optimized results. We introduce a metric
we call ADC (Average Density per Community); we use this metric to prove our
optimization provides improvements to the community density obtained with
benchmark algorithms. Additionally, we provide evidence this optimization might
not alter modularity of resulting communities significantly. Additionally, by
also using the SSC (Strongly Connected Components) concept we developed a
community detection algorithm that we also compare with the label propagation
algorithm. These comparisons were executed with several test networks and with
different network sizes. The results of the optimization algorithm proved to be
interesting. Additionally, the results of the community detection algorithm
turned out to be similar to the benchmark algorithm we used.

  Systematic Analysis of Jupyter Notebooks from Research Articles","4 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, In Proceedings of the DAGA 2019 (the
  annual conference of the German Acoustical Society, DEGA)",,,,"cs.DL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the advent of Open Science, researchers have started to publish their
research artefacts (i. e., data, software, and other products of the
investigations) in order to allow others to reproduce their investigations.
While this publication is beneficial for science in general, it often lacks a
comprehensive documentation and completeness with respect to the artefacts.
This, in turn, prevents the successful reproduction of the analyses. Typical
examples are missing scripts, incomplete datasets or specification of used
software. Moreover, issues about licences often create legal concerns. This is
true for the use of commercial software but also for the publication of
research artefacts without proper sharing licence. As a result, the sole
publication of research artefacts does not automatically result in reproducible
research.
  To empirically confirm this, we have been systematically analysing research
publications that also published their investigations as Jupyter notebooks. In
this paper, we present preliminary results of this analysis for five
publications. The results show, that the quality of the published research
artefacts must be improved in order to assure reproducibility.

Deep Neural Networks (DPNNs), image-based design and optimization have been
widely used in multidisciplinary researches. Recently, a Reconstructive Neural
Network (ReConNN) has been proposed to obtain an image-based model from an
analysis-based model [1, 2], and a steady-state heat transfer of a heat sink
has been successfully reconstructed. Commonly, this method is suitable to
handle stable-state problems. However, it has difficulties handling nonlinear
transient impact problems, due to the bottlenecks of the Deep Neural Network
(DPNN). For example, nonlinear transient problems make it difficult for the
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate various reasonable images.
Therefore, in this study, an improved ReConNN method is proposed to address the
mentioned weaknesses. Time-dependent ordered images can be generated.
Furthermore, the improved method is successfully applied in impact simulation
case and engineering experiment. Through the experiments, comparisons and
analyses, the improved method is demonstrated to outperform the former one in
terms of its accuracy, efficiency and costs.

Networks, conferencing and document sharing software, and email, to facilitate
collaboration among employees. During, or at the end of a collaboration,
documents are often produced. People who were not involved in the initial
collaboration often have difficulties understanding parts of its content
because they are lacking the overall context. We argue there is valuable
contextual and collaborative knowledge contained in these tools (content and
use) that can be used to understand the document. Our goal is to rebuild the
conversations that took place over a messaging service and their links with a
digital conferencing tool during document production. The novelty in our
approach is to combine several conversation-threading methods to identify
interesting links between distinct conversations. Specifically we combine
header-field information with social, temporal and semantic proximities. Our
findings suggest the messaging service and conferencing tool are used in a
complementary way. The primary results confirm that combining different
conversation threading approaches is efficient to detect and construct
conversation threads from distinct digital conversations concerning the same
document.

commonly employed on accelerators and nuclear fusion experimental devices. RF
contacts with a current load of 2 kA for steady-state operation were designed
for application to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
device. In contrast to the typical working conditions of general commercial
electrical contacts, those of RF contacts employed on fusion devices include
high vacuum, high temperature, and neutron radiation. CuCrZr is currently of
interest as a base material for the manufacture of louvers of RF contacts,
which has excellent thermal and electrical properties and has low creep rate at
250 {\textdegree}C. In this study, a hard Au coating (Au-Ni) was electroplated
on CuCrZr samples and the samples were then subjected to thermal aging
treatment at 250 {\textdegree}C for 500 h in order to simulate the
vacuum-commissioning process of the ITER. The effects of thermal aging on the
hardness, elastic modulus, crystallite size, and compositions of the coating
were investigated via microstructural and mechanical characterizations of the
coating material. Metal atom migration in different coating layers during
thermal aging was characterized and evaluated via scanning electron
microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy observations of the
cross-sectional surfaces, and the obtained results could be used to directly
select the coating thickness for the final RF contact component. The contact
resistance-an important parameter of the RF contact-was measured in a dedicated
testbed built to simulate fusion reactor conditions between CuCrZr pins and
stainless steel plates coated with Au-Ni and Rh, respectively.
