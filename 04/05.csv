$F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2)$ by means of QCD theory and by state-space
reconstruction from topological data analysis. We first calculate this quantity
in terms of quark-gluon interactions using light cone sum rules (LCSRs). The
spectral density includes radiative corrections in leading, next-to-leading,
and next-to-next-to-leading-order of perturbative QCD. Besides, it takes into
account the twist-four and twist-six terms. The hard-scattering part in the
LCSR is convoluted with various pion distribution amplitudes with different
morphologies in order to obtain a wide range of predictions for the form
factor, including two-loop evolution which accounts for heavy-quark thresholds.
We then use nonlinear time series analysis to extract information on the
long-term $Q^2$ behavior of the measured scaled form factor in terms of
state-space attractors embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These are reconstructed by
applying the Packard-Takens method of delays to appropriate samplings of the
data obtained in the CLEO, \textit{BABAR}, and Belle single-tagged $e^+e^- \to
e^+e^-\pi^0$ experiments. The corresponding lag plots show an aggregation of
states around the value $Q^2F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2) \approx 0.165\pm 0.005$
GeV pertaining to the momentum interval $Q^2\in [9-11]$~GeV$^2$. We argue that
this attractor portrait is a transient precursor of a distribution of states
peaking closer to the asymptotic limit $Q^2F^{\gamma*\gamma\pi^0}(Q^2\to
\infty)=\sqrt{2}f_\pi$~GeV. More data with a regular increment of 1~GeV$^2$ in
the range between 10 and 25~GeV$^2$ would be sufficient to faithfully determine
the terminal portrait of the attractor.

  Autoencoder for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection","Accepted to appear at ICCV 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep autoencoder has been extensively used for anomaly detection. Training on
the normal data, the autoencoder is expected to produce higher reconstruction
error for the abnormal inputs than the normal ones, which is adopted as a
criterion for identifying anomalies. However, this assumption does not always
hold in practice. It has been observed that sometimes the autoencoder
""generalizes"" so well that it can also reconstruct anomalies well, leading to
the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this drawback for autoencoder
based anomaly detector, we propose to augment the autoencoder with a memory
module and develop an improved autoencoder called memory-augmented autoencoder,
i.e. MemAE. Given an input, MemAE firstly obtains the encoding from the encoder
and then uses it as a query to retrieve the most relevant memory items for
reconstruction. At the training stage, the memory contents are updated and are
encouraged to represent the prototypical elements of the normal data. At the
test stage, the learned memory will be fixed, and the reconstruction is
obtained from a few selected memory records of the normal data. The
reconstruction will thus tend to be close to a normal sample. Thus the
reconstructed errors on anomalies will be strengthened for anomaly detection.
MemAE is free of assumptions on the data type and thus general to be applied to
different tasks. Experiments on various datasets prove the excellent
generalization and high effectiveness of the proposed MemAE.

transform is specified by a dense vector field. The two images are encoded as
feature hierarchies by siamese convolutional nets. Then a hierarchy of aligner
modules computes the transform in a coarse-to-fine recursion. Each module
receives as input the transform that was computed by the module at the level
above, aligns the source and target encodings at the same level of the
hierarchy, and then computes an improved approximation to the transform using a
convolutional net. The entire architecture of encoder and aligner nets is
trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the squared error between
source and target remaining after alignment. We show that siamese encoding
enables more accurate alignment than the image pyramids of SPyNet, a previous
deep learning approach to coarse-to-fine alignment. Furthermore,
self-supervision applies even without target values for the transform, unlike
the strongly supervised SPyNet. We also show that our approach outperforms
one-shot approaches to alignment, because the fine pathways in the latter
approach may fail to contribute to alignment accuracy when displacements are
large. As shown by previous one-shot approaches, good results from
self-supervised learning require that the loss function additionally penalize
non-smooth transforms. We demonstrate that ""masking out"" the penalty function
near discontinuities leads to correct recovery of non-smooth transforms. Our
claims are supported by empirical comparisons using images from serial section

up new applications from biomedical imaging to industrial inspection.
Unfortunately, deployment has been limited because small changes in mechanical
deformation (e.g. bending) and temperature can completely scramble optical
information, distorting images. Since such changes are dynamic, correcting them
requires measurement of the fibre transmission matrix (TM) in situ immediately
before imaging. TM calibration typically requires access to both the proximal
and distal facets of the fibre simultaneously, which is not feasible during
most realistic usage scenarios without compromising the thin form factor with
bulky distal optics. Here, we introduce a new approach to determine the TM of
multi-mode fibre (MMF) or multi-core fibre (MCF) in a reflection-mode
configuration without access to the distal facet. A thin stack of structured
metasurface reflectors is used at the distal facet to introduce
wavelength-dependent, spatially heterogeneous reflectance profiles. We derive a
first-order fibre model that compensates these wavelength-dependent changes in
the TM and show that, consequently, the reflected data at 3 wavelengths can be
used to unambiguously reconstruct the full TM by an iterative optimisation
algorithm. We then present a method for sample illumination and imaging
following TM reconstruction. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not
require the TM to be unitary making it applicable to physically realistic fibre
systems. We demonstrate TM reconstruction and imaging first using simulated
non-unitary fibres and noisy reflection matrices, then using much larger
experimentally-measured TMs of a densely-packed MCF, and finally on an
experimentally-measured multi-wavelength set of TMs recorded from a MMF. Our
findings pave the way for online transmission matrix calibration in situ in

\textit{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager}, we examined the connection of
non-neutralized currents and the observed activity in 20 solar active-regions
(ARs). The net current in a given magnetic polarity is algebraic sum of
direct-current (DC) and return-current (RC) and the ratio $|DC/RC|$ is a
measure of degree of net-current-neutralization (NCN). In the emerging ARs, the
non-neutrality of these currents builds with the onset of flux emergence,
following the relaxation to neutrality during the separation motion of bipolar
regions. Accordingly, some emerging ARs are source regions of CMEs occurring at
the time of higher level non-neutrality. ARs in the post-emergence phase can be
CME productive provided they have interacting bipolar regions with converging
and shearing motions. In these cases, the net current evolves with higher level
($>1.3$) of non-neutrality. Differently, the $|DC/RC|$ in flaring and quiet ARs
vary near unity. In all the AR samples, the $|DC/RC|$ is higher for chiral
current density than that for vertical current density. Owing to the fact that
the non-neutralized currents arise in the vicinity of sheared
polarity-inversion-lines (SPILs), the profiles of the total length of SPIL
segments and the degree of NCN follow each other with a positive correlation.
We find that the SPIL is localized as small segments in flaring-ARs whereas it
is long continuous in CME-producing ARs. These observations demonstrate the
dividing line between the CMEs and flares with the difference being in global
or local nature of magnetic shear in the AR that reflected in non-neutralized
currents.

report on the detection of five new periodic sources from a monitoring program
with the Torun 32 m telescope. Variability with a period of 149 to 540 d and
different patterns from sinusoidal-like to intermittent was displayed. Three
dimensional structure of G59.633$-$0.192 determined from the time delays of
burst peaks of the spectral features and high angular resolution map implies
that the emission traces a disk. For this source the 6.7 GHz light curve
followed the infrared variability supporting a radiative scheme of pumping. An
unusual time delay of $\sim$80 d occurred in G30.400$-$0.296 could not be
explained by the light travel time and may suggest a strong differentiation of
physical conditions and excitation in this deeply embedded source. Our
observations suggest the intermittent variability may present a simple response
of maser medium to the underlying variability induced by the accretion
luminosity while other variability patterns may reflect more complex changes in
the physical conditions.

human (or machine) to read a given passage, question pair and select one of the
n given options. The current state of the art model for this task first
computes a question-aware representation for the passage and then selects the
option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when
humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a
combination of elimination and selection. Specifically, a human would first try
to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the passage again in the
light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the
eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the
reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose ElimiNet, a
neural network-based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it
has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the passage,
question pair and if so it tries to make the passage representation orthogonal
to this eliminated option (akin to ignoring portions of the passage
corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of
partial elimination to refine the passage representation and finally uses a
selection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently
released large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current
state of the art model on 7 out of the $13$ question types in this dataset.
Further, we show that taking an ensemble of our elimination-selection based
method with a selection based method gives us an improvement of 3.1% over the
best-reported performance on this dataset.

exhibit a short plateau phase ($\sim 13$ days in the $R$-band) followed by a
rapid decline by $4.5$ mag in $\sim 20 \mathrm{days}$ after the plateau. The
decline rate is larger than those of any standard SNe, and close to those of
rapidly evolving transients. The peak absolute magnitude is $-16.8$ mag in the
$V$-band, which is within the observed range for SNe IIP and rapidly evolving
transients. The spectra of SN 2017czd clearly show the hydrogen features and
resemble those of SNe IIP at first. The H$\alpha$ line, however, does not
evolve much with time and it becomes similar to those in SNe IIb at decline
phase. We calculate the synthetic light curves using a SN IIb progenitor which
has 16 M$_{\odot}$ at the zero-age main sequence and evolves in a binary
system. The model with a low explosion energy ($5\times 10^{50}$ erg) and a low
${}^{56}$Ni mass ($0.003 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) can reproduce the short plateau

We conclude that SN 2017czd might be the first identified weak explosion from a

explained by such a weak explosion of the progenitors with little hydrogen-rich

we examine which attributes of profile and posted images are associated with
depression and anxiety of Twitter users. We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook
users to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and
anxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken
anxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132
Twitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and
extracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the
associations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.
For depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather
than display more negative emotions, likely because of social media
self-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user
(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the
self, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and
low aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of
anxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but
less so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can
be used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that
includes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.
Overall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety
offer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the
psychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the

Emojis. Meanwhile, nuances in Emoji use across cultures may also exist due to
linguistic differences in expressing emotions and diversity in conceptualizing
topics. Indeed, literature in cross-cultural psychology has found both
normative and culture-specific ways in which emotions are expressed. In this
paper, using social media, we compare the Emoji usage based on frequency,
context, and topic associations across countries in the East (China and Japan)
and the West (United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). Across the East and
the West, our study examines a) similarities and differences on the usage of
different categories of Emojis such as People, Food \& Drink, Travel \& Places
etc., b) potential mapping of Emoji use differences with previously identified
cultural differences in users' expression about diverse concepts such as death,
money emotions and family, and c) relative correspondence of validated
psycho-linguistic categories with Ekman's emotions. The analysis of Emoji use
in the East and the West reveals recognizable normative and culture specific
patterns. This research reveals the ways in which Emojis can be used for
cross-cultural communication.

measured metallicities and host masses has now grown to over one hundred,
allowing us to investigate how the distributions of both these properties
change with redshift. Using the combined host galaxy metallicity sample from
Graham & Fruchter (2013) and Kr\""uhler et al. (2015), we find a surprising lack
of evolution in the LGRB metallicity distribution across different redshifts.
In particular, the fraction of LGRB hosts with relatively high metallicity
(12+log(O/H) $\geq$ 8.4) remains essentially constant out to z = 2.5. This
result is at odds with the evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of
typical galaxies, which become progressively more metal poor with increasing
redshift. A similar result is found when converting the LGRB host galaxy mass
distribution taken from the SHOALS (Swift GRB Host Galaxy Legacy Survey) sample
to a corresponding metallicity distribution by applying a redshift-dependent
mass-metallicity relation. The SHOALS sample is compiled using an unbiased
selection function implying that the observed lack of evolution in the host
galaxy high metallicity distribution is not caused by selection effects.
However, the LGRB host galaxy metallicities estimated from the stellar mass are
typically a quarter dex higher at all redshifts than the metallicity we measure
spectroscopically. This implies that using mass-metallicity relationships to
estimate host metallicities will thus produce a substantial systematic bias.

characterize the non-classicality of quantum systems. Most resource theories
focus on quantum states and study their interconversions. Although quantum
channels are generally used as the tool for state manipulation, such a
manipulation capability can be naturally regarded as a generalized quantum
resource, leading to an open research direction in the resource theories of
quantum channels. Various resource-theoretic properties of channels have been
investigated, however, without treating channels themselves as operational
resources that can also be manipulated and converted. In this Letter, we
address this problem by first proposing a general resource framework for
quantum channels and introducing resource monotones based on general distance
quantifiers of channels. We study the interplay between channel and state
resource theories by relating resource monotones of a quantum channel to its
manipulation power of the state resource. Regarding channels as operational
resources, we introduce asymptotic channel distillation and dilution, the most
important tasks in an operational resource theory, and show how to bound the
conversion rates with channel resource monotones. Finally, we apply our results
to quantum coherence as an example and introduce the coherence of channels,
which characterizes the coherence generation ability of channels. We consider
asymptotic channel distillation and dilution with maximally incoherent
operations and find the theory asymptotically irreversible, in contrast to the
asymptotic reversibility of the coherence of states.

that its behaviour depends on the nodes it connects and on an extrinsic slow
variable. We show that, under mild conditions on the weight, there exists a
reduction such that the dynamics of the network are organized by a
transcritical singularity. As such, we detail a slow passage through a
transcritical singularity for a simple network, and we observe that an exchange
between consensus and clustering of the nodes is possible. In contrast to the
classical planar fast-slow transcritical singularity, the network structure of
the system under consideration induces the presence of a maximal canard. Our
main tool of analysis is the blow-up method. Thus, we also focus on tracking
the effects of the blow-up transformation on the network's structure. We show

be extremely successful in the study of quantum quenches in massive field

very simple, this method allows one to obtain analytic predictions for several
observables when the density of excitations produced by the quench is small. At
the same time, a novel generalized hydrodynamic (GHD) approach, which captures
exactly many asymptotic features of the integrable dynamics, has recently been
introduced. Interestingly, also this theory has a natural interpretation in
terms of semiclassical particles and it is then natural to compare the two
approaches. This is the objective of this work: we carry out a systematic
comparison between the two methods in the prototypical example of the
sine-Gordon field theory. In particular, we study the ""bipartitioning protocol""
where the two halves of a system initially prepared at different temperatures
are joined together and then left to evolve unitarily with the same
Hamiltonian. We identify two different limits in which the semiclassical
predictions are analytically recovered from GHD: a particular non-relativistic
limit and the low temperature regime. Interestingly, the transport of
topological charge becomes sub-ballistic in these cases. Away from these limits
we find that the semiclassical predictions are only approximate and, in
contrast to the latter, the transport is always ballistic. This statement seems
to hold true even for the so-called ""hybrid"" semiclassical approach, where
finite time DMRG simulations are used to describe the evolution in the internal

focused on parametrizing individual layers (convolutional or fully connected)

parametrizing it with a single high-order tensor, the modes of which represent
each of the architectural design parameters of the network (e.g. number of
convolutional blocks, depth, number of stacks, input features, etc). This
parametrization allows to regularize the whole network and drastically reduce

study the case of networks with rich structure, namely Fully Convolutional

an infinite family labeled both by the spin structure and the integration cycle

M(Sun) has a profound impact on their subsequent evolution. And yet, the
formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models
has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly
constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically
important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we
assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate
the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up
to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least
4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for
this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits
are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of
overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too
pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints
--- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties.
We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13
additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9
others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions,
supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a
total of 50 binary systems (100 stars).

rapidly increased over the past decade. Volatiles are detected through the gas
that exocomets release as they collide and grind down within their natal belts,
or as they sublimate once scattered inwards to the regions closest to their
host star. Most detections are in young, 10 to a few 100 Myr-old systems that
are undergoing the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. This opens the
exciting possibility to study exocomets at the epoch of volatile delivery to
the inner regions of planetary systems. Detection of molecular and atomic gas
in exocometary belts allows us to estimate molecular ice abundances and overall
elemental abundances, enabling comparison with the Solar Nebula and Solar
System comets. At the same time, observing star-grazing exocomets transiting in
front of their star (for planetary systems viewed edge-on) and exozodiacal dust
in the systems' innermost regions gives unique dynamical insights into the
inward scattering process producing delivery to inner rocky planets. The rapid
advances of this budding subfield of exoplanetary science will continue in the
short term with the upcoming JWST, WFIRST and PLATO missions. In the longer
term, the priority should be to explore the full composition of exocomets,
including species crucial for delivery and later prebiotic synthesis. Doing so
around an increasingly large population of exoplanetary systems is equally
important, to enable comparative studies of young exocomets at the epoch of
volatile delivery. We identify the proposed LUVOIR and Origins flagship
missions as the most promising for a large-scale exploration of exocometary
gas, a crucial component of the chemical heritage of young exo-Earths.

robust method to identify the subsets of satellites that have the most
co-planar orbits. Out of the 11 MW classical dwarf satellites, 8 have highly
clustered orbital planes whose poles are contained within a $22^\circ$ opening
angle centred around $(l,b)=(182^\circ,-2^\circ)$. This configuration stands
out when compared to both isotropic and typical $\Lambda$CDM satellite
distributions. Purely flattened satellite systems are short-lived chance
associations and persist for less than $1~\rm{Gyr}$. In contrast, satellite
subsets that share roughly the same orbital plane are longer lived, with half
of the MW-like systems being at least $4~\rm{Gyrs}$ old. On average, satellite
systems were flatter in the past, with a minimum in their minor-to-major axes
ratio about $9~\rm{Gyrs}$ ago, which is the typical infall time of the
classical satellites. MW-like satellite distributions have on average always
been flatter than the overall population of satellites in MW-mass haloes and,
in particular, they correspond to systems with a high degree of anisotropic
accretion of satellites. We also show that torques induced by the aspherical
mass distribution of the host halo channel some satellite orbits into the

$10^{20}$eV could be produced in the relativistic jets of powerful Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) via a one-shot reacceleration of lower-energy CRs
produced in supernova remnants (the $\textit{espresso}$ mechanism). We test
this theory by propagating particles in realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of ultra-relativistic jets and find that about $10\%$ of the CRs
entering the jet are boosted by at least a factor of $\sim\Gamma^2$ in energy,
where $\Gamma$ is the jet's effective Lorentz factor, in agreement with the
analytical expectations. Furthermore, about $0.1\%$ of the CRs undergo two or
more shots and achieve boosts well in excess of $\Gamma^2$. Particles are
typically accelerated up to the Hillas limit, suggesting that the
$\textit{espresso}$ mechanism may promote galactic-like CRs to UHECRs even in
AGN jets with moderate Lorentz factors, and not in powerful blazars only.
Finally, we find that the sign of the toroidal magnetic field in the jet and in
the cocoon controls the angular distribution of the reaccelerated particles,
leading to a UHECR emission that may be either quasi-isotropic or beamed along
the jet axis. These findings strongly support the idea that $\textit{espresso}$
acceleration in AGN jets can account for the UHECR spectra, chemical
composition, and arrival directions measured by Auger and Telescope Array.

10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$, above which the ISM undergoes a sharp increase in its
level of chemical enrichment. In the $10^{6}-10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$ range the MZR
follows a shallow power-law ($Z\propto M^{\alpha}_*$) with slope
$\alpha=0.14\pm0.08$. At approaching $M_* \simeq 10^{9.5}$M$_{\odot}$ the MZR
steepens significantly, showing a slope of $\alpha=0.37\pm0.08$ in the
$10^{9.5}-10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$ range, and a flattening towards a constant
metallicity at higher stellar masses. This behavior is qualitatively different
from results in the literature that show a single power-law MZR towards the low
mass end. We thoroughly explore systematic uncertainties in our measurement,
and show that the shape of the MZR is not induced by sample selection, aperture
effects, a changing N/O abundance, the adopted methodology used to construct
the MZR, secondary dependencies on star formation activity, nor diffuse ionized
gas (DIG) contamination, but rather on differences in the method used to
measure abundances. High resolution hydrodynamical simulations can
qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of
galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold. The
MZR characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale
height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which
the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to
decrease sharply.

project to study the cosmological formation and evolution of the smallest

resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo ($M_{\rm
halo}=10^{9}~M_\odot$), simulated to redshift $z=0$ at a mass and spatial
resolution of $\sim 20~M_\odot$ and $\sim 3$ pc. We consider different star
formation prescriptions, supernova feedback strengths and on-the-fly radiative
transfer (RT). We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at
this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and
circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm ($\sim 10^4$ K) even before
cosmic reionisation. By contrast, without RT, star formation regulation occurs
only through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows. In
spite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of
models without any feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity
dispersions, $V$-band magnitudes and dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is
because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host
dark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller
than the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity
relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects
more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar
mass. We conclude that the stellar mass-metallicity relation of the very
smallest galaxies provides a unique constraint on galaxy formation physics.

generalize the {\tt enterprise} pulsar timing software to account for possible

study how accurately the parameters of simulated signals can be recovered. We
find that while a pure dipole model can partially recover a pure quadrupole
signal, there is little possibility for confusion when the full model with all

decrease with increasing luminosity on the upper red giant branch, particularly
within the lowest metallicity clusters. While such a phenomena is not predicted

the result of some extra mixing operating during red giant branch ascent which
transports material exposed to the CN(O)-cycle across the radiative zone in the
stellar interior and into the base of the convective envelope, whereupon it is
brought rapidly to the stellar surface. Here we present measurements of [C/Fe]
abundances among 67 red giants in 19 globular clusters within the Milky Way.
Building on the work of Martell et al., we have concentrated on giants with
absolute magnitudes of $M_\mathrm{V} \sim -1.5$ within clusters encompassing a
range of metallicity (-2.4 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -0.3). The Kitt Peak National
Observatory (KPNO) 4 m and Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) 4.1 m
telescopes were used to obtain spectra covering the $\lambda$4300 CH and
$\lambda$3883 CN bands. The CH absorption features in these spectra have been
analyzed via synthetic spectra in order to obtain [C/Fe] abundances. These
abundances and the luminosities of the observed stars were used to infer the
rate at which C abundances change with time during upper red giant branch
evolution (i.e., the mixing efficiency). By establishing rates over a range of
metallicity, the dependence of deep mixing on metallicity is explored. We find
that the inferred carbon depletion rate decreases as a function of metallicity,
although our results are dependent on the initial [C/Fe] composition assumed

especially on a large-scale (i.e. million-level or above) dataset, remains an
open question. A key challenge lies in the complex variations of cluster
patterns, which make it difficult for conventional clustering methods to meet
the needed accuracy. This work explores a novel approach, namely, learning to
cluster instead of relying on hand-crafted criteria. Specifically, we propose a
framework based on graph convolutional network, which combines a detection and
a segmentation module to pinpoint face clusters. Experiments show that our
method yields significantly more accurate face clusters, which, as a result,
also lead to further performance gain in face recognition.

of multiple pathways for their formation. In this work, we compare the halo

of the Milky Way -- a very similar $A$(C)-[Fe/H] pattern is found, providing
clear evidence that halo CEMP-no stars were indeed accreted from their host
mini-halos, similar in nature to those that formed in presently observed
ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We also infer
that the previously noted ""anomalous"" CEMP-no halo stars (with high $A$(C) and
low [Ba/Fe] ratios) that otherwise would be associated with Group I may have
the same origin as the Group III CEMP-no halo stars, by analogy with the
location of several Group III CEMP-no stars in the UFDs and dSphs and their
distinct separation from that of the CEMP-$s$ stars in the $A$(Ba)-$A$(C)
space. Interestingly, CEMP-no stars associated with UFDs include both Group II
and Group III stars, while the more massive dSphs appear to have only Group II
stars. We conclude that understanding the origin of the CEMP-no halo stars

is the high rate of mismatch errors which has been observed to be between 1%

information in the tiles of a system in such a way that the rate of mismatch
errors in the final assembly is reduced even without a reduction in $\epsilon$.
Winfree and Bekbolatov, and Chen and Goel, introduced such error-resilient
systems that reduce the mismatch error rate to $\epsilon^k$ by replacing each
tile in an error-prone system with a $k \times k$ block of tiles in the
error-resilient system, but this increases the number of tile types used by a
factor of $k^2$, and the scale of the pattern produced by a factor of $k$.

is assumed as a distribution over obstacle positions and velocities, which can
be naturally included in the Gaussian process framework. Our approach is

Previous classification methods in the literature relies on filtering the

removing background noise. This pre-filtering process may negatively impact the
classification accuracy. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) using the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) architecture for
classifying images of fish without pre-filtering. Different from conventional
schemes, this scheme is divided into two steps. The first step is to train the
fish classifier via a public data set, i.e., Fish4Knowledge, without using
image augmentation, named as pre-training. The second step is to train the
classifier based on a new data set consisting of species that we are interested
in for classification, named as post-training. The weights obtained from
pre-training are applied to post-training as a priori. This is also known as
transfer learning. Our solution achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of
99.27% accuracy on the pre-training. The accuracy on the post-training is

set-valued map which is the sum of a single-valued continuous map and a locally
closed subset. First we derive a sufficient condition for metric subregularity
which is weaker than the so-called first-order sufficient condition for metric
subregularity (FOSCMS) by adding an extra sequential condition. Then we
introduce a directional version of the quasi-normality and the pseudo-normality
which is stronger than the new {weak} sufficient condition for metric
subregularity but is weaker than the classical quasi-normality and
pseudo-normality respectively. Moreover we introduce a nonsmooth version of the
second-order sufficient condition for metric subregularity and show that it is
a sufficient condition for the new sufficient condition for metric
{sub}regularity to hold. An example is used to illustrate that the directional
pseduo-normality can be weaker than FOSCMS. For the class of set-valued maps
where the single-valued mapping is affine and the abstract set is the union of
finitely many convex polyhedral sets, we show that the pseudo-normality and
hence the directional pseudo-normality holds automatically at each point of the
graph. Finally we apply our results to the complementarity and the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker systems.

applied to machine learning problems such as regression and classification. The
stochastic optimization problems arising in these machine learning problems is
solved using algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). A method
based on estimates of the change in the minimizers and properties of the
optimization algorithm is introduced for adaptively selecting the number of
samples at each time step to ensure that the excess risk, i.e., the expected
gap between the loss achieved by the approximate minimizer produced by the
optimization algorithm and the exact minimizer, does not exceed a target level.
A bound is developed to show that the estimate of the change in the minimizers
is non-trivial provided that the excess risk is small enough. Extensions
relevant to the machine learning setting are considered, including a cost-based
approach to select the number of samples with a cost budget over a fixed

have heterogenous mobility profiles, e.g., some users are moving at high speeds
and some users are static. A new non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)
transmission protocol that incorporates orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
modulation is proposed. Thereby, users with different mobility profiles are
grouped together for the implementation of NOMA. The proposed OTFS-NOMA
protocol is shown to be applicable to both uplink and downlink transmission,
where sophisticated transmit and receive strategies are developed to remove
inter-symbol interference and harvest both multi-path and multi-user diversity.
Analytical results demonstrate that both the high-mobility and low-mobility
users benefit from the application of OTFS-NOMA. In particular, the use of NOMA
allows the spreading of the high-mobility users' signals over a large amount of
time-frequency resources, which enhances the OTFS resolution and improves the
detection reliability. In addition, OTFS-NOMA ensures that low-mobility users
have access to bandwidth resources which in conventional OTFS-orthogonal
multiple access (OTFS-NOMA) would be solely occupied by the high-mobility
users. Thus, OTFS-NOMA improves the spectral efficiency and reduces latency.

different approaches: first the homogeneous DE approach, in which dark energy
does not exhibit fluctuations on cluster scales and the other, clustered DE
scenario in which, dark energy components inside the overdense region collapses
similar to dark matter. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, we investigate
the abundance of virialized halos in the framework of PADE parameterizations.
Specifically, the present analysis shows that the number count of dark matter
halos depends on the evolution of DE parameterizations and clustering
properties of dark energy. Also we show that perturbations in phantom DE
components enhance the growth of matter perturbations. This result were
obtained in the literature for dark energy parameterizations that are phantom
at all redshifts. But we obtained same results for dark energy
parameterizations which are in phantom regime and enter in quintessence region

extends to other physical processes involving QED vacuum fluctuations like the
Lamb shift, pair creation by $\gamma-$rays, van der Waals forces and the
Casimir effect, to the extent that one concentrates on the eventual outcome
resulting by forcing a virtual process to become real, and not on the role of
the black hole role in defining the event horizon. In the nuclear case, the
role of this event is taken over at a microscopic, fully quantum mechanical

is the bottleneck in computation, as is the case for robotic motion planning.
The optimal algorithm in this class, LazySP, lazily restricts edge evaluation
to only the shortest path. Doing so comes at the expense of search effort,
i.e., LazySP must recompute the search tree every time an edge is found to be
invalid. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with large graphs or
highly cluttered environments. Our key insight is the need to balance both edge
evaluation and search effort to minimize the total planning time. Our
contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework, Generalized Lazy
Search (GLS), that seamlessly toggles between search and evaluation to prevent
wasted efforts. We show that for a choice of toggle, GLS is provably more
efficient than LazySP. Second, we leverage prior experience of edge
probabilities to derive GLS policies that minimize expected planning time. We
show that GLS equipped with such priors significantly outperforms competitive
baselines for many simulated environments in R2, SE(2) and 7-DoF manipulation.

show that the RDDI force induced by the SPP fundamentally arises from the
two-body transient entanglement between the atoms. This SPP induced
entanglement force can be continuously tuned from being repulsive to attractive
by varying the polarization of the pulse. We further demonstrate that the
entanglement force can be enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude if
the atomic interactions are mediated by graphene plasmons. These results
demonstrate the potential of shaped SPPs as a powerful tool to manipulate this

in the Kasner-de Sitter space-time as a model of (pre-)inflation. Quantisation
in such an anisotropic background has been argued to be problematic based on
the fact that the initial Kasner singularity, where the spatial anisotropy
blows up, causes divergences to the effective frequencies squared for the
perturbations, which render the standard quantisation procedure relying on the
existence of an adiabatic vacuum state inexecutable. Here, an essential aspect
of the problem is that the ability in determining the quantum spectra of the
fields is restricted. Without its knowledge, one cannot even choose physically
favourable states like the Bunch-Davies vacuum in de Sitter. We here argue that
this difficulty may be circumvented if only there is a period, even if
temporal, after the singularity where certain adiabatic conditions for the
fields are met and the standard procedure of second quantisation can be carried
out within the framework of the WKB approximation. We demonstrate that our
prescription for determining the quantum energy spectrum is useful in making
physically meaningful predictions for the primordial gravitational waves in
triaxially anisotropic Kasner-de Sitter backgrounds. We confirm that, on short
wave-length scales, the resulting spectrum and directional distribution of the
primordial gravitational waves are the same as de Sitter inflation, namely,
scale invariant and isotropic.

high rate throughout their history in order to grow their massive, gigantic
stellar disks and maintain their blue u-r integrated colors. Their disks are
red on the inside and blue on the outside, consistent with inside-out growth.
They tend to have small bulge-to-total (B/T) r-band luminosity ratios,
characteristic of disk building via minor mergers and cold accretion. A large
percentage of super disk galaxies (41%) have double nuclei, double disks, or
other signatures of ongoing mergers. Most (72%) are found in moderate to low
density environments, while the rest are found at the outskirts of clusters. It
is likely that super spirals survive in these environments because they
continue to accrete cold gas and experience only minor mergers at late times,
by virtue of their enormous masses and angular momenta. We suggest that super
post-mergers are the product of super-spiral major mergers and may be the
precursors of some giant elliptical galaxies found in low density environments.

number of prominent self-tracking apps function, there has been relatively
little investigation of the goal-setting and achievement aspects of
self-tracking apps.
  Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular goal setting and
achievement process that is extensive, recorded, and crucial for both the app
and its users' success: weight loss goals in MyFitnessPal. We present a
large-scale study of 1.4 million users and weight loss goals, allowing for an
unprecedented detailed view of how people set and achieve their goals. We find
that, even for difficult long-term goals, behavior within the first 7 days
predicts those who ultimately achieve their goals, that is, those who lose at
least as much weight as they set out to, and those who do not. For instance,
high amounts of early weight loss, which some researchers have classified as
unsustainable, leads to higher goal achievement rates. We also show that early
food intake, self-monitoring motivation, and attitude towards the goal are
important factors. We then show that we can use our findings to predict goal
achievement with an accuracy of 79% ROC AUC just 7 days after a goal is set.
Finally, we discuss how our findings could inform steps to improve goal
achievement in self-tracking apps.

  AA- Bilayer Graphene",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Built on a realistic multiband tight-binding model, mirror symmetry is used
to map a calcium-intercalated bilayer graphene Hamiltonian into two independent
single layer graphene-like Hamiltonians with renormalized hopping. The
quasiparticles exhibit two types of chirality. Here a quasi-particle consists
of two electrons from opposing layers where possess an additional quantum
number called ""cone index"" which can be regarded as the eigenvalue of mirror
symmetry operations. To obtain tight-binding parameters, both effective
monolayer Schrodinger equations are solved analytically and fitted to
first-principles band structure results. Two quasi-particles (four electrons)
can team up to build a Cooper pair with even or odd chirality. Treatment of the
pairing Hamiltonian leads to two decoupled gap equations. The pairing of
quasi-particles with different cone indexes is forbidden. The decoupled gap
equations are solved analytically to obtain all the possible superconducting
phases. Two nearly ""flat bands"" crossing the Fermi energy, each related to the
graphene-like structures, are responsible for two distinct superconductivity
gaps that emerge.
  Depending on how much these bands are affected by the intercalant and which
is closer to the Fermi energy, distorted s-wave or d-wave superconductivity may
become dominant. Numerical calculations reveal that d-wave superconductivity is
dominant in both sectors. For these two dominant phases, within the range of
0-6 K which superconductivity has been observed, numerically the transition
from single-gap to dual-gap superconductivity is possible. Adopting the two-gap
viewpoint of superconductivity in C$_6$CaC$_6$, the dominant $d$-wave states
should have the same critical temperature. Around $T_c=2K$ these two relations
intersect, otherwise, superconductivity has been realized just in one of these
two sectors and disappears in the other one.

Fourier transform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on simple
mathematical models for the imaging systems. These methods are typically fast,

A second type is iterative reconstruction methods based on more complete models
for the imaging system physics and, where appropriate, models for the sensor

and artifacts. The FDA-approved methods among these have been based on
relatively simple regularization models. A third type of methods has been
designed to accommodate modified data acquisition methods, such as reduced

typically involve mathematical image models involving assumptions such as
sparsity or low-rank. A fourth type of methods replaces mathematically designed
models of signals and systems with data-driven or adaptive models inspired by
the field of machine learning. This paper focuses on the two most recent trends
in medical image reconstruction: methods based on sparsity or low-rank models,

challenging domains: Early Modern English and Twitter. Both domains differ
substantially from existing pretraining corpora, and domain-adaptive

partly because such rapid rotation almost contradicts direct inferences from
the p-mode rotational splitting inferred from the same data. Moreover, the
inferred amplitudes of the g modes appear to exceed the upper bound reported by
Appourchaux et al. (2010). It is also suspect because the theory of the

the \emph{physically relevant} analog of past null infinity

$\mathcal{I}^{-}_{0}$ of the $\Lambda=0$ theory, or do some differences persist
even in the limit? We will find that while there are many close similarities,
there are also some subtle but important differences from the asymptotically

causal inference problems into an abstract statistical formalism without
requiring any structure beyond an arbitrarily-indexed family of probability
models. The formalism is simple but can incorporate a variety of causal
modelling frameworks, including 'structural causal models', but also models
expressed in terms of, e.g., differential equations. We focus primarily on the
structural/graphical causal modelling literature, however. Secondly, we
consider the extent to which causal and statistical concerns can be cleanly
separated, examining the fundamental question: 'What can be estimated from
data?'. We call this the problem of estimability. We approach this by analysing
a standard formal definition of 'can be estimated' commonly adopted in the
causal inference literature -- identifiability -- in our abstract statistical
formalism. We use elementary category theory to show that identifiability
implies the existence of a Fisher-consistent estimator, but also show that this
estimator may be discontinuous, and thus unstable, in general. This difficulty
arises because the causal inference problem is, in general, an ill-posed
inverse problem. Inverse problems have three conditions which must be satisfied
to be considered well-posed: existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions.
Here identifiability corresponds to the question of uniqueness; in contrast, we
take estimability to mean satisfaction of all three conditions, i.e.
well-posedness. Lack of stability implies that naive translation of a causally
identifiable quantity into an achievable statistical estimation target may
prove impossible. Our article is primarily expository and aimed at unifying
ideas from multiple fields, though we provide new constructions and proofs.

However, the system is not conformal and the aHydro needed to be improved to
include a realistic prescription for the equation of state which takes care of
non-ideal effect in the dynamics. I have then designed a novel method for
implementing the realistic equation of state (provided by lattice QCD) in the
aHydro formalism. This model, called the quasiparticle aHydro model, integrates
the non-conformal effects in the aHydro model. The non-conformal effects are
due to strong interactions of plasma constituents which leads to
temperature-dependence of the particles' effective mass in the system. Based on
the quasiparticle picture, we have developed the quasiparticle aHydro

example has only one explicit label, superset label learning (SLL) refers to
the problem that a training example can be associated with a set of candidate
labels, and only one of them is correct. Existing SLL methods are either
regularization-based or instance-based, and the latter of which has achieved
state-of-the-art performance. This is because the latest instance-based methods
contain an explicit disambiguation operation that accurately picks up the
groundtruth label of each training example from its ambiguous candidate labels.
However, such disambiguation operation does not fully consider the mutually
exclusive relationship among different candidate labels, so the disambiguated
labels are usually generated in a nondiscriminative way, which is unfavorable
for the instance-based methods to obtain satisfactory performance. To address
this defect, we develop a novel regularization approach for instance-based
superset label (RegISL) learning so that our instance-based method also
inherits the good discriminative ability possessed by the regularization
scheme. Specifically, we employ a graph to represent the training set, and
require the examples that are adjacent on the graph to obtain similar labels.
More importantly, a discrimination term is proposed to enlarge the gap of

As a result, the intrinsic constraints among different candidate labels are
deployed, and the disambiguated labels generated by RegISL are more
discriminative and accurate than those output by existing instance-based
algorithms. The experimental results on various tasks convincingly demonstrate
the superiority of our RegISL to other typical SLL methods in terms of both
training accuracy and test accuracy.

recognition of power quality (PQ) disturbances based on Empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) and $k$ Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) classifier. Since EMD
decomposes a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) in time-domain with
same length of the original signal, it preserves the information that is hidden
in Fourier domain or in wavelet coefficients. In this proposed method, power
signals are decomposed into IMFs in EMD domain. Due to the presence of
non-linearity and noise on the original signal, it is hard to analyze them by
second order statistics. Thus, an effective feature set is developed
considering higher order statistics (HOS) like variance, skewness, and kurtosis
from the decomposed first three IMFs. This feature vector is fed into different
classifiers like $k$-NN, probabilistic neural network (PNN), and radial basis
function (RBF). Among all the classifiers, $k$-NN showed higher classification
accuracy and robustness both in training and testing to detect the PQ
disturbance events. Simulation results evaluated that the proposed HOS-EMD

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in safety-critical environments is severely limited

develops a randomized approach to detecting such perturbations based on minimum
uncertainty metrics that rely on sampling at the hidden layers during the DNN
inference stage. Inspired by Bayesian approaches to uncertainty estimation, the
sampling probabilities are designed for effective detection of the
adversarially corrupted inputs. Being modular, the novel detector of
adversaries can be conveniently employed by any pre-trained DNN at no extra
training overhead. Selecting which units to sample per hidden layer entails
quantifying the amount of DNN output uncertainty, where the overall uncertainty
is expressed in terms of its layer-wise components - what also promotes
scalability. Sampling probabilities are then sought by minimizing uncertainty
measures layer-by-layer, leading to a novel convex optimization problem that
admits an exact solver with superlinear convergence rate. By simplifying the
objective function, low-complexity approximate solvers are also developed. In
addition to valuable insights, these approximations link the novel approach
with state-of-the-art randomized adversarial detectors. The effectiveness of
the novel detectors in the context of competing alternatives is highlighted

predictions have poor probabilistic calibration may be recalibrated by
incorporating past performance information to produce a new forecasting system
that is demonstrably superior to the original, in that one may use it to
consistently win wagers against someone using the original system. The scheme
utilizes Gaussian process (GP) modeling to estimate a probability distribution
over the Probability Integral Transform (PIT) of a scalar predictand. The GP
density estimate gives closed-form access to information entropy measures
associated with the estimated distribution, which allows prediction of winnings
in wagers against the base forecasting system. A separate consequence of the
procedure is that the recalibrated forecast has a uniform expected PIT
distribution. A distinguishing feature of the procedure is that it is
appropriate even if the PIT values are not i.i.d. The recalibration scheme is
formulated in a framework that exploits the deep connections between
information theory, forecasting, and betting. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the scheme in two case studies: a laboratory experiment with a nonlinear

problems in areas such as processor scheduling, deamortization, and buffer
management. At the beginning of the single-processor cup game, $n$ cups are
initially empty. In each step of the game, a filler distributes $1$ unit of
water among the cups, and then an emptier selects a cup and removes $1 +
\epsilon$ units from that cup. The goal of the emptier is to minimize the
amount of water in the fullest cup, also known as the backlog. It is known that
the greedy algorithm (i.e., empty the fullest cup) achieves backlog $O(\log
n)$, and that no deterministic algorithm can do better. We show that the
performance of the greedy algorithm can be greatly improved with a small amount
of randomization: After any step $i$, and for any $k \ge \Omega(\log
\epsilon^{-1})$, the emptier achieves backlog at most $O(k)$ with probability
at least $1 -O(2^{-2^k})$. Whereas bounds for the single-processor cup game
have been known for more than fifteen years, proving nontrivial bounds on

simple analysis of the greedy algorithm for the multi-processor cup game,
establishing a backlog of $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$, as long as $\delta$, the
game's other speed-augmentation constant, is at least $1/poly(n)$. Turning to
randomized algorithms, we encounter an unexpected phenomenon: When the number
of processors $p$ is large, the backlog after each step drops to
\emph{constant} with large probability. Specifically, we show that if $\delta$
and $\epsilon$ satisfy reasonable constraints, then there exists an algorithm
that bounds the backlog after a given step by three or less with probability at
least $1 - O(\exp(-\Omega(\epsilon^2 p))$. We further extend the guarantees of

Gaugings are described by components of the embedding tensor transforming in

$CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ gauge groups while gaugings in $\overline{\mathbf{40}}$

half-supersymmetric domain walls as vacuum solutions. On the other hand,
gaugings involving both $\mathbf{15}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{40}}$ components

groups under consideration are $SO(2,1)\ltimes \mathbf{R}^4$ and
$CSO(2,0,2)\sim SO(2)\ltimes \mathbf{R}^4$. All of the domain wall solutions

flows from the $N=(2,0)$ SCFT to non-conformal $N=(2,0)$ field theories in the
IR. The solutions can be uplifted to eleven dimensions by using a truncation

deep neural networks, thanks to their high performance and fast computation
time. However, these methods are usually trained in a supervised manner, which
requires large number of high quality ground-truth segmentation masks. On the
other hand, classical image segmentation approaches such as level-set methods
are formulated in a self-supervised manner by minimizing energy functions such
as Mumford-Shah functional, so they are still useful to help generation of
segmentation masks without labels. Unfortunately, these algorithms are usually
computationally expensive and often have limitation in semantic segmentation.
In this paper, we propose a novel loss function based on Mumford-Shah
functional that can be used in deep-learning based image segmentation without
or with small labeled data. This loss function is based on the observation that
the softmax layer of deep neural networks has striking similarity to the
characteristic function in the Mumford-Shah functional. We show that the new
loss function enables semi-supervised and unsupervised segmentation. In
addition, our loss function can be also used as a regularized function to
enhance supervised semantic segmentation algorithms. Experimental results on
multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

continuous state and action spaces such as Reservoir Control, Heating
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning, and Navigation domains, it is difficult to
obtain a model of the complex nonlinear dynamics that govern state evolution.
However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allows us to collect large quantities
of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep
neural network models of their state transitions. But there remains one major
problem for the task of control -- how can we plan with deep network learned
transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other
black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not
easily extend to mixed discrete and continuous domains? In this paper, we
introduce two types of nonlinear planning methods that can leverage deep neural
network learned transition models: Hybrid Deep MILP Planner (HD-MILP-Plan) and
Tensorflow Planner (TF-Plan). In HD-MILP-Plan, we make the critical observation
that the Rectified Linear Unit transfer function for deep networks not only
allows faster convergence of model learning, but also permits a direct
compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear
Program encoding. Further, we identify deep network specific optimizations for
HD-MILP-Plan that improve performance over a base encoding and show that we can
plan optimally with respect to the learned deep networks. In TF-Plan, we take
advantage of the efficiency of auto-differentiation tools and GPU-based
computation where we encode a subclass of purely continuous planning problems
as Recurrent Neural Networks and directly optimize the actions through
backpropagation. We compare both planners and show that TF-Plan is able to
approximate the optimal plans found by HD-MILP-Plan in less computation time...

regression. By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps,
image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the FIRST radio
continuum and WISE infrared all sky surveys are first projected down to a
two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way. This embedding can be seen as
a discretised space of shapes with the coordinates reflecting morphological
features as expressed by the automatically derived prototypes. We find that
these prototypes have reconstructed physically meaningful processes across two
channel images at radio and infrared wavelengths in an unsupervised manner. In
the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a
heat-map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis
for transferring the user generated labels. These heat-maps have reduced the
feature space by a factor of 248 and are able to be used as the basis for
subsequent ML methods. Using an ensemble of decision trees we achieve upwards
of 85.7% and 80.7% accuracy when predicting the number of components and peaks

for designing hardware-efficient ConvNets in less than 4 hours. Our
contributions are as follows: 1. Single-path search space: Compared to previous
differentiable NAS methods, Single-Path NAS uses one single-path
over-parameterized ConvNet to encode all architectural decisions with shared
convolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the number of
trainable parameters and the search cost down to few epochs. 2.
Hardware-efficient ImageNet classification: Single-Path NAS achieves 74.96%
top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, which is
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to NAS methods with similar constraints
(<80ms). 3. NAS efficiency: Single-Path NAS search cost is only 8 epochs (30

leptogenesis in partially composite Pati--Salam unification. The
Davidson--Ibarra bound $M_{\nu R1} \gtrsim 10^9$ GeV for the successful thermal
leptogenesis can be recast to the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN) charge of the lopsided
texture. We found the FN charge $n_{\nu1}$ of the lightest right-handed
neutrino $\nu_{R1}$ can not be larger than a upper bound, $n_{\nu1} \lesssim
4.5$. From the viewpoint of unification, the FN charges of the neutrinos
$n_{\nu i}$ should be the same to that of other SM fermions. Then, two cases
$n_{\nu i} = n_{qi} = (3,2,0)$ and $ n_{\nu i} = n_{l i} = (n+1,n,n)$ are
considered. Observations of PS model shows that the case of $n=0$, $n_{li} =
n_{di} = (1,0,0)$ will be the simplest realization. To decrease the FN charges
of these fermions from the GUT invariant FN charges $n_{qi} = (3,2,0)$, we
utilize the partial compositeness. In this picture, the hierarchies of Yukawa
matrices are a consequence of mixings between massless chiral fermions $f_{L},
f'_{R}$ and massive vector fermions $F_{L,R}, F'_{L,R}$. This is induced by the
linear mixing terms $\lambda^{f} \bar f_{L} F_{R}$ and $\lambda^{f'} \bar
F'_{L} f'_{R}$. As a result of the partial compositeness, the decreases of FN
charges require fine-tunings between mass and Yukawa matrices either for the
increases of $\lambda^{f, f'}$ or for the decreases of $M_{F,F'}$. Therefore,
the case for $n=2$ and $n_{di} = n_{li} = (3,2,2)$, which requires only
increases of FN charges will be appropriate to build a natural model.

Several state-of-the-art defenses are shown to be robust against transferable

we further show that our method can be implemented by convolving the gradient

applicable to any gradient-based attack method. Extensive experiments on the
ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our best

However, it is challenging for conventional retrieval systems to match up the

mean-field potential are deactivated in the present comparison. Results are
compared to those from the two reference cases of a chemically equilibrated
ideal gas mixture and of the rate equation. In the results of the numbers of
$\Delta$ and $\pi$, deviations from the reference values are observed in many
codes, and they depend significantly on the size of the time step. These
deviations are tied to different ways in ordering the sequence of collisions

in the reaction rates and the number ratios among the isospin species of
$\Delta$ and $\pi$. These are, however, affected by the correlations, which are

alternating monomeric spin-1 sites and square-plaquette spin-1/2 sites is
investigated using variational technique, localized-magnon approach, exact
diagonalization (ED) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.
The investigated model has in a magnetic field an extraordinarily rich
ground-state phase diagram, which includes the uniform and cluster-based
Haldane phases, two ferrimagnetic phases of Lieb-Mattis type, two quantum spin
liquids and two bound magnon crystals in addition to the fully polarized
ferromagnetic phase. The lowest-energy eigenstates in a highly-frustrated
parameter region belong to flat bands and hence, low-temperature thermodynamics
above the bound magnon-crystal ground states can be satisfactorily described
within the localized-magnon approach. The variational method provides an exact
evidence for the magnon-crystal phase with a character of the monomer-tetramer
ground state at zero field, while another magnon-crystal phase with a single
bound magnon at each square plaquette is found in a high-field region. A
diversity of quantum ground states gives rise to manifold zero-temperature
magnetization curves, which may involve up to four wide intermediate plateaus
at zero, one-sixth, one-third and two-thirds of the saturation magnetization,
two quantum spin-liquid regions and two tiny plateaus at one-ninth and
one-twelfth of the saturation magnetization corresponding to the fragmentized
cluster-based Haldane phases.

developed for calculating the thermal diffusivity from the rear-surface

show how the rear-surface integral method can be applied to a more physically

arbitrary pulse shapes for either a homogeneous sample or a heterogeneous

the aliasing observed in the processed speech waveform via down/up-sampling

maps obtained from September 2014 to July 2016. During two out of three
observing campaigns, observations were performed bi-weekly at 22 and 43 GHz
quasi-simultaneously. At 22 GHz, we identified three jet components near the
core with apparent speeds up to (14.4+/-2.1)c. The timing of the ejection of a
new component detected in 2016 is consistent with a gamma-ray flare in November
2014. At 43 GHz, we found four inner jet (<3 mas) components with speeds from
(3.5+/-1.4)c to (6.8+/-1.5)c. Jet component speeds tend to be higher with
increasing distances from the core. We compared our data with archival Very
Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data from the Boston University (BU) 43 GHz and the
Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE)
15.4 GHz monitoring programs. Whereas MOJAVE data and our data are in good
agreement, jet speeds obtained from the BU Program data in the same time period
are about twice as high as the ones we obtain from the KaVA data. The
discrepancy at 43 GHz indicates that radio arrays with different angular
resolution identify and trace different jet features even when the data are
obtained at the same frequency and at the same time. The flux densities of jet
components decay exponentially, in agreement with a synchrotron cooling time
scale of about 1 year. Using known electron Lorentz factor values (about
9,000), we estimate the magnetic field strength to be around 1-3 micro-Tesla.
When adopting a jet viewing angle of 5 degrees, the intrinsic jet speed is of
order 0.99c.

the most commonly given explanations for collective animal movement is improved
foraging. Animals are hypothesized to gain from searching for food in groups.
Here, we use a computer simulation to analyze how moving in a group assists
searching for food. We use a well-established collective movement model that
only assumes local interactions between individuals without any leadership, in
order to examine the benefits of group searching. We focus on how the sensory
abilities of the simulated individuals, and specifically their ability to
detect food and to follow neighbours, influence searching dynamics and
searching performance. We show that local interactions between neighbors are
sufficient for the formation of groups, which search more efficiently than
independently moving individuals. Once a member of a group finds food, this
information diffuses through the group and results in a convergence of up to
85\% of group members on the food. Interestingly, this convergence behavior can
emerge from the local interactions between group members without a need to
explicitly define it. In order to understand the principles underlying the
group's performance, we perturb many of the model's basic parameters, including
its social, environmental and sensory parameters. We test a wide range of
biological-plausible sensory regimes, relevant to different species and
different sensory modalities and examine how they effect group-foraging
performance. This thorough analysis of model parameters allows for the
generalization of our results to a wide range of organisms, which rely on
different sensory modalities, explaining why they move and forage in groups.

traditional process by allowing the animated motion to become more interactive

reviews how this new type of character animation has evolved and been shaped
from character animation principles and practices. We outline some new
paradigms that aim at allowing character animators to become robot animators,
and to properly take part in the development of social robots. One such
paradigm consists of the 12 principles of robot animation, which describes
general concepts that both animators and robot developers should consider in
order to properly understand each other. We also introduce the concept of
Kinematronics, for specifying the controllable and programmable expressive
abilities of robots, and the Nutty Workflow and Pipeline. The Nutty Pipeline
introduces the concept of the Programmable Robot Animation Engine, which allows
to generate, compose and blend various types of animation sources into a final,
interaction-enabled motion that can be rendered on robots in real-time during
real-world interactions. The Nutty Motion Filter is described and exemplified
as a technique that allows an open-loop motion controller to apply physical
limits to the motion while still allowing to tweak the shape and expressivity
of the resulting motion. Additionally, we describe some types of tools that can
be developed and integrated into Nutty-based workflows and pipelines, which
allow animation artists to perform an integral part of the expressive behaviour
development within social robots, and thus to evolve from standard (3D)
character animators, towards a full-stack type of robot animators.

molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at high temperature
is the focus of a number of theoretical and experimental studies, many of them
motivated by astrophysical applications. We recorded the infrared spectrum of
pyrene C16H10 microcrystals embedded in a KBr pellet over a wide range of
temperature (14 -723 K) and studied the evolution of band positions, widths and
integrated intensities with temperature. We identified jumps for some of the
spectral characteristics of some bands in the [423- 473]K range. These were
attributed to a change of phase from crystal to molten in condensed pyrene,
which appears to affect more strongly bands involving large CH motions.
Empirical anharmonic factors that describe the evolution of band positions and
widths with temperature were retrieved from both phases over an unprecedented
temperature range. The derived values were found to be consistent with
available gas-phase data. We provide recommended values for anharmonic factors
and conclude about the interest of the methodology to provide data of interest
for comparison with theoretical models and as inputs of models that simulate
the infrared emission of astro-PAHs.

polymer-supported gold films. By means of detailed electron backscatter
diffraction analysis we were able to capture both the growth of individual
grains and the evolution of the whole microstructure on the basis of
statistical data over thousands of grains. The experimental data are reported
for three film thicknesses with slightly different microstructures and three
different amplitudes of cyclic mechanical loading. Although different kinds of
grain size evolution with increasing cycle number are observed depending on
film thickness and strain amplitude, a single model based on a thermodynamic
driving force is shown to be capable to explain initiation and stagnation of
grain coarsening in all cases. The main implication of the model is that the
grains having lower individual yield stress are coarsening preferentially.
Besides, it is demonstrated that the existence of local shear stresses imposed
on a grain boundary is not a necessary requirement for room-temperature grain
coarsening.

particle simulations are run to find a possible range of parameters for which
stellar rings can be formed around elliptical galaxies (i.e. Hoag-type
galaxies). A novel combination of particle swarm optimisation and Siamese
neural networks has been implemented to perform the search over the parameter
space and test the level of consistency between observations and simulations
for numerous models. Upon the success of this initial step, we subsequently run
full chemodynamical simulations for the derived range of model parameters in

efficiency and image quality improvement. However, relatively less attention
has been put on video compression using deep learning networks. In the paper,
we first propose a deep learning based bi-predictive coding network, called
BP-DVC Net, for video compression. Learned from the lesson of the conventional
video coding, a B-frame coding structure is incorporated in our BP-DVC Net.
While the bi-predictive coding in the conventional video codecs requires to
transmit to decoder sides the motion vectors for block motion and the residues
from prediction, our BP-DVC Net incorporates optical flow estimation networks
in both encoder and decoder sides so as not to transmit the motion information
to the decoder sides for coding efficiency improvement. Also, a bi-prediction
network in the BP-DVC Net is proposed and used to precisely predict the current
frame and to yield the resulting residues as small as possible. Furthermore,
our BP-DVC Net allows for the compressive feature maps to be entropy-coded
using the temporal context among the feature maps of adjacent frames. The
BP-DVC Net has an end-to-end video compression architecture with newly designed
flow and prediction losses. Experimental results show that the compression
performance of our proposed method is comparable to those of H.264, HEVC in

architectures have often been employed to jointly tackle the tasks at hand.
Such ramified networks typically start with a number of shared layers, after
which different tasks branch out into their own sequence of layers.
Understandably, as the number of possible network configurations is
combinatorially large, deciding what layers to share and where to branch out
becomes cumbersome. Prior works have either relied on ad hoc methods to
determine the level of layer sharing, which is suboptimal, or utilized neural
architecture search techniques to establish the network design, which is
considerably expensive. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and
propose an approach to automatically construct branched multi-task networks, by
leveraging the employed tasks' affinities. Given a specific budget, i.e. number
of learnable parameters, the proposed approach generates architectures, in
which shallow layers are task-agnostic, whereas deeper ones gradually grow more
task-specific. Extensive experimental analysis across numerous, diverse
multi-tasking datasets shows that, for a given budget, our method consistently
yields networks with the highest performance, while for a certain performance
threshold it requires the least amount of learnable parameters.

underlying community structure. Among various vertex clustering approaches,
spectral clustering is one of the most popular methods because it is easy to
implement while often outperforming more traditional clustering algorithms.
However, there are two inherent model selection problems in spectral
clustering, namely estimating both the embedding dimension and number of
clusters. This paper attempts to address the issue by establishing a novel
model selection framework specifically for vertex clustering on graphs under a
stochastic block model. The first contribution is a probabilistic model which
approximates the distribution of the extended spectral embedding of a graph.
The model is constructed based on a theoretical result of asymptotic normality
of the informative part of the embedding, and on a simulation result providing
a conjecture for the limiting behavior of the redundant part of the embedding.
The second contribution is a simultaneous model selection framework. In
contrast with the traditional approaches, our model selection procedure
estimates embedding dimension and number of clusters simultaneously. Based on
our conjectured distributional model, a theorem on the consistency of the
estimates of model parameters is presented, providing support for the validity
of our method. Algorithms for our simultaneous model selection for vertex
clustering are proposed, demonstrating superior performance in simulation
experiments. We illustrate our method via application to a collection of brain
graphs.

and the frictional contacts between particles are numerically studied under
simple and oscillatory shears in terms of the lattice Boltzmann method. We
successfully reproduce the discontinuous shear thickening (DST) under a simple
shear for bulk three-dimensional systems. For our simulation of an oscillatory
shear in a quasi-two-dimensional system, we measure the mechanical response
when we reduce the strain amplitude after the initial oscillations with a
larger strain amplitude. Here, we find the existence of the shear-jammed state
under this protocol in which the storage modulus $G^{\prime}$ is only finite
for high initial strain amplitude $\gamma_0^{I}$. We also find the existence of
the fragile state in which both fluid-like and solid-like responses can be
detected for an identical area fraction and an initial strain amplitude
$\gamma_0^{I}$ depending on the initial phase $\Theta$ (or the asymmetricity of
the applied strain) of the oscillatory shear. We also observe the DST-like
behavior under the oscillatory shear in the fragile state. Moreover, we find
that the stress anisotropy becomes large in the fragile state. Finally, we
confirm that the stress formula based on the angular distribution of the
contact force recovers the contact contributions to the stress tensors for both
simple and oscillatory shears with large strains.

Jarrow, and Morton [Econometrica 60(1), 77-105] under volatility uncertainty.
We model the instantaneous forward rate as a diffusion process driven by a
G-Brownian motion. The G-Brownian motion represents the uncertainty about the
volatility. Within this framework, we derive a sufficient condition for the
absence of arbitrage, known as the drift condition. In contrast to the
traditional model, the drift condition consists of several equations and
several market prices, termed market price of risk and market prices of
uncertainty, respectively. The drift condition is still consistent with the
classical one if there is no volatility uncertainty. Similar to the traditional
model, the risk-neutral dynamics of the forward rate are completely determined
by its diffusion term. The drift condition allows to construct arbitrage-free
term structure models that are completely robust with respect to the
volatility. In particular, we obtain robust versions of classical term
structure models.

optical waves exhibit a number of highly desirable attributes. They move along
a curved or accelerating trajectory while being resilient to perturbations

electric energy into heat through Joule heating, emerges as a promising route
to replace the conventional processing methods. In this work the electrical
behaviour of both uncured and oven cured GNPs/epoxy composites with loadings of
up to 10 wt% were evaluated and electrical percolation thresholds were
established for both. Above the critical loading found for oven cured materials
(8.5 wt%) the electrically conducting networks of GNPs formed in the matrix
showed the ability to act as integrated nanoheaters when an electric current
was passed through them, successfully curing the composites by Joule heating.
Composites prepared by this OoA curing method (as an alternative to the
traditional oven based one) at 10 wt% loading of GNPs were also prepared and
compared to the oven cured ones. They showed more compact composite structures,
with less microvoids and a preferred orientation of the GNPs in the matrix
relative to the oven cured material at identical loading, as revealed by
electron microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy, respectively. This
microstructure and anisotropy induced by the electrically induced (i.e. OoA)
cure led to GNPs/epoxy composites with superior electrical and mechanical
properties (revealed by tensile testing). The well distributed GNP
nanoparticles acting as nanoheaters integrated in a thermosetting matrix, in
combination with excellent mechanical and electrical performances achieved for
the overall graphene/epoxy composites and the simplicity associated to the
method, should open the door to novel industrial applications.

that includes the superfluidity and to understand the impact of pairing on both
the fusion barrier and cross-section. Method: The density-constraint method is
tested first on the following reactions without pairing, $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and
$^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca. A new method is developed, the Density-constraint
Time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method. Using the Gogny-TDHFB code, it
is applied to the reactions $^{20}$O+$^{20}$O and $^{44}$Ca+$^{44}$Ca. Results:
The Gogny approach for systems without pairing reproduces the experimental data
well. The DC-TDHFB method is coherent with the TDHFB fusion threshold. The
effect of the phase-lock mechanism is shown for those reactions. Conclusions:
The DC-TDHFB method is a useful new tool to determine the fusion potential

novelty, in this case, is the global force-free nature of the traction force
field. Such a constraint is absent in the case where the vector field describes
swimming speeds in micro-organisms suspensions. Cell traction is characterized
by means of a complex tensor quantity, that generalizes the nematic orientation
tensor to incorporate the ability of particles to synchronize, and cell
motility depends on this quantity being non-zero. We provide a realization of
migrating cell which comprises an assembly of dipolar elements exerting
traction on a fluid substrate. This model indicates that spontaneous transition
to the motile state is possible but requires (as in the case of
synchronization) non-isochrony of oscillations and involves subtle
synchronization patterns, associated to propagation of waves. Such results are
consistent with recent experimental work relating motility to the

  to 'Center and Scale Prediction: A Box-free Approach for Pedestrian and Face
  Detection'",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object detection generally requires sliding-window classifiers in tradition
or anchor box based predictions in modern deep learning approaches. However,
either of these approaches requires tedious configurations in boxes. In this
paper, we provide a new perspective where detecting objects is motivated as a
high-level semantic feature detection task. Like edges, corners, blobs and
other feature detectors, the proposed detector scans for feature points all
over the image, for which the convolution is naturally suited. However, unlike
these traditional low-level features, the proposed detector goes for a
higher-level abstraction, that is, we are looking for central points where
there are objects, and modern deep models are already capable of such a
high-level semantic abstraction. Besides, like blob detection, we also predict
the scales of the central points, which is also a straightforward convolution.
Therefore, in this paper, pedestrian and face detection is simplified as a
straightforward center and scale prediction task through convolutions. This
way, the proposed method enjoys a box-free setting. Though structurally simple,
it presents competitive accuracy on several challenging benchmarks, including
pedestrian detection and face detection. Furthermore, a cross-dataset
evaluation is performed, demonstrating a superior generalization ability of the
proposed method. Code and models can be accessed at

modelling of microgels at a flat water/oil interface. The model builds on a
realistic description of the internal polymeric architecture and
single-particle properties of the microgel and is able to reproduce its
experimentally observed shape at the interface. Complementing molecular
dynamics simulations with in-situ cryo-electron microscopy experiments and
atomic force microscopy imaging after Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, we compare
the morphology of the microgels for different values of the cross-linking

established based on the extended logarithmic function and the extended

Hinge-Logitron satisfies the classification-calibration condition and shows
reasonable classification performance with low computational cost. The

consistent recovery of the subgraph of probed network nodes, i) despite the
presence of unobserved nodes; and ii) under different connectivity regimes,
including the dense regime where the probed nodes are influenced by many
connections coming from the unobserved ones. We ascertain that suitable
estimators of the combination matrix (i.e., the matrix that quantifies the
pairwise interaction between nodes) possess an identifiability gap that enables
the discrimination between connected and disconnected nodes. Fundamental
conditions are established under which the subgraph of monitored nodes can be
recovered, with high probability as the network size increases, through
universal clustering algorithms. This claim is proved for three matrix
estimators: i) the Granger estimator that adapts to the partial observability
setting the solution that is exact under full observability ; ii) the one-lag
correlation matrix; and iii) the residual estimator based on the difference
between two consecutive time samples. A detailed characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of these estimators is established in terms of an error
bias and of the identifiability gap, and a sample complexity analysis is
performed to establish how the number of samples scales with the network size
to achieve consistent learning. Comparison among the estimators is performed
through illustrative examples that show how estimators that are not optimal in
the full observability regime can outperform the Granger estimator in the
partial observability regime. The analysis reveals that the fundamental
property enabling consistent graph learning is the statistical concentration of
node degrees.

a conventional density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation potential
for the less correlated, less localized orbitals. We implement this self-energy
(plus charge density) self-consistent DFT+DMFT scheme in a basis of maximally
localized Wannier orbitals using Wien2K, wien2wannier, and the DMFT impurity
solver w2dynamics. As a testbed material we apply the method to SrVO$_3$ and
report a significant improvement as compared to previous $d$+$p$ calculations.
In particular the position of the oxygen $p$ bands is reproduced correctly,
which has been a persistent hassle with unwelcome consequences for the $d$-$p$
hybridization and correlation strength. Taking the (linearized) DMFT
self-energy also in the Kohn-Sham equation renders the so-called

higher-order harmonic generations, three-wave and four-wave mixing are typical
phenomena in nonlinear optics. To obtain a nonzero signal for second-harmonic
generation in the long-wavelength limit ($q\rightarrow0$), the breaking of
inversion symmetry is required. In topological materials, a hexagonal warping
term which breaks the rotation symmetry of the Fermi surface is observed by
angular-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES). If a gap opens (e.g., by

use a nonlinear response theory based on a generalized Kubo formula to explain
the frequency up-conversion in topological materials.

immune response against the cancer cells is initiated by the dendritic cells

Consequently, T cells become activated against the tumour cells expressing such
antigens. Moreover, the differences in movement between inactive and active
immune cells are explicitly taken into account by the model. Computational
simulations of our model clarify the conditions for the emergence of tumour
clearance, dormancy or escape, and allow us to assess the impact of antigenic
heterogeneity of cancer cells on the efficacy of immune action. Ultimately, our
results highlight the complex interplay between spatial interactions and
adaptive mechanisms that underpins the immune response against solid tumours,

acoustic analysis via consumer devices (e.g. smartphones) offers a low-cost

identification of SDB sounds, such as snoring, using bottleneck features
learned from a corpus of whole-night sound recordings. Two types of bottleneck
features are described, obtained by applying a deep autoencoder to the output
of an auditory model or a short-term autocorrelation analysis. We investigate
two architectures for snore sound detection: a tandem system and a hybrid
system. In both cases, a `language model' (LM) was incorporated to exploit
information about the sequence of different SDB events. Our results show that
the proposed bottleneck features give better performance than conventional
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, and that the tandem system outperforms the
hybrid system given the limited amount of labelled training data available. The
LM made a small improvement to the performance of both classifiers.

attractive as they aim at strengthening discriminative features and suppressing

Intuitively, the affinities among spatial positions/nodes in the feature map

determined a new optical magnitude estimate at the position the source should

white dwarf sequence in the optical-NIR CMD and suggests that it might be a
very cool (T_eff < 4500 K) white dwarf at the bottom of the white dwarf cooling
sequence in M4, or a white dwarf/brown dwarf binary. We cannot entirely exclude
the possibility that the source is a very massive, bright brown dwarf, or a

cross-correlation function (CCF) and interaural level differences (ILDs). In
contrast to many previous binaural hearing systems, the proposed approach is
not restricted to localisation of sound sources in the frontal hemifield. Due
to the similarity of binaural cues in the frontal and rear hemifields,
front-back confusions often occur. To address this, a head movement strategy is
incorporated in the localisation model to help reduce the front-back errors.
The proposed DNN system is compared to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based

trophic coherence is positively correlated with the time to recovery (0.62 to

issue by proposing a novel framework for binaural sound localisation that
combines model-based information about the spectral characteristics of sound
sources and deep neural networks (DNNs). A target source model and a background
source model are first estimated during a training phase using spectral
features extracted from sound signals in isolation. When the identity of the
background source is not available, a universal background model can be used.
During testing, the source models are used jointly to explain the mixed
observations and improve the localisation process by selectively weighting
source azimuth posteriors output by a DNN-based localisation system. To address
the possible mismatch between training and testing, a model adaptation process
is further employed on-the-fly during testing, which adapts the background
model parameters directly from the noisy observations in an iterative manner.
The proposed system therefore combines model-based and data-driven information
flow within a single computational framework. The evaluation task involved
localisation of a target speech source in the presence of an interfering source
and room reverberation. Our experiments show that by exploiting model-based
information in this way, sound localisation performance can be improved

algorithms are those based on the principles of Elliptic Grid Generation (EGG)
which, in their most basic form, attempt to approximate a mapping operator
whose inverse is composed of harmonic functions. The main challenge lies in
finding a formulation of the problem that is suitable for a computational
approach and a common strategy is to approximate the mapping operator by means
of solving a PDE-problem. PDE-based EGG is well-established in classical
meshing and first generalization attempts to spline-based descriptions (as is
mandatory in IgA) have been made. Unfortunately, all of the practically viable
PDE-based approaches impose certain requirements on the employed spline-basis,
in particular global $C^{\geq 1}$-continuity. This paper discusses a PDE-based
EGG-algorithm for the generation of planar parameterizations with arbitrary
continuity properties (where arbitrary stands for spline bases with global
$C^{\geq 0}$-continuity). A major use case of the proposed algorithm is that of
multi-patch parameterization, made possible by the support of $C^{\geq

large-scale applications. It is discussed for the single-patch case before
generalizing its concepts to multipatch settings. This paper is concluded with

such concurrent solutions, while exploiting relatedness between multiple tasks
performed over the same dataset. In most cases however, this relatedness is not
explicitly defined and the domain expert knowledge that defines it is not
available. To address this issue, we introduce Selective Sharing, a method that
learns the inter-task relatedness from secondary latent features while the

them to share knowledge in a mutually beneficial way. We support our method
with experiments on 5 datasets in classification, regression, and ranking tasks

source code using metrics-based and heuristics-based methods. Machine learning
methods have been recently applied to detect source code smells; however, the
current practices are considered far from mature. Objective: First, explore the
feasibility of applying deep learning models to detect smells without extensive
feature engineering, just by feeding the source code in tokenized form. Second,
investigate the possibility of applying transfer-learning in the context of
deep learning models for smell detection. Method: We use existing metric-based
state-of-the-art methods for detecting three implementation smells and one
design smell in C# code. Using these results as the annotated gold standard, we
train smell detection models on three different deep learning architectures.
These architectures use Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) of one or two
dimensions, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as their principal hidden
layers. For the first objective of our study, we perform training and
evaluation on C# samples, whereas for the second objective, we train the models
from C# code and evaluate the models over Java code samples. We perform the
experiments with various combinations of hyper-parameters for each model.
Results: We find it feasible to detect smells using deep learning methods. Our
comparative experiments find that there is no clearly superior method between
CNN-1D and CNN-2D. We also observe that performance of the deep learning models
is smell-specific. Our transfer-learning experiments show that
transfer-learning is definitely feasible for implementation smells with
performance comparable to that of direct-learning. This work opens up a new
paradigm to detect code smells by transfer-learning especially for the
programming languages where the comprehensive code smell detection tools are
not available.

is a vital task in the monitoring of patients undergoing disease-modifying
treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, the definition of 'new or enlarged'
is not fixed, and it is known that lesion-counting is highly subjective, with
high degree of inter- and intra-rater variability. Automated methods for lesion
quantification hold the potential to make the detection of new and enlarged
lesions consistent and repeatable. However, the majority of lesion segmentation
algorithms are not evaluated for their ability to separate progressive from
stable patients, despite this being a pressing clinical use-case. In this paper
we show that change in volumetric measurements of lesion load alone is not a
good method for performing this separation, even for highly performing
segmentation methods. Instead, we propose a method for identifying lesion
changes of high certainty, and establish on a dataset of longitudinal multiple
sclerosis cases that this method is able to separate progressive from stable
timepoints with a very high level of discrimination (AUC = 0.99), while changes
in lesion volume are much less able to perform this separation (AUC = 0.71).
Validation of the method on a second external dataset confirms that the method
is able to generalize beyond the setting in which it was trained, achieving an
accuracy of 83% in separating stable and progressive timepoints. Both lesion
volume and count have previously been shown to be strong predictors of disease
course across a population. However, we demonstrate that for individual
patients, changes in these measures are not an adequate means of establishing
no evidence of disease activity. Meanwhile, directly detecting tissue which
changes, with high confidence, from non-lesion to lesion is a feasible
methodology for identifying radiologically active patients.

Observations at another epoch are aiming at further characterising these
atmospheric layers and their behaviour with time. The comparison of data from
two epochs should present the basis for more advanced theoretical modelling. In
Cycle 4, both stars were again detected in the same bands as in the earlier
Cycle 2. These early data suggested a flattening of the SED towards longer
wavelengths. Now, the SEDs exhibit a single spectral slope over the entire
frequency range (90 to 675 GHz). The SEDs from Cycle 4 can be fit by power laws
of the form S(f)~f^a with a=1.76+/-0.01 for alpha Cen A and a=1.71+/-0.02 for
alpha Cen B. In addition, we were aiming at clarifying the status of the
recently discovered U source and its relation to the alpha Cen system. Proper
motion data of the U source should establish its relation to the alpha Cen
system, and the submm SED of U should provide information about its physical
nature. For the U source, the upper limits on its proper motion are much
smaller than the pm of alpha Cen, which essentially excludes any physical
relationship with the binary. For the the ALMA-SED of U applies a=2.55+/-0.14.

(CNP), in an orthogonal magnetic field shows an ambipolar behavior of the
transverse resistance accompanied by a puzzling longitudinal magnetoresistance.
When injecting a transverse current at one end of the Hall bar, a sizeable non
local transverse magnetoresistance is measured at low temperature. While Zeeman
spin effect seems not to be able to justify these phenomena, some dissipation
involving edge states at the boundaries could explain the order of magnitude of
the non local transverse magnetoresistance, but not the asymmetry when the
orientation of the orthogonal magnetic field is reversed. As a possible
contribution to the explanation of the measured non local magnetoresistance
which is odd in the magnetic field, we derive a hydrodynamic approach to
transport in this system, which involves particle and hole Dirac carriers, in
the form of charge and energy currents. We find that thermal diffusion can take
place on a large distance scale, thanks to long recombination times, provided a
non insulating bulk of the Hall bar is assumed, as recent models seem to
suggest in order to explain the appearance of the longitudinal resistance. In
presence of the local source, some leakage of carriers from the edges generates
an imbalance of carriers of opposite sign, which are separated in space by the
magnetic field and diffuse along the Hall bar generating a non local transverse
voltage.

For
instance, when a smaller subcluster falls into the gravitational potential of a
more massive cluster, a bow shock is formed and moves together with the
subcluster. After pericenter passage, however, the subcluster is decelerated by
the gravity of the main cluster, while the shock continues moving away from the
cluster center. These shocks are considered as promising candidates for
powering radio relics found in many clusters. The aim of this paper is to
explore the fate of such shocks when they travel to the cluster outskirts, far
from the place where the shocks were initiated. In a uniform medium, such a
""runaway"" shock should weaken with distance. However, as shocks move to large
radii in galaxy clusters, the shock is moving down a steep density gradient
that helps the shock to maintain its strength over a large distance.
Observations and numerical simulations show that, beyond $R_{500}$, gas density
profiles are as steep as, or steeper than, $\sim r^{-3}$, suggesting that there
exists a ""Habitable zone"" for moderately strong shocks in cluster outskirts
where the shock strength can be maintained or even amplified. A characteristic
feature of runaway shocks is that the strong compression, relative to the
initial state, is confined to a narrow region just behind the shock. Therefore,
if such a shock runs over a region with a pre-existing population of
relativistic particles, then the boost in radio emissivity, due to pure
adiabatic compression, will also be confined to a narrow radial shell.

Engineering solid-state band structures to control the non-linear process has

efficiency is shown to increase when Cr dopants are introduced into pure MgO. A
physical picture of the effect of Cr dopants is aided by density functional
theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic structure for pure and doped
samples. This work shows an unambiguous enhancement of the SHG efficiency by
modifying the electronic structure. The observed effects are consistent with an
electronic structure that facilitates the surface induced SHG and demonstrates
a minimal angular dependence. This work highlights the potential of
manipulating the electronic structure of solids to control or test theories of

process of the fragments is described by the statistical code, GEMINI.
Production mechanism and isospin effect of the projectile-like and target-like

migration from the high-isospin density to the low-density matter takes place
in the neutron-rich nuclear reactions, i.e., $^{48}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb,
$^{86}$Kr+$^{48}$Ca/$^{208}$Pb/$^{124}$Sn, $^{136}$Xe+$^{208}$Pb,
$^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn and $^{136}$Xe+$^{136}$Xe. A hard symmetry energy is
available for creating the neutron-rich fragments, in particular in the
medium-mass region. The isospin effect of the neutron to proton (n/p) ratio of
the complex fragments is reduced once including the secondary decay process.
However, a soft symmetry energy enhances the n/p ratio of the light particles,

argued that as the spectral gap closes in dimensions $n\geq 2$, algebraic rates
are the best possible. In this paper, we revisit this issue. We rigorously
calculate the sharp relaxation rates in $L^\infty$ based spaces, both for the

algebraic, but about twice better than the best ones obtained in these early

The target/dump assembly lies at the heart of the facility, with the aim of
safely absorbing the full high intensity Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam,
while maximizing the production of charmed and beauty mesons. High-Z materials
are required for the target/dump, in order to have the shortest possible

average power deposited on target (305 kW) creates a challenge for heat

assess the target assembly design. These studies are described in the present

this self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta$_4$O$_{8+x}$N$_{4-x}$

also leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very

to continue further whilst focusing on recovering services to a functional

by the treating methodology of considering meaningful information across

efficiently. More specifically, we propose convolutional recurrent Gated Graph

tomography images with radiotherapy target. On this dataset, our convolutional
graph network produces state-of-the-art results and outperforms the baselines.
With the addition of interactive setting, performance is improved even further.
Our method has the potential to be easily applied to diverse kinds of medical

are learned using a Mallows ranking model. Bayesian inference leads to
interpretable uncertainties of each individual recommendation, and we also
propose a method to make personalized recommendations based on such
uncertainties. With a simulation study and a real life data example, we
demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art matrix factorization, BMCD makes
personalized recommendations with similar accuracy, while achieving much higher
level of diversity, and producing interpretable and actionable uncertainty

this by using ALMA [CII]158 $\mu$m emission lines for systemic velocities and
deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity profiles available

the [CII]-systemic velocities, and fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260,
CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption lines in the composite spectrum. We

400^{+100}_{-150}\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ on average, respectively, showing no

find that the $v_\rm{max}$ value of our $z=$5-6 galaxies is 3 times higher than
those of $z\sim0$ galaxies and comparable to $z\sim2$ galaxies. Estimating the
halo circular velocity $v_\rm{cir}$ from the stellar masses and the abundance

Interestingly, $v_\rm{max}$ for galaxies with $M_*=10^{10.0-10.8}\

positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related

(dEs) and its environmental dependence, we compare the slopes and intrinsic
scatter of color-magnitude relations (CMRs) for three nearby clusters, Fornax,
Virgo and Coma. Additionally we present and compare internal color profiles of

  We use the imaging of the HST/ACS Fornax cluster in the magnitude range of
-18.7 <= M_g' <= -16.0, to derive magnitudes, colors and color profiles, which
we compare with literature measurements.
  Based on analysis of the color profiles, we report a large number of dEs with
young stellar populations in their center in all three clusters. While for
Virgo and Coma the number of blue-cored dEs is found to be 85 +/- 2% and 53 +/-
3% respectively, for Fornax, we find that all galaxies have a blue core. We
show that bluer cores reside in fainter dEs, similar to the trend seen in
nucleated dEs. We find no correlation between the luminosity of the galaxy and
the size of its blue core. Moreover, a comparison of the CMRs of the three
clusters shows that the scatter in Virgo's CMR is considerably larger than in
the Fornax and Coma clusters. Presenting adaptive smoothing we show that the
galaxies on the blue side of the CMR often show evidence for dust extinction,
which strengthens the interpretation that the bluer colors are due to young
stellar populations. We also find that outliers on the red side of the CMR are
more compact than expected for their luminosity. We find several of these red
outliers in Virgo, often close to more massive galaxies. No red outlying
compact early-types are found in Fornax and Coma in this magnitude range while
we find three in the Virgo cluster. We suggest that the large number of
outliers and larger scatter found for the Virgo cluster CMR is a result of
Virgo's different assembly history.

\bar\nu A$ interactions, when the nucleus conserves its integrity, are
discussed with coherent (elastic) and incoherent (inelastic) scattering regimes
taken into account. In the first regime the nucleus remains in the same quantum
state after the scattering and the cross-section depends on the quadratic
number of nucleons. In the second regime the nucleus changes its quantum state
and the cross-section has an essentially linear dependence on the number of
nucleons. The coherent and incoherent cross-sections are driven by a nuclear
nucleon form-factor squared $|F|^2$ term and a $(1-|F|^2)$ term, respectively.
One has a smooth transition between the regimes of coherent and incoherent
(anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering. Due to the neutral current nature these
elastic and inelastic processes are indistinguishable if the nucleus recoil
energy is only observed. One way to separate the coherent signal from the
incoherent one is to register $\gamma$ quanta from deexcitation of the nucleus
excited during the incoherent scattering. Another way is to use a very
low-energy threshold detector and collect data at very low recoil energies,
where the incoherent scattering is vanishingly small. In particular, for
${}^{133}\text{Cs}$ and neutrino energies of 30--50 MeV the incoherent
cross-section is about 15-20\% of the coherent one. Therefore, the COHERENT
experiment (with ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$) has measured the coherent elastic
neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) with the inelastic admixture at a level
of 15-20\%, if the excitation $\gamma$ quantum escapes its detection.

inspired by Bag-of-Features models is equipped with a Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) branch and trained with weak supervision for WSI classification.
MIL avoids label ambiguity and enhances our model's expressive power without
guiding its attention. We utilize a fine-grained logit heatmap of the models
activations to interpret its decision-making process. The proposed method is
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on two challenging histology
datasets, outperforming a variety of baselines. In addition, two expert
pathologists were consulted regarding the interpretability provided by our
method and acknowledged its potential for integration into several clinical
applications.

Initially, for a
Weyl algebra over a field of characteristic zero, Bernstein's inequality
implies that holonomic bimodules finitely generated from the right or left form
a monoidal category.
  The most important bimodule in this paper is the graph of an endomorphism. We
prove that the graph of an endomorphism of a Weyl algebra over a field of
characteristic zero is a simple bimodule. The simplicity of the tensor product
of the dual graph and the graph is equivalent to the Dixmier conjecture.
  It is also shown how the graph construction leads to a non-commutative
Groebner basis algorithm for detecting invertibility of an endomorphism for
Weyl algebras and computing the inverse over arbitrary fields.

speech enhancement algorithm that combines the non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) dictionary learning algorithm with the generalized
cross-correlation (GCC) spatial localization method. Using a pre-learned
universal NMF dictionary, RT-GCC-NMF operates in a frame-by-frame fashion by
associating individual dictionary atoms to target speech or background
interference based on their estimated time-delay of arrivals (TDOA). We
evaluate RT-GCC-NMF on two-channel mixtures of speech and real-world noise from
the Signal Separation and Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC). We demonstrate that this
approach generalizes to new speakers, acoustic environments, and recording
setups from very little training data, and outperforms all but one of the
algorithms from the SiSEC challenge in terms of overall Perceptual Evaluation
methods for Audio Source Separation (PEASS) scores and compares favourably to
the ideal binary mask baseline. Over a wide range of input SNRs, we show that
this approach simultaneously improves the PEASS and signal to noise ratio
(SNR)-based Blind Source Separation (BSS) Eval objective quality metrics as
well as the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and extended STOI
(ESTOI) objective speech intelligibility metrics. A flexible, soft masking
function in the space of NMF activation coefficients offers real-time control
of the trade-off between interference suppression and target speaker fidelity.
Finally, we use an asymmetric short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to reduce the
inherent algorithmic latency of RT-GCC-NMF from 64 ms to 2 ms with no loss in
performance. We demonstrate that latencies within the tolerable range for

holes through superradiant instabilities, forming macroscopic boson clouds.
This process is most efficient when the Compton wavelength of the boson is
comparable to the size of the black hole horizon, i.e. when the ""gravitational
fine structure constant"" $\alpha\equiv G \mu M/\hbar c\sim 1$. If the black
hole/cloud system is in a binary, tidal perturbations from the companion can
produce resonant transitions between the energy levels of the cloud, depleting
it by an amount that depends on the nature of the transition and on the
parameters of the binary. Previous cloud depletion estimates considered
binaries in circular orbit and made the approximation $\alpha\ll 1$. Here we
use black hole perturbation theory to compute instability rates and decay
widths for generic values of $\alpha$, and we show that this leads to much
larger cloud depletion estimates when $\alpha \gtrsim 0.1$. We also study
eccentric binary orbits. We show that in this case resonances can occur at all
harmonics of the orbital frequency, significantly extending the range of
frequencies where cloud depletion may be observable with gravitational wave
interferometers.

time-periodic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we obtain a tight binding model
in the Floquet space, and we solve these equations in the semiclassical limit.
We observe that the parameter space defined by the contact transparencies and
quartet phase splits into two components with a non-trivial Berry phase. We use
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization to calculate the Berry phase. We find that if
the quantum dot level sits at zero energy, then the Berry phase takes the
values $\varphi_B=0$ or $\varphi_B=\pi$. We demonstrate that this non-trivial
Berry phase can be observed by tunneling spectroscopy in the Floquet spectra.
Consequently, the Floquet-Wannier-Stark ladder spectra of superconducting
multiterminal quantum dots are shifted by half-a-period if $\varphi_B=\pi$. Our
numerical calculations based on Keldysh Green's functions show that this Berry
phase spectral shift can be observed from the quantum dot tunneling density of

There are up to 6 further globular clusters, including $\omega$~Centauri, as

mass in the Sequoia galaxy is $\sim 5 \times 10^{7} M_\odot$, whilst the total
mass is $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$, as judged from abundance matching or from the
total sum of the globular cluster mass. Although clearly less massive than the
Sausage, the Sequoia has a distinct chemo-dynamical signature. The strongly
retrograde Sequoia stars have a typical eccentricity of $\sim0.6$, whereas the
Sausage stars have no clear net rotation and move on predominantly radial

fluid momentum equation is extended within the solid domain using an additional

Using this formulation, a single set of equations is solved over the entire

one using an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework of the immersed boundary (IB) method
and another using a fully-Eulerian approach of the Brinkman penalization (BP)

the discrete incompressible Navier-Stokes system in conservative form. A
consistent transport scheme is employed to advect mass and momentum in the

hard, or even impossible, to measure with acceptable precision, but are
crucially important for the proper description of the dynamics. This
substantially complicates construction of an accurate model for such systems
using data-driven approaches. The present paper illustrates how physical
constraints can be employed to overcome this limitation using the example of a
weakly turbulent quasi-two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow driven by a steady
Lorenz force with an unknown spatial profile. Specifically, the terms involving
latent variables in the partial differential equations governing the dynamics
can be eliminated at the expense of raising the order of that equation. We show
that local polynomial interpolation combined with symbolic regression can
handle sparse data on grids that are representative of typical experimental
measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry. However, we also
find that the reconstructed model is sensitive to measurement noise and trace
this sensitivity to the presence of high order spatial and/or temporal

today, this cosmology has passed over 25 observational tests, often better than
LCDM. The gravitational/Hubble radius R_h therefore appears to be highly
relevant to cosmological theory, and in this paper we begin to explore its
impact on fundamental physics. We calculate the binding energy of a mass m
within the horizon and demonstrate that it is equal to mc^2. This energy is
stored when the particle is at rest near the observer, transitioning to a
purely kinetic form equal to the particle's escape energy when it approaches

due to an exposure and is often interpreted as the proportion of preventable
cases if the exposure could be extinct. Difficulties in the definition and
interpretation of the PAF arise when the exposure of interest depends on time.
Then, the definition of exposed and unexposed individuals is not
straightforward. We propose dynamic prediction and landmarking to define and
estimate a PAF in this data situation. Two estimands are discussed which are
based on two hypothetical interventions that could prevent the exposure in
different ways. Considering the first estimand, at each landmark the estimation
problem is reduced to a time-independent setting. Then, estimation is simply
performed by using a generalized-linear model accounting for the current
exposure state and further (time-varying) covariates. The second estimand is
based on counterfactual outcomes, estimation can be performed using
pseudo-values or inverse-probability weights. The approach is explored in a
simulation study and applied on two data examples. First, we study a large
French database of intensive care unit patients to estimate the
population-benefit of a pathogen-specific intervention that could prevent
ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Moreover, we quantify the population-attributable burden of locoregional and
