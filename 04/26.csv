for Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics (NESP). But recently, Jack and Evans
and Maes have raised concerns about how Max Cal handles dissipative processes.
Here, we show that the problem does not lie in Max Cal; the problem is in the
use of insufficient constraints. We also present an exactly solvable
single-particle model of dissipation, valid far from equilibrium, and its
solution by Maximum Caliber. The model illustrates how the influx and efflux of
work and heat into a flowing system alters the distribution of trajectories.
Maximum Caliber is a viable principle for dissipative systems.

The standard difference-in-difference estimator for a comparative interrupted

not satisfy mechanical equilibrium conditions. When two objects nominally
overlap, a contact surface is defined where the two pressure fields are equal.
This static pressure is supplemented with a dissipative rate-dependent pressure
and friction to determine tractions on the contact surface. The contact wrench
between pairs of objects is an integral of traction contributions over this
surface. The model evaluates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while
showing the essential trends of force, moment, and stiffness increase with
contact load. It yields continuous wrenches even for non-convex objects and
coarse meshes. The method shows promise as sufficiently fast, accurate, and
robust for design-in-simulation of robot controllers.

galaxies. Whilst the traditional spiral sequence is based on a combination of
both measures, and is supposed to favour arm winding where disagreement exists,
we demonstrate that, in modern usage, the spiral classifications Sa-Sd are
predominantly based on bulge size, with no reference to spiral arms.
Furthermore, in a volume limited sample of galaxies with both automated and
visual measures of bulge prominence and spiral arm tightness, there is at best
a weak correlation between the two. Galaxies with small bulges have a wide
range of arm winding, while those with larger bulges favour tighter arms. This
observation, interpreted as revealing a variable winding speed as a function of
bulge size, may be providing evidence that the majority of spiral arms are not
static density waves, but rather wind-up over time. This suggests the ""winding
problem"" could be solved by the constant reforming of spiral arms, rather than
needing a static density wave. We further observe that galaxies exhibiting
strong bars tend have more loosely wound arms at a given bulge size than
unbarred spirals. This observations suggests that the presence of a bar may
slow the winding speed of spirals, and may also drive other processes (such as
density waves) which generate spiral arms. It is remarkable that after over 170
years of observations of spiral arms in galaxies our understanding of them
remains incomplete.

discovery of the TeV halo around the Geminga pulsar. The TeV emission is
believed to originate from inverse Compton scattering of pulsar-injected
electrons/positrons off cosmic microwave background photons. In the mean time,
these electrons should inevitably radiate X-ray photons via the synchrotron
radiation, providing a useful constraint on the magnetic field in the TeV halo.
In this work, we analyse the data of XMM-Newton and Chandra, and obtain an
upper limit for the diffuse X-ray flux in a region of $600''$ around the
Geminga pulsar, which is at a level of $\lesssim 10^{-14}\rm
erg\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Through a numerical modelling on both the X-ray and the
TeV observations assuming isotropic diffusion of injected electrons/positrons,
we find the magnetic field inside the TeV halo is required to be $<1\mu$G,
which is significantly weaker than the typical magnetic field in the
interstellar medium. The weak magnetic field together with the small diffusion
coefficient inferred from HAWC's observation implies that the Bohm limit of
particle diffusion may probably have been achieved in the TeV halo. We also
discuss alternative possibilities for the weak X-ray emission, such as the
hadronic origin of the TeV emission or a specific magnetic field topology, in
which a weak magnetic field and a very small diffusion coefficient might be
avoided.

  Policy Evaluation","Accepted by AAMAS 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal-Difference (TD) learning is a standard and very successful
reinforcement learning approach, at the core of both algorithms that learn the
value of a given policy, as well as algorithms which learn how to improve
policies. TD-learning with eligibility traces provides a way to boost sample
efficiency by temporal credit assignment, i.e. deciding which portion of a
reward should be assigned to predecessor states that occurred at different
previous times, controlled by a parameter $\lambda$. However, tuning this
parameter can be time-consuming, and not tuning it can lead to inefficient
learning. For better sample efficiency of TD-learning, we propose a
meta-learning method for adjusting the eligibility trace parameter, in a
state-dependent manner. The adaptation is achieved with the help of auxiliary
learners that learn distributional information about the update targets online,
incurring roughly the same computational complexity per step as the usual value
learner. Our approach can be used both in on-policy and off-policy learning. We
prove that, under some assumptions, the proposed method improves the overall
quality of the update targets, by minimizing the overall target error. This
method can be viewed as a plugin to assist prediction with function
approximation by meta-learning feature (observation)-based $\lambda$ online, or
even in the control case to assist policy improvement. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates significant performance improvements, as well as improved
robustness of the proposed algorithm to learning rate variation.

$\delta$ the random walk spectral gap. This improves on existing strategies by
initially growing a classical seed set in the graph, from which a quantum walk

new bound on the setup cost of quantum walk search algorithms, (ii) it yields a
new algorithm for $st$-connectivity, and (iii) it allows to create a

mechanism both participating to compaction of bacterial genomes and making
genomic sequences adopt various structural forms. DNA supercoiling may lead to
the formation of braided superstructures (plectonemes), or it may locally
destabilize canonical B-DNA to generate denaturation bubbles, left-handed Z-DNA
and other functional alternative forms. Prediction of the relative fraction of
these structures has been limited because of a lack of predictive polymer
models that can capture the multiscale properties of long DNA molecules. In
this work, we address this issue by extending the self-avoiding rod-like chain
model of DNA so that every site of the chain is allocated with an additional
structural degree of freedom reflecting variations of DNA forms. Efficient
simulations of the model reveal its relevancy to capture multiscale properties
of long chains (here up to 21 kb) as reported in magnetic tweezers experiments.
Well-controlled approximations further lead to accurate analytical estimations
of thermodynamic properties in the high force regime, providing, in combination
with experiments, a simple, yet powerful framework to infer physical parameters
describing alternative forms. In this regard, using simulated data, we find
that extension curves at forces above 2 pN may lead, alone, to erroneous
parameter estimations as a consequence of an underdetermination problem. We
thus revisit published data in light of these findings and discuss the
relevancy of previously proposed sets of parameters for both denatured and
left-handed DNA forms. Altogether, our work paves the way for a scalable
quantitative model of bacterial DNA.

stability conditions for a Markov jump linear system to handle switches

challenging. To improve scalability, we provide two approaches based on convex

dark matter halos acquire the gas to form and fuel galaxies, hot and cold mode
accretion. In cold mode accretion, gas streams along cosmic web filaments to
the center of the halo, allowing for the efficient delivery of star-forming
fuel. Recently, two QSO-illuminated HI Lyman alpha (Ly{\alpha}) emitting
objects were reported to have properties of cold, rotating structures (Martin
et al. 2015, Martin et al. 2016). However, the spatial and spectral resolution
available was insufficient to constrain radial flows associated with connecting
filaments. With the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) we now have eight times the
spatial resolution, permitting the detection of these in-spiraling flows. In
order to detect these inflows, we introduce a suite of models which incorporate
zonal radial flows, demonstrate their performance on a numerical simulation
that exhibits coldflow accretion, and show that they are an excellent match to
KCWI velocity maps of two Ly{\alpha} emitters observed around high-redshift
quasars. These Multi-Filament Inflow models kinematically isolate zones of
radial inflow that correspond to extended filamentary emission. The derived gas

quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators and axion insulators. Up till now, such
magnetic topological insulators are obtained by doping topological insulators

disorders that hinder further exploration of quantum effects in the material.
Here, we resolve this dilemma by probing quantum transport in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
thin flake - a topological insulator with intrinsic magnetic order. In this
layered van der Waals crystal, the ferromagnetic layers couple anti-parallel to
each other, so MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is an antiferromagnet. A magnetic field, however,
aligns all the layers and induces an interlayer ferromagnetic order; we show
that a quantized anomalous Hall response emerges in atomically thin
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ under a moderate magnetic field. MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ therefore
becomes the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator exhibiting quantized
anomalous Hall effect. The result establishes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as an ideal arena

the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. In particular, there is
considerable evidence for Kondo destruction: a disappearance of the static
Kondo singlet amplitude that results in a sudden reconstruction of Fermi
surface across the quantum critical point and an extra critical energy scale.
This effect can be analyzed in terms of a dynamical interplay between the Kondo
and RKKY interactions. In the Kondo-destroyed phase, a well-defined Kondo
resonance is lost, but Kondo singlet correlations remain at nonzero
frequencies. This dynamical effect allows for mass enhancement in the
Kondo-destroyed phase. Here, we elucidate the dynamical Kondo effect in
Bose-Fermi Kondo/Anderson models, which unambiguously exhibit Kondo-destruction
quantum critical points. We show that a simple physical quantity---the
expectation value $\langle {\bf S}_{f} \cdot {\bf s}_{c} \rangle$ for the dot
product of the local ($f$) and conduction-electron ($c$) spins---varies
continuously across such quantum critical points. A nonzero $\langle {\bf
S}_{f} \cdot {\bf s}_{c} \rangle$ manifests the dynamical Kondo effect that
operates in the Kondo-destroyed phase. Implications are discussed for the
stability of Kondo-destruction quantum criticality as well as the understanding
of experimental results in quantum critical heavy-fermion metals.

infinite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system's nonlinear
dynamics through the linear evolution of functions of the state space.
Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system's
global nonlinear features. We demonstrate how the presence of symmetries
affects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we
show that symmetry considerations can also simplify finding the Koopman
operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode
decomposition methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Specifically, representation
theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces block
diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization.
Practically, if the data is symmetric, the EDMD and kernel DMD methods can be
modified to give more efficient computation of the Koopman operator
approximation and its eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out

scenario in which the gravitational collapse of large inhomogeneities at the

form of primordial black holes (PBHs). This is due to the sudden drop in
radiation pressure during the transition from a quark-gluon plasma to
non-relativistic hadrons. The collapse to a PBH is induced by fluctuations of a
light spectator scalar field in rare regions and is accompanied by the violent
expulsion of surrounding material, which might be regarded as a sort of
""primordial supernova"" . The acceleration of protons to relativistic speeds
provides the ingredients for efficient baryogenesis around the collapsing
regions and its subsequent propagation to the rest of the Universe. This
scenario naturally explains why the observed BAU is of order the PBH collapse
fraction and why the baryons and dark matter have comparable densities. The
predicted PBH mass distribution ranges from sub-solar to several hundred solar
masses. This is compatible with current observational constraints and could
explain the rate, mass and low spin of the black hole mergers detected by
LIGO-Virgo. Future observations will soon be able to test this scenario.

themselves through a rapid metal-insulator transition in the bulk electrical

strongly nonlinear dependence on the applied bias voltage. We probe the spin
texture of the solids using a modified Corbino geometry that allows
ferromagnetic magnons to be launched and detected. We find that magnon
transport is highly efficient when one Landau level is filled ($\nu=1$),
consistent with quantum Hall ferromagnetic spin polarization; however, even
minimal doping immediately quenches the the magnon signal while leaving the
vanishing low-temperature charge conductivity unchanged. Our results can be
understood by the formation of a solid of charged skyrmions near $\nu=1$, whose
noncolinear spin texture leads to rapid magnon decay. Data near fractional

fix is anti-aliasing by low-pass filtering before downsampling. However, simply
inserting this module into deep networks degrades performance; as a result, it
is seldomly used today. We show that when integrated correctly, it is

classification, across several commonly-used architectures, such as ResNet,

running-coupling improved $k_T$-factorized formula, we calculate bulk
observables in several heavy-ion collision systems. This is done in two ways:
first we calculate the particle distribution directly implied from the CGC
model, and we compare this to the case where it is instead used as initial
conditions for a hybrid hydrodynamic simulation. In this way, we can assess the
effects of hydrodynamic and hadronic evolution by quantifying how much they
change the results from a pure initial state approach and, therefore, to what
extent initial condition models can be directly compared to experimental data.
We find that entropy production in subsequent hydrodynamic evolution can
increase multiplicity by as much as 50\%. However, disregarding a single
overall normalization factor, the centrality, energy, and system size
dependence of charged hadron multiplicity is only affected at the $\sim$5\%
level. Because of this, the parameter-free prediction for these dependencies
gives reasonable agreement with experimental data whether or not hydrodynamic
evolution is included. On the other hand, our model results are not compatible
with the hypothesis that hydrodynamic evolution is present in large systems,
but not small systems like p-Pb, in which case the dependence of multiplicity
on system size would be stronger than seen experimentally. Moreover, we find
that hydrodynamic evolution significantly changes the distribution of momentum,
so that observables such as mean transverse momentum are very different from
the initial particle production, and much closer to measured data. Finally, we
find that a good agreement to anisotropic flow data cannot be achieved due to
the large eccentricity generated by this model.

used the MULTI2.3 program to compute LTE and NLTE equivalent widths of spectral

analyses of extra-galactic stellar populations. We used ATLAS12 model

individual stars in the model SSP. The NLTE and LTE equivalent widths
calculated for the individual stars were combined to calculate the SSP NLTE

cases, and often exceed 0.1 dex. In particular, LTE abundances of Mn are
consistently under-estimated by 0.3 dex for all optical lines of Mn I studied
in this work. On the other hand, Ba II, and Mg I lines show a strong
differential effect: the NLTE abundance corrections for the individual stars
and integrated light spectra are close to zero for the low-excitation lines,
but they amount to -0.15 dex for the strong high-excitation lines. Our results
emphasise the need to take NLTE effects into account in the analysis of spectra

low-accretion states in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and using newly available
photographic plates, we identify pre-discovery low states in 1965, 1966, and
1974. The primary focus of our analysis, however, is an extensive set of
time-series photometry obtained between 2002 and 2018, with particularly
intensive coverage of the 2016-2018 low states. After computing an updated spin
ephemeris for the white dwarf (WD), we show that its spin period began to
increase in 2014 after having spent 27 years decreasing; no other intermediate
polar has experienced a sign change of its period derivative, but FO Aqr has
now done so twice. Our central finding is that the recent low states all
occurred shortly after the WD began to spin down, even though no low states
were reported in the preceding quarter-century, when it was spinning up.
Additionally, the system's mode of accretion is extremely sensitive to the
mass-transfer rate, with accretion being almost exclusively disk-fed when FO
Aqr is brighter than V~14 and substantially stream-fed when it is not. Even in
the low states, a grazing eclipse remains detectable, confirming the presence
of a disk-like structure (but not necessarily a Keplerian accretion disk). We
relate these various observations to theoretical predictions that during the
low state, the system's accretion disk dissipates into a non-Keplerian ring of
diamagnetic blobs. Finally, a new XMM-Newton observation from a high state in

thermalization times for 2-point functions are significantly (approximately
three times) larger than those of 1-point functions. Magnetic field and charge
amplify this difference, generally increasing thermalization times. However,
there is also a competition of scales between charge density, magnetic field,

spanning the radial profiles around the MW and M31. This agreement does not
depend strongly on satellite mass, even at distances <~ 100 kpc. Host-to-host
variation dominates the scatter in satellite counts within 300 kpc of the
hosts, while time variation dominates scatter within 50 kpc. More massive host
galaxies within our sample have fewer satellites at small distances, likely
because of enhanced tidal destruction of satellites via the baryonic disks of
host galaxies. Furthermore, we quantify and provide fits to the tidal depletion
of subhalos in baryonic relative to dark matter-only simulations as a function
of distance. Our simulated profiles imply observational incompleteness in the
LG even at Mstar >~ 10^5 Msun: we predict 2-10 such satellites to be discovered

entire large [O III] extended regions of OIIIB-4, unlike the known green peas
whose strong [O III] emission region is compact. Moreover, OIIIB-4 presents no
high ionization emission lines, unlike green beans that have extended [O III]
emission with a type-2 AGN. OIIIB-4 is thus a giant green pea, which is a low
stellar mass ($7\times10^7$ $M_\odot$) galaxy with a very high specific star
formation rate (sSFR = $2\times10^2\, {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$), a high ionization
parameter ($q_{ion} \sim 3\times10^8\, {\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$), and a low
metallicity similar to those of green peas. Neither an AGN-light echo nor a
fast radiative shock likely takes place due to the line diagnostics for
spatially-resolved components of OIIIB-4 and no detections of He
II$\lambda$4686 or [Ne V]$\lambda\lambda$3346,3426 lines that are
fast-radiative shock signatures. There is a possibility that the
spatially-extended [O III] emission of OIIIB-4 is originated from outflowing
gas produced by the intense star formation in a density-bounded ionization
state.

formed far apart, occasionally occur in the same location and at the same time,
thus challenging our understanding of reconnection and heating of the lower

fibrils and hot and dense coronal plasma. The emergence of a untwisted magnetic
flux sheet, injected $2.5$~Mm below the photosphere, is studied as it pierces
the photosphere and interacts with the preexisting ambient field. Specifically,
we aim to study whether EBs and UV bursts are generated as a result of such
flux emergence and examine their physical relationship. The Bifrost radiative
magnetohydrodynamics code was used to model flux emerging into a model
atmosphere that contained a fairly strong ambient field, constraining the
emerging field to a limited volume wherein multiple reconnection events occur
as the field breaks through the photosphere and expands into the outer
atmosphere. Synthetic spectra of the different reconnection events were
computed using the $1.5$D RH code and the fully 3D MULTI3D code. The formation
of UV bursts and EBs at intensities and with line profiles that are highly
reminiscent of observed spectra are understood to be a result of the
reconnection of emerging flux with itself in a long-lasting current sheet that
extends over several scale heights through the chromosphere. Synthetic
diagnostics suggest that there are no compelling reasons to assume that UV
bursts occur in the photosphere. Instead, EBs and UV bursts are occasionally
formed at opposite ends of a long current sheet that resides in an extended
bubble of cool gas.

factory architectural layouts that divide a single factory into spatially
distributed factories located throughout the processor. We find that
distributed factory architectures minimize the space-time volume overhead
imposed by distillation. Additionally, we find that the number of distributed
components in each optimal configuration is sensitive to application
characteristics and underlying physical device error rates. More specifically,
we find that the rate at which T-gates are demanded by an application has a
significant impact on the optimal distillation architecture. We develop an
optimization procedure that discovers the optimal number of factory
distillation rounds and number of output magic states per factory, as well as
an overall system architecture that interacts with the factories. This yields
between a 10x and 20x resource reduction compared to commonly accepted single
factory designs. Performance is analyzed across representative application
classes such as quantum simulation and quantum chemistry.

several distinctive geometrical aspects, such as excitations with restricted

rank gauge fields. In this paper, we investigate possible effective field
theories for 3D fracton order, by presenting a general philosophy whereby
topological-like actions for such higher-rank gauge fields can be constructed.
Our approach draws inspiration from Chern-Simons and BF theories in 2+1
dimensions, and imposes constraints binding higher-rank gauge charge to
higher-rank gauge flux. We show that the resulting fractonic Chern-Simons and
BF theories reproduce many of the interesting features of their familiar 2D

in detail, and show that upon quantization it realizes a gapped fracton order
with quasiparticle excitations that are mobile only along a sub-set of
1-dimensional lines, and display a form of fractional self-statistics. The
ground state degeneracy of this theory is both topology- and geometry-
dependent, scaling exponentially with the linear system size when the model is

that adding a product to an assortment will not increase the choice probability

relaxes this assumption and can model a wider range of customer behavior, such
as decoy effects between products. In this model, each customer type is
associated with a binary decision tree, which represents a decision process for
making a purchase based on checking for the existence of specific products in
the assortment. Together with a probability distribution over customer types,
we show that the resulting model -- a decision forest -- is able to represent
any customer choice model, including models that are inconsistent with weak
rationality. We theoretically characterize the depth of the forest needed to
fit a data set of historical assortments and prove that with high probability,
a forest whose depth scales logarithmically in the number of assortments is
sufficient to fit most data sets. We also propose two practical algorithms --
one based on column generation and one based on random sampling -- for
estimating such models from data. Using synthetic data and real transaction
data exhibiting non-rational behavior, we show that the model outperforms both
rational and non-rational benchmark models in out-of-sample predictive ability.

from localized ""hotspots"" on the stellar surface occurring where large-scale

modeling has primarily been limited to simple models, such as circular
antipodal emitting regions with constant temperature. We calculate more
realistic temperature distributions within the polar caps, taking advantage of
recent advances in magnetospheric theory, and we consider their effect on the
predicted lightcurves. The emitting regions are non-circular even for a pure
dipole magnetic field, and the inclusion of an aligned magnetic quadrupole
moment introduces a north-south asymmetry. As the aligned quadrupole moment is
increased, one hotspot grows in size before becoming a thin ring surrounding
the star. For the pure dipole case, moving to the more realistic model changes
the lightcurves by $5-10\%$ for millisecond pulsars, helping to quantify the
systematic uncertainty present in current dipolar models. Including the
quadrupole gives considerable freedom in generating more complex lightcurves.
We explore whether these simple dipole+quadrupole models can account for the
qualitative features of the lightcurve of PSR J0437$-$4715.

in computational advertising. Lately, embedding techniques that produce
low-dimensional representations of ad IDs drastically improve CTR prediction
accuracies. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work
poorly on new ads with little logging data, which is known as the cold-start
problem.
  In this paper, we aim to improve CTR predictions during both the cold-start
phase and the warm-up phase when a new ad is added to the candidate pool. We
propose Meta-Embedding, a meta-learning-based approach that learns to generate
desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs. The proposed method trains an
embedding generator for new ad IDs by making use of previously learned ads
through gradient-based meta-learning. In other words, our method learns how to
learn better embeddings. When a new ad comes, the trained generator initializes
the embedding of its ID by feeding its contents and attributes. Next, the
generated embedding can speed up the model fitting during the warm-up phase
when a few labeled examples are available, compared to the existing
initialization methods.
  Experimental results on three real-world datasets showed that Meta-Embedding
can significantly improve both the cold-start and warm-up performances for six
existing CTR prediction models, ranging from lightweight models such as
Factorization Machines to complicated deep models such as PNN and DeepFM. All
of the above apply to conversion rate (CVR) predictions as well.

constrain the distances to these pulsars, placing them on the far-side of the

the independent distance measurements to these and other pulsars near the GC

absent in the unitary evolution because of the initialization of the state,
there is always an emergent conformal symmetry in the long time limit. The
emergence of this dynamic conformal symmetry is robust, and always occurs; it
uniquely defines the characteristics of the asymptotic dynamics at a scale

of the microscopic density matrices, we have focused on the effects of this

time behaviour of these observables is completely set by conformal symmetry,
while the leading long time corrections depend on interference effects between
different conformal tower states. The emergent conformal symmetry naturally
leads to entropy conservation, and {\em conformal cooling}, an energy
conserving cooling of a strongly interacting gas during free expansion. When
the interaction Hamiltonian breaks the scale symmetry, we further demonstrate
that there is a direct cause-effect relation between conformal symmetry
breaking in the long time limit, and a non-vanishing entropy production. This
suggests that the entropy production rate is a natural {\em parameter} for
categorizing the breaking of conformal symmetry.

at which information can be transferred to recover a sender's information at
the receiver with a vanishingly low error probability. After verifying their
equivalence with estimates based on the continuous phase data, we determined
the mutual information using the time points at which the individual phases

on the dynamics may resemble, e.g., neural spike times, that are common

also increased processing speed significantly, rendering it particularly
suitable for a fine-grained analysis of the effects of experimental and model
parameters. In our model, the delayed mutual information within each
subpopulation peaked at zero delay, whereas between the subpopulations it was
always maximal at non-zero delay, irrespective of parameter choices. We
observed that the delayed mutual information of the desynchronized
subpopulation preceded the synchronized subpopulation. Put differently, the
oscillators of the desynchronized subpopulation were 'driving' the ones in the
synchronized subpopulation. These findings were also observed when estimating
mutual information of the full phase trajectories. We can thus conclude that
the delayed mutual information of discrete time points allows for inferring a
functional directed flow of information between subpopulations of coupled phase

The proposed scheme is shown to outperform a few of the well--known earlier

Here we present a high-performance Python package called pawpyseed, which can
read PAW DFT wave functions and calculate the overlap between wavefunctions
from different structures. Using pawpyseed, we implement a new band shifting
correction derived from first order perturbation theory. We benchmark this
method by calculating the transition levels of several point defects in silicon
and comparing to experimental and hybrid functional results. The new band
shifting method can shift single-particle energies to improve transition level
predictions and can be automated and parallelized using pawpyseed, suggesting
it could be a useful method for high-throughput point defect calculations.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In reality, IDSs can be defined as a

The high diversity of network attacks in addition to the need for
generalization, motivate us to propose a semi-supervised method. Inspired by
the successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for training deep
models in semi-unsupervised setting, we have proposed an end-to-end deep

underlying concept of the normal traffic class. The key idea of this paper is
to compensate the lack of anomalous traffic by approximately obtain them from
normal flows. In this case, our method is not biased towards the available
intrusions in the training set leading to more accurate detection. The proposed

shells to dynamically compress matter or magnetic fields, including magnetised
target fusion schemes. This paper examines the effect of fluid rotation on the
Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) driven growth of perturbations at the inner surface of an
imploding cylindrical liquid shell which compresses a gas-filled cavity. The
shell was formed by rotating water in solid body rotation prior to the
piston-driven implosion, which was propelled by a modest external gas pressure.
The fast rise in pressure in the gas-filled cavity at the point of maximum
convergence results in an RT unstable configuration where the cavity surface
accelerates in the direction of the density gradient at the interface. The
experimental arrangement allowed for visualization of the cavity surface during
the implosion using high-speed videography, while offering the possibility to
provide geometrically similar implosions over a wide range of initial angular
velocities such that the effect of rotation on the interface stability could be
quantified. A model developed for the growth of perturbations on the inner
surface indicated that the RT instability may be suppressed by rotating the
liquid shell at a sufficient angular velocity so that the net surface
acceleration remains opposite to the interface density gradient throughout the
implosion. Rotational stabilisation of high-mode-number perturbation growth was
examined by collapsing nominally smooth cavities and demonstrating the
suppression of spray-like perturbations that appear on RT unstable cavity
surfaces. Experiments observing the evolution of low-mode-number perturbations,
prescribed using a mode-6 obstacle plate, showed that the RT-driven growth was
suppressed by rotation, while geometric growth remained along with significant
non-linear distortion of the perturbations near final convergence.

can be used for sparse recovery on the rotation group. The mutual coherence,
however, is used to assess the performance of deterministic and regular sensing

sensing matrices with the worst possible mutual coherence, and therefore are
undesirable for sparse recovery. Using tools from angular momentum analysis in
quantum mechanics, we provide a new expression for the mutual coherence, which
encourages the use of regular elevation samples. We construct low coherence
deterministic matrices by fixing the regular samples on the elevation and
minimizing the mutual coherence over the azimuth-polarization choice. It is
shown that once the elevation sampling is fixed, the mutual coherence has a
lower bound that depends only on the elevation samples. This lower bound,
however, can be achieved for spherical harmonics, which leads to new sensing
matrices with better coherence than other representative regular sampling
patterns. This is reflected as well in our numerical experiments where our
proposed sampling patterns perfectly match the phase transition of random

linear and four non-linear) $Q_1=3Hb\rho_{D}$, $Q_2=3Hb\rho_{m}$,
$Q_3=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_m\right)$,
$Q_4=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\frac{\rho_{D}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$,
$Q_5=3Hb\left(\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{m}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$,
$Q_6=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{D}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$,
$Q_7=3Hb\left(\rho_{D}+\rho_{m}+\frac{\rho_{m}^2}{\rho_{D}+\rho_m}\right)$
respectively. To find the best model we apply Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and use the $\Lambda$CDM as the
referring model for comparison. Using AIC and BIC models selection method we
note that the $Q_1$ and $Q_4$ interaction terms are favored by observational
data within the context of the holographic Ricci dark energy models. The
obtained results also demonstrated that the considered types of holographic
Ricci dark energy model are not favored by observational data since the
$\Lambda$CDM is considered as the reference model. We also observed that the
values of the deceleration parameter and the transition redshift for all models
are compatible with the latest observational data and Planck 2015. In addition,
we studied the jerk parameter for all models. Using our modified CAMB code, we
observed that the interacting models suppress the CMB spectrum at low
multi-poles and enhances the acoustic peaks.

Diameter (the largest shortest paths distance) and Radius (the smallest
distance for which a ""center"" node can reach all other nodes). The natural and
important $ST$-variant considers two subsets $S$ and $T$ of the vertex set and
lets the $ST$-diameter be the maximum distance between a node in $S$ and a node
in $T$, and the $ST$-radius be the minimum distance for a node of $S$ to reach
all nodes of $T$. The bichromatic variant is the special case in which $S$ and
$T$ partition the vertex set.
  In this paper we present a comprehensive study of the approximability of $ST$
and Bichromatic Diameter, Radius, and Eccentricities, and variants, in graphs
with and without directions and weights. We give the first nontrivial
approximation algorithms for most of these problems, including time/accuracy
trade-off upper and lower bounds. We show that nearly all of our obtained
bounds are tight under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), or the
related Hitting Set Hypothesis.
  For instance, for Bichromatic Diameter in undirected weighted graphs with $m$
edges, we present an $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time $5/3$-approximation algorithm,
and show that under SETH, neither the running time, nor the approximation
factor can be significantly improved while keeping the other unchanged.

probabilities and thus fits into a predictive framework for semiclassical
quantum cosmology. We find that the amplitude is low for large anisotropies. In
the isotropic limit the usual Hartle-Hawking wave function for the de Sitter
minisuperspace model is recovered. Inhomogeneous perturbations in an extended
minisuperspace are shown to be initially in their ground state. We also
demonstrate that the precise mathematical implementation of the no-boundary
proposal as a functional integral in minisuperspace depends on detailed aspects
of the model, including the choice of gauge-fixing. This shows in particular
that the choice of contour cannot be fundamental, adding weight to the recent
proposal that the semiclassical no-boundary wave function should be defined
solely in terms of a collection of saddle points. We adopt this approach in
most of this paper. Finally we show that the semiclassical tunneling wave
function of the universe is essentially equal to the no-boundary state in this
particular minisuperspace model, at least in the subset of the classical domain
where the former is known.

distance of $120''$ ($\sim 5.6\ {\rm kpc}$) along the major axis, corresponding

the galaxy that are distinct in the combined stellar dynamics/populations
space, which implies distinct formation paths. We find evidence for a
dynamically-cold, metal-rich disk, consistent with a gradual in-situ formation.
This disk is embedded in a generally-old population of stars, with kinematics
ranging from dispersion-dominated in the centre to an old, diffuse, metal-poor
stellar halo at the extremities. We find also a direct correlation between the
dominant dynamical support of these components, and their associated age, akin
to the relation observed in the Milky Way. This approach not only provides a
powerful model for inferring the formation history of external galaxies, but
also paves the way to a complete population-dynamical model.

Comments are welcome",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an alternative approach for constructing invariant
Jeffreys prior distributions tailored for hierarchical or multilevel models. In
particular, our proposal is based on a flexible decomposition of the Fisher
information for hierarchical models which overcomes the marginalization step of
the likelihood of model parameters. The Fisher information matrix for the
hierarchical model is derived from the Hessian of the Kullback-Liebler (KL)
divergence for the model in a neighborhood of the parameter value of interest.
Properties of the KL divergence are used to prove the proposed decomposition.
Our proposal takes advantage of the hierarchy and leads to an alternative way
of computing Jeffreys priors for the hyperparameters and an upper bound for the
prior information. While the Jeffreys prior gives the minimum information about
parameters, the proposed bound gives an upper limit for the information put in
any prior distribution. A prior with information above that limit may be
considered too informative. From a practical point of view, the proposed prior
may be evaluated computationally as part of a MCMC algorithm. This property
might be essential for modeling setups with many levels in which analytic
marginalization is not feasible. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposal
with examples in mixture models, in model selection priors such as lasso and in
the Student-t model.

is difficult to collect real-world IR images for special purposes, including
space exploration, military and fire-fighting applications. To solve this
problem, we created color visible and IR images using a Unity-based 3D game
editor. These synthetically generated color visible and IR images were used to
train cycle consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) to convert visible
images to IR images. CycleGAN has the advantage that it does not require
precisely matching visible and IR pairs for transformation training. In this
study, we discovered that additional synthetic data can help improve CycleGAN
performance. Neural network training using real data (N = 20) performed more
accurate transformations than training using real (N = 10) and synthetic (N =
10) data combinations. The result indicates that the synthetic data cannot
exceed the quality of the real data. Neural network training using real (N =
10) and synthetic (N = 100) data combinations showed almost the same
performance as training using real data (N = 20). At least 10 times more
synthetic data than real data is required to achieve the same performance. In
summary, CycleGAN is used with synthetic data to improve the IR image
conversion performance of visible images.

measuring the spatial temperature fluctuation power spectrum from the EoR. The
KDE estimates the underlying probability distribution function of fluctuations
as a function of spatial scale, and contains different systematic biases and
errors to the typical approach to estimating the fluctuation power spectrum.
Extraction of histograms of visibilities allows moments analysis to be used to
discriminate foregrounds from 21 cm signal and thermal noise. We use the
information available in the histograms, along with the statistical
dis-similarity of foregrounds from two independent observing fields, to
robustly separate foregrounds from cosmological signal, while making no
assumptions about the Gaussianity of the signal. Using two independent
observing fields to robustly discriminate signal from foregrounds is crucial
for the analysis presented in this paper. We apply the techniques to 13 hours
of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) EoR data over two observing fields. We
compare the output to that obtained with a comparative power spectrum
estimation method, and demonstrate the reduced foreground contamination using
this approach. Using the second moment obtained directly from the KDE
distribution functions yields a factor of 2-3 improvement in power for k <
0.3hMpc^{-1} compared with a matched delay space power estimator, while
weighting data by additional statistics does not offer significant improvement

To do this, we introduce a new continuous-spin process we call the median

way, we study the time-infinity agreement clusters of the median process, show
that they are a.s. finite, and deduce that all continuous spins flip finitely

By assuming linear viscoelasticity, the effective transient elasticity and

Curie point, even at compositions where the transition appears second order
from magnetic measurements. No weak ferromagnetic order could be detected at
Si-poor compositions showing the kinetic arrest phenomenon, but rather the
phase separation of fully ferromagnetic domains from volume fractions where Mn
spins are fluctuating. The more pronounced decrease of the ordered moment at
the $3f$ sites on approaching $T_C$, characteristic of the mixed magnetism of
these materials, is demonstrated to be driven by a vanishing spin density
rather than enhanced spin fluctuations at the $3f$ site. An upper limit of
0.03~$\mu_B$ is set for the fluctuating Mn moment at the $3f$ site by the
direct detection of a $^{55}$Mn NMR resonance peak in the Mn-rich samples above

secondary peak observed at the same compositions reveals however the
disproportionation of a significant $3f$-Mn fraction with negligible hyperfine
couplings, which retains its diamagnetic character across the transition, down
to the lowest available temperatures. Such a diamagnetic fraction qualitatively
accounts for the reduced average $3f$ moment previously reported at large Mn

mass protoplanetary disc around an eccentric binary undergoes damped nodal
oscillations of tilt angle and longitude of ascending node. Dissipation causes
evolution towards a stationary state of polar alignment in which the disc lies
perpendicular to the binary orbital plane with angular momentum aligned to the
eccentricity vector of the binary. We use hydrodynamic simulations and analytic
methods to investigate how the mass of the disc affects this process. The
simulations suggest that a disc with nonzero mass settles into a stationary
state in the frame of the binary, the generalised polar state, at somewhat
lower levels of misalignment with respect to the binary orbital plane, in
agreement with the analytic model. Provided that discs settle into this
generalised polar state, the observational determination of the misalignment
angle and binary properties can be used to determine the mass of a circumbinary
disc. We apply this constraint to the circumbinary disc in HD 98800. We obtain
analytic criteria for polar alignment of a circumbinary ring with mass that
approximately agree with the simulation results. Very broad misaligned discs
undergo breaking, but the inner regions at least may still evolve to a polar
state. The long term evolution of the disc depends on the evolution of the
binary eccentricity that we find tends to decrease. Although the range of
parameters required for polar alignment decreases somewhat with increasing disc
mass, such alignment appears possible for a broad set of initial conditions
expected in protostellar circumbinary discs.

the Kolmogorov $\epsilon$-capacity to packing sets of overlap at most $\delta$,
and is a variation of a previous definition proposed by one of the authors.
Results are then extended to more general noise models, and to non-stochastic,
memoryless, stationary channels. Finally, sufficient conditions are established
for the factorization of the $\delta$-mutual information and to obtain a single

presented theory admits the possibility of decoding errors as in Shannon's

problems, but their training process tends to require immense amounts of

training methods that require small labeled training sets is an important
research direction that will allow a more effective use of resources.Among
current approaches designed to address this issue, two are particularly
interesting: data augmentation and active learning. Data augmentation achieves
this goal by artificially generating new training points, while active learning
relies on the selection of the ""most informative"" subset of unlabeled training

augmentation can waste computational resources because it indiscriminately
generates samples that are not guaranteed to be informative, and active

method in infinitesimal freeness. More precisely, we provide the solution for
the following problem: suppose that $A_1(N),\dots,A_k(N)$ are self-adjoint
$N\times N$ random matrices which are asymptotically infinitesimally free for
$N\to \infty$, let $p$ be a self-adjoint polynomial in $k$ non-commuting

infinitesimal distribution of $P$ in terms of the asymptotic infinitesimal
distributions of $A_1(N),\dots,A_k(N)$?
  Firstly, we consider the infinitesimal freeness in the operator-valued
framework, and we show that the operator-valued infinitesimal free independence
is equivalent to the operator-valued free independence over an algebra of
$2\times 2$ upper triangular matrices. Then we introduce the notion of
operator-valued infinitesimal cumulants and study its properties. We deduce
that the operator valued infinitesimal freeness is equivalent to the vanishing
of our mixed cumulants. Moreover, we establish the formula to obtain the free
additive convolution, in the context of operator valued infinitesimal freeness.
Combining these new results with Anderson's linearization trick, we give the
algorithmic solution of the above problem.

semi-implicit time-stepping method is employed to transform the nonlinear

finding of our study is that the newly proposed mesh-free finite volume method
based on circular control volumes reduces to the collocation method as the
radius limits to zero. Both methods produce a large constrained least-squares
problem that must be solved at each time step in the advancement of the
solution. We have found that regularization yields a relatively

An extensive numerical investigation is performed to illustrate the

cannot be explained by hadronic production accompanied by cold and hot medium

with that expected from the Au nucleus and shows a hint of interference.
Comparison of the measurements to theoretical calculations of coherent
production shows that the excess yield can be described reasonably well and
reveals a partial disruption of coherent production in semi-central collisions,
perhaps due to the violent hadronic interactions. Incorporating theoretical
calculations, the results strongly suggest that the dramatic enhancement of
J/$\psi$ yield observed at extremely low $p_{T}$ originates from coherent
photon-nucleus interactions. In particular, coherently produced J/$\psi$'s in
violent hadronic collisions may provide a novel probe of the

in statistical applications with low signal-to-noise ratio. This problem is
particularly challenging in settings with heteroscedastic noise. In certain
signal-plus-noise models of data, such as the classical spiked covariance model
and its variants, there are closed formulas for the spectral signal detection
threshold (the largest sample eigenvalue attributable solely to noise) for
isotropic noise in the limit of infinitely large data matrices. However, more
general noise models currently lack provably fast and accurate methods for
numerically evaluating the threshold.
  In this work, we introduce a rapid algorithm for evaluating the spectral
signal detection threshold in the limit of infinitely large data matrices. We
consider noise matrices with a separable variance profile (whose variance
matrix is rank one), as these arise often in applications. The solution is
based on nested applications of Newton's method. We also devise a new algorithm
for evaluating the Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution at real
values exceeding the threshold. The Stieltjes transform on this domain is known
to be a key quantity in parameter estimation for spectral denoising methods.
The correctness of both algorithms is proven from a detailed analysis of the
master equations characterizing the Stieltjes transform, and their performance
is demonstrated in numerical experiments.

complicated microscopic reaction mechanism in biological, chemical and physical
systems. Especially, the exchange of hydrogen to deuterium is a standard
approach to investigate kinetics and pathways of a wide spectrum of key
reactions involving proton transfer. However, KIE in electrocatalysis is still
challenge. One main reason is owing to the high sensitivity to impurities in
electrochemical systems. Aiming to establish an appropriate approach to observe
KIE in electrocatalysis, we investigated KIE in electrocatalysis by using fully
deuterated ultrapure electrolytes. With these electrolytes, we studied oxygen
reduction reaction with platinum catalyst, which is well-known to be sensitive

degenerate open quantum systems, where the dynamics is induced by
time-dependent fluctuating loop paths in control parameter space. For weak
system-bath coupling, the fluctuations around a deterministic base path obey
Gaussian statistics, where we assume that the quantum adiabatic theorem is also
satisfied for fluctuating paths. We show that universal non-Abelian geometric
dephasing (NAGD) contributions are contained in the fluctuation-averaged
evolution operator. This operator plays a key role in all experimental
protocols proposed in this work for the detection of NAGD. In particular, we
formulate interference measurements providing full access to NAGD. Apart from a
factor due to the dynamic phase and its fluctuations, the averaged evolution
operator contains the averaged Berry matrix. A polar decomposition of this
non-unitary matrix into the product of a unitary, $V$, and a positive
semi-definite Hermitian matrix, $R$, reveals the physics of the NAGD
contributions. Unlike the conventional dynamic dephasing rate, the NAGD
eigenrates encoded by $R$ depend on the loop orientation sense and, in
particular, change sign under a reversal of the direction. A negative rate then
implies amplification of coherences as compared to the ones when only dynamic
dephasing is present. The non-Abelian character of geometric dephasing is
rooted in the non-commutativity of $V$ and $R$ and causes smoking-gun
signatures in interference experiments. We also clarify why systems subject to
topological protection do not show geometric dephasing. Without full
protection, however, geometric dephasing can arise and has to be taken into
account. As concrete application, we propose spin-echo NAGD detection protocols

measurement. We do not confirm a significant decrease in the lag for HKL in
2013-2014 previously reported by Schnulle et al. (2015), but we find that the
lag of the short-lag component of J increased. We discuss our results within
the framework of the standard model, where the variable infrared radiation is
mainly due to the thermal re-emission of short-wave radiation by dust clouds
close to a variable central source. There is also some contribution to the IR
emission from the accretion disk, and this contribution increases with
decreasing wavelength. The variability in J and K is not entirely simultaneous,
which may be due to the differing contributions of the radiation from the
accretion disk in these bands. The absence of strong wavelength-dependent
changes in infrared lag across the HKL passbands can be explained by having the
dust clouds during 2010-2015 be located beyond the sublimation radius. The
relative wavelength independence of the infrared lags is also consistent with
the hollow bi-conical outflow model of Oknyansky et al. (2015).

relies on the collective dynamics of single microtubules. However, the
connection between macroscopic fluid flows and microscopic motion of
microtubules remains unclear. In this work, the motion of single microtubules
was characterized by means of 2D gliding assays and compared with the flows of
3D active fluids. While the scales of the two systems differ by 1,000x, both
were driven by processive, non-processive or an equal mixture of both molecular
motor proteins. To search for the dynamic correlation between both systems, the
motor activities were tuned by varying temperature and ATP concentration, and
the changes in both systems were compared. Motor processivity played an
important role in active fluid flows but only when the fluids were nearly
motionless; otherwise, flows were dominated by hydrodynamic resistance
controlled by sample size. Furthermore, while the motors' thermal reaction led
active fluids to flow faster with increasing temperature, such temperature
dependence could be reversed by introducing temperature-varying depletants,
emphasizing the potential role of the depletant in designing an active fluid's
temperature response. The temperature response of active fluids was nearly
immediate (<10 sec). Such a characteristic enables active fluids to be
controlled with a temperature switch. Overall, this work not only clarifies the
role of temperature in active fluid activity, but also sheds light on the
underlying principles of the relationship between the collective dynamics of
active fluids and the dynamics of their constituent single microtubules.

static frictional sensation using the pseudo-haptic effect as a first attempt,
which is the simplest implementation of presenting static friction sensation.
We focus on the stick-slip phenomenon while users explore surfaces with an
input device, such as a stylus. During the stick phase, we present users with
pseudo-haptic feedback that represents static friction on the surface. In our
method, users watch a virtual contact point become stuck at the contact point
on screen while users freely move the input device. We hypothesize that the
perceived probability and intensity of static friction sensation can be
controlled by changing the static friction coefficient as a visual parameter.
User studies were conducted, and results show the threshold value over which
users felt the pseudo-haptic static friction sensation at 90% probability. The
results also show that the perceived intensity of the sensation changed with
respect to the static friction coefficient. The maximum intensity change was
23%. These results confirm the hypothesis and show that our method is a
promising option for presenting static friction sensation.

increased the demand for accurate fake news detection. Recent advancements in
this area have proposed novel techniques that aim to detect fake news by
exploring how it propagates on social networks. Nevertheless, to detect fake
news at an early stage, i.e., when it is published on a news outlet but not yet
spread on social media, one cannot rely on news propagation information as it
does not exist. Hence, there is a strong need to develop approaches that can
detect fake news by focusing on news content. In this paper, a theory-driven

at various levels: lexicon-level, syntax-level, semantic-level and
discourse-level. We represent news at each level, relying on well-established
theories in social and forensic psychology. Fake news detection is then
conducted within a supervised machine learning framework. As an
interdisciplinary research, our work explores potential fake news patterns,
enhances the interpretability in fake news feature engineering, and studies the
relationships among fake news, deception/disinformation, and clickbaits.
Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets indicate the proposed method

target at capturing different kinds of relations in KGs, have been designed by
humans in recent years. However, as relations can exhibit complex patterns that
are hard to infer before training, none of them can consistently perform better
than others on existing benchmark data sets. In this paper, inspired by the
recent success of automated machine learning (AutoML), we propose to
automatically design SFs (AutoSF) for distinct KGs by the AutoML techniques.
However, it is non-trivial to explore domain-specific information here to make
AutoSF efficient and effective. We firstly identify a unified representation
over popularly used SFs, which helps to set up a search space for AutoSF. Then,
we propose a greedy algorithm to search in such a space efficiently. The
algorithm is further sped up by a filter and a predictor, which can avoid
repeatedly training SFs with same expressive ability and help removing bad
candidates during the search before model training. Finally, we perform
extensive experiments on benchmark data sets. Results on link prediction and
triplets classification show that the searched SFs by AutoSF, are KG dependent,
new to the literature, and outperform the state-of-the-art SFs designed by
humans.

time-consuming. To address this problem, it is a good choice to learn to
segment with weak supervision from bounding boxes. How to make full use of the
class-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical
challenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first
introduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant
regions of each class. Moreover, based on the pixel-level segment proposal
generated from the bounding box supervision, we could calculate the mean
filling rates of each class to serve as an important prior cue, then we propose
a filling rate guided adaptive loss (FR-Loss) to help the model ignore the
wrongly labeled pixels in proposals. Unlike previous methods directly training
models with the fixed individual segment proposals, our method can adjust the
model learning with global statistical information. Thus it can help reduce the
negative impacts from wrongly labeled proposals. We evaluate the proposed

fields leads to an enhanced dimension-6 proton decay width detectable at

45}_{\rm H}$ arises due to Planck-suppressed terms, $W\propto ({\bf 45}_{\rm
H}^2)^2/M_*+{\bf 45}_{\rm H}^4/M_*$, and is therefore substantially larger than
the other VEVs that conserve SU(5). As a result, the $({\bf 3},{\bf 2},1/6)$
GUT gauge boson mass is about $1/5$ smaller than the $({\bf 3},{\bf 2},-5/6)$
GUT gauge boson mass and can induce a fast dimension-6 proton decay. Through a
numerical analysis on threshold corrections of the GUT gauge bosons and the
physical components of the GUT-breaking Higgs fields, we confirm that the

investigated in an effective Lagrangian approach. The $t$-channel Pomeron
exchange diffractive process is considered as the main background for the
$J/\psi $ photoproduction. The numerical results show that the theoretical
cross section, which is calculated by assuming a branching ratio
$Br[P_{c}\rightarrow J/\psi p]\simeq 3\%$, is consistent with the existing
experimental data of the $ \gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ process. With such a
branching ratio, if experimental precision reaches 0.1 nb within a bin of 100
MeV for photon energy, two peaks are expected to be obviously observed in the
$J/\psi $ photoproduction. To observe the two-peak structure from $P_{c}(4440)$
and $ P_{c}(4457)$, higher precision, about 0.1nb/10 MeV, is required to
distinguish two close pentaquarks. If the physical branching ratio is larger,
the requirement of experimental precision will be reduced. The differential
cross sections for reaction $\gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ are also present. It
is found that the $t$-channel Pomeron exchange provides a sharp increase at
extreme forward angles and gives a sizable contribution at most energy points,

roles at threshold energies. The experimental measurement of the $\gamma

metric learning methods need training information in the form of pair or
triplet sets. Nowadays, this training information often is obtained from the
Internet via crowdsourcing methods. Therefore, this information may contain
label noise or outliers leading to the poor performance of the learned metric.
It is even possible that the learned metric functions perform worse than the

features of QCD, a dual version of the color gauge theory based on the
topologically viable homogeneous fiber bundle approach has been analysed taking
into account its magnetic symmetry structure. In the dynamically broken phase
of magnetic symmetry, the associated flux tube structure on a S 2 -sphere in
the magnetically condensed state of the dual QCD vacuum has been analyzed for
the profiles of the color electric field using flux quantization and stability
conditions. The color electric field has its intimate association with the
vector mode of the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum and such field
configurations have been analyzed to show that the color electric flux gets
localized towards the poles for a large sphere case while it gets uniformly
distributed for the small sphere case in the infrared sector of QCD. The
critical flux tube densities have been computed for various couplings and are
shown to be in agreement with that for lead-ion central collisions in the near
infrared sector of QCD. The possible annihilation/unification of flux tubes
under some typical flux tube density and temperature conditions in the magnetic
symmetry broken phase of QCD has also been analyzed and shown to play an
important role in the process of QGP formation. The thermal variation of the
profiles of the color electic field is further investigated which indicates the
survival of flux tubes even in the thermal domain that leads the possibility of
the formation of some exotic states like QGP in the intermedate regime during
the quark-hadron phase transition.

therefore the geobiological nitrogen cycle is a fundamental factor in the long
term evolution of both Earth and Earth-like exoplanets. We discuss the
development of the Earth's N2 atmosphere since the planet's formation and its
relation with the geobiological cycle. Then we suggest atmospheric evolution
scenarios and their possible interaction with life forms: firstly, for a
stagnant-lid anoxic world, secondly for a tectonically active anoxic world, and
thirdly for an oxidized tectonically active world. Furthermore, we discuss a
possible demise of present Earth's biosphere and its effects on the atmosphere.
Since life forms are the most efficient means for recycling deposited nitrogen
back into the atmosphere nowadays, they sustain its surface partial pressure at
high levels. Also, the simultaneous presence of significant N2 and O2 is
chemically incompatible in an atmosphere over geological timescales. Thus, we
argue that an N2-dominated atmosphere in combination with O2 on Earth-like
planets within circumstellar habitable zones can be considered as a
geo-biosignature. Terrestrial planets with such atmospheres will have an
operating tectonic regime connected with an aerobe biosphere, whereas other
scenarios in most cases end up with a CO2-dominated atmosphere. We conclude
with implications for the search for life on Earth-like exoplanets inside the

risk minimization approach has been proposed, giving an unbiased estimator of
the classification risk that can be computed only from pairwise similarities

dissimilarities so far. On the other hand, semi-supervised clustering is one of
the methods which can use both similarities and dissimilarities. Nevertheless,
they typically require strong geometrical assumptions on the data distribution

Analysis methods evolved to account for the increased complexity of the
combination of particles required in each collision event (final states) and
for the need of squeezing every last bit of sensitivity from the data;
physicists often seek to fully reconstruct the final state, a process that is

statistical techniques such as machine learning.
  The need for keeping the publications documenting results to a reasonable

important practical issues such as the necessity of a sufficient statistical
averaging. As an ideal, artifact-free reference case and particularly targeting
finite-size systems, we consider two cases of numerically simulated interfaces,
one in equilibrium with a disordered energy landscape and one corresponding to
the critical depinning state when the external applied driving force equals the
depinning force. We find that the use of the reciprocal space methods based on
the structure factor allows the most robust extraction of the roughness

In this work, we investigate the operational environmental stability of

an inorganic or organic HBL, with only the former effectively blocking ions
from migrating to the metal electrode. This is confirmed by X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy measured on electrodes of degraded devices, where only electrodes
of devices with an organic HBL show a significant iodine signal. Despite this,
we show that when these devices are degraded under realistic operational
conditions (i.e. constant illumination in a variety of atmospheric conditions),
both types of devices exhibit nearly identical degradation behavior. These
results demonstrate that contrary to prior suggestions, ion-induced electrode
degradation is not the dominant factor in perovskite environmental instability
under operational conditions.

ion etching sources is a common technique that allows for the probing of the
vertical compositional profiles of a wide range of materials. In polymer-based
organic photovoltaic devices, it is commonly used to study compositional
variations across the interfaces of the organic active layer with charge
extraction layers or electrodes, as well as the vertical phase separation
within the bulk-heterojunction active layer. It is generally considered that
the damage induced by the etching of organic layers is limited to the very top
surface, such that the XPS signal (acquired from the top ~10 nm of the layer)
remains largely unaffected, allowing for a reliable measurement of the sample
composition throughout the depth profile. Herein, we investigate a range of
conjugated polymers and quantify the depth of the damage induced by monoatomic
etching for Ar+ ion energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 4 keV using argon gas
cluster ion beam depth profiling. The results demonstrate that even when
etching with the lowest available monoatomic ion energy for as little as 3 s,
the damaged polymer material extends deeper into the bulk than the XPS probing
depth. We show that the damaged material distorts the compositional information
obtained by XPS, resulting in erroneous depth profiles. Furthermore, we propose
that only gas cluster ion beam etching sources should be used for depth
profiling of organic conjugated polymers, as those induce significantly less
damage and maintain the compositional information throughout the entire

Australia. The first TLP aims to control the pricing zone (PZ) through a
time-varying joint distance and delay toll (JDDT) such that the network
fundamental diagram (NFD) of the PZ does not enter the congested regime. The
second TLP is built upon the first TLP by further considering the minimization
of the heterogeneity of congestion distribution in the PZ. To solve the two
TLPs, a computationally efficient surrogate-based optimization method, i.e.,
regressing kriging (RK) with expected improvement (EI) sampling, is applied to
approximate the simulation input-output mapping, which can balance well between
local exploitation and global exploration. Results show that the two optimal
TLP solutions reduce the average travel time in the PZ (entire network) by
29.5% (1.4%) and 21.6% (2.5%), respectively. Reducing the heterogeneity of

yields and the dust produced are determined by the change in the surface
chemical composition, with a transition occurring at $\sim 2.5~M_{\odot}$.
Stars of mass $M < 2.5~M_{\odot}$ reach the carbon stage and produce carbon
dust, whereas their higher mass counterparts produce mainly silicates and
alumina dust; in both cases the amount of dust manufactured decreases towards
lower metallicities. The $Z=10^{-4}$ models show a complex and interesting
behaviour on this side, because the efficient destruction of the surface oxygen
favours the achievement of the C-star stage, independently of the initial mass.
The present results might indicate that the contribution from this class of

Different topological states including quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and
time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) broken quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect can be
obtained by changing spin orientation in the NiTl2S4 monolayer. Remarkably, the
dilated nc-AFM NiTl2S4 monolayer gives birth to the QAH effect with hitherto
reported largest number of quantized conducting channels (Chern number C = -4)
in 2D materials. Interestingly, under tunable chemical potential, the nc-AFM
NiTl2S4 monolayer hosts a novel state supporting the coexistence of QAH and TRS
broken QSH effects with a Chern number C = 3 and spin Chern number C_s = 1.

important when multiple agents are trying to achieve joint goals, or when
agents commit to achieving goals for each other. Making such a determination
for a single goal by observing only plan traces is not trivial as agents often
deviate from optimal plans for various reasons, including the pursuit of
multiple goals or the inability to act optimally. In this article, we develop
an approach based on domain independent heuristics from automated planning,
landmarks, and fact partitions to identify sub-optimal action steps - with
respect to a plan - within a plan execution trace. Such capability is very
important in domains where multiple agents cooperate and delegate tasks among
themselves, e.g. through social commitments, and need to ensure that a
delegating agent can infer whether or not another agent is actually progressing
towards a delegated task. We demonstrate how an agent can use our technique to
determine - by observing a trace - whether an agent is honouring a commitment.
We empirically show, for a number of representative domains, that our approach
infers sub-optimal action steps with very high accuracy and detects commitment
abandonment in nearly all cases.

computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is
efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no

for generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset. We next evaluate the
relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks

models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer

route to chaos and other phenomena associated with nonlinear dynamics in the
presence of two rationally unrelated periodicities. In particular, the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is a crucial component of climate
variability on interannual time scales and it is dominated by the seasonal
cycle, on the one hand, and an intrinsic oscillatory instability with a period
of a few years, on the other. The role of meteorological phenomena on much
shorter time scales, such as westerly wind bursts, has also been recognized and
modeled as additive noise. We consider herein Arnold maps with additive,
uniformly distributed noise. When the map's nonlinear term, scaled by the
parameter $\epsilon$, is sufficiently small, i.e. $\epsilon < 1$, the map is
known to be a diffeomorphism and the rotation number $\rho_{\omega}$ is a
differentiable function of the driving frequency $\omega$. We concentrate on
the rotation number's behavior as the nonlinearity becomes large, and show
rigorously that $\rho _{\omega }$ is a differentiable function of $\omega $,
even for $\epsilon \geq 1$, at every point at which the noise-perturbed map is
mixing. We also provide a formula for the derivative of the rotation number.
The reasoning relies on linear-response theory and a computer-aided proof. In
the diffeomorphism case of $\epsilon <1$, the rotation number $\rho_{\omega }$
behaves monotonically with respect to $\omega $. We show, using again a
computer-aided proof, that this is not the case when $\epsilon \geq 1$ and the

a semiparametric approach to correct the bias of variance estimators, both for
untransformed and transformed (with particular attention to log-transformation)

exposure or sequencing depth in the data. In addition to identifying the
principal components, we also address the non-trivial problem of computing the
principal scores in this semiparametric framework. Most previous approaches
tend to take a more parametric line. For example the Poisson-log-normal (PLN)
model, approach. We compare our method with the PLN approach and find that our
method is better at identifying the main principal components of the latent
log-transformed Poisson means, and as a further major advantage, takes far less
time to compute. Comparing methods on real data, we see that our method also
appears to be more robust to outliers than the parametric method.

proposes a few alternative distance-dependent area-based pricing models for a

(NFD) to monitor the network traffic state over time and consider different
trip lengths in the toll calculation. The first model is a distance toll that
is linearly related to the distance traveled within the cordon. The second
model is an improved joint distance and time toll (JDTT) whereby users are
charged jointly in proportion to the distance traveled and time spent within
the cordon. The third model is a further improved joint distance and delay toll
(JDDT) which replaces the time toll in the JDTT with a delay toll component. To
solve the optimal toll level problem, we develop a simulation-based
optimization (SBO) framework. Specifically, we propose a simultaneous approach
and a sequential approach, respectively, based on the proportional-integral
(PI) feedback controller to iteratively adjust the JDTT and JDDT, and use a
calibrated large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model
of Melbourne, Australia to evaluate the network performance under different
pricing scenarios. While the framework is developed for static pricing, we show
that it can be easily extended to solve time-dependent pricing by using
multiple PI controllers. Results show that although the distance toll keeps the
network from entering the congested regime of the NFD, it naturally drives
users into the shortest paths within the cordon resulting in an uneven
distribution of congestion. This is reflected by a large clockwise hysteresis
loop in the NFD. In contrast, both the JDTT and JDDT reduce the size of the
hysteresis loop while achieving the same control objective.

degeneracy of the dark energy equation of state and thus provide
complementarity with other popular probes, such as type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background radiation.
Interestingly, compared to traditional strong lensing systems where quasars act
as sources, strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary
coalescence and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts systems have been
recently proposed to be more powerful for studying cosmology since GWs and
their EM counterparts are transients. Short durations of GWs and their EM
counterparts are very advantageous to time delay measurement and lens profile
modeling. Here, in the framework of Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
parametrization, we investigate improvement of constraining power on dark
energy equation of state due to including time delay measurements of strong
lensed GW systems. It is suggested that, on the basis of the third generation
ground-based detector, e.g. Einstein Telescope, adding time delay of only 30
strong lensed GW systems to type Ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background
radiation can improve the dark energy figure of merit by a factor 2. For the
traditional standard siren method where the uncertainties of luminosity
distances of GWs are $\sim10\%$, a few $\times~10^4$ events are expected to
present similar constraints. In the precision cosmology era, this progress is
of great significance for studying the nature of dark energy.

reliability, it is important to comprehensively detect input values that lead
to malfunctions of a system (failures) during development and take appropriate

the input to the DTEM, and to use separate software to process input values
that may lead to failures. To develop the input filter, it is necessary to

malfunction of the system. Given that necessity, in this paper, we propose a
method for formally verifying a DTEM and, according to the result of the
verification, if an input value leading to a failure is found, extracting the
range in which such an input value exists. The proposed method can
comprehensively extract the range in which the input value leading to the
failure exists; therefore, by creating an input filter based on that range, it
is possible to prevent the failure occurring in the system. In this paper, the

the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated, and its scalability is

design that can cause different quality problems, such as faults, technical
debt, or difficulties with maintenance and evolution. Some studies show that
code smells and architectural smells often appear together in the same file.
The correlation between code smells and architectural smells, however, is not
clear yet; some studies on a limited set of projects have claimed that
architectural smells can be derived from code smells, while other studies claim
the opposite. Objective. The goal of this work is to understand whether
architectural smells are independent from code smells or can be derived from a
code smell or from one category of them. Method. We conducted a case study
analyzing the correlations among 19 code smells, six categories of code smells,
and four architectural smells. Results. The results show that architectural
smells are correlated with code smells only in a very low number of occurrences
and therefore cannot be derived from code smells. Conclusion. Architectural
smells are independent from code smells, and therefore deserve special
attention by researchers, who should investigate their actual harmfulness, and
practitioners, who should consider whether and when to remove them.

with growing fiber link capacity. One key research issue of all-optical
switching is the design of optical buffers for packet contention resolution.
One of the most general buffering schemes is optical priority queue, where
every packet is associated with a unique priority upon its arrival and departs
the queue in order of priority, and the packet with the lowest priority is
always dropped when a new packet arrives but the buffer is full. In this paper,
we focus on the feedback construction of an optical priority queue with a
single $\boldsymbol{(M+2)\times (M+2)}$ optical crossbar Switch and
$\boldsymbol{M}$ fiber Delay Lines (SDL) connecting $\boldsymbol{M}$ inputs and
$\boldsymbol{M}$ outputs of the switch. We propose a novel construction of an
optical priority queue with buffer $\boldsymbol{2^{\Theta(\sqrt{M})}}$, which
improves substantially over all previous constructions that only have buffers
of $\boldsymbol{O(M^c)}$ size for constant integer $\boldsymbol{c}$. The key
ideas behind our construction include (i) the use of first in first out
multiplexers, which admit efficient SDL constructions, for feeding back packets
to the switch instead of fiber delay lines, and (ii) the use of a routing
policy that is similar to self-routing, where each packet entering the switch
is routed to some multiplexer mainly determined by the current ranking of its
priority.

qubits, although in different models which also include other elements. We show
how a quantum two-level system can be understood as containing a valid limit
cycle as the starting point of synchronization, and that it can synchronize its
dynamics to an external weak signal. This is demonstrated by analytically
solving the Lindblad equation of a two-level system coupled to an environment,
determining the steady state. This is a mixed state with contributions from
many pure states, each of which provides a valid limit cycle. We show that this
is sufficient to phase-lock the dynamics to a weak external signal, hence
clarifying synchronization in two-level systems. We use the Husimi Q
representation to analyze the synchronization region, defining a
synchronization measure which characterizes the strength of the phase-locking.
Also, we study the stability of the limit cycle and its deformation with the
strength of the signal in terms of the components of the Bloch vector of the

arise in presence of atomic spin-orbit coupling, which is a typical case, or
due to spin-orbital entanglement at the bonds in its absence, being much less

network design. In this paper, we consider this problem in the online setting.
We are given an $n$-vertex spanning tree $T$ and an additional set $L$ of edges
(called links) with costs. Then, terminal pairs arrive one-by-one and our task
is to maintain a low-cost subset of links $F$ such that every terminal pair
that has arrived so far is $2$-edge-connected in $T \cup F$. This online
problem was first studied by Gupta, Krishnaswamy and Ravi (SICOMP 2012) who
used it as a subroutine for the online survivable network design problem. They
gave a deterministic $O(\log^2 n)$-competitive algorithm and showed an
$\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound on the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms.
The case when $T$ is a path is also interesting: it is exactly the online
interval set cover problem, which also captures as a special case the parking

is to give tight results for online weighted tree and path augmentation
problems. The main result of this work is a deterministic $O(\log

number of maximum distance separable codes that are non-equivalent to
Reed--Solomon codes. TRS codes were recently proposed as an alternative to
Goppa codes for the McEliece code-based cryptosystem, resulting in a potential
reduction of key sizes. The use of TRS codes in the McEliece cryptosystem has
been motivated by the fact that a large subfamily of TRS codes is resilient to
a direct use of known algebraic key-recovery methods. In this paper, an
efficient key-recovery attack on the TRS variant that was used in the McEliece
cryptosystem is presented. The algorithm exploits a new approach based on
recovering the structure of a well-chosen subfield subcode of the public code.
It is proved that the attack always succeeds and breaks the system for all
practical parameters in $O(n^4)$ field operations. A software implementation of
the algorithm retrieves a valid private key from the public key within a few
minutes, for parameters claiming a security level of 128 bits. The success of
the attack also indicates that, contrary to common beliefs, subfield subcodes
of the public code need to be precisely analyzed when proposing a McEliece-type
code-based cryptosystem. Finally, the paper discusses an attempt to repair the
scheme and a modification of the attack aiming at Gabidulin-Paramonov-Tretjakov
cryptosystems based on twisted Gabidulin codes.

the multiscale organization of human connectomes using datasets of healthy
subjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We found that the
structure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution of
observation is progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the
anatomical regions. Strikingly, a geometric network model, where distances are
not Euclidean, predicts the multiscale properties of connectomes, including
self-similarity. The model relies on the application of a geometric
renormalization protocol which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and
averaging over short similarity distances. Our results suggest that simple

discrete time periodic systems with real coefficients well known in literature.
A special finite field version of the Floquet theory of such periodic systems
is developed and the structure of trajectories of the PFSS is analyzed through
that of a shift invariant linear system after Floquet transformation. The
concept of extension of a dynamical system is proposed for such systems
whenever the equivalent shift invariant system can be obtained over an
extension field.

examples of support vector machines (SVMs), a major machine learning model for
classification and regression tasks. Following a recent stream of works on
formal robustness verification of (deep) neural networks, our approach relies
on a sound abstract version of a given SVM classifier to be used for checking
its robustness. This methodology is parametric on a given numerical abstraction
of real values and, analogously to the case of neural networks, needs neither
abstract least upper bounds nor widening operators on this abstraction. The
standard interval domain provides a simple instantiation of our abstraction
technique, which is enhanced with the domain of reduced affine forms, which is
an efficient abstraction of the zonotope abstract domain. This robustness
verification technique has been fully implemented and experimentally evaluated
on SVMs based on linear and nonlinear (polynomial and radial basis function)
kernels, which have been trained on the popular MNIST dataset of images and on
the recent and more challenging Fashion-MNIST dataset. The experimental results
of our prototype SVM robustness verifier appear to be encouraging: this
automated verification is fast, scalable and shows significantly high
percentages of provable robustness on the test set of MNIST, in particular
compared to the analogous provable robustness of neural networks.

exploit this property to design an efficient algorithm for our industrial

problem can be solved in polynomial time on graphs with bounded treewidth and
we devise a simple polytime dynamic programming algorithm in this case (not

provide computational evidences that the corresponding algorithm could be
suitable for practice, by testing our algorithm on true instances obtained from
an on-going collaboration with Mentor Graphics. We finally compare this

suggests that dynamic programming cannot compete with integer programming when
the tree-width is greater than three. While all our industrial instances
exhibit such a small tree-width, this is not for granted that all future
instances will also do, and this tend to advocate for integer programming
approaches.

useful for describing high-dimensional distributions in terms of local
dependence structures. The probabilistic inference is a fundamental problem
related to graphical models, and sampling is a main approach for the problem.
In this paper, we study probabilistic inference problems when the graphical
model itself is changing dynamically with time. Such dynamic inference problems
arise naturally in today's application, e.g.~multivariate time-series data
analysis and practical learning procedures.
  We give a dynamic algorithm for sampling-based probabilistic inferences in
MRFs, where each dynamic update can change the underlying graph and all
parameters of the MRF simultaneously, as long as the total amount of changes is
bounded. More precisely, suppose that the MRF has $n$ variables and
polylogarithmic-bounded maximum degree, and $N(n)$ independent samples are
sufficient for the inference for a polynomial function $N(\cdot)$. Our
algorithm dynamically maintains an answer to the inference problem using
$\widetilde{O}(n N(n))$ space cost, and $\widetilde{O}(N(n) + n)$ incremental
time cost upon each update to the MRF, as long as the well-known
Dobrushin-Shlosman condition is satisfied by the MRFs. Compared to the static
case, which requires $\Omega(n N(n))$ time cost for redrawing all $N(n)$
samples whenever the MRF changes, our dynamic algorithm gives a
$\widetilde\Omega(\min\{n, N(n)\})$-factor speedup. Our approach relies on a
novel dynamic sampling technique, which transforms local Markov chains (a.k.a.
single-site dynamics) to dynamic sampling algorithms, and an ""algorithmic
Lipschitz"" condition that we establish for sampling from graphical models,
namely, when the MRF changes by a small difference, samples can be modified to
reflect the new distribution, with cost proportional to the difference on MRF.

part of an open neurosurgical intervention with a handheld PA and ultrasonic
(US) imaging system in vivo. Throughout the experiment, we varied respiratory
oxygen and continuously measured arterial blood gases. The arterial blood
oxygenation (SaO2) values derived by the blood gas analyzer were used as a
reference to compare the performance of linear spectral unmixing algorithms in
this scenario. According to our experiment, PA imaging can be used to monitor
sO2 in the porcine cerebral cortex. While linear spectral unmixing algorithms
are well-suited for detecting changes in oxygenation, there are limits with
respect to the accurate quantification of sO2, especially in depth. Overall, we
conclude that multispectral PA imaging can potentially be a valuable tool for
change detection of sO2 in the cerebral cortex of a gyrencephalic brain. The

memory access and data sharing are becoming performance bottlenecks. Cloud
computing employs a data processing paradigm typically built on a loosely
connected group of low-cost computing nodes without relying upon shared storage

in the cloud, which we have successfully deployed via job submission scripts on
production clusters.
  In this paper, we describe common parallel analysis dataflows for both
Message Passing Interface (MPI) and cloud based applications. We developed an
effective benchmark to measure the performance characteristics of these tasks
using both types of systems, specifically comparing MPI/C-based analyses with
Spark. The benchmark is a data processing pipeline representative of a typical
analytics framework implemented using map-reduce. In the case of Spark, we also
consider whether language plays a role by writing tests using both Python and
Scala, a language built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We include
performance results from two large systems at Argonne National Laboratory
including Theta, a Cray XC40 supercomputer on which our experiments run with
65,536 cores (1024 nodes with 64 cores each). The results of our experiments

direction of the Local Group (LG) barycentre and anti-barycentre, by studying
spectral data of 29 extragalactic background sources obtained with Cosmic
Origins Spectropgraph (COS) installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Methods. We model column-densities of low, intermediate, and high ions, such as
Si II, C II, Si III, Si IV, and C IV and use this to construct a set of Cloudy
ionisation models. Results. In total, we found 69 high-velocity absorption
components along the 29 lines of sight. The ones in the direction of the LG
barycentre span the entire range of studied velocities, 100 \lesssim
|v_{LSR}|\lesssim 400 km s^-1, while the anti-barycentre sample has velocities
up to about 300 km s^-1. For 49 components, we infer the gas densities. In the
direction of the LG barycentre, the gas densities exhibit a large range between
log n_H=-3.96 to -2.55, while in the anti-barycentre direction the densities
are systematically higher, log n_H>-3.25. The barycentre absorbers can be split
into two groups based on their density: a high density group with log
n_H>-3.54, which can be affected by the Milky Way radiation field, and a low
density group (log n_H \leq -3.54). The latter has very low thermal pressures
of P/k<7.3 K cm^-3. Conclusions. Our study shows that part of the absorbers in
the LG barycentre direction trace gas at very low gas densities and thermal
pressures. Such properties indicate that these absorbers are located beyond the
virial radius of the Milky Way. Our study also confirms results from earlier,
single-sightline studies, suggesting the presence of a metal-enriched
intragroup medium filling the LG near its barycentre.

design of hand-written scripts to building and tuning complex pipelines of
automated data cleaning libraries. Hyper-parameter tuning for data cleaning is
very different than hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning since the
pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning
algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean,
that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides
users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of
SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where
each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a
shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences
them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures.
This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations
including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic
pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic
benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality
than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is
significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in
the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning
systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.

remains challenging to devisesufficiently accurate models to observe, control

largely overlooked fact is that these systems are typically open and receive
unknown inputs from their environment. A further fundamental obstacle are
structural model errors caused by insufficient or inaccurate knowledge about
the quantitative interactions in the real system.
  Here, we show that unknown inputs to open systems and model errors can be
treated under the common framework of invertibility, which is a requirement for
reconstructing these disturbances from output measurements. By exploiting the
fact that invertibility can be decided from the influence graph of the system,
we analyse the relationship between structural network properties and
invertibility under different realistic scenarios. We show that sparsely
connected scale free networks are the most difficult to invert. We introduce a
new sensor node placement algorithm to select a minimum set of measurement
positions in the network required for invertibility. This algorithm facilitates
optimal experimental design for the reconstruction of inputs or model errors
from output measurements. Our results have both fundamental and practical
implications for nonlinear systems analysis, modelling and design.

16-17, 2018.
  The goal of ASIME 2018: Asteroid Intersections with Mine Engineering, was to
focus on asteroid composition for advancing the asteroid in-space resource
utilisation domain. What do we know about asteroid composition from
remote-sensing observations? What are the potential caveats in the
interpretation of Earth-based spectral observations? What are the next steps to
improve our knowledge on asteroid composition by means of ground-based and
space-based observations and asteroid rendez-vous and sample return missions?
How can asteroid mining companies use this knowledge?
  ASIME 2018 was a two-day workshop of almost 70 scientists and engineers in
the context of the engineering needs of space missions with in-space asteroid
utilisation. The 21 Questions from the asteroid mining companies were sorted
into the four asteroid science themes: 1) Potential Targets, 2)
Asteroid-Meteorite Links, 3) In-Situ Measurements and 4) Laboratory
Measurements. The Answers to those Questions were provided by the scientists
with their conference presentations and collected by A. Graps or edited
directly into an open-access collaborative Google document or inserted by A.
Graps using additional reference materials. During the ASIME 2018, first day
and second day Wrap-Ups, the answers to the questions were discussed further.
New readers to the asteroid mining topic may find the Conversation boxes and
the Mission Design discussions especially interesting.

be encoded into the captured images. We then employ a ptychographic phase
retrieval process to jointly recover the exit wavefront of the complex object

super-resolution approach, the recovered image of our approach depends upon how
the complex wavefront exits the sample - not enters it. Therefore, the sample
thickness becomes irrelevant during reconstruction. After recovery, we can
propagate the super-resolution complex wavefront to any position along the
optical axis. We validate our approach using a resolution target, a
quantitative phase target, a two-layer sample, and a thick PDMS sample. We
demonstrate a 4.5-fold resolution gain over the diffraction limit. We also show
that a 4-fold resolution gain can be achieved with as few as ~30 images. The

for $r\gtrsim r_0$ these excitations produce a new component for the radial
acceleration of stars in galaxies which leads to the result found by McGaugh

Weyl nodes with a finite distance in momentum space suddenly appear or
disappear in the spectral function. We associate this behavior to the buildup

manifesting in dynamical fluctuations in the orbital channel. We also highlight
the impact of electronic correlations on the Fermi arcs.

resemble a flattened ellipsoid and Coriolis forces support waves in its fluid
core, known as inertial waves. These waves can lead to global oscillations, or
modes, of the fluid. Periodic variations of the Earth's rotation axis
(nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and
the fluid core and excite these inertial modes. In addition to viscous torques
that exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of
the core-mantle boundary (CMB) allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques
on the mantle. These torques effectively couple the rigid-body dynamics of the
Earth with the fluid dynamics of the fluid core. Here we present the first high
resolution numerical model that solves simultaneously the rigid body dynamics
of the mantle and the Navier-Stokes equation for the liquid core. This method
takes naturally into account dissipative processes in the fluid that are
ignored in current nutation models. We find that the Free Core Nutation (FCN)
mode, mostly a toroidal fluid flow if the mantle has a large moment of inertia,
enters into resonance with nearby modes if the mantle's moment of inertia is
reduced. These mode interactions seem to be completely analogous to the ones
discovered by Schmitt (2006) in a uniformly rotating ellipsoid with varying
flattening.

deep recurrent neural networks for natural language generation. The most widely

pre-processing step called delexicalization (conversely, relexicalization) to
deal with uncommon or unknown words. These forms of processing, however, give
rise to models that depend on the vocabulary used and are not completely
neural.
  In this work, we present an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence model with
attention mechanism which reads and generates at a character level, no longer
requiring delexicalization, tokenization, nor even lowercasing. Moreover, since
characters constitute the common ""building blocks"" of every text, it also
allows a more general approach to text generation, enabling the possibility to
exploit transfer learning for training. These skills are obtained thanks to two
major features: (i) the possibility to alternate between the standard
generation mechanism and a copy one, which allows to directly copy input facts
to produce outputs, and (ii) the use of an original training pipeline that
further improves the quality of the generated texts.
  We also introduce a new dataset called E2E+, designed to highlight the
copying capabilities of character-based models, that is a modified version of
the well-known E2E dataset used in the E2E Challenge. We tested our model

show that the empirical data can be utilized for the construction of a weighted
least squares estimate (LSE) for quantum tomography. Taking into consideration
the trace-one condition, a constrained weighted LSE can be explicitly computed,
being the optimal unbiased estimation among all linear estimators. Next, for
general measurement bases, we show that $\ell_2$-regularization with proper
regularization gain provides even lower mean-square error under a cost in bias.
The regularization parameter is tuned by two estimators in terms of a risk
characterization. Finally, a concise and unified formula is established for the
regularization parameter with complete measurement basis under an equivalent

drive a powerful pulsar wind (PW) and bring out some detectable
multi-wavelength emissions. On the one hand, the PW can evaporate the companion
in a few days to form a torus surrounding the NS. Then, due to the blockage of
the PW by the torus, a reverse shock can be formed in the wind to generate
intense hard X-rays. This emission component disappears in a few weeks' time,
after the torus is broken down at its inner boundary and scoured into a very
thin disk. On the other hand, the interaction between the PW with an AIC ejecta
can lead to a termination shock of the wind, which can produce a long-lasting
soft X-ray emission component. In any case, the high-energy emissions from deep
inside the system can be detected only after the AIC ejecta becomes transparent
for X-rays. Meanwhile, by absorbing the X-rays, the AIC ejecta can be heated
effectively and generate a fast-evolving and luminous ultraviolet (UV)/optical
transient. Therefore, the predicted hard and soft X-ray emissions, associated

thought to produce a kinonova, is concentrated in the equatorial plane and
occupies only part of the whole azimuthal angle. In addition, recent
simulations suggest that the outflow or wind from the post-merger remnant disk,
presumably anisotropic, can be a major ejecta component responsible for a
kilonova. For any ejecta whose photosphere shape deviates from the spherical
symmetry, the electron scattering at the photosphere causes a net polarization
in the kilonova light. Recent observational and theoretical polarization
studies have been focused to the NS-NS merger kilonova AT2017gfo. We extend
those work to the case of a BH-NS merger kilonova. We show that the degree of
polarization at the first $\sim 1$ hr can be up to $\sim$ 3\% if a small amount
($10^{-4} M_{\odot}$) of free neutrons have survived in the fastest component
of the dynamical ejecta, whose beta-decay causes a precursor in the kilonova
light. The polarization degree can be $\sim$ 0.6\% if free neutrons survived in
the fastest component of the disk wind. Future polarization detection of a
kilonova will constrain the morphology and composition of the dominant ejecta
component, therefore help to identify the nature of the merger.

within a few percent using either the full or the small archive. For spectra
with 30 wavelength points, this NLTE inversion approach takes 0.02 (0.35) s per
profile to obtain a temperature stratification when using the small (full)
archive, i.e., it can invert a single spectral scan in about 4 (68) hrs. The
code is able to simultaneously deal with an arbitrary number of spectral lines.
This makes it a promising tool for deriving thermodynamic properties of the
solar atmosphere from current or future solar high-resolution observations of
photospheric and chromospheric lines.

conjectured that all quantum superintegrable potentials that do not satisfy any
linear equation satisfy nonlinear equations having the Painlev\'e property. In
addition, it has been discovered that their integrals naturally generate
finitely generated polynomial algebras and the representations can be exploited
to calculate the energy spectrum. For certain very interesting cases associated
with exceptional orthogonal polynomials, these algebraic structures do not
allow to calculate the full spectrum and degeneracies. It has been demonstrated
that alternative sets of integrals which can be build and used to provide a

channels, the velocity of the interface at the NI transition increases from
zero (i) linearly with the activity for contractile systems and (ii)
quadratically for extensile ones. Interestingly, the nematic phase expands for

stability of the nematic, for active nematics in the stable regime the
temperature can be tuned to observe static interfaces, providing an operational
definition for the coexistence of active nematic and isotropic phases. At
higher activities, beyond the stable regime, an interfacial instability is
observed for extensile nematics. In this regime defects are nucleated at the

simulations and seem to be the dominant rupture mode along crustal faults.
Pulse-like ruptures propagating under steady-state conditions can be
efficiently analysed theoretically, but it remains unclear how they can arise
and how they evolve if perturbed. Using thermal pressurisation as a
representative constitutive law, we conduct elastodynamic simulations of
pulse-like ruptures and determine the spatio-temporal evolution of slip, slip
rate and pulse width perturbations induced by infinitesimal perturbations in
background stress. These simulations indicate that steady-state pulses driven
by thermal pressurisation are unstable. If the initial stress perturbation is
negative, ruptures stop; conversely, if the perturbation is positive, ruptures
grow and transition to either self-similar pulses (at low background stress) or
expanding cracks (at elevated background stress). Based on a dynamic
dislocation model, we develop an elastodynamic equation of motion for slip
pulses, and demonstrate that steady-state slip pulses are unstable if their
accrued slip $b$ is a decreasing function of the uniform background stress
$\tau_\mathrm{b}$. This condition is satisfied by slip pulses driven by thermal
pressurisation. The equation of motion also predicts quantitatively the growth
rate of perturbations, and provides a generic tool to analyse the propagation
of slip pulses. The unstable character of steady-state slip pulses implies that
this rupture mode is a key one determining the minimum stress conditions for
sustainable ruptures along faults, i.e., their ``strength''. Furthermore, slip
pulse instabilities can produce a remarkable complexity of rupture dynamics,
even under uniform background stress conditions and material properties.

Density of States (DOS) is $m$ times differentiable in the part of the spectrum

compact support and has H\""older continuous $m+1$ st derivative. The required
H\""older continuity depends on the fractional moment bounds satisfied by

properties.
  The local connectivity is measured in COSMOS around X-Ray detected groups
between redshift 0.5 and 1.2. To this end, large-scale filaments are extracted
using the accurate photometric redshifts of the COSMOS2015 catalogue in
two-dimensional slices of thickness 120 comoving Mpc centred on the group's
redshift. The link between connectivity, group mass and the properties of the
brightest group galaxy (BGG) is investigated. The same measurement is carried
out on mocks extracted from the lightcone of the hydrodynamical simulation
Horizon-AGN in order to control systematics.
  More massive groups are on average more connected. At fixed group mass in
low-mass groups, BGG mass is slightly enhanced at high connectivity, while in
high mass groups BGG mass is lower at higher connectivity. Groups with a
star-forming BGG have on average a lower connectivity at given mass. From the
analysis of the Horizon-AGN simulation, we postulate that different
connectivities trace different paths of group mass assembly: at high group
mass, groups with higher connectivity are more likely to have grown through a
recent major merger, which might be in turn the reason for the quenching of the
BGG. Future large-field photometric surveys, such as Euclid and LSST, will be

nodes, which will rapidly, automatically, and adaptively organize and mange a

the light of orbital hybridization modification. Compositional and structural
studies revealed that cationic substitution of Cd2+ by Ni2+ ions leads to a
monotonic shift in (220) diffraction peak, indicating the suppression of
lattice distortion while evolution of local strain with increasing Ni
concentration mainly associated to the mismatch in electro-negativity of Cd2+
and Ni2+ ion. In fact, Fermi level pinning towards conduction band minima takes
place with increasing Ni concentration at the cost of electronically
compensated oxygen vacancies, resulting modification in the distribution of
carrier concentration which eventually affects the band edge effective mass of
conduction band electrons and further endorses band gap renormalization.
Besides that, the appearance of longitudinal optical (LO) mode at 477 cm-1 as
manifested by Raman spectroscopy also indicate the active involvement of
electron-phonon scattering whereas modification in local coordination
environment particularly anti-crossing interaction in conjunction with presence
of satellite features and shake-up states with Ni doping is confirmed by X-ray
absorption near-edge and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. These
results manifest the gradual reduction of orbital hybridization with Ni
incorporation, leading to decrement in the band edge effective mass of

suggesting that the sensitivity to loading rate stems from the nonlinear and

gauge theories at finite temperature. We consider the presence of a chemical
potential $\mu$ for the fermionic charge, and monitor its evolution with
real-time classical lattice simulations. This method accounts for short-scale
fluctuations not included in the usual effective magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD)
treatment. We observe a self-similar decay of the chemical potential,
accompanied by an inverse cascade process in the gauge field that leads to a
production of long-range helical magnetic fields. We also study the chiral
charge dynamics in the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, and extract
its decay rate $\Gamma_5 \equiv -{d\log \mu\over dt}$. We provide in this way a
new determination of the gauge coupling and magnetic field dependence of the
chiral rate, which exhibits a best fit scaling as $\Gamma_5 \propto
e^{11/2}B^2$. We confirm numerically the fluctuation-dissipation relation
between $\Gamma_5$ and $\Gamma_{\rm diff}$, the Chern-Simons diffusion rate,
which was obtained in a previous study. Remarkably, even though we are outside
the MHD range of validity, the dynamics observed are in qualitative agreement
with MHD predictions. The magnitude of the chiral/diffusion rate is however a
factor $\sim 10$ times larger than expected in MHD, signaling that we are in
reality exploring a different regime accounting for short scale fluctuations.
This discrepancy calls for a revision of the implications of fermion number and
chirality non-conservation in finite temperature Abelian gauge theories, though
not definite conclusion can be made at this point until hard-thermal-loops
(HTL) are included in the lattice simulations.

this reaction involves similar kinetic energy as the ${}^{3}{\rm He}({\rm

finds widespread applications in a variety of fields. The time required for a
Markov chain to converge to its stationary distribution is known as the
classical mixing time. In this article, we deal with analog quantum algorithms
for mixing. First, we provide an analog quantum algorithm that given a Markov
chain, allows us to sample from its stationary distribution in a time that
scales as the sum of the square root of the classical mixing time and the
square root of the classical hitting time. Our algorithm makes use of the
framework of interpolated quantum walks and relies on Hamiltonian evolution in
conjunction with von Neumann measurements.
  There also exists a different notion for quantum mixing: the problem of
sampling from the limiting distribution of quantum walks, defined in a
time-averaged sense. In this scenario, the quantum mixing time is defined as
the time required to sample from a distribution that is close to this limiting
distribution. Recently we provided an upper bound on the quantum mixing time
for Erd\""os-Renyi random graphs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 050501 (2020)]. Here, we
also extend and expand upon our findings therein. Namely, we provide an
intuitive understanding of the state-of-the-art random matrix theory tools used

about macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic statistics of eigenvalues of
random matrices which we highlight here. Furthermore, we provide numerical
simulations that corroborate our analytical findings and extend this notion of

the effect of more flexible trend models is explored and we show that
sufficiently flexible models are capable of attenuating the signal, although
this is an expected byproduct of invoking such models. We also explore trend
models using X and Y centroid positions and show that there is no data-driven
impetus to adopt such models over temporal ones. We quantify the probability
that the 500 ppm moon-like dip could be caused by a Neptune-sized transiting
planet to be < 0.75%. We show that neither autocorrelation, Gaussian processes
nor a Lomb-Scargle periodogram are able to recover a stellar rotation period,
demonstrating that K1625 is a quiet star with periodic behavior < 200 ppm.
Through injection and recovery tests, we find that the star does not exhibit a
tendency to introduce false-positive dip-like features above that of pure
Gaussian noise. Finally, we address a recent re-analysis by Kreidberg et al
(2019) and show that the difference in conclusions is not from differing
systematics models but rather the reduction itself. We show that their
reduction exhibits i) slightly higher intra-orbit and post-fit residual

$\simeq$ 2 times larger Y-centroid variations, and iv) $\simeq$ 3.5 times

how to place attention on relevant areas of the visual input, which ultimately
allows the system to more rapidly detect unsafe conditions. We accomplish this
by using MPC to learn to select regions of interest in the input image, which
are used to output control actions as well as estimates of epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty in the attention-aware visual input. We use these
uncertainty estimates to quantify the safety of our network controller under
the current navigation condition. The proposed architecture and algorithm is
tested on a 1:5 scale terrestrial vehicle. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms previous approaches on early detection of unsafe

environment. The proposed architecture is the first step towards using deep

The group gas extends to radii of $\sim300$\,kpc to the north and south. The
observations reveal a cold front $\sim20$\,kpc north of the BGG center and an
X-ray bright stripped tail 70\,kpc long and 10\,kpc wide to the southwest of
the BGG. We argue that the atmosphere of the infalling group was slowed by its
encounter with the Virgo cluster gas, causing the BGG to move forward
subsonically relative to the group gas. We measure declining temperature and
metallicity gradients along the stripped tail. The tail gas can be traced back
to the cooler and enriched gas uplifted from the BGG center by buoyant bubbles,
implying that AGN outbursts may have intensified the stripping process. We
extrapolate to a virial radius of 740\,kpc and derive a virial mass of
$4.6\times10^{13}\,M_\odot$ for the M49 group. Its group atmosphere appears
truncated and deficient when compared with isolated galaxy groups of similar

random quantities with zero mean and a constant variance, thus, the system is
far away from the thermal equilibrium. It is known that in the framework of the
corresponding conservative problem the kinetic and potential energies oscillate

qualitatively changes the features of this process. The unsteady process
generally has two stages. At the first stage oscillations of kinetic and
potential energies with decreasing amplitude, subjected to exponential decay,
can be observed (this stage exists only in the underdamped case). At the second
stage (which always exists), the oscillations vanish, and the energies are
subjected to a power decay. The large-time asymptotics for the energy is
proportional to $t^{-3/2}$ in the case of the potential energy and to
$t^{-5/2}$ in the case the kinetic energy. Hence, at large values of time the

operator (MNO) that leases spectrum to a number of Programme Making and Special
Events (PMSE) users. The MNO offers two quality-of-service (QoS) classes (high
and low), differentiating the price based on the QoS class. The key question
that we address is whether and to which extent the MNO has incentive to adopt
this form of QoS-aware pricing. The first step is to model the parameters that
are controlled by each PMSE user: i) the way to choose between the two QoS
classes and ii) the available budget per QoS class. The second step is to
compute the maximum revenue of the MNO. Our analysis reveals that the MNO can
always tune the prices so as to maximise its revenue for the scenario where all
users belong to the high QoS class. This is a consistent result throughout our
study, that holds for any considered set of user-controlled parameters and of
technical parameters. We conclude that the adoption of QoS-aware pricing in the
LSA market generates a tussle between the MNO and the regulator. The MNO has
incentive to support fewer users but with high QoS and charge them more, which
is not aligned with the regulator's goal for social welfare maximisation.

vulnerabilities that constitute the highest overall risk exposure. The
conducted study showed that the vulnerabilities associated with the RF
interface of CIED represent an acceptable risk. In contrast, the network and
internet connectivity of external devices represent an important potential
risk. The previously described findings suggest that the highest risk is
associated with external systems and not the CIED itself.

The current requirement engineering practices are not suitable for small
software companies. We propose a social network-based requirement engineering
approach that will complement the traditional requirement engineering
approaches and will make it suitable for small software companies. Findings: We
have applied our SNS-based requirements determination approach to knowing about
its validity. As a result, we concluded that 33.06 % of invited end-users
participated in our approach and figured out 156 distinct user requirements. It
has been seen that it was not necessary for users to have requirements
engineering knowledge to participate in our proposed SNS-based approach that
made maximum users to be involved during requirements elicitation process. By
investigating the ideas and opinions communicated by users, we were able to
figure out a high number of user requirements. It was observed that maximum
user-requirements were determined within a short period of time (7days). Our
experience with SNS-based approach also says that end-users hardly know about
non-functional requirements and express it explicitly.
Improvements/Applications: we believe that researchers will consider SNS other

speed in reducing the energy of propagating Alfv\'en waves under conditions

Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. Our results
show that the energy of the transmitted Alfv\'en wave decreases as the
inhomogeneity parameter, $\lambda/L_{\rm A}$, increases. Here, $\lambda$ is the
wavelength of the Alfv\'en wave and $L_{\rm A}$ is the scale length of Alfv\'en
speed gradient. For gradients similar to those in coronal holes, the waves are
observed to lose a factor of $\approx 5$ more energy than they do when
propagating through a uniform plasma without a gradient. We have carried out
further experiments and analyses to constrain the cause of wave energy
reduction in the gradient. The loss of Alfv\'en wave energy from mode coupling
is unlikely, as we have not detected any other modes. Contrary to theoretical
expectations, the reduction in the energy of the transmitted wave is not
accompanied by a detectable reflected wave. Nonlinear effects are ruled out as
the amplitude of the initial wave is too small and the wave frequency well
below the ion cyclotron frequency. Since the total energy must be conserved, it
is possible that the lost wave energy is being deposited in the plasma. Further
studies are needed to explore where the energy is going.

successfully. One of the many theories is that of Probabilistic Population
Codes (PPC). Although this model has so far only been considered as meaningful

suggested that this mechanism also underlies higher cognition and
decision-making. However, the adequacy of PPC for this regard cannot be
confirmed by means of neurological standard measurement procedures.

systems and predictive data mining with theoretical neuroscience. The nexus of
both fields is given by behavioural variability and resulting internal
distributions. We adopt latest experimental settings and measurement approaches
from predictive data mining to obtain these internal distributions, to inform
the theoretical PPC approach and to deduce medical correlates which can indeed
be measured in vivo. This is a strong hint for the applicability of the PPC

Fabry-Perot interferometers (EFPI). Two schemes, comprising of a signal and a
reference interferometers, switched in different optical channels of the
interrogating unit, were proposed. The approach is based on the fact that the
fluctuations of some of the interrogator parameters produce correlated
fluctuations of the reference and signal interferometers optical path
differences (OPD) measured values. The fluctuations of the reference
interferometers measured OPD can be subtracted from the measured OPD of the
signal interferometer. The fluctuations of different parameters of the
interrogator are considered, the correlation properties of the produced noises
of the measured OPD values are demonstrated. The first scheme contains two
interferometers with similar parameters and enabled a three-fold resolution
improvement in the performed experiments, when the difference of the
interferometers OPDs was varied within about 10 nm. The second scheme contains
two interferometers with OPDs difference such that all interrogator
fluctuations, except for the dominating one produce uncorrelated OPD errors.
With the second scheme a two-fold resolution improvement was experimentally
demonstrated, when the interferometers OPDs difference was varied within more

by the angles between the each transform NMP zero direction and RNPD direction,

  Decomposition Algorithms",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of multi-objective optimization algorithms, multi-objective
Bayesian Global Optimization (MOBGO) is an important branch, in addition to
evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms (EMOAs). MOBGO utilizes
Gaussian Process models learned from previous objective function evaluations to
decide the next evaluation site by maximizing or minimizing an infill
criterion. A common criterion in MOBGO is the Expected Hypervolume Improvement
(EHVI), which shows a good performance on a wide range of problems, with
respect to exploration and exploitation. However, so far it has been a
challenge to calculate exact EHVI values efficiently. In this paper, an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the exact EHVI for a generic case is
proposed. This efficient algorithm is based on partitioning the integration
volume into a set of axis-parallel slices. Theoretically, the upper bound time
complexities are improved from previously $O (n^2)$ and $O(n^3)$, for two- and
three-objective problems respectively, to $\Theta(n\log n)$, which is
asymptotically optimal. This article generalizes the scheme in higher
dimensional case by utilizing a new hyperbox decomposition technique, which was
proposed by D{\""a}chert et al, EJOR, 2017. It also utilizes a generalization of
the multilayered integration scheme that scales linearly in the number of
hyperboxes of the decomposition. The speed comparison shows that the proposed
algorithm in this paper significantly reduces computation time. Finally, this
decomposition technique is applied in the calculation of the Probability of
Improvement (PoI).

not make detection impossible, but suggests it may be unlikely. Furthermore,

required two significant advances. First, we conducted the first large-scale

  Models",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Policy-based Models aim to enable a coalition of systems, be they
devices or services to adapt according to contextual changes such as
environmental factors, user preferences and different tasks whilst adhering to
various constraints and regulations as directed by a managing party or the
collective vision of the coalition. Recent developments have proposed new
architectures to realize the potential of GPMs but as the complexity of systems
and their associated requirements increases, there is an emerging requirement
to have scenarios and associated datasets to realistically evaluate GPMs with
respect to the properties of the operating environment, be it the future
battlespace or an autonomous organization. In order to address this
requirement, in this paper, we present a method of applying an agile knowledge
representation framework to model requirements, both individualistic and
collective that enables synthetic generation of ground truth data such that
advanced GPMs can be evaluated robustly in complex environments. We also
release conceptual models, annotated datasets, as well as means to extend the
data generation approach so that similar datasets can be developed for varying
complexities and different situations.

Based on the criteria of a force of impact and the speed of implementation of

Poisson's ratio over a large strain range is presented in this work by
combining the density-based topology optimization together with a mixed

Poisson's ratio based on the macro deformations is proposed, which is further
validated through direct numerical simulations. With the consistent
optimization formulations based on nonlinear homogenization, auxetic
metamaterial designs with respect to different loading orientations and with
different unit cell domains are systematically explored. In addition, the
extension to multimaterial auxetic metamaterial designs is also considered, and
stable optimization formulations are presented to obtain discrete metamaterial
topologies under finite strains. Various new auxetic designs are obtained based
on the proposed framework. To validate the performance of optimized designs, a
multiscale stability analysis is carried out using the Bloch wave method and
rank-one convexity check. As demonstrated, short and/or long wavelength
instabilities can occur during the loading process, leading to a change of
periodicity of the microstructure, which can affect the performance of an
optimized design.

digitally capturing physical prototypes. The motivation for this work is to
collect observations that can aid in understanding prototyping in the early
stages of engineering design projects, and this article investigates if and how
digital capture of physical prototypes can be used for this purpose.
Early-stage prototypes are usually rough and of low-fidelity and are thus often
discarded or substantially modified through the projects. Hence, retrospective
access to prototypes is a challenge when trying to gather accurate empirical
data. To capture the prototypes developed through the early stages of a
project, a new research tool has been developed for capturing prototypes
through multi-view images, along with metadata describing by whom, why, when
and where the prototypes were captured. Over the course of 17 months, this
research tool has been used to capture more than 800 physical prototypes from
76 individual users across many projects. In this article, one project is shown
in detail to demonstrate how this capturing system can gather empirical data
for enriching engineering design project cases that focus on prototyping for
concept generation. The authors also analyse the metadata provided by the
system to give understanding into prototyping patterns in the projects. Lastly,
through enabling digital capture of large quantities of data, the research tool
presents the foundations for training artificial intelligence-based predictors
and classifiers that can be used for analysis in engineering design research.

Chinese entity names are highly context-dependent. In addition, Chinese texts
lack delimiters to separate words, making it difficult to identify the boundary
of entities. Besides, the training data for CNER in many domains is usually
insufficient, and annotating enough training data for CNER is very expensive
and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for CNER.
First, we introduce a CNN-LSTM-CRF neural architecture to capture both local

of CNER model in identifying entity boundaries. Third, we introduce an

detailed analyses of the local pore geometry and the local flow fields. To
develop the model, the detailed pore space geometry and simulation runs data
from 3500 two-dimensional high-fidelity Lattice Boltzmann simulation runs are

Boltzmann simulations equivalents do with the great advantage that their

introduced to find an approximated optimal solution in general scenarios, where
the QoS is ensured by using the property that the optimal solution should
