jet derived from the jet break time of the afterglow. We carried out Monte
Carlo simulations of long gamma-ray burst observations assuming three radial
luminosity density profiles for jets and randomizing all burst parameters, and
created samples of gamma light curves by simulating jets undergoing Brownian
motions with linear restoring forces. We were able to demonstrate that the
connection between the variability and the characteristic angle is an
anti-correlation in case of uniform and power-law jet profiles, and a
correlation in case of a Gaussian profile. We have found that as low as $50$

sufficient for a $3\sigma\ (5\sigma) $ detection of the connection. The number
of observations required for the detection depends on the underlying jet beam

stepping over the gyration time-scale. In contrast to previous efforts in this
direction, the new scheme also features exact energy conservation. In the
derivation of the scheme, we find that a new numerical time-scale is
introduced. This scale is analyzed and the resulting restrictions on time-step
are derived. Based on this analysis, we develop an adaptive time-stepping
strategy the respects these constraints while stepping over the gyration scale
when physically justified. It is shown through numerical tests on

adjusting for the influence of the remaining variables. They form the backbone
for graphical models and are readily obtained from the inverse of the
covariance matrix. For compositional data, the covariance structure is
specified from log ratios of variables, so unless we try to ""open"" the data via
a normalization, this implies changes in the definition and interpretation of
partial correlations. In the present work, we elucidate how results derived by
Aitchison (1986) lead to a natural definition of partial correlation that has a
number of advantages over current measures of association. For this, we show
that the residuals of log-ratios between a variable with a reference, when
adjusting for all remaining variables including the reference, are
reference-independent. Since the reference itself can be controlled for,
correlations between residuals are defined for the variables directly without
the necessity to recur to ratios except when specifying which variables are
partialled out. Thus, perhaps surprisingly, partial correlations do not have
the problems commonly found with measures of pairwise association on
compositional data. They are well-defined between two variables, are properly
scaled, and allow for negative association. By design, they are
subcompositionally incoherent, but they share this property with conventional
partial correlations (where results change when adjusting for the influence of
fewer variables). We discuss the equivalence with normalization-based
approaches whenever the normalizing variables are controlled for. We also
discuss the partial variances and correlations we obtain from a previously
studied data set of Roman glass cups.

highly heterogeneous, which means that a given contact is present in only a

acceleration of the power method (PM). The power method is a simple technique
for determining the dominant eigenmode of an operator $\mathbf{A}$, and
variants of the power method are widely used in reactor analysis. Dynamic mode
decomposition is an algorithm for decomposing a time-series of
spatially-dependent data and producing an explicit-in-time reconstruction for
that data. By viewing successive power-method iterates as snapshots of a
time-varying system tending toward a steady state, DMD can be used to predict
that steady state using (a sometime surprisingly small) $n$ iterates. The
process of generating snapshots with the power method and extrapolating forward
with DMD can be repeated. The resulting restarted, DMD-accelerated power method
(or DMD-PM($n$)) was applied to the two-dimensional IAEA diffusion benchmark
and compared to the unaccelerated power method and Arnoldi's method. Results
indicate that DMD-PM($n$) can reduce the number of power iterations required by
approximately a factor of 5. However, Arnoldi's method always outperformed
DMD-PM($n$) for an equivalent number of matrix-vector products $\mathbf{Av}$.
In other words, DMD-PM($n$) cannot compete with leading eigensolvers if one is
not limited to snapshots produced by the power method. Contrarily, DMD-PM($n$)
can be readily applied as a post process to existing power-method applications
for which Arnoldi and similar methods are not directly applicable. A slight
variation of the method was also found to produce reasonable approximations to
the first and second harmonics without substantially affecting convergence of
the dominant mode.

paper considers three different approaches to routing in NoCs with ring

stragglers in distributed computing. However, coding in this context has been
mainly explored under the assumption of homogeneous workers, although the

the awareness of heterogeneity possibly causes a significant loss in latency.
In this paper, we suggest the optimal load allocation for coded distributed
computing with heterogeneous workers. Specifically, we focus on the scenario
that there exist workers having the same computing capability, which can be
regarded as a group for analysis. We rely on the lower bound on the expected
latency and obtain the optimal load allocation by showing that our proposed
load allocation achieves the minimum of the lower bound for a sufficiently
large number of workers. From numerical simulations, when assuming the group
heterogeneity, our load allocation reduces the expected latency by orders of
magnitude over the existing load allocation scheme.

structured social groups. Yet, it remains unclear how humans acquire knowledge
about these social structures to successfully navigate social relationships.
Here we address this knowledge gap with an interdisciplinary neuroimaging study
drawing on recent advances in network science and statistical learning.
Specifically, we collected BOLD MRI data while participants learned the
community structure of both social and non-social networks, in order to examine
whether the learning of these two types of networks was differentially
associated with functional brain network topology. From the behavioral data in
both tasks, we found that learners were sensitive to the community structure of
the networks, as evidenced by a slower reaction time on trials transitioning
between clusters than on trials transitioning within a cluster. From the
neuroimaging data collected during the social network learning task, we
observed that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and
temporoparietal junction was significantly greater when transitioning between
clusters than when transitioning within a cluster. Furthermore, temporoparietal
regions of the default mode were more strongly connected to hippocampus,
somatomotor, and visual regions during the social task than during the
non-social task. Collectively, our results identify neurophysiological
underpinnings of social versus non-social network learning, extending our
knowledge about the impact of social context on learning processes. More
broadly, this work offers an empirical approach to study the learning of social
network structures, which could be fruitfully extended to other participant
populations, various graph architectures, and a diversity of social contexts in
future studies.

using the artificial neural networks. To this end, we architect a special
algorithm for the feedforward neural network method (FNNM) to compute the QNMs
complying with the certain types of boundary conditions. To test the
reliability of the method, we consider two black hole spacetimes whose QNMs are
well-known: $4D$ pure de Sitter (dS) and five-dimensional Schwarzschild anti-de
Sitter (AdS) black holes. Using the FNNM, the QNMs of are computed numerically.
It is shown that the obtained QNMs via the FNNM are in good agreement with
their former QNM results resulting from the other methods. Therefore, our
method of finding the QNMs can be used for other curved spacetimes that obey
the same boundary conditions.

interaction (PSOI) in two-dimensional structures with a gate that can allow the

pair Coulomb field and creates a one-particle Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We
find that the normal component of the electric field substantially affects the
BEPs but the key role in forming the BEPs belongs to the in-plane component.
The ground state of a BEP with zero total momentum, which is doubly degenerate
in the absence of the gate, splits into two states. One of them is tunable by
varying the gate voltage whereas the other is on the contrary robust. The
tunable BEP has a higher binding energy which grows as the gate voltage
increases, with its orbital and spin structure changing continuously. At the
large negative voltage the tunable BEP decays. The orbital and spin structure
of the robust BEP does not depend on the gate voltage. Its energy level crosses
the conduction band bottom at high gate voltage of any polarity, but the robust
BEP remains bound and localized even when in continuum.

with non-smooth Lipschitz-continuous convex objective function and convex
functional constraints. Both algorithms, with an accuracy $\varepsilon$ of the

of estimates and have the complexity $O\left( \varepsilon^{-2} \right)$. In
both algorithms, the precise first-order information, which connected with

to both (i) a spatial resolution that is dictated by the characteristic

distance between the illuminated random mask and the target plane to be
sufficiently small that the effects of diffraction may be neglected. The latter
accounts for the effects of Fresnel diffraction in the regime of large Fresnel
number. Numerical simulations are provided for both variants of the method.
Contrast and signal-to-noise ratio are also considered. The method may be

polynomial of degree at most $D$ whose zero set divides $\mathbb{R}^d$ into
open connected sets, so that only a small fraction of the given varieties
intersect each of these sets. Guth's result generalized an earlier result of
Guth and Katz for points.
  Guth's proof relies on a variant of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, and for $k>0$,
it is unknown how to obtain an explicit representation of such a partitioning
polynomial and how to construct it efficiently. In particular, it is unknown
how to effectively construct such a polynomial for bounded-degree algebraic
curves (or even lines) in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  We present an efficient algorithmic construction for this setting. Given a
set of $n$ input algebraic curves and a positive integer $D$, we efficiently
construct a decomposition of space into $O(D^3\log^3{D})$ open ""cells,"" each of
which meets $O(n/D^2)$ curves from the input. The construction time is
$O(n^2)$. For the case of lines in $3$-space we present an improved
implementation, whose running time is $O(n^{4/3} \log^{O(1)} n)$. The constant
of proportionality in both time bounds depends on $D$ and the maximum degree of
the polynomials defining the input curves.
  As an application, we revisit the problem of eliminating depth cycles among
non-vertical lines in $3$-space, recently studied by Aronov and Sharir (2018),
and show an algorithm that cuts $n$ such lines into $O(n^{3/2+\epsilon})$
pieces that are depth-cycle free, for any $\epsilon > 0$. The algorithm runs in
$O(n^{3/2+\epsilon})$ time, which is a considerable improvement over the

applications. Our research has concentrated on four areas. We filter
information based on relevance to the user (in turn based on location),
evaluate methods for presenting information that represents entities occluded
from the user's view, enable interaction through a top-down map view metaphor
akin to current techniques used in the military, and facilitate collaboration
with other mobile users and/or a command center. In addition, we refined the
user interface architecture to conform to requirements from subject matter
experts. We discuss the lessons learned in our work and directions for future
research.

active contours can also track contours as the mesh animates, and
frame-to-frame correspondences between snaxels lead to a new method to convert

only one community or multiple communities. The desired tests should (a)
accommodate severe degree heterogeneity, (b) accommodate mixed-memberships, (c)
have a tractable null distribution, and (d) adapt automatically to different
levels of sparsity, and achieve the optimal phase diagram. How to find such a
test is a challenging problem.
  We propose the Signed Polygon as a class of new tests. Fixing $m \geq 3$, for
each $m$-gon in the network, define a score using the centered adjacency
matrix. The sum of such scores is then the $m$-th order Signed Polygon
statistic. The Signed Triangle (SgnT) and the Signed Quadrilateral (SgnQ) are
special examples of the Signed Polygon.
  We show that both the SgnT and SgnQ tests satisfy (a)-(d), and especially,
they work well for both very sparse and less sparse networks. Our proposed
tests compare favorably with the existing tests. For example, the EZ and GC
tests behave unsatisfactorily in the less sparse case and do not achieve the
optimal phase diagram. Also, many existing tests do not allow for severe
heterogeneity or mixed-memberships, and they behave unsatisfactorily in our
settings.
  The analysis of the SgnT and SgnQ tests is delicate and extremely tedious,
and the main reason is that we need a unified proof that covers a wide range of
sparsity levels and a wide range of degree heterogeneity. For lower bound
theory, we use a phase transition framework, which includes the standard
minimax argument, but is more informative. The proof uses classical theorems on
matrix scaling.

generate interpretable examples for each neuron of interest, and current
methods rely on a manual, qualitative evaluation of each setting, which is
prohibitively slow. We introduce a new metric that uses Fr\'echet Inception

to retrieve (from the KB and/or corpus) and (2) reasoning with this
heterogeneous information to find the best answer. PullNet uses an {iterative}
process to construct a question-specific subgraph that contains information
relevant to the question. In each iteration, a graph convolutional network
(graph CNN) is used to identify subgraph nodes that should be expanded using
retrieval (or ``pull'') operations on the corpus and/or KB. After the subgraph
is complete, a similar graph CNN is used to extract the answer from the
subgraph. This retrieve-and-reason process allows us to answer multi-hop
questions using large KBs and corpora. PullNet is weakly supervised, requiring
question-answer pairs but not gold inference paths. Experimentally PullNet
improves over the prior state-of-the art, and in the setting where a corpus is
used with incomplete KB these improvements are often dramatic. PullNet is also
often superior to prior systems in a KB-only setting or a text-only setting.

customizable parameterized collection of benchmark kernels used to calibrate

particular computation: two matrix multiplication variants, four Discontinuous

GPUs from multiple vendors and hardware generations. We view this customizable

growth. Nevertheless, most KBs still suffer from serious incompletion.
Researchers proposed many tasks such as knowledge base completion and relation

issues unsettled towards enriching the KBs. Knowledge base completion and
relation prediction assume that we know two elements of the fact triples and we
are going to predict the missing one. This assumption is too restricted in
practice and prevents it from discovering new facts directly. To address this
issue, we propose a new task, namely, fact discovery from knowledge base. This
task only requires that we know the head entity and the goal is to discover
facts associated with the head entity. To tackle this new problem, we propose a
novel framework that decomposes the discovery problem into several facet
discovery components. We also propose a novel auto-encoder based facet
component to estimate some facets of the fact. Besides, we propose a feedback

This paper aims to analyze performance of a network of randomly deployed

confined space (e.g. a circular region) and the wireless sensors, with fixed
sensing range, are deployed within the boundary of forest itself. The sensing
area of the network is modeled as a finite Boolean-Poisson model. In this

global image feature is controlled by the first gate and the local image
feature is selected by the attention mechanism. With the latter two gates, the
relationship between image and text can be well explored, which improves the

to the HAL QCD method. We calculate the HAL QCD potentials in the $I=2$
$\pi\pi$ scattering in order to see how statistical fluctuations of the
potential behave under the hybrid method. All of the calculations are performed
with the 2+1 flavor gauge configurations on $16^3 \times 32$ lattice at the
lattice spacing $a \approx 0.12$ fm and $m_{\pi} \approx 870$ MeV. It is
revealed that statistical errors for the potential are enhanced by stochastic
noises introduced by the hybrid method, which, however, are shown to be reduced
by increasing the level of dilutions, in particular, that of space dilutions.
From systematic studies, we obtain a guiding principle for a choice of dilution
types/levels and a number of eigenvectors to reduce noise contaminations to the
potential while keeping numerical costs reasonable. We also confirm that we can
obtain the scattering phase shifts for the $I=2$ $\pi\pi$ system by the hybrid
method within a reasonable numerical cost, which are consistent with the result
obtained with the conventional method. The knowledge we obtain in this study
will become useful to investigate hadron resonances which require quark
annihilation diagrams such as the $\rho$ meson by the HAL QCD potential with
the hybrid method.

Several work has recently discussed the stability of word embeddings in general

the surprising high stability of low-frequency concepts: low-frequency (<100)

theoretical analysis of the frequency dependence of the PSSW peaks on the

pinning, for variable magnetization at different surfaces of the Ni thin film.
The strain field induced by applying DC voltage to PMN-PT substrate leads to a
down shift of PSSW mode frequency owing to the magneto-elastic effect in Ni,
and corresponding changes in the spin wave resonance conditions. The observed
non-monotonic dependence of the PSSW frequency on DC voltage is related to an
abrupt change of the pinning parameter at certain values of the voltage. The

straightforward. In this paper, we study the agreement of PICO annotations made
by multiple human annotators, including both experts and non-experts.
Agreements are estimated by a standard span agreement (i.e., matching both

(i.e., matching labels without guaranteeing matching boundaries of spans).
Based on the analysis, we report two observations: (i) Boundaries of PICO span

disagreement in span boundaries, general areas of the span annotations are
broadly agreed by annotators. Our results suggest that applying a standard

Taylor-expanding the effective-one-body (EOB) resummed energy and and angular
momentum flux along circular orbits with all the known test-particle
information up to 5.5PN. The -- yet uncalculated -- terms at 4PN order and
beyond entering both the energy flux and the energy are taken into account as

approximants against full EOB waveforms using gauge-invariant phasing
diagnostics $Q_\omega=\hat\omega^2/\dot{\hat\omega}$, where $\hat\omega$ is the
dimensionless gravitational-wave frequency. The quasi-5.5PN phasing is found to
be systematically closer to the EOB one than the 3.5PN one. Notably, the
quasi-5.5PN (3.5PN) approximant accumulates a EOB$-$PN dephasing of
$\Delta\Psi^{\rm EOBPN}\sim10^{-3}$rad ($0.13$rad) up to frequency $\hat\omega
\simeq 0.06$, 6 orbits to merger, ($\hat\omega \simeq 0.086$, 2 orbits to
merger) for a fiducial binary neutron star system. We explore the performance
of the quasi-5.5PN approximant on the measurement of the tidal polarizability
parameter $\tilde\Lambda$ using injections of EOB waveforms hybridized with
numerical relativity merger waveforms. We prove that the quasi-5.5PN point-mass
approximant augmented with 6PN-accurate tidal terms allows one to reduce (and
in many cases even eliminate) the biases in the measurement of $\tilde\Lambda$
that are instead found when the standard 3.5PN point-mass baseline is used.
Methodologically, we demonstrate that the combined use of $Q_\omega$ analysis

over the past two decades and they are by now widely used in a number of
diverse applications. However, GP kernel design and the associated
hyper-parameter optimization are still hard and to a large extend open
problems. In this paper, we consider the task of GP regression for time series
modeling and analysis. The underlying stationary kernel can be approximated
arbitrarily close by a new proposed grid spectral mixture (GSM) kernel, which
turns out to be a linear combination of low-rank sub-kernels. In the case where
a large number of the sub-kernels are used, either the Nystr\""{o}m or the
random Fourier feature approximations can be adopted to deal efficiently with
the computational demands. The unknown GP hyper-parameters consist of the
non-negative weights of all sub-kernels as well as the noise variance; their
estimation is performed via the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation framework.
Two efficient numerical optimization methods for solving the unknown
hyper-parameters are derived, including a sequential majorization-minimization
(MM) method and a non-linearly constrained alternating direction of multiplier
method (ADMM). The MM matches perfectly with the proven low-rank property of
the proposed GSM sub-kernels and turns out to be a part of efficiency, stable,
and efficient solver, while the ADMM has the potential to generate better local
minimum in terms of the test MSE. Experimental results, based on various
classic time series data sets, corroborate that the proposed GSM kernel-based
GP regression model outperforms several salient competitors of similar kind in
terms of prediction mean-squared-error and numerical stability.

$C_p\cdot \left(2\sqrt{p}\right)^n$, where $C_p$ is a constant only depending

$p^{(1/2)\cdot (1+o(1))n}$, whereas all previously known upper bounds were of
the form $p^{(1-o(1))n}$ (with $p^n$ being a trivial bound).
  Our proof uses the so-called multi-colored sum-free theorem which is a
consequence of the Croot-Lev-Pach polynomial method. This method and its
consequences were already applied by Naslund as well as by Fox and the author
to prove bounds for the problem studied in this paper. However, using some key

large-scale architectural scene reconstruction nowadays. In order to generate a
complete scene reconstruction, an effective way is to completely cover the
scene using ground and aerial images, supplemented by laser scanning on certain
regions with low texture and complicated structure. Thus, the key issue is to
accurately calibrate cameras and register laser scans in a unified framework.
To this end, we proposed a three-step pipeline for complete scene
reconstruction by merging images and laser scans. First, images are captured
around the architecture in a multi-view and multi-scale way and are feed into a
structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline to generate SfM points. Then, based on the
SfM result, the laser scanning locations are automatically planned by
considering textural richness, structural complexity of the scene and spatial
layout of the laser scans. Finally, the images and laser scans are accurately
merged in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experimental evaluations on two ancient
Chinese architecture datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
complete scene reconstruction pipeline.

fused with the fine-level features from the top-down pathway. By adding FAMs
after the fusion operations in the top-down pathway, coarse-level features from
the GGM can be seamlessly merged with features at various scales. These two
pooling-based modules allow the high-level semantic features to be
progressively refined, yielding detail enriched saliency maps. Experiment
results show that our proposed approach can more accurately locate the salient
objects with sharpened details and hence substantially improve the performance

compound chondrule formation via optically thin shock waves. Several features
of compound chondrules indicate that compound chondrules are formed via the
collisions of supercooled precursors. We evaluate whether compound chondrules
can be formed via the collision of supercooled chondrule precursors in the
framework of the shock-wave heating model by using semi-analytical methods and
discuss whether most of the crystallized chondrules can avoid destruction upon
collision in the post-shock region. We find that chondrule precursors
immediately turn into supercooled droplets when the shock waves are optically
thin and they can maintain supercooling until the condensation of evaporated
fine dust grains. Owing to the large viscosity of supercooled melts,
supercooled chondrule precursors can survive high-speed collisions on the order
of $1\ {\rm km}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ when the temperature is below $\sim 1400\ {\rm
K}$. From the perspective of the survivability of crystallized chondrules,
shock waves with a spatial scale of $\sim 10^{4}\ {\rm km}$ may be potent
candidates for the chondrule formation mechanism. Based on our results from
one-dimensional calculations, a fraction of compound chondrules can be
reproduced when the chondrule-to-gas mass ratio in the pre-shock region is

(an uneven contribution of the neighbors to the decision about the direction of
flight of a given individual) the flock is more prone to loose coherence due to
perturbations even when a comparison with the standard egalitarian flock is
made. Thus, we concentrated on building models based on leaderfollower
relationships. And, indeed, our findings support the concept that hierarchical
organization can be very efficient in important practical cases, especially if
the leaderfollower interactions (corresponding to an underlying directed
network of interactions) have several levels. Efficiency here is associated
with remaining stable (coherent and cohesive) even in cases when collective

{\em obfuscation}, relying on the properties of natural language. Specifically,
a given English text is obfuscated using a neural model that aims to preserve
the syntactic relationships of the original sentence so that the obfuscated
sentence can be parsed instead of the original one. The model works at the word
level, and learns to obfuscate each word separately by changing it into a new
word that has a similar syntactic role. The text obfuscated by our model leads
to better performance on three syntactic parsers (two dependency and one
constituency parsers) in comparison to an upper-bound random substitution
baseline. More specifically, the results demonstrate that as more terms are
obfuscated (by their part of speech), the substitution upper bound
significantly degrades, while the neural model maintains a relatively high
performing parser. All of this is done without much sacrifice of privacy
compared to the random substitution upper bound. We also further analyze the
results, and discover that the substituted words have similar syntactic
properties, but different semantic content, compared to the original words.

  a few typos)",,,,"econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Central to the official ""green growth"" discourse is the conjecture that
absolute decoupling can be achieved with certain market instruments. This paper
evaluates this claim focusing on the role of technology, while changes in GDP
composition are treated elsewhere. Some fundamental difficulties for absolute
decoupling, referring specifically to thermodynamic costs, are identified
through a stylized model based on empirical knowledge on innovation and
learning. Normally, monetary costs decrease more slowly than production grows,
and this is unlikely to change should monetary costs align with thermodynamic
costs, except, potentially, in the transition after the price reform.
Furthermore, thermodynamic efficiency must eventually saturate for physical
reasons. While this model, as usual, introduces technological innovation just
as a source of efficiency, innovation also creates challenges: therefore,
attempts to sustain growth by ever-accelerating innovation collide also with
the limited reaction capacity of people and institutions. Information
technology could disrupt innovation dynamics in the future, permitting quicker
gains in eco-efficiency, but only up to saturation and exacerbating the
downsides of innovation. These observations suggest that long-term
sustainability requires much deeper transformations than the green growth
discourse presumes, exposing the need to rethink scales, tempos and
institutions, in line with ecological economics and the degrowth literature.

Here, by constructing BICs at K point in photonic graphenes, we theoretically
demonstrate that the far-field polarization states close to BICs can exhibit
remarkable polarization diversity. Interestingly, C-points (circular

along a closed loop enclosing BICs in the momentum space, the trajectory of the

research. Here, we study the most probable stellar CME candidates associated
with flares captured in the literature to date, all of which were observed on
magnetically active stars. We use a simple CME model to derive masses and
kinetic energies from observed quantities, and transform associated flare data
to the GOES 1--8~\AA\ band. Derived CME masses range from $\sim 10^{15}$ to
$10^{22}$~g. Associated flare X-ray energies range from $10^{31}$ to

generally lie along or below the extrapolated mean for solar events. In
contrast, CME kinetic energies lie below the analogous solar extrapolation by
roughly two orders of magnitude, indicating approximate parity between flare
X-ray and CME kinetic energies. These results suggest that the CMEs associated
with very energetic flares on active stars are more limited in terms of the

luminous REOTs spectroscopically unclassified might be rapidly evolving
SNe~Ib/Ic or Ibn. Three events in the sample cannot be explained by the two
models we use. We expect that future intense photometry, spectroscopic
classifications, and systematic light-curve modeling of luminous REOTs will
shed more light on their nature.

(RL). In this paper, we propose a novel method called Generative Exploration
and Exploitation (GENE) to overcome sparse reward. GENE automatically generates
start states to encourage the agent to explore the environment and to exploit
received reward signals. GENE can adaptively tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation according to the varying distributions of states experienced by
the agent as the learning progresses. GENE relies on no prior knowledge about
the environment and can be combined with any RL algorithm, no matter on-policy
or off-policy, single-agent or multi-agent. Empirically, we demonstrate that
GENE significantly outperforms existing methods in three tasks with only binary
rewards, including Maze, Maze Ant, and Cooperative Navigation. Ablation studies
verify the emergence of progressive exploration and automatic reversing.

Digital Fault Recorder (DFR) to evaluate STATCOM's response to dynamic system

STATCOMs with automatic gain adjustment feature. This feature actively measures
the external system's Thevanin impedance and accordingly changes the STATCOM

finding finite size spectrum of Hamiltonians in quantum field theory described

method have been systematically studied near the UV fixed point (when the
characteristic energy related to the coupling is less than the truncation
cutoff) where a good theoretical understanding has been achieved. However
numerically the method demonstrated a good agreement with other methods for
much larger values of the coupling when the RG flow approaches a new fixed
point in the infrared. In the present paper we investigate this regime for a
number of boundary RG flows testing the leading exponent and truncation errors.
We also study the flows beyond the first fixed point which have been observed
numerically but yet lack a theoretical understanding. We show that while in
some models such flows approximate reversed physical RG flows, in other models
the spectrum approaches a stable regime that does not correspond to any local
boundary condition. Furthermore we find that in general the flows beyond the

research-oriented applications. Because manual segmentation methods are
tedious, and fully automatic segmentation lacks the flexibility of human
intervention or correction, semi-automatic methods have become the preferred
type of medical image segmentation. We present a hybrid, semi-automatic
segmentation method in 3D that integrates both region-based and boundary-based
procedures. Our method differs from previous hybrid methods in that we perform
region-based and boundary-based approaches separately, which allows for more
efficient segmentation. A region-based technique is used to generate an initial
seed contour that roughly represents the boundary of a target brain structure,
alleviating the local minima problem in the subsequent model deformation phase.
The contour is deformed under a unique force equation independent of image
edges. Experiments on MRI data show that this method can achieve high accuracy
and efficiency primarily due to the unique seed initialization technique.

often not able to detect advanced obfuscated malware. Hence time-to-time
various authors have proposed different machine learning solutions to identify

improved by using the clustering method. Therefore in this paper, we propose a
novel scalable and effective clustering method to improve the detection
accuracy of the malicious android application and obtained a better overall
accuracy (98.34%) by random forest classifier compared to regular method, i.e.,
taking the data altogether to detect the malware. However, as far as true
positive and true negative are concerned, by clustering method, true positive
is best obtained by decision tree (97.59%) and true negative by support vector
machine (99.96%) which is the almost same result obtained by the random forest
true positive (97.30%) and true negative (99.38%) respectively. The reason that
overall accuracy of random forest is high because the true positive of support
vector machine and true negative of the decision tree is significantly less
than the random forest.

suggested diverse contributors, like growth of online media, echo chamber

tools to understand, quantify, and predict the emergence of high political
polarization among voters and their legislators. Here, we analyze millions of
roll-call votes cast in the U.S. Congress over the past six decades. Our
analysis reveals the critical change of polarization patterns that started at
the end of 1980's. In earlier decades, polarization within each Congress tended
to decrease with time. In contrast, in the recent decades, the polarization has
been likely to grow within each term. To shed light on the reasons for this
change, we introduce here a formal model for competitive dynamics to quantify
the evolution of polarization patterns in the legislative branch of the U.S.
government. Our model represents dynamics of polarization, enabling us to
successfully predict the direction of polarization changes in 28 out of 30 U.S.
Congresses elected in the past six decades. From the evolution of polarization
level as measured by the Rice index, our model extracts a hidden parameter -
polarization utility which determines the convergence point of the polarization
evolution. The increase in the polarization utility implied by the model
strongly correlates with two current trends: growing polarization of voters and
increasing influence of election campaign funders. Two largest peaks of the
model's polarization utility correlate with significant political or
legislative changes happening at the same time.

  arXiv:1811.02815",,,,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful
recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering(CF) provides a way
to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history.
However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior
data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems
have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to
alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that,
for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by
her trusted users. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in
the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process.
Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static
models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the
recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal
recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence
propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social
diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion
process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a
free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key
idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation
structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion
process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could
be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is
not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world
datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than
13% performance improvements over the best baselines.

(typically small) group of neurons from a large neuron pool. It is conjectured
to underlie many of the brain's fundamental computational abilities. However,
not much is known about the robustness of a spike-based WTA network to the
inherent randomness of the input spike trains. In this work, we consider a
spike-based $k$--WTA model wherein $n$ randomly generated input spike trains
compete with each other based on their underlying statistics, and $k$ winners
are supposed to be selected. We slot the time evenly with each time slot of
length $1\, ms$, and model the $n$ input spike trains as $n$ independent
Bernoulli processes. The Bernoulli process is a good approximation of the
popular Poisson process but is more biologically relevant as it takes the
refractory periods into account. Due to the randomness in the input spike
trains, no circuits can guarantee to successfully select the correct winners in
finite time. We focus on analytically characterizing the minimal amount of time
needed so that a target minimax decision accuracy (success probability) can be
reached.
  We first derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the decision time. We
show that to have a (minimax) decision error $\le \delta$ (where $\delta \in
(0,1)$), the computation time of any WTA circuit is at least \[ ((1-\delta)
\log(k(n -k)+1) -1)T_{\mathcal{R}}, \] where $T_{\mathcal{R}}$ is a difficulty
parameter of a WTA task that is independent of $\delta$, $n$, and $k$. We then
design a simple WTA circuit whose decision time is \[ O(
\log\frac{1}{\delta}+\log k(n-k))T_{\mathcal{R}}). \] It turns out that for any
fixed $\delta \in (0,1)$, this decision time is order-optimal in terms of its
scaling in $n$, $k$, and $T_{\mathcal{R}}$.
