  Simultaneous Interpretation","NAACL 2019",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneous interpretation, the translation of speech from one language to
another in real-time, is an inherently difficult and strenuous task. One of the
greatest challenges faced by interpreters is the accurate translation of
difficult terminology like proper names, numbers, or other entities.
Intelligent computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools that could analyze the
spoken word and detect terms likely to be untranslated by an interpreter could
reduce translation error and improve interpreter performance. In this paper, we
propose a task of predicting which terminology simultaneous interpreters will
leave untranslated, and examine methods that perform this task using supervised
sequence taggers. We describe a number of task-specific features explicitly
designed to indicate when an interpreter may struggle with translating a word.
Experimental results on a newly-annotated version of the NAIST Simultaneous
Translation Corpus (Shimizu et al., 2014) indicate the promise of our proposed
method.

first eigenvalue of one of the operators involved: if it is positive, then the
chemical potential vanishes at infinity and every element of the omega-limit is
a stationary solution to the phase equation; if, instead, the first eigenvalue
is 0, then every element of the omega-limit satisfies a problem containing a
real function related to the chemical potential. Such a function is nonunique
and time dependent, in general, as we show by an example. However, we give
sufficient conditions in order that this function be uniquely determined and
constant.

reproduces key properties of the model, including the screening of the impurity
spin, formation of the resonance at the Fermi energy, and a linear conductance
of $2e^2/h$. We discuss the suppression of the Kondo resonance by the
electron-phonon interaction on the impurity site. When analyzing THz STM
experiments we compute the time dependence of the key physical quantities,
including current, the number of electrons on the localized orbital, and the

fragments of bounded hypertreewidth. Approximating a hard CQ by a query from
such a fragment can thus allow for an efficient approximate evaluation. While
underapproximations (i.e., approximations that return correct answers only) are
well-understood, the dual notion of overapproximations (i.e, approximations
that return complete - but not necessarily sound - answers), and also a more
general notion of approximation based on the symmetric difference of query
results, are almost unexplored. In fact, the decidability of the basic problems
of evaluation, identification, and existence of those approximations has been
open.
  This article establishes a connection between overapproximations and
existential pebble games that allows for studying such problems systematically.
Building on this connection, it is shown that the evaluation and identification
problem for overapproximations can be solved in polynomial time. While the
general existence problem remains open, the problem is shown to be decidable in
2EXPTIME over the class of acyclic CQs and in PTIME for Boolean CQs over binary
schemata. Additionally we propose a more liberal notion of overapproximations
to remedy the known shortcoming that queries might not have an
overapproximation, and study how queries can be overapproximated in the
presence of tuple generating and equality generating dependencies.
  The techniques are then extended to symmetric difference approximations and
used to provide several complexity results for the identification, existence,
and evaluation problem for this type of approximations.

far heavier pruning than possible in prior works, resulting in significant area

whether such an approach can be extended to the crystallization of driven melts

Currently, Stack Overflow hides comments that are ranked beyond the top 5.

result, 4.4 million comments are hidden under their answer threads. Therefore,
it is very important to understand how well the current comment hiding
mechanism works. In this study, we investigate whether the mechanism can
effectively deliver informative comments while hiding uninformative comments.
We find that: 1) Hidden comments are as informative as displayed comments; more
than half of the comments (both hidden and displayed) are informative (e.g.,
providing alternative answers, or pointing out flaws in their associated
answers). 2) The current comment hiding mechanism tends to rank and hide

in practice, these algorithms generally also require large amounts of on-policy

many problems. To this end, we propose to learn a reinforcement learning
procedure in a federated way, where individual off-policy learners can solve
the individual meta-training tasks, and then consolidate these solutions into a
single meta-learner. Since the central meta-learner learns by imitating the
solutions to the individual tasks, it can accommodate either the standard
meta-RL problem setting or a hybrid setting where some or all tasks are
provided with example demonstrations. The former results in an approach that
can leverage policies learned for previous tasks without significant amounts of
on-policy data during meta-training, whereas the latter is particularly useful
in cases where demonstrations are easy for a person to provide. Across a number
of continuous control meta-RL problems, we demonstrate significant improvements
in meta-RL sample efficiency in comparison to prior work as well as the ability
to scale to domains with visual observations.

with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random

the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures. We
conclude with numerical experiments that illustrate how the incorporation of
uncertainty yields a more robust theoretical framework for enhancing

partial densities where the structure required by ES schemes breaks down (the
entropy variables are no longer defined). It is shown that while an EC flux is
well-defined in this limit, a well-defined upwind ES flux requires
appropriately averaged partial densities in the dissipation matrix. A similar
result holds for the high-order TecNO reconstruction. However, this does not
prevent the numerical solution from developing negative partial densities or
internal energy. Numerical experiments were performed on one-dimensional and
two-dimensional interface and shock-interface problems. The present scheme
exactly preserves stationary interfaces. On moving interfaces, it produces
pressure anomalies typically observed with conservative schemes [Karni,

are not present in the single-component case, violate neither entropy stability
nor a minimum principle of the specific entropy. Finally, we show that the

strategies, the definitions of extortionate strategies are algebraically rigid,
apply only to memory-one strategies, and require complete knowledge of a
strategy (memory-one cooperation probabilities). We describe a method to detect
extortionate behaviour from the history of play of a strategy. When applied to
a corpus of 204 strategies this method detects extortionate behaviour in
well-known extortionate strategies as well others that do not fit the algebraic
definition. The highest performing strategies in this corpus are able to
exhibit selectively extortionate behavior, cooperating with strong strategies
while exploiting weaker strategies, which no memory-one strategy can do. These
strategies emerged from an evolutionary selection process and their existence
contradicts widely-repeated folklore in the evolutionary game theory
literature: complex strategies can be extraordinarily effective,
zero-determinant strategies can be outperformed by non-zero determinant
strategies, and longer memory strategies are able to outperform short memory
strategies. Moreover, while resistance to extortion is critical for the
evolution of cooperation, the extortion of weak opponents need not prevent
cooperation between stronger opponents, and this adaptability may be crucial to
maintaining cooperation in the long run.

ground-state binding energy in the 8Li + 12C and 8Li + 208Pb breakup reactions,
by considering an arbitrary range for the 8Li ground-state binding energies
{\epsilon}b, varying from the experimental one 2.03 MeV down to 0.01 MeV.
Regardless the target mass, we first show that the Coulomb breakup cross
section is stronger dependent on {\epsilon}b than the nuclear breakup cross
section, due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb forces and to the
electromagnetic transition matrix elements. For example, in case of 8Li + 208Pb
reaction at Elab = 60MeV, it is found that |{\sigma}_int|\simeq
4\times{\sigma}_nucl$, while ${\sigma}_Coul\simeq 35\times{\sigma_nucl}$. This
shows clearly that small nuclear contribution in a Coulomb-dominated reaction
does not imply insignificant Coulomb-nuclear interference. Such result can be
mainly attributed to peripheral interference phenomenon, represented by a
function of the binding energy, which determines the peripheral range of
nuclear forces, where Coulomb and nuclear forces strongly interfere
destructively.

against defense models (models to defense adversarial attacks). In particular,

  Adversarial examples generated by existing attacks are generally hard to
transfer to defense models. We observe the property of regional homogeneity in
adversarial perturbations and suggest that the defenses are less robust to
regionally homogeneous perturbations. Therefore, we propose an effective
transforming paradigm and a customized gradient transformer module to transform
existing perturbations into regionally homogeneous ones. Without explicitly
forcing the perturbations to be universal, we observe that a well-trained

universal) benefiting from the under-fitting phenomenon. Thorough experiments
demonstrate that our work significantly outperforms the prior art attacking

exactly Gaussian distribution, significant non-Gaussianities affecting PBH
formation must be considered. Numerical simulations are used to investigate the
critical value and the mass of PBHs which form, and peaks theory is used to
calculate the mass fraction of the universe collapsing to form PBHs at the time

mass function is also derived. It is found that the abundance of PBHs is very
sensitive to the non-linear effects, and that the power spectrum
$\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ must be a factor of $\sim2$ larger to produce the same
number of PBHs as the linear model (where the exact value depends on the

and the longer it takes to damp these oscillations. A circumbinary disc that is
only mildly inclined may increase its inclination by a factor of a few before
it moves towards alignment. The results of the SPH simulations agree well with
those of linear theory. We investigate the properties of the circumbinary
disc/ring around KH 15D. We determine disc properties based on the
observational constraints imposed by the changing binary brightness. We find
that the inclination is currently at a local minimum and will increase
substantially before setting to coplanarity. In addition, the nodal precession
is currently near its most rapid rate. The recent observations that show a
reappearance of Star B impose constraints on the thickness of the layer of

substantial inward drift and settling towards to disc midplane. For disc masses

performed over a discrete subgroup of the rotation group, enabling, thus, joint

one layer with strong spin-orbit coupling and a second layer without spin-orbit

diffusion modes of the two isolated layers hybridize in the presence of
tunneling, which constitutes a source of spin-charge coupled transport in the
second layer. Second, the random tunneling introduces spin-orbit coupling in

the surface of a topological insulator (TI) and show that the proximity of the
TI induces a coupling of the spin and charge transport in the 2DEG. In
addition, we show that such coupling can be tuned by varying the doping of the
TI's surface. We then obtain, for a simple geometry, the current-induced

were subsequently lost. Using orbit calculations we assess the likelihood that
an existing sample of 57 field stars with globular cluster-like CN band
strength originated in any of the currently known Milky Way globular clusters.
Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Gaia data, we determine orbits and integrals

these stars been stripped from such objects, they would have remained on very

properties consistent with the halo of the Milky Way; however, only 20 stars
have likely orbital associations with an existing globular cluster. The

sample has to be properly cleaned from spurious objects. Furthermore, the bias

of this analysis is a new model of the size function, parameterised in terms of

observation that the standard current conservation equations remain unchanged
if any differential operator that commutes with the total exterior derivative
multiplies the current. Such an operator, effectively changing the dimension of
the current, increases the allowable gauge transformations in electromagnetism
and is at the heart of N\""other's second theorem. Here we develop a consistent
theory of electromagnetism that exploits this hidden redundancy in which the
standard gauge symmetry in electromagnetism is modified by the rotationally
invariant operator, the fractional Laplacian. We show that the resultant
theories all allow for anomalous (non-traditional) scaling dimensions of the
gauge field and the associated current. Using well known extension theorems and
the membrane paradigm, we show that either the boundary (UV) or horizon (IR)
theory of holographic dilatonic models are both described by such fractional
electromagnetism. We also show that the non-local Pippard kernel introduced to
solve the problem of the Meissner effect in elemental superconductors can also
be formulated as a special case of fractional electromagnetism. We show that
the standard charge quantization rules fail when the gauge field acquires an

-- describes an ensemble of atoms which are collectively coupled to a leaky
cavity mode. As a result of the cooperative nature of these interactions, the
system's dynamics are captured by the behavior of a single mean-field,
collective spin. In this mean-field limit, it has recently been shown that the
interplay between photon losses and periodic driving of light-matter coupling
can lead to time-crystalline-like behavior of the collective spin. In this
work, we investigate whether such a Dicke time crystal is stable to
perturbations that explicitly break the mean-field solvability of the
conventional Dicke model. In particular, we consider the addition of
short-range interactions between atoms, which breaks the collective coupling
and leads to complex many-body dynamics. In this context, the interplay between
periodic driving, dissipation and interactions yields a rich set of dynamical
responses including long-lived and metastable Dicke time crystals, where losses
can cool down the many-body heating resulting from the continuous pump of
energy from the periodic drive. Specifically, when the additional short-range
interactions are ferromagnetic, we observe time crystalline behavior at
non-perturbative values of the coupling strength, suggesting the possible
existence of stable dynamical order in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body
system. These findings illustrate the rich nature of novel dynamical responses
with many-body character in quantum optics platforms.

galaxies as luminous as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and for halos as
massive as expected for the LMC (determined by its rotation speed), the
simulations predict about 3 satellites with stellar masses exceeding
$M_*>10^5\, M_\odot$. If the LMC is on its first pericentric passage, then
these satellites should be near the LMC and should have orbital angular momenta
roughly coincident with that of the LMC. We use 3D positions and velocities
from the 2nd data release of the Gaia mission to revisit which of the
""classical"" MW dwarf spheroidals could plausibly be LMC satellites. The new
proper motions of the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidals place them on orbits
closely aligned with the orbital plane of the Magellanic Clouds, hinting at a
potential Magellanic association. Together with the Small Magellanic Cloud

degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering. Combining
void information with that from BAO and galaxy RSD in the same CMASS sample, we

Fitting a flat cosmological constant $\Lambda$CDM model to these results in
combination with Planck CMB data, we find up to an 11% reduction in
uncertainties on $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ compared to use of the corresponding BOSS

three distinct constructions that are common in the literature, namely the

expansion up to the leading order in both vacuum and non-vacuum. We provide a
collection of results including the area of the codimension-two edge, the
maximal hypersurface volume and their isoperimetric ratio for each

quantitative properties of causal diamonds. In particular, by solving the
dynamical equations of the expansion and the shear on the lightcone, we find
that intriguingly only the light-cone cut construction yields an area deficit
proportional to the Bel-Robinson superenergy density W in four dimensional
spacetime, but such a direct connection fails to hold in any other dimension.
We also compute the volume of the Alexandrov interval causal diamond in vacuum,

compact dwarfs (UCDs) around predominantly massive elliptical galaxies. Their
origin is still debated as some UCDs are considered to be the remnant nuclei of

very close projected distance (1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass

of this UCD as either a massive cluster or the remnant nucleus of a dissolved
galaxy. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope data to study the photometric
and structural properties of FCC47-UCD1. In the MUSE data, the UCD is
unresolved, but we use its spectrum to determine the radial velocity and
metallicity. FCC47-UCD1's surface brightness is best described by a single King
profile with low concentration C = R_t/R_c ~ 10 and large effective radius (r_e
= 24pc). Its integrated magnitude and a blue colour (G = -10.6 mag, g-z = 1.46
mag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H] = -1.12+-0.10 dex and an age > 8
Gyr obtained from the full fitting of the MUSE spectrum suggests a stellar
population mass of M_star = 4.87x10^6 M_sun. The low S/N of the MUSE spectrum
prevents detailed stellar population analysis. Due to the limited spectral
resolution of MUSE, we can only give an upper limit on the velocity dispersion
(sig < 17km/s), and consequently on its dynamical mass (M_dyn < 1.3x10^7
M_sun). The origin of the UCD cannot be constrained with certainty. The low
metallicity, old age and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin,
whereas the extended size is consistent with an origin as the stripped nucleus
of a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M_sun.

caused by the transition from sheet/filament to halo gas. Absorption systems
with $N \gtrsim 10^{16} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ are dominated by collisionally
ionized O VII and O VIII, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column
densities is also influenced by photoionization. At these high column
densities, O VII and O VIII arising in the same structures probe systematically
different gas temperatures, meaning their line ratio does not translate into a
simple estimate of temperature. While O VII and O VIII column densities and
covering fractions correlate poorly with the H I column density at
$N_{\mathrm{H \, I}} \gtrsim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, O VII and O VIII
column densities are higher in this regime than at the more common, lower H I

this analysis. We obtain a preliminary estimate of the fractional deviation of

Astrobiological evolution of the Milky Way (or the shape of its
""astrobiological landscape"") has emerged as one of the key research topics in
recent years. In order to build precise, quantitative models of the Galactic
habitability, we need to account for two opposing tendencies of life and
intelligence in the most general context: the tendency to spread to all
available ecological niches (conventionally dubbed ""colonization"") and the
tendency to succumb to various types of existential catastrophes
(""catastrophism""). These evolutionary tendencies have become objects of study
in fields such as ecology, macroevolution, risk analysis, and futures studies,
while a serious astrobiological treatment has been lacking so far. Aims. Our
aim is to numerically investigate the dynamics of opposed processes of
expansion (panspermia, colonization) and extinction (catastrophic mechanisms)
of life in the Galaxy. Methods. We employ a new type of numerical simulation
based on 1D probabilistic cellular automaton with very high temporal
resolution, in order to study astrobiological dynamics. Results. While the
largest part of the examined parameter space shows very low habitability
values, as expected, the remaining part has some observationally appealing
features that imply, among other things, a reduction in the amount of
fine-tuning necessary for resolving the Fermi paradox. Conclusions. Advanced
aspects of Galactic habitability are amenable to precision studies using
massive parallel computer simulations. There are regions of parameter space
corresponding to a quasi-stationary state satisfying observable constraints and
possessing viable SETI targets.

hydrodynamic escape of an Earth-like atmosphere. We consider the case of an
Earth-mass planet with an atmospheric composition identical to that of the
current Earth orbiting at 1 AU around a young and very active solar mass star.
  Methods. To model the upper atmosphere, we used the Kompot Code, which is a
first-principles model that calculates the physical structures of the upper
atmospheres of planets, taking into account hydrodynamics and the main chemical
and thermal processes taking place in the upper atmosphere of a planet. This
model enabled us to calculate the 1D vertical structure of the atmosphere using
as input the high-energy spectrum of a young and active Sun.
  Results. The atmosphere has the form of a transonic hydrodynamic Parker wind,
which has an outflow velocity at the upper boundary of our computational domain
that exceeds the escape velocity. The outflowing gas is dominated by atomic
nitrogen and oxygen and their ion equivalents and has a maximum ionization
fraction of 20%. The mass outflow rate is found to be 1.8x10^9 g s^-1, which
would erode the modern Earth's atmosphere in less than 0.1 Myr.
  Conclusions. This extreme mass loss rate suggests that an Earth-like
atmosphere cannot form when the planet is orbiting within the habitable zone of
a very active star. Instead, such an atmosphere can only form after the
activity of the star has decreased to a much lower level. This happened in the
early atmosphere of the Earth, which was likely dominated by other gases such
as CO2. Since the time it takes for the activity of a star to decay is highly
dependent on its mass, this is important for understanding possible formation
timescales for planets orbiting low-mass stars.

probabilities of trajectories of a stochastic dynamics and its time reversals,
has a central role in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In the theory of
probability, the change in the statistical properties of observables can be
represented by a change in the probability measure. We consider operators on
the space of probability measure that induce changes in the statistical
properties of a process, and formulate entropy productions in terms of these
change-of-probability-measure (CPM) operators. This mathematical underpinning
of the origin of entropy productions allows us to achieve an organization of
various forms of fluctuation relations: All entropy productions have a
non-negative mean value, admit the integral fluctuation theorem, and satisfy a
rather general fluctuation relation. Other results such as the transient
fluctuation theorem and detailed fluctuation theorems then are derived from the
general fluctuation relation with more constraints on the operator. We use a
discrete-time, discrete-state-space Markov process to draw the
contradistinction among three reversals of a process: time reversal, protocol
reversal and the dual process. The properties of their corresponding CPM
operators are examined, and the domains of validity of various fluctuation
relations for entropy productions in physics and chemistry are revealed. We
also show that our CPM operator formalism can help us rather easily extend
other fluctuations relations for excess work and heat, discuss the martingale
properties of entropy productions, and derive the stochastic integral formulas

Seyfert 2 galaxies. This suggests that this ratio is a good indicator for
identifying buried AGNs. Then, we apply this criterion to 23 local
ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) in various merger stages hosting
AGNs. We find that AGNs in most of mid- to late-stage mergers are buried, while
those in earlier stage ones (including non-merger) are not. This result
suggests that the fraction of buried AGNs in U/LIRGs increases as the

Compton-thick, partial-covering medium, responsible for the irregular dips. The
high X-ray/optical flux ratio rules out the possibility that CG X-1 is a

updating their models frequently with newly-collected data in an online

  In this paper, we investigate whether the change in the output of a black-box

attack surface against black-box ML models and such information leakage may
compromise the intellectual property and data privacy of the ML model owner. We
propose four attacks following an encoder-decoder formulation, which allows
inferring diverse information of the updating set. Our new attacks are
facilitated by state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, we
propose a hybrid generative model (CBM-GAN) that is based on generative
adversarial networks (GANs) but includes a reconstructive loss that allows
reconstructing accurate samples. Our experiments show that the proposed attacks

evolution connection and a principal data point for near-field cosmology. Due
to its proximity (780 kpc), M31 can be resolved into individual stars like the
Milky Way (MW). Unlike the MW, we have the advantage of a global view of M31,
enabling M31 to be observed with techniques that also apply to more distant
galaxies. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that M31 may have survived a major
merger within the last several Gyr, shaping the morphology of its stellar halo
and triggering a starburst, while leaving the stellar disk largely intact. The
MW and M31 thus provide complementary opportunities for in-depth studies of the
disks, halos, and satellites of L* galaxies.
  Our understanding of the M31 system will be transformed in the 2020s if they
include wide field facilities for both photometry (HST-like sensitivity and
resolution) and spectroscopy (10-m class telescope, >1 sq. deg. field, highly
multiplexed, R~ 3000 to 6000). We focus here on the power of these facilities
to constrain the past, present, and future merger history of M31, via
chemo-dynamical analyses and star formation histories of phase-mixed stars
accreted at early times, as well as stars in surviving tidal debris features,
M31's extended disk, and intact satellite galaxies that will eventually be
tidally incorporated into the halo. This will yield an unprecedented view of
the hierarchical formation of the M31 system and the subhalos that built it
into the L* galaxy we observe today.

BFMs are used as the input of an SDL network, which performs unsupervised
stacked convolutional auto-encoder (SCAE) image reconstruction guided by lesion

strategy by balancing reconstruction error and classification label prediction
error. We compared the performance of the BIRADS-SDL network with conventional
SCAE and SDL methods that use the original images as inputs, as well as with an
SCAE that use BFMs as inputs. Experimental results on two breast US datasets
show that BIRADS-SDL ranked the best among the four networks, with
classification accuracy around 92.00% and 83.90% on two datasets. These

so-called `symmetry energy' is the part of the EOS accounting for the
difference in the number of neutrons and protons. Numerous experiments have
been devised to assess the symmetry energy and constrain its functional
dependence with the nucleon density. Further constraints follow from a stellar
modeling using the EOS to reproduce astronomical observations such as neutron
star masses and radii. The recent detection of gravitational waves emitted from
neutron star mergers and the nucleosynthesis ensuing from these events caused a

experience-based mapping has proven to be an effective technique for bridging

matching. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate substantial
improvements in localization performance across day-night cycles, enabling
continuous metric localization over a 30-hour period using a single mapping
experience, and allowing experience-based localization to scale to long

nearby dwarf irregular galaxy Sextans A, the first globular cluster known in
this galaxy. The cluster, which we designate as Sextans A-GC1, lies some 4.4
arcminutes ($\sim1.8$ kpc) to the SW of the galaxy centre and clearly resolves
into stars in sub-arcsecond seeing ground-based imaging.We measure an
integrated magnitude $V=18.04$, corresponding to an absolute magnitude,
$M_{V,0} = -7.85$. This gives an inferred mass $M\sim$1.6$\times10^5~M\odot$,
assuming a Kroupa IMF. An integrated spectrum of Sextans A-GC1 reveals a
heliocentric radial velocity $v_{\rm helio}=305\pm15$~ km/s, consistent with
the systemic velocity of Sextans A. The location of candidate red giant branch
stars in the cluster, and stellar population analyses of the cluster's
integrated optical spectrum, suggests a metallicity [Fe/H] $\sim$--2.4, and an
age $\sim9$ Gyr. We measure a half light radius, $R_h = 7.6\pm0.2$ pc.
Normalising to the galaxy integrated magnitude, we obtain a $V$-band specific
frequency, $S_N=2.1$. We compile a sample of 1,928 GCs in 28 galaxies with
spectroscopic metallicities and find that the low metallicity of Sextans A-GC1
is close to a ""metallicity floor"" at [Fe/H] $\sim-2.5$ seen in these globular
cluster systems which include the Milky Way, M31, M87 and the Large Magellanic
Cloud. This metallicity floor appears to hold across 6 dex in host galaxy
stellar mass and is seen in galaxies with and without accreted GC
subpopulations.

have developed a machine learning algorithm based on symbolic regression in the

computationally efficient manybody potential models. The key to our approach is
to explore a hypothesis space of models based on fundamental physical
principles and select models within this hypothesis space based on their
accuracy, speed, and simplicity. The focus on simplicity reduces the risk of
overfitting the training data and increases the chances of discovering a model
that generalizes well. Our algorithm was validated by rediscovering an exact
Lennard-Jones potential and a Sutton Chen embedded atom method potential from
training data generated using these models. By using training data generated
from density functional theory calculations, we found potential models for
elemental copper that are simple, as fast as embedded atom models, and capable
of accurately predicting properties outside of their training set. Our approach
requires relatively small sets of training data, making it possible to generate
training data using highly accurate methods at a reasonable computational cost.

causal inference. In the standard RD, the assignment to treatment is determined
by a continuous pretreatment variable (i.e., running variable) falling above or
below a pre-fixed threshold. In the case of the corporate sector purchase
programme (CSPP) of the European Central Bank, which involves large-scale
purchases of securities issued by corporations in the euro area, such a
threshold can be defined in terms of an ordinal running variable. This feature
poses challenges to RD estimation due to the lack of a meaningful measure of
distance. To evaluate such program, this paper proposes an RD approach for
ordinal running variables under the local randomization framework. The proposal
first estimates an ordered probit model for the ordinal running variable. The
estimated probability of being assigned to treatment is then adopted as a
latent continuous running variable and used to identify a covariate-balanced
subsample around the threshold. Assuming local unconfoundedness of the
treatment in the subsample, an estimate of the effect of the program is
obtained by employing a weighted estimator of the average treatment effect. Two
weighting estimators---overlap weights and ATT weights---as well as their
augmented versions are considered. We apply the method to evaluate the causal
effect of the CSPP and find a statistically significant and negative effect on
corporate bond spreads at issuance.

redshifts. Modeling the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth with
a power-law, $\tau_\mathrm{eff}=\tau_0 (1 + z)^\gamma$ produces $\tau_0=(5.54
\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-3}$ and $\gamma=3.182 \pm 0.074$. The 2.2% precision
estimate on $\gamma$ is dominated by systematic errors, likely arising from the
bias and uncertainties in spectral index estimates. Even after incorporating
the systematic errors, this work provides the most precise estimates of optical
depth parameters to date. Finally, using the reconstructed Ly$\alpha$ forest
continuum to directly measure the transmitted flux ratio as a function of
redshift, we find deviations of less than 2.5% from the predictions from the
global model and no convincing evidence for signal associated with He II
reionization.

cooperate to protect the target subspace by capturing an attacker which strives
to enter the target subspace from the play subspace without being captured. A
closed-form solution is provided from the perspectives of kind and degree.
Contributions of the work include the use of the attack subspace (AS) method to
construct the barrier, by which the game winner can be perfectly predicted
before the game starts. In addition to this inclusion, with the priori
information about the game result, a critical payoff function is designed when
the defenders can win the game. Then, the optimal strategy for each player is
explicitly reformulated as a saddle-point equilibrium. Finally, we apply these
theoretical results to a half-space guarding game in three-dimensional space.
Since the whole achieved developments are analytical, they require a little
memory without computational burden and allow for real-time updates, beyond the
capacity of traditional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs method. It is worth noting that
this is the first time in the current work to consider the target guarding
games for arbitrary high-dimensional space, and in a fully analytical form.

takes different patterns. While many species release spores intermittently,
others release spores at specific times of day or night according to intrinsic
rhythms. Despite intriguing evidence of diurnal rhythms, why the timing of
spore liberation would matter to a fungus remains an open question. Here we use
state-of-the-art numerical simulations of atmospheric transport with
meteorological data to follow the trajectory of many spores released in the
open atmosphere at different times of day, during different seasons and at
different locations across North America. While individual spores follow
unpredictable trajectories due to turbulence, in the aggregate patterns emerge:
statistically, spores released during the day fly for several days, while
spores released at night return to the ground within a few hours. Differences
are caused by intense turbulence during the day and weak turbulence at night.
The pattern is widespread but its reliability varies, for example, day/night
patterns are stronger in southern regions, where temperatures are warmer.
Results provide a set of testable hypotheses explaining intermittent and
regular patterns of spore release as strategies to maximize spore survival in
the air. Species with short lived spores reproducing where there is strong and
regular turbulence during the day, for example in Mexico, will maximize
survival by routinely releasing spores at night. Where cycles are weak, for
example in Canada during spring, there will be no benefit to releasing spores
at the same time every day. We also challenge the perception of atmospheric
dispersal as risky, wasteful, and beyond control of a sporocarp; our data
suggest the timing of spore liberation may be finely tuned by a fungus to
maximize fitness during atmospheric transport.

from Florida to New York. This paper introduces PAWS (Paraphrase Adversaries
from Word Scrambling), a new dataset with 108,463 well-formed paraphrase and
non-paraphrase pairs with high lexical overlap. Challenging pairs are generated
by controlled word swapping and back translation, followed by fluency and
paraphrase judgments by human raters. State-of-the-art models trained on
existing datasets have dismal performance on PAWS (<40% accuracy); however,
including PAWS training data for these models improves their accuracy to 85%
while maintaining performance on existing tasks. In contrast, models that do
not capture non-local contextual information fail even with PAWS training
examples. As such, PAWS provides an effective instrument for driving further
progress on models that better exploit structure, context, and pairwise
comparisons.

scalable tools that allow users to translate descriptions of electronic

express quantum algorithms at scale, and interfaces with NWChem, a leading

with metadata required for effective quantum simulation, such as trial

magnetized neutron stars - X-ray pulsars (XRPs). The X-ray variability is
largely determined by mass accretion rate fluctuations at the NS surface, which
replicate accretion rate fluctuations at the inner radius of the accretion
disc. The variability at the inner radius is due to fluctuations arising all
over the disc and propagating inwards under the influence of viscous diffusion.
The inner radius varies with mean mass accretion rate and can be estimated from
the known magnetic field strength and accretion luminosity of XRPs.
Observations of transient XRPs covering several orders of magnitude in
luminosity give a unique opportunity to study effects arising due to the
changes of the inner disc radius. We investigate the process of viscous
diffusion in XRP accretion discs and construct new analytical solutions of the
diffusion equation applicable for thin accretion discs truncated both from
inside and outside. Our solutions are the most general ones derived in the
approximation of Newtonian mechanics. We argue that the break observed at high
frequencies in the power density spectra of XRPs corresponds to the minimal
time scale of the dynamo process, which is responsible for the initial
fluctuations. Comparing data from the bright X-ray transient A 0535+26 with our
model, we conclude that the time scale of initial variability in the accretion
disc is a few times longer than the local Keplerian time scale.

the fraction of the solar disc covered by that feature, and the assignment of
reference synthetic spectra. In this paper, the FFs, specified as a function of
radial position on the solar disc, are computed for each image in a tabular
form. The filling factor (FF) is an important parameter and is defined as the
fraction of area in a pixel covered with the magnetic field, whereas the rest
of the area in the pixel is field-free. However, this does not provide
extensive information about the experiments conducted on tens or hundreds of
such images. This is the first time that filling factors for SODISM images have
been catalogued in tabular formation. This paper presents a new method that
provides the means to detect sunspots on full-disk solar images recorded by the
Solar Diameter Imager and Surface Mapper (SODISM) on the PICARD satellite. The
method is a totally automated detection process that achieves a sunspot
recognition rate of 97.6%. The number of sunspots detected by this method
strongly agrees with the NOAA catalogue. The sunspot areas calculated by this
method have a 99% correlation with SOHO over the same period, and thus help to
calculate the filling factor for wavelength (W.L.) 607nm.

arcminute maps toward L1521E using the IRAM-30m telescope in transitions of
various species. We derived abundances for the species and compared them to
those obtained toward L1544. We estimated CO depletion factors. Similarly to
L1544, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$OH peak at different positions. Most species
peak toward the $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ peak. The CO depletion factor derived toward the
$Herschel$ dust peak is 4.3$\pm$1.6, which is about a factor of three lower
than that toward L1544. The abundances of sulfur-bearing molecules are higher
toward L1521E than toward L1544 by factors of $\sim$2-20. The abundance of
methanol is similar toward the two cores. The higher abundances of
sulfur-bearing species toward L1521E than toward L1544 suggest that significant
sulfur depletion takes place during the dynamical evolution of dense cores,
from the starless to pre-stellar stage. The CO depletion factor measured toward
L1521E suggests that CO is more depleted than previously found. Similar
CH$_3$OH abundances between L1521E and L1544 hint that methanol is forming at
specific physical conditions in Taurus, characterized by densities of a few
$\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N$(H$_2$)$\gtrsim$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, when CO
starts to catastrophically freeze-out, while water can still be significantly
photodissociated, so that the surfaces of dust grains become rich in solid CO
and CH$_3$OH, as already found toward L1544. Methanol can thus provide
selective crucial information about the transition region between dense cores
and the surrounding parent cloud.

compact particles display weak circular dichroism at low rotation frequency

the random-phase approximation and populate the particle electronic states
according to the principle that they are thermally equilibrated in the rotating
frame. We further provide insight into the rotational superradience effect and
the ensuing optical gain, originating in population inversion as regarded from
the lab frame, in which the particle is out of equilibrium. Surprisingly, we
find the optical frequency cutoff for superradiance to deviate from the
rotation frequency $\Omega$. Our results unveil a rich, unexplored
phenomenology of light interaction with rotating objects.

process. We have measured the neutron multiplicities in atmospheric neutrino
interactions in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment and compared them
to the prediction of a Monte Carlo simulation using GENIE and a minimally
modified version of GEANT4. We analyzed 837 days of exposure corresponding to
Phase I, using pure heavy water, and Phase II, using a mixture of Cl in heavy
water. Neutrons produced in atmospheric neutrino interactions were identified
with an efficiency of $15.3\%$ and $44.3\%$, for Phase I and II respectively.
The neutron production is measured as a function of the visible energy of the
neutrino interaction and, for charged current quasi-elastic interaction
candidates, also as a function of the neutrino energy. This study is also
performed classifying the complete sample into two pairs of event categories:
charged current quasi-elastic and non charged current quasi-elastic, and
$\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_e$. Results show good overall agreement between data and
Monte Carlo for both phases, with some small tension with a statistical
significance below $2\sigma$ for some intermediate energies.

allocation solution for networks that need to share and optimize limited
resources like bandwidth, fiber or optical slots in a flexible and dynamic way.
This paper proposes and evaluates the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for the
cognitive management of BAM reconfiguration in MPLS networks. The results
suggest that CBR learns about bandwidth request profiles (LSPs requests)
associated with the current network state and is able to dynamically define or
assist in BAM reconfiguration. The BAM reconfiguration approach adopted is
based on switching among available BAM implementations (MAM, RDM and ATCS). The
cognitive management proposed allows BAMs self-configuration and results in

or 3D networks, where both pipelines have advantages and disadvantages. 2D
methods enjoy a low inference time and greater transfer-ability while 3D
methods are superior in performance for hard targets requiring contextual
information. This paper investigates efficient 3D segmentation from another
perspective, which uses 2D networks to mimic 3D segmentation. To compensate the
lack of contextual information in 2D manner, we propose to thicken the 2D
network inputs by feeding multiple slices as multiple channels into 2D networks
and thus 3D contextual information is incorporated. We also put forward to use
early-stage multiplexing and slice sensitive attention to solve the confusion
problem of information loss which occurs when 2D networks face thickened
inputs. With this design, we achieve a higher performance while maintaining a
lower inference latency on a few abdominal organs from CT scans, in particular
when the organ has a peculiar 3D shape and thus strongly requires contextual
information, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and ability in capturing
3D information. We also point out that ""thickened"" 2D inputs pave a new method
of 3D segmentation, and look forward to more efforts in this direction.
Experiments on segmenting a few abdominal targets in particular blood vessels
which require strong 3D contexts demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

computationally fast and accurate tool, named Golden Angle Linogram Evaluation
(GALE), for approximating the DTFT at points of a GALFD. A GALFD resembles a
Linogram Fourier Domain (LFD), which is efficient and accurate. A limitation of
linograms is that embedding an LFD into a larger one requires many extra

hand, allows for incremental inclusion of relatively few data points.
Approximation error bounds and floating point operations counts are presented

beneficial in applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Experiments for

(Li-ion) batteries as the main power source with a total capacity of 14.6kWh to
17.952kWh, and the vehicle can run for 10 hours. The draw-backs of operating

transport, and facility access, all of which should be taken into
consideration. Recharging the batteries for at least 8 hours is also very

existing power system (i.e. battery bank). The integration of the fuel cell not
only will increase the system power, but it will also reduce the number of
batteries needed as suggested by HOMER software. In this paper, an integrated
fuel cell is designed to be added into the MUN Explorer AUV along with a
battery bank system to increase its power system. The system sizing is

by adversarial examples. Two defects exist in black-box iterative attacks that
generate adversarial examples by incrementally adjusting the noise-adding
direction for each step. On the one hand, existing iterative attacks add noises
monotonically along the direction of gradient ascent, resulting in a lack of
diversity and adaptability of the generated iterative trajectories. On the
other hand, it is trivial to perform adversarial attack by adding excessive
noises, but currently there is no refinement mechanism to squeeze redundant
noises. In this work, we propose Curls & Whey black-box attack to fix the above
two defects. During Curls iteration, by combining gradient ascent and descent,
we `curl' up iterative trajectories to integrate more diversity and
transferability into adversarial examples. Curls iteration also alleviates the
diminishing marginal effect in existing iterative attacks. The Whey
optimization further squeezes the `whey' of noises by exploiting the robustness
of adversarial perturbation. Extensive experiments on Imagenet and
Tiny-Imagenet demonstrate that our approach achieves impressive decrease on
noise magnitude in l2 norm. Curls & Whey attack also shows promising
transferability against ensemble models as well as adversarially trained
models. In addition, we extend our attack to the targeted misclassification,
effectively reducing the difficulty of targeted attacks under black-box

macromolecules were found to extend throughout the parenchyma from both
external and internal (fissures) CNS boundaries, excluding ventricles, in large
numbers, on average ca. 40 channels per mm2 in rats and non-human primates. The
high density and depth of extension of the perivascular channels suggest that
the perivascular route can be suitable for delivery of therapeutics to
parenchymal targets throughout the CNS.

hardware capabilities are introduced, we establish a foundation for the
multi-layer aerial network (MAN). First, the MAN is modeled as K layer ANs, and
each layer has UAVs with different densities, floating altitudes, and
transmission power. To make the framework applicable for various scenarios in
MAN, we consider the transmitter- and the receiver-oriented node association
rules as well as the air-to-ground and air-to-air channel models, which form
line of sight links with a location-dependent probability. We then newly
analyze the association probability, the main link distance distribution,
successful transmission probability (STP), and area spectral efficiency (ASE)
of MAN. The upper bounds of the optimal densities that maximize STP and ASE are
also provided. Finally, in the numerical results, we show the optimal UAV
densities of an AN that maximize the ASE and the STP decrease with the altitude
of the network. We also show that when the total UAV density is fixed for two
layer AN, the use of single layer in higher(lower) altitude only for all UAVs
can achieve better performance for low(high) total density case, otherwise,
distributing UAVs in two layers, i.e., MAN, achieves better performance.

vehicles are becoming smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth
of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through
advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and
enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in
applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize
the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication
and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog
computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to
conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm
that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by
pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application
services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable
transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks
in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction,
several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most
of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and
trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and
key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used
for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed
for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs).
Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the
considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing
state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security
features.

solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems,
issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to
protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and
dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even
more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we
propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for
rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following
phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual
Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has
been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical
authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been
employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication
between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG).
Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational
overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of
the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet

extend Golay's concatenation and interleaving methods by considering extra

non-contiguous resource allocation in frequency, e.g., an arbitrary number of
null symbols between the occupied resource blocks (RBs). The first scheme
separates the PAPR minimization and the inter-cell interference minimization
problems. While the former is solved by spreading the sequences in a Golay
complementary pair (GCP) with the sequences in another GCP, the latter is
managed by designing a set of GCPs with low cross-correlation. The second
scheme generates reference symbols (RSs) and data symbols on each RB as parts
of an encoded CS. Therefore, it enables coherent detection at the receiver

a natural mathematical question on its own, this problem appears in various
incarnations in computer science; the most significant being in the context of
lower bounds for algebraic circuits which compute linear transformations,
matrix rigidity and data structure lower bounds.
  We first show, for every constant $d$, a deterministic construction in
subexponential time of a family $\{M_n\}$ of $n \times n$ matrices which cannot
be expressed as a product $M_n = A_1 \cdots A_d$ where the total sparsity of

this problem, which are barely super-linear, and were obtained by a long line
of research based on the study of super-concentrators (albeit at the cost of a
blow up in the time required to construct these matrices).
  We then outline an approach for proving improved lower bounds through a
certain derandomization problem, and use this approach to prove asymptotically
optimal quadratic lower bounds for natural special cases, which generalize many

costs. For analysis tractability, we linearize the nonlinear AoI evolution in
the constrained dynamic programming problem, by approximating the dynamic AoI
reduction as a time-average term and solving the approximate dynamic pricing in
closed-form. Then, we estimate this approximate term based on Brouwer's
fixed-point theorem. Finally, we provide the steady-state analysis of the
optimized approximate dynamic pricing scheme for an infinite time horizon, and
show that the pricing scheme can be further simplified to an e-optimal version
without recursive computing over time.

this end, we propose a novel framework for training efficient deep neural

the pre-trained teacher networks are regarded as a fixed discriminator and the
generator is utilized for derivating training samples which can obtain the
maximum response on the discriminator. Then, an efficient network with smaller
model size and computational complexity is trained using the generated data and
the teacher network, simultaneously. Efficient student networks learned using
the proposed Data-Free Learning (DAFL) method achieve 92.22% and 74.47%

aim of the study consists in finding ways to avoid or minimize MHD and AE
activity for different magnetic field configurations and neutral beam injection
operational regimes. The simulations show at the beginning of the discharge,
before the reverse shear region is formed, a plasma that is AE unstable and
marginally MHD stable. As soon as the reverse shear region appears, ideal MHD
modes are destabilized with a larger growth rate than the AEs. Both MHD modes
and AEs coexist during the discharge, although the MHD modes are more unstable
as the reverse shear region deepens. The simulations indicate the
destabilization of Beta induced AE, Toroidal AE, Elliptical AE and Reverse
Shear AE at different phases of the discharges. A further analysis of the NBI
operational regime indicates that the AE stability can be improved if the NBI
injection is off axis, because on-axis injection leads to AEs with larger
growth rate and frequency. In addition, decreasing the beam energy or
increasing the NBI relative density leads to AEs with larger growth rate and
frequency, so an NBI operation in the weakly resonant regime requires higher
beam energies than in the experiment. The MHD linear stability can be also
improved if the reverse shear region and the q profile near the magnetic axis
are in between the rational surfaces q=2 and q=1, particularly if there is a
region in the core with negative shear, avoiding a flat q profile near the
magnetic axis.

boundaries. However, multiple independent studies have recently shown that
small amounts of surfactant, naturally present in the environment, can induce
Marangoni forces that increase drag, at least in the laminar regime. To obtain
accurate drag predictions, one must solve the mass, momentum, bulk surfactant
and interfacial surfactant conservation equations. This requires expensive
simulations, thus preventing surfactant from being widely considered in SHS
studies. To address this issue, we propose a theory for steady,
pressure-driven, laminar, two-dimensional flow in a periodic SHS channel with
soluble surfactant. We linearise the coupling between flow and surfactant,
under the assumption of small concentration, finding a scaling prediction for
the local slip length. To obtain the drag reduction and interfacial shear, we
find a series solution for the velocity field by assuming Stokes flow in the
bulk and uniform interfacial shear. We find how the slip and drag depend on the
nine dimensionless groups that together characterize the surfactant transport
near SHSs, the gas fraction and the normalized interface length. Our model
agrees with numerical simulations spanning orders of magnitude in each
dimensionless group. The simulations also provide the constants in the scaling
theory. Our model significantly improves predictions relative to a
surfactant-free one, which can otherwise overestimate slip and underestimate
drag by several orders of magnitude. Our slip length model can provide the
boundary condition in other simulations, thereby accounting for surfactant
effects without having to solve the full problem.

period, usually attributed to light scattered from electrons in circumstellar

observations of Spica have shown low polarization with no evidence for
variability. Here we report new high-precision polarization observations of
Spica that show variation with an amplitude ~200 parts-per-million (ppm). Using
a new modelling approach we show that the phase-dependent polarization is
primarily due to reflected light from the primary off the secondary and vice
versa. The stars reflect only a few per-cent of the incident light, but the
reflected light is very highly polarized. The polarization results show that
the binary orbit is clockwise and the position angle of the line of nodes is
130.4 +/- 6.8 degrees in agreement with Intensity Interferometer results. We
suggest that reflected light polarization may be much more important in binary
systems than has previously been recognized and may be a way of detecting
previously unrecognized close binaries.

methods where the perturbation depends on the gradients and hence, complicating
the convergence analysis. We study the convergence of training algorithms using
DQSG and the trade off between the number of quantization levels and the

  Next, we observe that there is a correlation among the SGs computed by
workers that can be utilized to further reduce the communication overhead
without any performance loss. Hence, we develop a simple yet effective
quantization scheme, nested dithered quantized SG (NDQSG), that can reduce the
communication significantly \emph{without requiring the workers communicating
extra information to each other}. We prove that although NDQSG requires
significantly less bits, it can achieve the same quantization variance bound as
DQSG.

tested our model on several GC-MS data sets of various complexities and
analysed the alignment results quantitatively. We show the model has very good
performance (AUC $\sim 1$ for simple data sets and AUC $\sim 0.85$ for very
complex data sets). Further, our model easily outperforms existing algorithms
on complex data sets. Compared with existing methods, ChromAlignNet is very
easy to use as it requires no user input of reference chromatograms and

identifying road areas in visual images remains challenging due to issues like
illumination changes and blurry images. To this end, LiDAR sensor data can be
incorporated to improve the visual image-based road detection, because LiDAR
data is less susceptible to visual noises. However, the main difficulty in
introducing LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection is that
LiDAR data and its extracted features do not share the same space with the
visual data and visual features. Such gaps in spaces may limit the benefits of
LiDAR information for road detection. To overcome this issue, we introduce a
novel Progressive LiDAR Adaptation-aided Road Detection (PLARD) approach to
adapt LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection and improve
detection performance. In PLARD, progressive LiDAR adaptation consists of two
subsequent modules: 1) data space adaptation, which transforms the LiDAR data
to the visual data space to align with the perspective view by applying
altitude difference-based transformation; and 2) feature space adaptation,
which adapts LiDAR features to visual features through a cascaded fusion
structure. Comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known KITTI road
detection benchmark demonstrate that PLARD takes advantage of both the visual
and LiDAR information, achieving much more robust road detection even in
challenging urban scenes. In particular, PLARD outperforms other
state-of-the-art road detection models and is currently top of the publicly
accessible benchmark leader-board.

interacting players and mathematically reveals the condition of how cooperation
is achieved, which is not achieved in a one-shot game. In the repeated
prisoner's dilemma (RPD) game with no errors, zero-determinant (ZD) strategies
allow a player to unilaterally set a linear relationship between the player's
own payoff and the opponent's payoff regardless of the strategy that the
opponent implements. In contrast, unconditional strategies such as ALLD and
ALLC also unilaterally set a linear payoff relationship. Errors often happen
between players in the real world. However, little is known about the existence
of such strategies in the RPD game with errors. Here, we analytically search
for all strategies that enforce a linear payoff relationship under observation
errors in the RPD game. As a result, we found that, even in the case with
observation errors, the only strategy sets that enforce a linear payoff
relationship are either ZD strategies or unconditional strategies and that no
other strategies can enforce it, which were numerically confirmed.

data that do not belong to the normal data distribution. Current
state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on complex high-dimensional data
are based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). However, the traditional
GAN loss is not directly aligned with the anomaly detection objective: it
encourages the distribution of the generated samples to overlap with the real
data and so the resulting discriminator has been found to be ineffective as an
anomaly detector. In this paper, we propose simple modifications to the GAN
loss such that the generated samples lie at the boundary of the real data
distribution. With our modified GAN loss, our anomaly detection method, called
Fence GAN (FGAN), directly uses the discriminator score as an anomaly
threshold. Our experimental results using the MNIST, CIFAR10 and KDD99 datasets
show that Fence GAN yields the best anomaly classification accuracy compared to

saliency maps from raw pixels of the input denoised image using a data-driven

consistency loss is also incorporated to further improve salient region

inefficient in general. In addition to the intrinsic inefficiency of
equilibria, the authors recently showed that, in mixed-autonomy networks in
which autonomous vehicles maintain a shorter headway than human-driven cars,
increasing the fraction of autonomous vehicles in the network may increase the
inefficiency of equilibria. In this work, we study the possibility of obviating
the inefficiency of equilibria in mixed-autonomy traffic networks via pricing
mechanisms. In particular, we study assigning prices to network links such that
the overall or social delay of the resulting equilibria is minimum. First, we
study the possibility of inducing such optimal equilibria by imposing a set of
undifferentiated prices, i.e. a set of prices that treat both human-driven and
autonomous vehicles similarly at each link. We provide an example which
demonstrates that undifferentiated pricing is not sufficient for achieving
minimum social delay. Then, we study differentiated pricing where the price of
traversing each link may depend on whether vehicles are human-driven or
autonomous. Under differentiated pricing, we prove that link prices obtained
from the marginal cost taxation of links will induce equilibria with minimum
social delay if the degree of road capacity asymmetry (i.e. the ratio between
the road capacity when all vehicles are human-driven and the road capacity when
all vehicles are autonomous) is homogeneous among network links.

embedded in an external tidal field by exploring the MOCCA Survey Database I,
with focus on the presence and evolution of a stellar-mass black hole
subsystem. We argue that the presence of a black hole subsystem can lead to the
dissolution of tidally filling star clusters and this can be regarded as a
third type of cluster dissolution mechanism (in addition to well-known
mechanisms connected with strong mass loss due to stellar evolution and mass
loss connected with the relaxation process). This third process is
characterized by abrupt cluster dissolution connected with the loss of
dynamical equilibrium. The abrupt dissolution is powered by strong energy
generation from a stellar-mass black hole subsystem accompanied by tidal
stripping. Additionally, we argue that such a mechanism should also work for
even tidally under-filling clusters with top-heavy initial mass function.
Observationally, star clusters which undergo dissolution powered by the third
mechanism would look as a 'dark cluster' i.e. composed of stellar mass black
holes surrounded by an expanding halo of luminous stars (Banerjee & Kroupa
2011), and they should be different from 'dark clusters' harbouring
intermediate mass black holes as discussed by Askar et al. (2017a). An
additional observational consequence of an operation of the third dissolution
mechanism should be a larger than expected abundance of free floating black
holes in the Galactic halo.

momentum projection calculations are done for the decay of the $K=10^+$ isomer

numbers of the bands are quite good. There is significant difference in the
reduced matrix elements of transition operators in our formalism and that in
the rotational model. Angular momentum projection gives J-selection rule but
there is no K selection rule for reduced matrix elements of electromagnetic
multipole operators. Thus, E2 and M1 transitions from the K isomer to the
ground band of $^{182}W$ are finite but retarded in angular momentum projection
theory, as in experiments. This provides a theoretical basis for the study of
K-isomers and their decay modes. Quantitative results are presented. The

generate a sparser and more insidious adversarial perturbation, compared to
traditional image-space attacks. These adversarial perturbations are so subtle
that a human observer cannot notice their presences, but the model outputs will
be revolutionized. This phenomenon raises security threats to deep saliency

the feature-space attack, e.g. 1) the hidden layers with bigger receptive

higher attack success rates, and 3) different loss functions and different

observed, where both partners appear in the same pathway without any direct

  We revisit our RNA-RNA interaction partition function algorithm, piRNA, which
computes the partition function, base-pairing probabilities, and structure for
the comprehensive Turner energy model using 96 different dynamic programming
tables. In this study, we strategically retreat from sophisticated
thermodynamic models to the much simpler base pair counting model. That might

surprisingly rich phase diagram under pressure, taking up several structures

demonstrate that some predicted high-pressure phases of elemental Li also host
topological electronic structures. Beginning at 80 GPa and coincident with a
transition to the Pbca phase, we find Li to be a Dirac nodal line semimetal. We
further calculate that Li retains linearly-dispersive energy bands in
subsequent predicted higher pressure phases, and that it exhibits a Lifshitz
transition between two Cmca phases at 220 GPa. The Fd-3m phase at 500 GPa forms
buckled honeycomb layers that give rise to a Dirac crossing 1 eV below the
Fermi energy. The well-isolated topological nodes near the Fermi level in these
phases result from increasing p-orbital character with density at the Fermi
level, itself a consequence of rising 1s core wavefunction overlap, and a
preference for nonsymmorphic symmetries in the crystal structures favored at
these pressures. Our results provide evidence that under pressure, bulk 3D
materials with light elements, or even pure elemental systems, can undergo
topological phase transitions hosting nontrivial topological properties near
the Fermi level with measurable consequences; and that, through pressure, we
can access these novel phases in elemental lithium.

allows to jointly learn a metric based semantic space facilitating similar
images to be clustered together in that target space and at the same time
producing compact final activations that lose negligible information when
binarized. Experiments carried out on two benchmark RS archives point out that
the proposed network significantly improves the retrieval performance under the

The geometrical definition of the different structural components of these two

old, relatively metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced, and their star formation
history (SFH) reveals a minor younger component whose chemical properties
suggest its later accretion. Moreover, the outer regions of these geometrically
defined thick disks show higher values of metallicity and lower values of
[Mg/Fe]. These stars probably formed in the thin-disk region and they were
dynamically heated to form the flares present in these two galaxies. We propose
different formation scenarios for the three populations of these thick disks:
in-situ formation, accretion and disk heating. A clear distinction in age is
found between the metal poor and [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thick disks (old, $\sim
12-13$ Gyr), and the metal rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced thin disks (young,
$\sim 4-5$ Gyr). These two galaxies show signs of relatively recent star
formation in their thin disks and nuclear regions. While the thin disks show
more continuous SFHs, the nuclei display a rather bursty SFH. These two
galaxies are located outside of the densest region of the Fornax cluster where
FCC 170 resides. This other edge-on S0 galaxy was studied by \citet{Pinna2019}.
We compare and discuss our results with this previous study. The differences

locations, are the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Accurate and
timely diagnosis can improve the quality of life of cataract patients. In this
paper, a feature extraction-based method for grading cataract severity using
retinal images is proposed. To obtain more appropriate features for the
automatic grading, the Haar wavelet is improved according to the
characteristics of retinal images. Retinal images of non-cataract, as well as
mild, moderate, and severe cataracts, are automatically recognized using the
improved Haar wavelet. A hierarchical strategy is used to transform the
four-class classification problem into three adjacent two-class classification
problems. Three sets of two-class classifiers based on a neural network are
trained individually and integrated together to establish a complete
classification system. The accuracies of the two-class classification (cataract
and non-cataract) and four-class classification are 94.83% and 85.98%,
respectively. The performance analysis demonstrates that the improved Haar
wavelet feature achieves higher accuracy than the original Haar wavelet
feature, and the fusion of three sets of two-class classifiers is superior to a
simple four-class classifier. The discussion indicates that the retinal
image-based method offers significant potential for cataract detection.

controllable bandgap, making them attractive for all-dielectric and tunable
metasurfaces. Till now, perovskite metasurfaces have only been used in
structural colors. More interesting meta-devices with 2{\pi} phase control are
still absent. Here we experimentally demonstrate the MAPbX3 perovskite based
metasurfaces with a complete control of phase shift in a reflection mode. By
utilizing MAPbBr3 cut-wires as meta-atoms on a ground metal film, we find that
the MAPbBr3 perovskite metasurface can produce full phase control from 0 to
2{\pi} and high reflection efficiency simultaneously. Consequently,
high-efficiency polarization conversion, anomalous reflection and meta-hologram
have been successfully produced. Most interestingly, the bandgap of MAPbX3
perovskite can be post-synthetically and reversibly tuned via anion exchange,
providing a new approach to dynamically control of the all-dielectric
meta-devices with novel function such as anomalous reflection and hologram et
al.

$n\times m$ rectangular patterns if all $n\times m$ sub-patterns of the

respect to a rectangle if there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ and a set $P$ of

$|P|\leq nm$. Open since it was stated in 1997, Nivat's conjecture states that
such a coloring is necessarily periodic. If Nivat's conjecture is true, all
valid colorings with respect to $P$ such that $|P|\leq mn$ must be periodic. We
prove that there exists at least one periodic coloring among the valid ones. We
use this result to investigate the tiling problem, also known as the domino
problem, which is well known to be undecidable in its full generality. However,
we show that it is decidable in the low-complexity setting. Then, we use our
result to show that Nivat's conjecture holds for uniformly recurrent
configurations. These results also extend to other convex shapes in place of
the rectangle.\\ After that, we prove that the $nm$ bound is multiplicatively
optimal for the decidability of the domino problem, as for all $\varepsilon>0$
it is undecidable to determine if there exists a valid coloring for a given

Eleven high-current waveforms with peak value ranging from 100--250 kA with

However,
the origin of this asymmetry was believed to be different in actinides and in

252502 (2010)]. It has recently been argued that quantum shell effects
stabilising pear shapes of the fission fragments could explain the observed
asymmetries in fission of actinides[G. Scamps and C. Simenel, Nature {\bf 564},

microscopic mean-field calculations of fission based on the Hartree-Fock

in terms of deformed shell gaps in the fragments. A new method is proposed to
investigate the dominant shell effects in the pre-fragments at scission. We
conclude that the mechanisms responsible for asymmetric fissions in the

dimensional latent space, where this data is easier to understand and model.
The autoencoder consists of two sub-networks, the encoder and the decoder,
which carry out these transformations. The neural network is trained such that
the output is as close to the input as possible, the data having gone through
an information bottleneck : the latent space. This tool bears significant
ressemblance to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with two main differences.
Firstly, the autoencoder is a non-linear transformation, contrary to PCA, which
makes the autoencoder more flexible and powerful. Secondly, the axes found by a
PCA are orthogonal, and are ordered in terms of the amount of variability which
the data presents along these axes. This makes the interpretability of the PCA
much greater than that of the autoencoder, which does not have these
attributes. Ideally, then, we would like an autoencoder whose latent space
consists of independent components, ordered by decreasing importance to the
data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to create such a network. We
create an iterative algorithm which progressively increases the size of the
latent space, learning a new dimension at each step. Secondly, we propose a
covariance loss term to add to the standard autoencoder loss function, as well
as a normalisation layer just before the latent space, which encourages the
latent space components to be statistically independent. We demonstrate the
results of this autoencoder on simple geometric shapes, and find that the
algorithm indeed finds a meaningful representation in the latent space. This
means that subsequent interpolation in the latent space has meaning with
respect to the geometric properties of the images.

place fingers' major or minor joints flatly towards the capturing sensor. To
extend these systems for user non-intrusive application scenarios, such as
consumer electronics, forensic, defence etc, we suggest matching the full
dorsal fingers, rather than the major/ minor region of interest (ROI) alone. In
particular, this paper makes a comprehensive study on the comparisons between
full finger and fusion of finger ROI's for finger knuckle image recognition.
These experiments suggest that using full-finger, provides a more elegant
solution. Addressing the finger matching problem, we propose a CNN
(convolutional neural network) which creates a $128$-D feature embedding of an
image. It is trained via. triplet loss function, which enforces the L2 distance
between the embeddings of the same subject to be approaching zero, whereas the
distance between any 2 embeddings of different subjects to be at least a
margin. For precise training of the network, we use dynamic adaptive margin,
data augmentation, and hard negative mining. In distinguished experiments, the
individual performance of finger, as well as weighted sum score level fusion of
major knuckle, minor knuckle, and nail modalities have been computed,
justifying our assumption to consider full finger as biometrics instead of its
counterparts. The proposed method is evaluated using two publicly available

classification of band alignment is proposed as the coupled and intrinsic band
alignments. This classification indeed reveals that the rutile/anatase

further systematic information of the interface and other factors that

robust lower limit on NS radii. This excludes NSs with radii smaller than about
10.7 km and thus rules out very soft nuclear matter. We stress the potential of
this type of constraints when future detections become available. A very
similar argumentation may yield an upper bound on the maximum mass of
nonrotating NSs. We also discuss simulations of NS mergers, which undergo a
first-order phase transition to quark matter. We point out a different
dynamical behavior. Considering the gravitational-wave signal, we identify an
unambiguous signature of the QCD phase transition in NS mergers. The occurrence
of quark matter through a strong first-order phase transition during merging
leads to a characteristic shift of the dominant postmerger frequency. The
frequency shift is indicative for a phase transition if it is compared to the
postmerger frequency which is expected for purely hadronic EoS models. A very
strong deviation of several 100 Hz is observed for hybrid EoSs in an otherwise
tight relation between the tidal deformability and the postmerger frequency. We
address the potential impact of a first-order phase transition on the
electromagnetic counterpart of NS mergers. Our simulations suggest that there
would be no significant qualitative differences between a system undergoing a
phase transition to quark matter and purely hadronic mergers. The quantitative
differences are within the spread which is found between different hadronic EoS
models. This implies on the one hand that GW170817 is compatible with a
possible transition to quark matter. On the other hand these considerations
show that it may not be easy to identify quantitative differences between
purely hadronic mergers and events in which quark matter occurs considering
solely their electromagnetic counterpart or their nucleosynthesis products.

set for which the ID labels are unavailable during training. In this paper, we
propose to unify two trends in unsupervised person re-ID: clustering &
fine-tuning and adversarial learning. On one side, clustering groups training
images into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor.
On the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation,
to match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed
across different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an
independent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features.
Straightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus
introduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect. In our
framework, the centroid of the cluster to which the visual sample belongs is
used as conditioning vector of our conditional adversarial network, where the
vector is permutation invariant (clusters ordering does not matter) and its
size is independent of the number of clusters. To our knowledge, we are the
first to propose the use of conditional adversarial networks for unsupervised
person re-ID. We evaluate the proposed architecture on top of two
state-of-the-art clustering-based unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID)

module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well

accurate modelling of the strength of preference between two consecutive levels

consecutive positions in the ranking of objects such as criteria and scale
levels, we consider also the number of blank cards between non consecutive

examined by nanoindentation and Vickers microhardness tests. An intrinsic

significantly lower values obtained by compression tests are attributed to the
detrimental effect of pores, microcracks, and secondary phases. Microscopic

For the DF scheme, we allow the source node to transmit continuous-wave signals

power allocation for the transmissions in the source-to-relay and

the added complexity of the decoding operation. On the other hand, the AF

dynamics of an open, inextensible viscoelastic rod - a long and thin three
dimensional object - representing the body of a long, thin microswimmer. Our
model allows for both elastic and viscous, bending and twisting deformations
and describes the evolution of the midline curve of the rod as well as an
orthonormal frame which fully determines the rod's three dimensional geometry.
The numerical method is based on using a combination of piecewise linear and
piecewise constant functions based on a novel rewriting of the model equations.
We derive a stability estimate for the semi-discrete scheme and show that at
the fully discrete level that we have good control over the length element and
preserve the frame orthonormality conditions up to machine precision. Numerical
experiments demonstrate both the good properties of the method as well as the
applicability of the method for simulating undulatory locomotion in the
low-inertia regime.

unsupervised learning of 3D representations from natural images. Most
generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few
assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry
images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as
novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world,
and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs,
HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through
rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that
using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity,
which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able
to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative
models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only.
Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of
the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that
learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised
manner.

whereby the resulting pure effective magnetic field $B^\pm_z$ governs the

This amplification comes at the expense of of diminishing the effective field

the needs for expensive bounding box annotations. In this work, we instead

can simultaneously detect the size and location of human heads and count them
in crowds. We first mine useful person size information from point-level
annotations and initialize the pseudo ground truth bounding boxes. An online
updating scheme is introduced to refine the pseudo ground truth during
training; while a locally-constrained regression loss is designed to provide
additional constraints on the size of the predicted boxes in a local

the network from images of relatively accurate and easy pseudo ground truth

inference in order to approximate the intractable posterior distribution. In

multivariate normal distributions with tridiagonal covariance matrices. Each
single normal distribution belongs either to the weights, or to the biases
corresponding to one network layer. The layer-wise a posteriori variances are
defined based on the corresponding expectation values and further the

spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements. In the
LNO/LMO heterostructures with asymmetric charge redistribution, the electrons
donated from Mn to Ni ions are confined within one monolayer (ML) of LNO at the
interface, whereas holes are distributed over 3-4 ML on the LMO side. A
detailed analysis of the Ni-$L_{2,3}$ and Mn-$L_{2,3}$ XMCD spectra reveals
that Ni magnetization is induced only by the Ni$^{2+}$ ions in the 1 ML LNO
adjacent to the interface, while the magnetization of Mn ions is increased in
the 3-4 ML LMO of the interfacial region. The characteristic length scale of
the emergent (increased) interfacial ferromagnetism of the LNO (LMO) layers is
in good agreement with that of the charge distribution across the interface,
indicating a close relationship between the charge redistribution due to the
interfacial charge transfer and the ferromagnetism of the LNO/LMO interface.
Furthermore, the XMCD spectra clearly demonstrate that the vectors of induced
magnetization of both ions are aligned ferromagnetically, suggesting that the
delicate balance between the exchange interactions occurring inside each layer
and across the interface may induce the canted ferromagnetism of Ni$^{2+}$
ions, resulting in weak magnetization in the 1 ML LNO adjacent to the
interface.

role is non-negligible at the high energy scales of inflation, we result in a
holographic inflation scenario that is very efficient in incorporating
inflationary requirements and predictions. We first extract analytically the
solution of the Hubble function in an implicit form, which gives a scale factor
evolution of the desired e-foldings. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the
Hubble slow-roll parameters and then the inflation-related observables, such as
the scalar spectral index and its running, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the
tensor spectral index. Confronting the predictions with Planck 2018
observations we show that the agreement is perfect and in particular deep
inside the 1$\sigma$ region.

iconic models, such as those due to Kondo or Anderson. While providing
invaluable qualitative insight, detailed comparisons to experiments are
encumbered by the materials' complexity, including the spin-orbit coupling,
crystal fields, and ligand hybridizations. Here, we study the paradigmatic
Kondo insulator Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ with a first principles dynamical mean-field
method that includes these complications. We find that salient signatures of
many-body effects in this material---large effective masses, the
insulator-to-metal crossover, the concomitant emergence of Curie-Weiss
behaviour and notable transfers of optical spectral weight---are captured
quantitatively. With this validation, we elucidate the fabric of the many-body
state. In particular, we extent the phenomenology of the Kondo crossover to
time-scales of fluctuations: We evidence that spin and charge degrees of
freedom each realize two regimes in which fluctuations adhere to vastly
different decay laws. We find these regimes to be separated by a {\it common}
temperature $T^{max}_\chi$, linked to the onset of Kondo screening.
Interestingly, below (above) $T^{max}_\chi$, valence fluctuations become faster
(slower) than the dynamical screening of the local moments. Overall, however,
spin and charge fluctuations occur on comparable time-scales of
$\mathcal{O}(0.5-12\hbox{ fs})$, placing them on the brink of detection for
modern time-resolved probes.

two-neutron transfer reactions allow to obtain such a sequence of the
collective states that meets the requirements for a statistical analysis. Their
theoretical analysis is based on the linear approximation of a repulsion level
density within the Wigner-Dyson theory. This approximation is successful to
evaluate separately the Wigner chaos and Poisson order contributions. We found
an intermediate behavior of NNSDs between the Wigner and Poisson limits. NNSDs
turn out to be shifted from a chaos to order with increasing the length of

caught. Unfortunately, such attacks are extremely difficult to detect in
real-time due to cost and implementation constraints. In this paper, we propose
SurFi to detect these attacks in real-time by utilizing commonly available

addition to surveillance cameras. SurFi processes and correlates the live video

the presence of the surveillance camera looping attacks. SurFi does not require
the deployment of additional infrastructure because Wi-Fi transceivers are
easily found in the urban indoor environment. We design and implement the SurFi

of quantum superposition. However, this principle can be encoded differently,
i.e., in different logico-algebraic objects. As a result, the logic of
experimental quantum propositions might have various semantics. E.g., it might
have either a total semantics, or a partial semantics (in which the valuation
relation -- i.e., a mapping from the set of atomic propositions to the set of
two objects, 1 and 0 -- is not total), or a many-valued semantics (in which the
gap between 1 and 0 is completed with truth degrees). Consequently, closed
linear subspaces of the Hilbert space representing experimental quantum
propositions may be organized differently. For instance, they could be
organized in the structure of a Hilbert lattice (or its generalizations)
identified with the bivalent semantics of quantum logic or in a structure
identified with a non-bivalent semantics. On the other hand, one can only
verify -- at the same time -- propositions represented by the closed linear
subspaces corresponding to mutually commuting projection operators. This
implies that to decide which semantics is proper -- bivalent or non-bivalent --
is not possible experimentally. Nevertheless, the latter allows simplification
of certain no-go theorems in the foundation of quantum mechanics. In the
present paper, the Kochen-Specker theorem asserting the impossibility to
interpret, within the orthodox quantum formalism, projection operators as
definite {0,1}-valued (pre-existent) properties, is taken as an example. The
paper demonstrates that within the algebraic structure identified with
supervaluationism (the form of a partial, non-bivalent semantics), the
statement of this theorem gets deduced trivially.

networks. However, there are few theoretical results that address the influence
of residuals on the hypothesis complexity and the generalization ability of
deep neural networks. This paper studies the influence of residual connections
on the hypothesis complexity of the neural network in terms of the covering
number of its hypothesis space. We prove that the upper bound of the covering
number is the same as chain-like neural networks, if the total numbers of the
weight matrices and nonlinearities are fixed, no matter whether they are in the
residuals or not. This result demonstrates that residual connections may not
increase the hypothesis complexity of the neural network compared with the
chain-like counterpart. Based on the upper bound of the covering number, we
then obtain an $\mathcal O(1 / \sqrt{N})$ margin-based multi-class
generalization bound for ResNet, as an exemplary case of any deep neural
network with residual connections. Generalization guarantees for similar
state-of-the-art neural network architectures, such as DenseNet and ResNeXt,
are straight-forward. From our generalization bound, a practical implementation
is summarized: to approach a good generalization ability, we need to use
regularization terms to control the magnitude of the norms of weight matrices
not to increase too much, which justifies the standard technique of weight
decay.

ratio assuming the dust attenuation laws with the sub-millimeter observations
from previous works. The result suggests that the Calzetti-like dust

direct demand model has been recognized as an effective approach. However,
existing direct demand models including Geographically Weighted Regression

practice, acquiring insights into metro ridership under multiple influencing
factors from a local perspective is important for passenger volume management

study, we propose an Adapted Geographically Weighted Lasso (Ada-GWL) framework
for modelling metro ridership, which performs regression-coefficient shrinkage
and local model selection. It takes metro network connection intermedia into
account and adopts network-based distance metric instead of Euclidean-based
distance metric, making it so-called adapted to the context of metro networks.
The real-world case of Shenzhen Metro is used to validate the superiority of
our proposed model. The results show that the Ada-GWL model performs the best
compared with the global model (Ordinary Least Square (OLS), GWR, GWR
calibrated with network-based distance metric and GWL in terms of estimation
error of the dependent variable and goodness-of-fit. Through understanding the
variation of each coefficient across space (elasticities) and variables
selection of each station, it provides more realistic conclusions based on
local analysis. Besides, through clustering analysis of the stations according
to the regression coefficients, clusters' functional characteristics are found
to be in compliance with the facts of the functional land use policy of
Shenzhen. These results of the proposed Ada-GWL model demonstrate a great
spatial explanatory power in transportation planning.

with excessive missingness and high dimensionality challenge most approaches to
imputation. Here we show that appropriate feature selection can be an effective
preprocessing step for imputation, allowing for more accurate imputation and
subsequent model predictions. The key feature of this preprocessing is that it
incorporates uncertainty: by accounting for uncertainty due to missingness when
selecting features we can reduce the degree of missingness while also limiting
the number of uninformative features being used to make predictive models. We
introduce a method to perform uncertainty-aware feature selection (UAFS),
provide a theoretical motivation, and test UAFS on both real and synthetic
problems, demonstrating that across a variety of data sets and levels of
missingness we can improve the accuracy of imputations. Improved imputation due
to UAFS also results in improved prediction accuracy when performing supervised
learning using these imputed data sets. Our UAFS method is general and can be
fruitfully coupled with a variety of imputation methods.

  for two-qubit states","7 pages, 1 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entanglement and coherence are two essential quantum resources for quantum
information processing. A natural question arises of whether there are direct
link between them. And by thinking about this question, we propose a new
measure for quantum state that contains concurrence and is called intrinsic
concurrence. Interestingly, we discover that the intrinsic concurrence is
always complementary to coherence. Note that the intrinsic concurrence is
related to the concurrence of a special pure state ensemble. In order to
explain the trade-off relation more intuitively, we apply it in some composite
systems composed by a single-qubit state coupling four typical noise channels
with the aim at illustrating their mutual transformation relationship between
their coherence and intrinsic concurrence. This unified trade-off relation will
provide more flexibility in exploiting one resource to perform quantum tasks
and also provide credible theoretical basis for the interconversion of the two
important quantum resources.

contamination also leaks into higher radial and angular wavenumber modes and
forms a foreground wedge. Cosmic tidal reconstruction aims to extract the
large-scale signal from anisotropic features in the local small-scale power
spectrum through non-linear tidal interactions; losing small-scale modes to
foreground wedge will impair its performance. In this paper, we review tidal
interaction theory and estimator construction, and derive the theoretical
expressions for the reconstructed spectra. We show the reconstruction is robust
against peculiar velocities. Removing low line-of-sight $k$ modes, we
demonstrate cross-correlation coefficient $r$ is greater than 0.7 on large
scales ($k <0.1$ $h/$Mpc) even with a cutoff value $k^c_{\|}=0.1$ $h/$Mpc.
Discarding wedge modes yields $0.3< r < 0.5$ and completely removes the

traffic efficiency, and passenger comfort. The performance of most VANET
applications relies on the availability of accurate and recent
mobility-information, shared by neighboring vehicles. However, sharing false
mobility information can disrupt any potential VANET application. Misbehavior
detection is an important security component. However, existing misbehavior
detection solutions lack considering the high dynamicity of vehicular context
which leads to low detection accuracy and high false alarms. The use of
predefined and static security thresholds are the main drawbacks of the
existing solutions. In this paper, a context-aware misbehavior detection scheme
(CAMDS) is proposed using sequential analysis of temporal and spatial
properties of mobility information. A dynamic context reference is constructed
online and timely updated using statistical techniques. Firstly, the Kalman
filter algorithm is used to track the mobility information received from
neighboring vehicles. Then, the innovation errors of the Kalman filter are
utilized to construct a temporal consistency assessment model for each vehicle
using Box-plot. Then, the Hampel filter is used to construct a spatial
consistency assessment model that represents the context reference model.
Similarly, plausibility assessment reference models are built online and timely
updated using the Hampel filter and by utilizing the consistency assessment
reference model of neighboring information. Finally, a message is classified as
suspicious if its consistency and plausibility scores deviate much from the
context reference model. The proposed context-aware scheme achieved a 73%
reduction in false Alarm rate while it achieves a 37% improvement in the
detection rate. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared
with the existing static solutions.

critical amplitude of the acoustic pressure required to achieve yielding and we
find a good agreement between numerical simulations and an analytical formula

Our study covers an area of $\sim 176.7$ arcmin$^{2}$ (i.e., with
$R\lesssim7.5\arcmin$) with 537 X-ray sources. We show that the surface density
distribution of X-ray sources in 47 Tuc is highly peaked in cluster center,
rapidly decreases at intermediate radii, and finally rises again at larger
radii, with two distribution dips at $R\sim 100\arcsec$ and $R\sim 170\arcsec$
for the faint ($L_{X}\lesssim 5.0\times 10^{30} {\rm\ erg\,s^{-1}}$) and bright
($L_{X}\gtrsim 5.0\times 10^{30} {\rm\ erg\,s^{-1}}$) groups of X-ray sources,
separately. These distribution features are similar to those of Blue Straggler
Stars (BSS), where the distribution dip is located at $R\sim 200\arcsec$
\citep{ferraro2004}. By fitting the radial distribution of each group of
sources with a ""generalized King model"", we estimated an average mass of
$1.51\pm0.17\ M_{\odot}$, $1.44\pm0.15\ M_{\odot}$ and $1.16\pm0.06\ M_{\odot}$
for the BSS, bright and faint X-ray sources, respectively. These results are
consistent with the mass segregation effect of heavy objects in GCs, where more
massive objects drop to the cluster center faster and their distribution dip
propagates outward further. Besides, the peculiar distribution profiles of
X-ray sources and BSS are also consistent with the mass segregation model of
binaries in GCs, which suggests that in addition to the dynamical formation
channel, primordial binaries are also a significant contributor to the X-ray
source population in GCs.

symmetric skyrmion and give exact formulas for the solution of the
corresponding far-field and near-field equations, in the asymptotic limit of
small DM parameter (alternatively large anisotropy). The matching of these two
fields leads to a formula for the skyrmion radius as a function of the DM
parameter. The derived solutions show the different length scales which are
present in the skyrmion profiles. The picture is thus created of a chiral
skyrmion that is born out of a Belavin-Polyakov solution with an
infinitesimally small radius, as the DM parameter is increased from zero. The
skyrmion retains the Belavin-Polyakov profile over and well-beyond the core
before it assumes an exponential decay; the profile of an axially-symmetric
Belavin-Polyakov solution of unit degree plays the role of the universal core
profile of chiral skyrmions.

in the input image. In this work, we investigate contextual reasoning based on
multi-scale message propagations from the neighboring contents to the target
ROIs. To this end, we design a novel end-to-end context and attribute grounded
dense captioning framework consisting of 1) a contextual visual mining module
and 2) a multi-level attribute grounded description generation module. Knowing
that captions often co-occur with the linguistic attributes (such as who, what
and where), we also incorporate an auxiliary supervision from hierarchical
linguistic attributes to augment the distinctiveness of the learned captions.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies on Visual Genome dataset demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art

planets in crossing orbits close to their star, the final distribution shows a
significant number of planets on eccentric orbits. The highly misaligned

obtain an equivalence for the Gurevi\v{c} entropy: $h(X)=h(X^{\mathrm{ab}})$ if

periodic orbits for amenable covers $X$ to the compact factor $M$, they
equidistribute with respect to a natural equilibrium measure -- in the case of

M_{\odot}$) stars. Owing to their short lifespan, we expect a very low rate of
such events in elliptical host galaxies, where the star-formation rate is low,
and which mostly consist of an old stellar population. SN 2016hil (iPTF16hil)
is a Type II supernova located in the extreme outskirts of an elliptical galaxy
at redshift $z=0.0608$ (projected distance $27.2$ kpc). It was detected near
peak brightness ($M_{r} \approx -17$ mag) 9 days after the last nondetection.
SN 2016hil has some potentially peculiar properties: while presenting a
characteristic spectrum, the event was unusually short lived and declined by
$\sim 1.5$ mag in $< 40$ days, following an apparently double-peaked light
curve. Its spectra suggest a low metallicity ($Z<0.4\ Z_{\odot}$). We place a
tentative upper limit on the mass of a potential faint host at
$\log(M/M_{\odot}) =7.27^{+0.43}_{-0.24}$ using deep Keck optical imaging. In
light of this, we discuss the possibility of the progenitor forming locally,
and other more exotic formation scenarios such as a merger or common-envelope
evolution causing a time-delayed explosion. Further observations of the
explosion site in the ultraviolet are needed in order to distinguish between
the cases. Regardless of the origin of the transient, observing a population of
such seemingly hostless Type II SNe could have many uses, including an estimate
the number of faint galaxies in a given volume, and tests of the prediction of
a time-delayed population of core-collapse SNe in locations otherwise
unfavorable for the detection of such events.

transformation from the source point set to the target one. Existing methods
often iteratively search for the optimal geometric transformation to register a
given pair of point sets, driven by minimizing a predefined alignment loss
function. In contrast, the proposed point registration neural network (PR-Net)
actively learns the registration pattern as a parametric function from a
training dataset, consequently predict the desired geometric transformation to
align a pair of point sets. PR-Net can transfer the learned knowledge (i.e.
registration pattern) from registering training pairs to testing ones without
additional iterative optimization. Specifically, in this paper, we develop
novel techniques to learn shape descriptors from point sets that help formulate
a clear correlation between source and target point sets. With the defined
correlation, PR-Net tends to predict the transformation so that the source and
target point sets can be statistically aligned, which in turn leads to an
optimal spatial geometric registration. PR-Net achieves robust and superior
performance for non-rigid registration of point sets, even in presence of
Gaussian noise, outliers, and missing points, but requires much less time for
registering large number of pairs. More importantly, for a new pair of point
sets, PR-Net is able to directly predict the desired transformation using the
learned model without repetitive iterative optimization routine. Our code is

outflow in high-mass star-forming region HH 80--81. The outflow is known to
contain two prominent molecular bullets, namely B1 and B2, discovered from our
previous SMA CO J=2-1 observations. While B1 is detected in all the CO, SiO,
and SO lines, B2 is only detected in CO lines. The CO 3-2/2-1 line ratio in B1
is clearly greater than that in B2. We perform a large velocity gradient
analysis of the CO lines and derive a temperature of 70--210 K for B1 and
20--50 K for B2. Taking into account the differences in the velocity, distance
from the central source, excitation conditions, and chemistry between the two
bullets, we suggest that the bullets are better explained by direct ejections
from the innermost vicinity of the central high-mass protostar, and that we are
more likely observing the molecular component of a primary wind rather than
entrained or swept-up material from the ambient cloud. These findings further
support our previous suggestions that the molecular bullets indicate an
episodic, disk-mediated accretion in the high-mass star formation process.

cell physical thickness from its refractive index profile. This manuscript

$55\deg$ in latitude above and below the Galactic center (GC). Although the FBs
were discovered 8 years ago, their origin and the nature of the gamma-ray
emission are still unresolved. Understanding the properties of the FBs near the
Galactic plane may provide a clue to their origin. Previous analyses of the
gamma-ray emission at the base of the FBs, what remains after subtraction of
Galactic foregrounds, have shown an increased intensity compared to the FBs at
high latitudes, a hard power-law spectrum without evidence of a cutoff up to
approximately 1 TeV, and a displacement of the emission to negative longitudes
relative to the GC. We analyze 9 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data in
order to study in more detail the gamma-ray emission at the base of the FBs,
especially at energies above 10 GeV. We confirm that the gamma-ray emission at
the base of the FBs is well described by a simple power law up to 1 TeV
energies. The 95% confidence lower limit on the cutoff energy is about 500 GeV.
It has larger intensity than the FBs emission at high latitudes and is shifted
to the west (negative longitudes) from the GC. If the emission at the base of
the FBs is indeed connected to the high-latitude FBs, then the shift of the
emission to negative longitudes disfavors models where the FBs are created by
the supermassive black hole at the GC. We find that the gamma-ray spectrum can
be explained either by gamma rays produced in hadronic interactions or by
leptonic inverse Compton scattering. In the hadronic scenario, the emission at
the base of the FBs can be explained either by several hundred supernova
remnants (SNRs) near the Galactic center or by about 10 SNRs at a distance of ~
1 kpc. In the leptonic scenario, the necessary number of SNRs is a factor of a
few larger than in the hadronic scenario. (abridged)

of gravity the theory should not have any ds or meta stable ds vacua. In this
regard the Swampland criterion is proposed which any low energy theory should
obey to be consistent with quantum theory of gravity. This criterion is written
as $|\nabla V|/V > c \sim {\cal {O}}(1)$. In this work we consider a scalar
field model for Dark Energy namely the Slotheon Dark Energy model inspired by
the theories of extra dimensions and show that this Dark Energy model agrees
better with the Swampland criteria than the quintessence Dark Energy model.

We propose to use permutation-invariant quantum codes to store quantum data in
Heisenberg ferromagnets, because the ground space of any Heisenberg ferromagnet
must be symmetric under any permutation of the underlying qubits. By exploiting
an area law on the expected energy of Pauli errors, we show that increasing the
effective dimension of Heisenberg ferromagnets can improve the storage
lifetime. When the effective dimension of Heisenberg ferromagnets is maximal,
we also obtain an upper bound for the storage error. This result relies on
perturbation theory, where we use Davis' divided difference representation for

differences. Our numerical bounds allow us to better understand how quantum
memory lifetimes can be enhanced in Heisenberg ferromagnets.

successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) are taken

obtained. Analytical results make known that the diversity orders of the $n$-th

inflection tables from the UniMorph project and raw text examples from

cosmological HI signal. Using N-body simulations we simulate HI intensity maps
and optical catalogues which share the same underlying cosmology. Adding
simulated foreground contamination and using state-of-the-art reconstruction
techniques we investigate the impacts that 21cm foregrounds and other
systematics have on these cross-correlations. We find that the impact a FASTICA
21cm foreground clean has on the cross-correlations with spectroscopic optical
surveys with well-constrained redshifts is minimal. However, problems arise
when photometric surveys are considered: we find that a redshift uncertainty
{\sigma}_z {\geq} 0.04 causes significant degradation in the cross power
spectrum signal. We diagnose the main root of these problems, which relates to
arbitrary amplitude changes along the line-of-sight in the intensity maps
caused by the foreground clean and suggest solutions which should be applicable
to real data. These solutions involve a reconstruction of the line-of-sight
temperature means using the available overlapping optical data along with an
artificial extension to the HI data through redshift to address edge effects.
We then put these solutions through a further test in a mock experiment that
uses a clustering-based redshift estimation technique to constrain the
photometric redshifts of the optical sample. We find that with our suggested
reconstruction, cross-correlations can be utilized to make an accurate
prediction of the optical redshift distribution.

the nearby Compton-thick Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14, with angular resolution 0.7
arcsec (78 pc). We detect CO(2-1) emission from spiral arms and a
circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with
size of $\sim100$ pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions
the circumnuclear ring. The molecular gas in the host galaxy is distributed in
a rotating disk with intrinsic circular velocity $v_{rot}=135$ km/s,
inclination $i=57$ deg, and dynamical mass $M_{dyn }=5\times 10^9~\rm
M_{\odot}$ within a radius of $\sim 1$ kpc. In the inner 100 pc region CO is
distributed in a equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and
consistent with an inflow of gas towards the AGN. This inner CO bar overlaps
with the most obscured, Compton-thick region seen in X-rays. We derive a column
density of $\rm N(H_2) \approx 2\times10^{23}~ cm^{-2}$ in this region,
suggesting that molecular gas may contribute significantly to the AGN
obscuration. We detect a molecular outflow with a total outflow rate $\rm \dot
M_{of}\approx 0.8~M_{\odot}/yr$, distributed along a bi-conical structure with
size of $700$ pc on both sides of the AGN. The bi-conical outflow is also
detected in the $\rm H_2$ emission line at 2.12 $\mu$m, which traces a warmer
nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the AGN. This suggests that the
outflow cools with increasing distance from the AGN. We find that the hard
X-ray emitting nuclear region mapped with Chandra is CO-deprived, but filled
with warm molecular gas traced by $\rm H_2$ - thus confirming that the hard
(3-6 keV) continuum and Fe K$\alpha$ emission are due to scattering from dense
neutral clouds in the ISM.

essential for their practical success. Correspondingly, a number of knowledge
base debugging approaches, in particular for ontology-based systems, were

asking knowledge engineers a series of questions. Concrete implementations of

also observed that users frequently made errors in the process, which

tasks where the inputs are a low-resolution source image of some target

high-resolution guide image from a different domain (e.g., a grey-scale image
from a conventional camera); and the target output is a high-resolution version
of the source (in our example, a high-res depth map). The standard way of
looking at this problem is to formulate it as a super-resolution task, i.e.,
the source image is upsampled to the target resolution, while transferring the
missing high-frequency details from the guide. Here, we propose to turn that
interpretation on its head and instead see it as a pixel-to-pixel mapping of
the guide image to the domain of the source image. The pixel-wise mapping is
parametrised as a multi-layer perceptron, whose weights are learned by
minimising the discrepancies between the source image and the downsampled

the mapping function, while avoiding regularisation of the outputs; thus
producing crisp, natural-looking images. The proposed method is unsupervised,
using only the specific source and guide images to fit the mapping. We evaluate
our method on two different tasks, super-resolution of depth maps and of tree
height maps. In both cases, we clearly outperform recent baselines in
quantitative comparisons, while delivering visually much sharper outputs.

computational power persists even when the constant-depth quantum circuit is
restricted to geometrically local gates in one dimension. The corresponding
quantum algorithm is the simplest we know of which achieves a quantum advantage
of this type. It may also be more practical for future implementations. Our
second, main result, is that a separation persists even if the shallow quantum

solved with near certainty using a noisy constant-depth quantum circuit
composed of geometrically local gates in three dimensions, provided the noise
rate is below a certain constant threshold value. On the other hand, the
problem cannot be solved with high probability by a noise-free classical
circuit of constant depth. A key component of the proof is a quantum
error-correcting code which admits constant-depth logical Clifford gates and
single-shot logical state preparation. We show that the surface code meets

reachability constraints. We discuss different variants depending on the
comparison operator in the constraints and the domain of the parameter values.
We improve all known lower bounds for this problem, and notably provide
ETR-completeness results for distinct variants of this problem. Furthermore, we
provide insights in the functions describing the induced reachability
probabilities, and how pMDPs generalise concurrent stochastic reachability
games.

$f(R)$ are fundamentally different from those in General Relativity. In the
special case of $f(R) = \alpha R^2$ theories, it has been recently argued that
iso-spectrality between scalar and vector modes breaks down. Here, we show that
such a break down is quite general across all $f(R)$ theories, as long as they
satisfy $f''(0)/(1+f''(0)) \neq 0$, where a prime denotes derivative of the
function with respect to its argument. We specifically discuss the origin of
the breaking of isospectrality. We also show that along with this breaking the
QNMs receive a correction that arises when $f''(0)/(1+f'(0)) \neq 0$ owing to
the inhomogeneous term that it introduces in the mode equation. We discuss how
these differences affect the ""ringdown"" phase of binary black hole mergers and
the possibility of constraining $f(R)$ models with gravitational-wave
observations. We also find that even though the iso-spectrality is broken in
$f(R)$ theories, in general, nevertheless in the corresponding scalar-tensor
theories in the Einstein frame it is unbroken.

In the fully connected ferromagnetic Potts model, a first-order phase
transition is induced by varying thermal fluctuations. Therefore, the
computational time required to obtain the ground states by simulated annealing
exponentially increases with the system size. This study analytically confirms
that the transverse magnetic-field quantum annealing induces a first-order
phase transition. This result implies that quantum annealing does not
exponentially accelerate the ground-state search of the ferromagnetic Potts
model. To avoid the first-order phase transition, we propose an iterative
optimization method using a half-hot constraint that is applicable to both
quantum and simulated annealing. In the limit of $Q \to \infty$, a saddle point
equation under the half-hot constraint is identical to the equation describing
the behavior of the fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model, thus confirming
a second-order phase transition. Furthermore, we verify the same relation
between the fully connected Potts glass model and the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick
model under assumptions of static approximation and replica symmetric solution.
The proposed method is expected to obtain low-energy states of the Potts models
with high efficiency using Ising-type computers such as the D-Wave quantum

Dictionary Learning and total variation, while only requiring a small fraction

data manifold of the spatio-temporal domain has a lower complexity than the
spatial domain and therefore, the learning of a projection-like mapping is
facilitated. Even when trained on only one single subject without

suitable for training a network on limited training data. Finally, in contrast

frequency that depends on the balance of momentum and buoyancy fluxes at the
inlet, as parametrized by the Richardson number. Experiments have revealed the
existence of scaling relations between the Strouhal number of the puffing and
the inlet Richardson number, but geometry-specific relations are required when
the characteristic length is taken to be the diameter (for round inlets) or
width (for planar inlets). In the present study, we show that when the
hydraulic radius of the inlet is instead used as the characteristic length, a
single Strouhal-Richardson scaling relation is obtained for a variety of inlet
geometries. In particular, we use adaptive mesh numerical simulations to
measure puffing Strouhal numbers for circular, rectangular (with three
different aspect ratios), triangular, and annular high-temperature buoyant jets
over a range of Richardson numbers. We then combine these results with prior
experimental data for round and planar buoyant jets to propose a new scaling
relation that accurately describes puffing Strouhal numbers for various inlet
shapes and for Richardson numbers spanning over four orders of magnitude.

infer social intentions and not merely as the state of a moving object. We
investigate human behavior in this virtual world by conducting a study of 22

collected and analyzed, showing that, in fact, social cues can be engineered

immersive virtual worlds which allow the pedestrian to move around freely,

background of ultra-light axion and a binary Keplerian system can affect the
motion of the latter. These resonances lead to perturbations in the
instantaneous time-of-arrivals, and to secular variations in the period of the
binary. While the secular changes at exact resonance have recently been
explored, the instantaneous effects have been overlooked. In this paper, we
examine the latter using N-body simulations including the external oscillatory
forcing induced by the axion background. While the secular effects are
restricted to a narrow width near the resonance, the instantaneous changes,
albeit strongest close to resonances, are apparent for wide range of
configurations. We compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of
semi-major axis for a detection of axion oscillations through the R\{o} mer
delay. The latter can be extracted from the time-of-arrivals of binary pulsars.
The SNR broadly increases with increasing binary eccentricity in agreement with
the secular expectation. However, we find that it differs significantly from
the scaling a^{5/2} around the lowest orders of resonance. Future observations
could probe these effects away from resonances and, therefore, constrain a much
broader range of axion masses provided that binary pulsar systems are found
near the central region of our Galaxy, and that the time-or-arrival measurement

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability and energetic particle effects on a LHD
equilibria, calculated during a discharge where energetic-ion-driven resistive
interchange mode (EIC) events were triggered. We use the reduced MHD equations
to describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal
component of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of
density and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles species. We
add the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects using a closure
relation. The simulations suggest that the helically trapped EP driven by the
perpendicular neutral beam injector (NBI) further destabilizes the 1/1 MHD-like
mode located at the plasma periphery (r/a = 0.88). If the beta of the EP driven
by the perpendicular NBI is larger than 0.0025 a 1/1 EIC with a frequency
around 3 kHz is destabilized. If the effect of the passing EP driven by the
tangential NBI is included on the model, any enhancement of the injection
intensity of the tangential NBI below beta=0.025 leads to a decrease of the
instability growth rate. The simulations indicate that the perpendicular NBI EP
is the main driver of the EIC events, as it was observed in the experiment. If
the effect of the helical couplings are added in the model, an 11/13 EIC is
destabilized with a frequency around 9 kHz, inward shifted (r/a = 0.81)
compared to the 1/1 EIC. Thus, one possible explanation for the EIC frequency
chirping down from 9 to 3 kHz is a transition between the 11/13 to the 1/1 EIC
due to a weakening of the destabilizing effect of the high n modes, caused by a
decrease of the EP drive due to a loss of helically trapped EP or a change in
the EP distribution function after the EIC burst.

operators associated via Fourier transform to the Bessel potentials. These
operators (which we will denote as $J^{\alpha },$ $\alpha >n$) are of the form
(J^{\alpha })(x)=\mathcal{F}_{\xi \rightarrow x}^{-1}\left[ (\max\{1,||\xi

\mathcal{D}\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}),\text{ } x\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}. We show that
the fundamental solution $Z(x,t)$ of the $p-$adic heat equation naturally
associated to these operators satisfies $Z(x,t)<= 0,x\in\mathbb{Q}

given region over time. Unlike the archimedean classical theory, although the
operator symbol -J^{\alpha } is not a function negative definite, we show that
the operator -J^{\alpha } satisfies the positive maximum principle on
C_{0}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}). Moreover, we will show that the closure
\overline{-J^{\alpha }} of the operator -J^{\alpha } is single-valued and
generates a strongly continuous, positive, contraction semigroup {T(t)} on

-J^{\alpha } is m-dissipative and is the infinitesimal generator of a
C_{0}-semigroup of contractions T(t), t>= 0, on L^{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p}^{n}). The
latter will allow us to show that for f\in

sends the right amount of information to the transmitter so that the latter be
able to take its (resource allocation) decision. More formally, the decision
task of the transmitter is to maximize an utility function u(x;g) with respect
to x (e.g., a power allocation vector) given the knowledge of a quantized
version of the function parameters g. We exhibit a special case of an
energy-efficient power control (PC) problem for which the optimal task oriented
CSI quantizer (TOCQ) can be found analytically. For more general utility
functions, we propose to use neural networks (NN) based learning. Simulations
show that the compression rate obtained by adapting the feedback information

importance of learning feature interactions has been emphasized by many works.
Many deep models are proposed to automatically learn high-order feature

system are high-dimensional sparse features, deep models usually learn a
low-dimensional distributed representation for each feature in the bottom
layer. Besides traditional fully-connected architectures, some new operations,

high-quality of MBIR as fast as standard techniques. Intuitively, since CAD
models are typically available for parts to be manufactured, this provides a
strong constraint ""prior"" which can be leveraged to improve the reconstruction.

holds the potential for patient care and clinical research, portability of NLP
approaches across multiple sites remains a major challenge. This study
investigated the portability of an NLP system developed initially at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to extract 27 key cardiac concepts from
free-text or semi-structured echocardiograms from three academic medical
centers: Weill Cornell Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Northwestern Medicine. While
the NLP system showed high precision and recall measurements for four target
concepts (aortic valve regurgitation, left atrium size at end systole, mitral
valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve regurgitation) across all sites, we found
moderate or poor results for the remaining concepts and the NLP system
performance varied between individual sites.

  General Relativity Exceptionalism vs. Particle Physics Egalitarianism","Part of forthcoming Einstein Studies volume with Birkh\""auser,
  provisionally entitlted _Back with a Flourish: Revisiting the Renaissance of

regarding both understanding and justifying Einstein's equations. Both general
relativists and historians of the subject tend to share a view, General
Relativity exceptionalism. But does some of the renaissance progress in
understanding and justifying Einstein's equations owe something to particle
physics egalitarianism? If so, how should the historiography of gravitation and
Einstein's equations reflect that fact?
  The idea of a graviton mass has a 19th century Newtonian pre-history in
Neumann's and Seeliger's long-distance modification of gravity, which
(especially for Neumann) altered Poisson's equation to give a potential
$e^{-mr}/r$ for a point mass, improving convergence for homogeneous matter.
Einstein reinvented the idea before introducing his faulty analogy with
$\Lambda$. This confusion was first critiqued by Heckmann in the 1940s (without
effect) and by Trautman, DeWitt, Treder, Rindler, and Freund et al. in the
1960s, and especially more recently by Sch\""{u}cking, but it has misled North,
Jammer, Pais, Kerszberg, the Einstein Papers, and Kragh. The error is difficult
to catch if one has an aversion to perturbative thinking, but difficult to make
if one thinks along the lines of particle physics. The $\Lambda$-graviton mass
confusion not only distorted the interpretation of Einstein's theory, but also
obscured a potentially serious particle physics-motivated rivalry (massless vs.
massive spin 2). How could one entertain massive spin 2 gravity if $\Lambda$ is
thought already analogous to the Neumann-Seeliger scalar theory?
  Historiography, like physics, is best served by overcoming the divide between
the two views of gravitation.
