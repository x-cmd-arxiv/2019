magnetosphere with the field-line-angular-velocity (FLAV) $\Omega_{\rm F}$,
where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ is the horizon angular-velocity. Then, the
zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the
frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ will see that the `null surface'
S$_{\rm N}$ where $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists. They will see
that the outer domain $D_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ is prograde-rotating
with $\Omega_{{\rm F} \omega}>0$, whereas the inner domain $D_{\rm (in)}$
inside is retrograde-rotating with $\Omega_{{\rm F} \omega}<0$, where
$\Omega_{{\rm F} \omega}=\Omega_{{\rm F}} - \omega$ denotes the ZAMO-FLAV.
`This surface' S$_{\rm N}$ must be the magneto-centrifugal divider of the
force-free magnetosphere, with a kind of plasma-shed on it. Subsequently, the
force-free and freezing-in conditions break down on S$_{\rm N}$, thereby
allowing the particle-current sources to be set up on S$_{\rm N}$. `This
surface' also is the ZAM-surface S$_{\rm ZAMD}$, on which no flow of angular
momentum nor electric current can cross. Because the electric field ${\bf
E}_{\rm p}$ reverses sign on S$_{\rm N}$, the Poynting flux reverses direction
from outward to inward on S$_{\rm N}$. An electromagnetic self-extraction of
energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the
inner domain $D_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and `this surface'
S$_{\rm N}$, in order to comply with the first and second laws of
thermodynamics.

been widely used for the dry release transfer of TMD materials. However, this
method has been known to have limitations that make it difficult to transfer
few-layer-thick graphene and h-BN because of the difficulty to fabricate these
materials on PDMS. As an alternative method, we demonstrate the dry release
transfer of single- and bi-layer graphene and few-layer h-BN in this study by
utilizing poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) films. Because of the strong adhesion
between PPC and 2D materials around room temperature, we demonstrate that
single- to few-layer graphene, as well as few-layer h-BN, can be fabricated on
a spin-coated PPC film/290-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate via the mechanical
exfoliation method. In addition, we show that these few-layer crystals are
clearly distinguishable using an optical microscope with the help of optical
interference. Because of the thermoplastic properties of PPC film, the adhesion
force between the 2D materials and PPC significantly decreases at about 70
{\deg}C. Therefore, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene, as well
as few-layer h-BN flakes, on PPC can be easily dry-transferred onto another
h-BN substrate. This method enables a multilayer van der Waals heterostructure
to be constructed with a minimum amount of polymer contamination. We
demonstrate the fabrication of encapsulated h-BN/graphene/h-BN devices and
graphene/few-layer h-BN/graphene vertical-tunnel-junction devices using this
method. Since devices fabricated by this method do not require an edge-contact
scheme, our finding provide a simples method for constructing high-quality
graphene and h-BN-based van der Waals heterostructures.

the data streams can evolve, i.e., old features vanish and new features emerge.
Its goal is to keep the model always performing well even when the features
happen to evolve. To tackle this problem, canonical methods assume that the old
features will vanish simultaneously and the new features themselves will emerge
simultaneously as well. They also assume there is an overlapping period where
old and new features both exist when the feature space starts to change.
However, in reality, the feature evolution could be unpredictable, which means
the features can vanish or emerge arbitrarily, causing the overlapping period
incomplete. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: Prediction with
Unpredictable Feature Evolution (PUFE) where the feature evolution is
unpredictable. To address this problem, we fill the incomplete overlapping
period and formulate it as a new matrix completion problem. We give a
theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries to make the
overlapping period intact. With this intact overlapping period, we leverage an
ensemble method to take the advantage of both the old and new feature spaces
without manually deciding which base models should be incorporated. Theoretical
and experimental results validate that our method can always follow the best
base models and thus realize the goal of learning with feature evolution.

to the successful performance improvement of numerous computer vision tasks.
However, it can only be achieved at the expense of images' spatial resolution.
Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) addresses this problem by fusing
low resolution (LR) HSI with multispectral image (MSI) carrying much higher
spatial resolution (HR). All existing HSI-SR approaches require the LR HSI and
HR MSI to be well registered and the reconstruction accuracy of the HR HSI
relies heavily on the registration accuracy of different modalities. This paper
exploits the uncharted problem domain of HSI-SR without the requirement of
multi-modality registration. Given the unregistered LR HSI and HR MSI with
overlapped regions, we design a unique unsupervised learning structure linking
the two unregistered modalities by projecting them into the same statistical
space through the same encoder. The mutual information (MI) is further adopted
to capture the non-linear statistical dependencies between the representations
from two modalities (carrying spatial information) and their raw inputs. By
maximizing the MI, spatial correlations between different modalities can be
well characterized to further reduce the spectral distortion. A collaborative
$l_{2,1}$ norm is employed as the reconstruction error instead of the more
common $l_2$ norm, so that individual pixels can be recovered as accurately as
possible. With this design, the network allows to extract correlated spectral
and spatial information from unregistered images that better preserves the
spectral information. The proposed method is referred to as unregistered and
unsupervised mutual Dirichlet Net ($u^2$-MDN). Extensive experimental results
using benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate the superior performance of $u^2$-MDN
as compared to the state-of-the-art.

to model short- and long range spatial dependencies and encode global contexts
for strengthening feature activations by channel-wise attention. The NLCE

dispersive waves with which the magnetic flux non-linearly interact. In this
work, we study the properties of the electromagnetic resonances, under
different conditions of practical interest, in annular JTJs (AJTJs), in which
the wavelengths are limited to the length of the circumference divided by an
integer. Our analysis is based on perturbed sine-Gordon equations the

presence of an in-plane magnetic field, as well as in the recently introduced
confocal annular JTJs (in the absence of magnetic field). In both cases, a
variable-separation method leads to quantitatively different Mathieu equations
characterized by even and odd spatially periodic solutions with different
eigen-frequencies. It implicates that a single mode circulating wave is given
by the superposition of two standing waves with the same wavelengths but
different frequencies, and so has a periodically inverting direction of
propagation. The control parameters of this frequency splitting are the

for the confocal AJTJs. In the appropriate limits, the previously known

radial-velocity determinations of their planets' masses, obstructing detection
of Earth twins. Since 2015 July we have been monitoring disc-integrated
sunlight in daytime using a purpose-built solar telescope and fibre feed to the
HARPS-N stellar radial-velocity spectrometer. We present and analyse the solar
radial-velocity measurements and cross-correlation function (CCF) parameters
obtained in the first 3 years of observation, interpreting them in the context
of spatially-resolved solar observations. We describe a Bayesian mixture-model
approach to automated data-quality monitoring. We provide dynamical and daily
differential-extinction corrections to place the radial velocities in the
heliocentric reference frame, and the CCF shape parameters in the sidereal
frame. We achieve a photon-noise limited radial-velocity precision better than
0.43 m s$^{-1}$ per 5-minute observation. The day-to-day precision is limited
by zero-point calibration uncertainty with an RMS scatter of about 0.4 m
s$^{-1}$. We find significant signals from granulation and solar activity.
Within a day, granulation noise dominates, with an amplitude of about 0.4 m
s$^{-1}$ and an autocorrelation half-life of 15 minutes. On longer timescales,
activity dominates. Sunspot groups broaden the CCF as they cross the solar
disc. Facular regions temporarily reduce the intrinsic asymmetry of the CCF.
The radial-velocity increase that accompanies an active-region passage has a
typical amplitude of 5 m s$^{-1}$ and is correlated with the line asymmetry,
but leads it by 3 days. Spectral line-shape variability thus shows promise as a
proxy for recovering the true radial velocity.

a topological tool called persistent homology (and its corresponding

representation so as to facilitate the downstream use of machine learning
tools, and in these approaches, the importance (weight) of different
persistence features are often preset. However often in practice, the choice of
the weight function should depend on the nature of the specific type of data

(and thus metric for persistence diagrams) from labelled data. We study this
problem and develop a new weighted kernel, called WKPI, for persistence

deriving the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate for this model.
Then under the assumption that the users are divided into groups of common

almost surely tight in the limit that the number of BS antennas, the number of

a standard deviation in the range $ [1.8,3.7]$. The lattice potential predicts
a shallow repulsive $\Xi^-$ interaction within pure neutron matter at

Leja algorithm. At each level, adaptive sparse grid interpolation and
quadrature are used to approximate the posterior and perform all quadrature
operations, respectively. Specifically, our algorithm uses coarse
discretizations of the underlying mathematical model to investigate the
parameter space and to identify areas of high posterior probability. Adaptive
sparse grid algorithms are then used to place points in these areas, and ignore
other areas of small posterior probability. The points are weighted Leja
points. As the model discretization is coarse, the construction of the sparse
grid is computationally efficient. On this sparse grid, the posterior measure
can be approximated accurately with few expensive, fine model discretizations.
The efficiency of the algorithm can be enhanced further by exploiting more than
two discretization levels. We apply the proposed multilevel adaptive sparse
Leja algorithm in numerical experiments involving elliptic inverse problems in
2D and 3D space, in which we compare it with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
and a standard multilevel approximation.

mutate shared data, they may lose writes, corrupt data, or produce erratic
program behavior. While many of the data-race issues with concurrency can be
avoided by the placing of locks throughout the code, these often serialize
program execution, and can significantly slow down performance-critical
applications. Programmers also make mistakes, and often forget locks in
less-executed code paths, which leads to programs that misbehave only in rare
situations.
  Rust is a recent programming language from Mozilla that attempts to solve
these intertwined issues by detecting data-races at compile time. Rust's type
system encodes a data-structure's ability to be shared between threads in the
type system, which in turn allows the compiler to reject programs where threads
directly mutate shared state without locks or other protection mechanisms. In
this work, we examine how this aspect of Rust's type system impacts the
development and refinement of a concurrent data structure, as well as its
ability to adapt to situations where correctness is guaranteed by lower-level
invariants (e.g., in lock-free algorithms) that are not directly expressible in
the type system itself. We detail the implementation of a concurrent lock-free
hashmap in order to describe these traits of the Rust language. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/saligrama/concache and is one of the
fastest concurrent hashmaps for the Rust language, which leads to mitigating
bottlenecks in concurrent programs.

subsentential level. Experimental results show that we can distinguish
non-literal translation from literal translation with an accuracy of 87.09%,
and 55.20% for classifying among five non-literal translation processes. This
work demonstrates that it is possible to automatically classify translation

  ACM classes given in lexicographic order",,,,"cs.DB cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents an abstract model for the computations performed by
analytic column stores or columnar query processors. The model is based on
circuits whose wires carry columns rather than scalar values, and whose nodes
apply operators with column inputs and outputs. This model allows expression of
most of the architectural features of existing column-store DBMSes through
columnar execution plans, rather than such features being implemented
sui-generis, and without the column store maintaining significant out-of-plan
data. A strict adherence to columnarity allows for a relatively simple and
robust model; enabling extensive and intensive optimization of almost all
aspects of query processing; and also enabling massive uniform parallelization
of query process on modern hardware. Moreover, the computational model's
expressivity makes it useful also as an \emph{analytical} tool for considering
design aspects and features of existing column stores, individually and
comparatively.
  To achieve the model's wide expressiveness, much of this work develops
representation schemes of relevant data structures as combinations of plain
columns, with columnar circuits used as scheme encoders and decoders. A
particular focus is given to schemes which also compress the data, and their
use in query execution --- as an integral part of the computation: Subcircuits
of larger columnar circuits, not black boxes. Decoder and encoder circuits are
thus also composed to form more elaborate schemes. Such formulation allows both
for an alternative view of well-known compression schemes, and for the
development of new columnar compression schemes with useful features; these
should be of independent interest irrespective of column store systems.

detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is very important to avoid
classification errors. In the context of OOD detection for image
classification, one of the recent approaches proposes training a classifier
called ""confident-classifier"" by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss on
in-distribution samples and minimizing the KL divergence between the predictive
distribution of OOD samples in the low-density regions of in-distribution and
the uniform distribution (maximizing the entropy of the outputs). Thus, the
samples could be detected as OOD if they have low confidence or high entropy.
In this paper, we analyze this setting both theoretically and experimentally.
We conclude that the resulting confident-classifier still yields arbitrarily
high confidence for OOD samples far away from the in-distribution. We instead
suggest training a classifier by adding an explicit ""reject"" class for OOD
samples.

results if any single image classification requests experience slowdown.

generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model
from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training
examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent
space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent
space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate
our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated
layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of
learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just
memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a
fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning
model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined
heuristics.

algorithms have tremendous use in guiding parameter space searches, or solving
inverse problems. As the algorithms become more sophisticated, we no longer
only need to differentiate simple mathematical functions, but have to deal with
general programs which encode complex transformations of data. This
dissertation introduces three tools for addressing the challenges that arise
when obtaining and applying the derivatives for complex graphics algorithms.
  Traditionally, practitioners have been constrained to composing programs with
a limited set of operators, or hand-deriving derivatives. We extend the image
processing language Halide with reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and the
ability to automatically optimize the gradient computations. This enables
automatic generation of the gradients of arbitrary Halide programs, at high
performance, with little programmer effort.
  In 3D rendering, the gradient is required with respect to variables such as
camera parameters, geometry, and appearance. However, computing the gradient is
challenging because the rendering integral includes visibility terms that are
not differentiable. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first general-purpose
differentiable ray tracer that solves the full rendering equation, while
correctly taking the geometric discontinuities into account.
  Finally, we demonstrate that the derivatives of light path throughput can
also be useful for guiding sampling in forward rendering. Simulating light
transport in the presence of multi-bounce glossy effects and motion in 3D
rendering is challenging due to the hard-to-sample high-contribution areas. We
present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo rendering algorithm that extends Metropolis
Light Transport by automatically and explicitly adapting to the local
integrand, thereby increasing sampling efficiency.

the lines $j=2i-\sigma_{\xi}+2k-1$ for $0\leq k\leq g+1$ where
$\sigma_{\xi^*}(L)+2g= \sigma_{\xi}(L)$ are the signatures of $L$ for a

links, the two signatures are equal and this recovers Lee's $H$-thinness result
for $Kh^{*,*}(L)$. Our result applies more generally to give an upper bound for
the homological width of the Khovanov homology of any checkerboard virtual link

viewed as the virtual analogue of the Turaev genus. The proof rests on
associating, to any checkerboard colorable link $L$, an alternating virtual
link diagram with the same Khovanov homology as $L$.

are among the most common structures in use. They are highly efficient, in
terms of material required to maintain strength, but also prone to deformation
and failure. We introduce an efficient method for reinforcing shells, that is,
adding material to the shell to increase its resilience to external loads. Our
goal is to produce a reinforcement structure of minimal weight. It has been
demonstrated that optimal reinforcement structures may be qualitatively
different, depending on external loads and surface shape. In some cases, it
naturally consists of discrete protruding ribs; in other cases, a smooth shell
thickness variation allows to save more material.
  Most previously proposed solutions, starting from classical Michell trusses,
are not able to handle a full range of shells (e.g., are restricted to
self-supporting structures) or are unable to reproduce this range of behaviors,
resulting in suboptimal structures.

configurations, taking into account both in-plane (tensile/compression) and
out-of-plane (bending) forces. By using a more precise volume model, we are
capable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitative
behaviors. Our method includes new algorithms for determining the layout of
reinforcement structure elements, and an efficient algorithm to optimize their
shape, minimizing a non-linear non-convex functional at a fraction of the cost

only confirms the existence of dark things but does not specify their locations

click-stream analysis and scenic route planning. For example, in economics and
targeted marketing, understanding economic behavior of consumers is quite
challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product
profitability. Several algorithms have been proposed to address this problem by
efficiently mining utility-based useful sequential patterns. Nevertheless, the
performance of these algorithms can be unsatisfying in terms of runtime and
memory usage due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space for low
utility threshold and large databases. Hence, this paper proposes a more
efficient algorithm for the task of high-utility sequential pattern mining,
called HUSP-ULL. It utilizes a lexicographic sequence (LS)-tree and a
utility-linked (UL)-list structure to fast discover HUSPs. Furthermore, two
pruning strategies are introduced in HUSP-ULL to obtain tight upper-bounds on
the utility of candidate sequences, and reduce the search space by pruning
unpromising candidates early. Substantial experiments both on real-life and
synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively and
efficiently discover the complete set of HUSPs and outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

important for the task of video summarization. Practically, RNN is good at

not capable enough to handle the video summarization task, since traditional

summarization task are usually in longer duration. To address this problem, we
propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network for video summarization, called
H-RNN in this paper. Specifically, it has two layers, where the first layer is
utilized to encode short video subshots cut from the original video, and the
final hidden state of each subshot is input to the second layer for calculating
its confidence to be a key subshot. Compared to traditional RNNs, H-RNN is more
suitable to video summarization, since it can exploit long temporal dependency
among frames, meanwhile, the computation operations are significantly lessened.

geometric hierarchy of the non-compact Hopf maps, we extend the $Sp(2;

(AGNs) whose black holes possess accretion disks; these TDEs can be confused
with common AGN flares. The disruption itself is unaffected by the disk, but
the evolution of the bound debris stream is modified by its collision with the
disk when it returns to pericenter. The outcome of the collision is largely
determined by the ratio of the stream mass current to the azimuthal mass
current of the disk rotating underneath the stream footprint, which in turn
depends on the mass and luminosity of the AGN. To characterize TDEs in AGNs, we
simulated a suite of stream--disk collisions with various mass current ratios.
The collision excites shocks in the disk, leading to inflow and energy
dissipation orders of magnitude above Eddington; however, much of the radiation
is trapped in the inflow and advected into the black hole, so the actual
bolometric luminosity may be closer to Eddington. The emergent spectrum may not
be thermal, TDE-like, or AGN-like. The rapid inflow causes the disk interior to
the impact point to be depleted within a fraction of the mass return time. If
the stream is heavy enough to penetrate the disk, part of the outgoing material
eventually hits the disk again, dissipating its kinetic energy in the second
collision; another part becomes unbound, emitting synchrotron radiation as it
shocks with surrounding gas.

AMS-02 observation above $15~\rm GeV$ and consistent with the de-modulated
spectrum within $2\%$. The proton spectrum based on the cross section model of
Kafexhiu et al. (2014) is about $1.4-1.8$ times that of AMS-02 at $2-100~\rm

is performed to compare with the observation of Voyager 1, and we find a
deviation of $\lesssim 2.5\sigma$ for both the models. In general, an
approximately consistent CR spectrum can be obtained using $\gamma$-ray

properties is part of the search for habitable exoplanets. In this work, we use
the general circulation model ExoCAM to determine how the inner edge of the
habitable zone of tidally locked planets orbiting M dwarf stars depends on
planetary radius, surface gravity, and surface pressure. We find that the inner
edge of the habitable zone for more massive planets occurs at higher stellar
irradiation, as found in previous one-dimensional simulations. We also
determine the relative effects of varying planetary radius and surface gravity.
Increasing the planetary radius leads to a lower planetary albedo and warmer
climate, pushing the inner edge of the habitable zone to lower stellar
irradiation. This results from a change in circulation regime that leads to the
disruption of the thick, reflective cloud deck around the substellar point.
Increasing gravity increases the outgoing longwave radiation, which moves the
inner edge of the habitable zone to higher stellar irradiation. This is because
the column mass of water vapor decreases with increasing gravity, leading to a
reduction in the greenhouse effect. The effect of gravity on the outgoing
longwave radiation is stronger than the effect of radius on the planetary
albedo, so that increasing gravity and radius together causes the inner edge of
the habitable zone to move to higher stellar irradiation. Our results show that
the inner edge of the habitable zone for more massive terrestrial planets
occurs at a larger stellar irradiation.

consequences of utilizing a large number of antennas with an increased
bandwidth is that array steering vectors vary among different subcarriers. Due
to this effect, known as beam squint, the conventional channel model is no
longer applicable for mmWave massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we study
channel estimation under the resulting non-standard model. To that aim, we
first analyze the beam squint effect from an array signal processing
perspective, resulting in a model which sheds light on the angle-delay sparsity
of mmWave transmission. We next design a compressive sensing based channel
estimation algorithm which utilizes the shift-invariant block-sparsity of this
channel model. The proposed algorithm jointly computes the off-grid angles, the
off-grid delays, and the complex gains of the multi-path channel. We show that
the newly proposed scheme reflects the mmWave channel more accurately and
results in improved performance compared to traditional approaches. We then
demonstrate how this approach can be applied to recover both the uplink as well

attention to learn the representation matrix to construct a suitable similarity
matrix and overlook the influence of the noise term on subspace clustering.
However, the real data are always contaminated by the noise and the noise
usually has a complicated statistical distribution. To alleviate this problem,
we in this paper propose a subspace clustering method based on Cauchy loss
function (CLF). Particularly, it uses CLF to penalize the noise term for
suppressing the large noise mixed in the real data. This is due to that the
CLF's influence function has a upper bound which can alleviate the influence of
a single sample, especially the sample with a large noise, on estimating the
residuals. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the grouping effect of our
proposed method, which means that highly correlated data can be grouped
together. Finally, experimental results on five real datasets reveal that our
proposed method outperforms several representative clustering methods.

much close to the shortest path with this requirements. We further demonstrate

preprocess a data structure of size $O(n^2)$ in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time, such that
for any query target point we can find a path with the given requirements in

Nevertheless, dynamic point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to
hardware, software or other causes. While a plethora of methods have been
proposed for static point cloud denoising, few efforts are made for the
denoising of dynamic point clouds with varying number of irregularly-sampled
points in each frame. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds
naturally on graphs and address the denoising problem by inferring the
underlying graph via spatio-temporal graph learning, exploiting both the
intra-frame similarity and inter-frame consistency. Firstly, assuming the
availability of a relevant feature vector per node, we pose spatial-temporal
graph learning as optimizing a Mahalanobis distance metric $\mathbf{M}$, which
is formulated as the minimization of graph Laplacian regularizer. Secondly, to
ease the optimization of the symmetric and positive definite metric matrix
$\mathbf{M}$, we decompose it into $\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}^{\top}\mathbf{R}$ and
solve $\mathbf{R}$ instead via proximal gradient. Finally, based on the
spatial-temporal graph learning, we formulate dynamic point cloud denoising as
the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and underlying
spatio-temporal graph, which leverages both intra-frame affinities and
inter-frame consistency and is solved via alternating minimization.
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
independent denoising of each frame from state-of-the-art static point cloud
denoising approaches.

radiative hydrodynamics modeling with the RADYN code, and then recalculate the
Mg II line profiles from RADYN atmosphere snapshots using the radiative
transfer code RH. We find that the current RH code significantly underestimates
the Mg II h \& k Stark widths. By implementing semi-classical perturbation
approximation results of quadratic Stark broadening from the STARK-B database
in the RH code, the Stark broadenings are found to be one order of magnitude
larger than those calculated from the current RH code. However, the improved
Stark widths are still too small, and another factor of 30 has to be multiplied
to reproduce the significantly broadened lines and adjacent continuum seen in
observations. Non-thermal electrons, magnetic fields, three-dimensional effects
or electron density effect may account for this factor. Without modifying the
RADYN atmosphere, we have also reproduced non-reversed Mg II h \& k profiles,
which appear when the electron beam energy flux is decreasing. These profiles
are formed at an electron density of $\sim 8\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$

a much cleaner collision environment than the LHC, it is ideally suited for
studying the properties of Higgs boson with greater precision. Another
advantage of the CEPC over the LHC is that the Higgs boson can be detected
through the recoil mass method by only reconstructing Z boson decay without
examining the Higgs decays. In Concept Design Report(CDR), the circumference of
CEPC is 100km, with two interaction points available for exploring different
detector design scenarios and technologies. The baseline design of CEPC
detector is an ILD-like concept, with a superconducting solenoid of 3.0 Tesla
surrounding the inner silicon detector, TPC tracker detector and the
calorimetry system. Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) have been extensively
studied and used in many fields, especially in particle physics experiments,
including STAR and ALICE. The TPC detector will operate in continuous mode on
the circular machine. To fulfill the physics goals of the future circular

We have proposed and investigated the ions controlling performance of a novel

quasi-linear relation with the pulsation period but the slope is negative for
the gravity modes and positive for the Rossby modes. Most Rossby modes have

near-core rotation rate, assuming the star rotates rigidly. We report the

low-energy Lagrangian description so new techniques are desirable to shed light
on the physics of these phenomena. The 6-dimensional N=(1,0) world-volume
theory on the M5 branes is composed of massless vector, tensor, and hyper

treated in a concise and effective manner by means of Coulomb branches of

Artists frequently use dense collections of such strokes to draw virtual 3D
shapes. We propose SurfaceBrush, a surfacing method that converts such VR
drawings into user-intended manifold free-form 3D surfaces, providing a novel
approach for modeling 3D shapes. The inputs to our method consist of dense
collections of artist-drawn stroke ribbons described by the positions and
normals of their central polylines, and ribbon widths. These inputs are highly
distinct from those handled by existing surfacing frameworks and exhibit
different sparsity and error patterns, necessitating a novel surfacing
approach. We surface the input stroke drawings by identifying and leveraging
local coherence between nearby artist strokes. In particular, we observe that
strokes intended to be adjacent on the artist imagined surface often have
similar tangent directions along their respective polylines. We leverage this
local stroke direction consistency by casting the computation of the
user-intended manifold surface as a constrained matching problem on stroke
polyline vertices and edges. We first detect and smoothly connect adjacent
similarly-directed sequences of stroke edges producing one or more manifold
partial surfaces. We then complete the surfacing process by identifying and
connecting adjacent similarly directed edges along the borders of these partial
surfaces. We confirm the usability of the SurfaceBrush interface and the
validity of our drawing analysis via an observational study. We validate our
stroke surfacing algorithm by demonstrating an array of manifold surfaces
computed by our framework starting from a range of inputs of varying
complexity, and by comparing our outputs to reconstructions computed using
alternative means.

one in which the top cell is made of amorphous silicon and the bottom cell is
made of an amorphous silicon-silicon heterojunction; 3) one based on the use of

control for legged robots. However, most of WBC frameworks fail to generalize
beyond rigid terrains. Legged locomotion over soft terrain is difficult due to
the presence of unmodeled contact dynamics that WBCs do not account for. This
introduces uncertainty in locomotion and affects the stability and performance
of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel soft terrain adaptation
algorithm called STANCE: Soft Terrain Adaptation and Compliance Estimation.
STANCE consists of a WBC that exploits the knowledge of the terrain to generate
an optimal solution that is contact consistent and an online terrain compliance
estimator that provides the WBC with terrain knowledge. We validated STANCE
both in simulation and experiment on the Hydraulically actuated Quadruped (HyQ)
robot, and we compared it against the state of the art WBC. We demonstrated the
capabilities of STANCE with multiple terrains of different compliances,
aggressive maneuvers, different forward velocities, and external disturbances.
STANCE allowed HyQ to adapt online to terrains with different compliances
(rigid and soft) without pre-tuning. HyQ was able to successfully deal with the
transition between different terrains and showed the ability to differentiate
between compliances under each foot.

in the correlation function that derives from differences in the galaxies'
properties and environments. This is typically associated with a difference in
galaxy bias, describing the relation between galaxy number density and dark
matter density, although observational effects such as magnification bias also
play a role. In this paper we show that the presence of a screened fifth force
adds additional degrees of freedom to the correlation function, describing the
effective coupling of the force to the two galaxy populations. These are also
properties of the galaxies' environments, but with different dependence in
general to galaxy bias. We derive the parity-breaking correlation function
analytically as a function of fifth-force strength and the two populations'
fifth-force charges, and explore the result numerically using Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$
as a toy model of chameleon screening. We find that screening gives rise to an
octopole, which, in the absence of magnification bias, is not present in any
gravity theory without screening and thus is a qualitatively distinct
signature. The modification to the dipole and octopole can be
$\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ and $\mathcal{O}(100\%)$ respectively at redshift $z
\gtrsim 0.5$ due to screening, but decreases towards lower redshift. The change
in the background power spectrum in $f(R)$ theories induces a change in the
dipole of roughly the same size, but dominant to the effect of screening at low
$z$. While current data is insufficient to measure the parity-breaking dipole
or octopole to the precision required to test these models, future surveys such
as DESI, Euclid and SKA have the potential to probe screened fifth forces
through the dipole.

light-meson nonets in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel, namely the light nonet
composed of $a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (800)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$, and the heavy
nonet of $a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$, can be
expressed by linear combinations of the two tetraquark types, one type
containing the spin-0 diquark and the other with the spin-1 diquark. Among
various consequences of this mixing model, one surprising result is that the
second tetraquark with the spin-1 diquark configuration is more important for
the light nonet. In this work, we report that this result can be supported by
the QCD sum rule calculation. In particular, we construct a QCD sum rule for
the isovector resonance $a_0(980)$ using an interpolating field composed of
both tetraquark types and then perform the operator product expansion up to
dimension 10 operators. Our sum rule analysis shows that the spin-1 diquark
configuration is crucial in generating the $a_0(980)$ mass. Also, the mixed
correlation function constructed from the two tetraquark types is found to have
large strength which seems consistent with what the tetraquark mixing framework
is advocating. On the other hand, the correlation function from the
interpolating field with the spin-0 diquark configuration alone fails to
predict the $a_0(980)$ mass mostly by the huge negative contribution from
dimension 8 operators.

which becomes flatter at large field values. Depending on the initial

cosmic expansion and begins the contraction phase. The flat potential plays a
crucial role in triggering the bounce. After the bounce, the flat potential
naturally allows the universe to enter the slow-roll inflation regime, thereby
making the bouncing universe compatible with observations. If the e-folding of
the subsequent inflation is just enough, a positive spatial curvature may be
found in the future observations. Our scenario nicely fits with the creation of
the universe from nothing, which leads to the homogeneous and isotropic
universe with positive curvature. As a variant of the mechanism, we also find

geological disposal. The disposal locations are isolated from biosphere by
engineered barriers while dense rock characteristics and low groundwater flow
assure that any potential return of radionuclides to biosphere by groundwater
transport will be retarded for many hundreds of thousands of years. If the
actinides (and other radionuclides) are conditioned within a glass matrix and
cast into metal canisters, actinides can only be released to the ground water

It is now known that the problem can be solved in deterministic polynomial time
in the white-box model for noncommutative formulas with inverses, and in
randomized polynomial time in the black-box model [GGOW16, IQS18, DM18], where
the running time is polynomial in the size of the formula. The complexity of
identity testing of noncommutative rational functions remains open in general
(when the formula size is not polynomially bounded). We solve the problem for a
natural special case. We consider polynomial expressions in the free group
algebra $\mathbb{F}\langle X, X^{-1}\rangle$ where $X=\{x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_n\}$, a subclass of rational expressions of inversion height one. Our main
results are the following. 1. Given a degree $d$ expression $f$ in
$\mathbb{F}\langle X, X^{-1}\rangle$ as a black-box, we obtain a randomized
$\text{poly}(n,d)$ algorithm to check whether $f$ is an identically zero
expression or not. We obtain this by generalizing the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem

deterministic identity testing algorithm (and even an expression reconstruction
algorithm) that is polynomial time in the sparsity of the input expression. 2.

modelling tasks, especially in neural machine translation(NMT). Very recent NMT
models are based on Encoder-Decoder, where a deep LSTM based encoder is used to
project the source sentence to a fixed dimensional vector and then another deep
LSTM decodes the target sentence from the vector. However there has been very
little work on exploring architectures that have more than one layer in
space(i.e. in each time step). This paper examines the effectiveness of the
simple Recurrent Highway Networks(RHN) in NMT tasks. The model uses Recurrent
Highway Neural Network in encoder and decoder, with attention .We also explore
the reconstructor model to improve adequacy. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of all three approaches on the IWSLT English-Vietnamese dataset. We see that
RHN performs on par with LSTM based models and even better in some cases.We see
that deep RHN models are easy to train compared to deep LSTM based models
because of highway connections. The paper also investigates the effects of
increasing recurrent depth in each time step.

  Loss Function","Version 2",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work investigates the impact of the loss function on the performance of
Neural Networks, in the context of a monocular, RGB-only, image localization
task. A common technique used when regressing a camera's pose from an image is
to formulate the loss as a linear combination of positional and rotational mean
squared error (using tuned hyperparameters as coefficients). In this work we
observe that changes to rotation and position mutually affect the captured
image, and in order to improve performance, a pose regression network's loss
function should include a term which combines the error of both of these
coupled quantities. Based on task specific observations and experimental
tuning, we present said loss term, and create a new model by appending this
loss term to the loss function of the pre-existing pose regression network
`PoseNet'. We achieve improvements in the localization accuracy of the network
for indoor scenes; with decreases of up to 26.7% and 24.0% in the median
positional and rotational error respectively, when compared to the default
PoseNet.

attention in large-scale multimedia retrieval. It aims to encode
high-dimensional data points to binary codes, hence the original
high-dimensional metric space can be efficiently approximated via Hamming
space. However, most existing hashing methods adopted offline batch learning,
which is not suitable to handle incremental datasets with streaming data or new
instances. In contrast, the robustness of the existing online hashing remains
as an open problem, while the embedding of supervised/semantic information
hardly boosts the performance of the online hashing, mainly due to the defect
of unknown category numbers in supervised learning. In this paper, we proposed
an online hashing scheme, termed Hadamard Codebook based Online Hashing (HCOH),
which aims to solve the above problems towards robust and supervised online
hashing. In particular, we first assign an appropriate high-dimensional binary
codes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes to
each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes. Subsequently,
LSH is adopted to reduce the length of such Hadamard codes in accordance with
the hash bits, which can adapt the predefined binary codes online, and
theoretically guarantee the semantic similarity. Finally, we consider the
setting of stochastic data acquisition, which facilitates our method to
efficiently learn the corresponding hashing functions via stochastic gradient
descend (SGD) online. Notably, the proposed HCOH can be embedded with
supervised labels and it not limited to a predefined category number. Extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the merits of the
proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/lmbxmu/mycode/tree/master/2018ACMMM_HCOH.

for many societal applications such as grouping moving objects, classifying

consider only either spatial locations or spatial relationship between two
line-segments. However, these approaches show a limitation to find the similar
moving objects with common views. In this paper, we propose new algorithm that
can group both spatial locations and points of view to identify similar
trajectories. We also propose novel methods that reduce the computational cost

recently introduced world models, have been shown to outperform traditional
deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a variety of different domains.
Instead of the relatively simple architectures employed in most RL experiments,
world models rely on multiple different neural components that are responsible
for visual information processing, memory, and decision-making. However, so far
the components of these models have to be trained separately and through a
variety of specialized training methods. This paper demonstrates the surprising
finding that models with the same precise parts can be instead efficiently
trained end-to-end through a genetic algorithm (GA), reaching a comparable
performance to the original world model by solving a challenging car racing
task. An analysis of the evolved visual and memory system indicates that they
include a similar effective representation to the system trained through
gradient descent. Additionally, in contrast to gradient descent methods that
struggle with discrete variables, GAs also work directly with such
representations, opening up opportunities for classical planning in latent
space. This paper adds additional evidence on the effectiveness of deep
neuroevolution for tasks that require the intricate orchestration of multiple
components in complex heterogeneous architectures.
