excellent rejection of $\alpha$ particles, we attained the lowest background
ever measured with thermal detectors in the energy region where we search for
the signature of $^{82}$Se neutrinoless double beta decay. In this work we
develop a model to reconstruct the CUPID-0 background over the whole energy

distinctive signatures and we assess their extremely low contribution (down to
$\sim10^{-4}$ counts/(keV kg yr)) in the region of interest for $^{82}$Se

towards the comprehension of the background in experiments based on
scintillating calorimeters and in next generation projects such as CUPID.

dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. $T$ is called intransitive if it
leaves invariant spaces other than 0 or the whole space $\mathcal{H}$;
otherwise it is transitive. In 1970, P. R. Halmos raised ten open problems on
operator theory. In the past more than 50 years, nine of Halmos' ten problems
were answered, but only the third one has made little progress. The third
problem of Halmos is the following: if an intransitive operator has an inverse,
is its inverse also intransitive? In this paper, we establish a set of
theoretical systems with the help of Cowen-Douglas operators and spectral
analysis. We give an affirmative answer to this problem under certain spectral
conditions, which make essential progress in the research of Halmos' third
problem. As the first application, we show that for an invertible hyponormal
operator $T$, if $T^{-1}$ is intransitive and int$\sigma(T^{-1})^{\land}$ is
not connected, then $T$ is also intransitive. As the second application, we
show that if $T^{-1}$ has a proper strictly cyclic invariant subspace and there
exists a bounded open set $\Omega$ which is a connected component of
$\rho(T^{-1})$ such that $\Omega\cap \mathcal{U}_0=\emptyset$, where
$\mathcal{U}_0$ is the connected component of $int(\sigma(T^{-1})^\land)$
containing zero point, then $T$ is intransitive.

  Maximum Set Coverage Approach",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twitter has grown to become an important platform to access immediate
information about major events and dynamic topics. As one example, recent work
has shown that classifiers trained to detect topical content on Twitter can
generalize well beyond the training data. Since access to Twitter data is
hidden behind a limited search API, it is impossible (for most users) to apply
these classifiers directly to the Twitter unfiltered data streams (""firehose"").
Rather, applications must first decide what content to retrieve through the
search API before filtering that content with topical classifiers. Thus, it is
critically important to query the Twitter API relative to the intended topical
classifier in a way that minimizes the amount of negatively classified data
retrieved. In this paper, we propose a sequence of query optimization methods
that generalize notions of the maximum coverage problem to find the subset of
query terms within the API limits that cover most of the topically relevant
tweets without sacrificing precision. We evaluate the proposed methods on a
large dataset of Twitter data collected during 2013 and 2014 labeled using
manually curated hashtags for eight topics. Among many insights, our analysis
shows that the best of the proposed methods can significantly outperform the
firehose on precision and F1-score while achieving high recall within strict
API limitations.

to address this challenge based on the analysis of visual cognitive mechanism

final-state collective response to the collision geometry (FSM). To complement
the previous scan of asymmetric collision systems ($p$+Au, $d$+Au and He+Au),
we propose a scan of small symmetric collision systems at RHIC, such as C+C,

triangular flow appears to show a similar behavior. Furthermore, a comparison

well to datasets of different sizes and with varying levels of homogeneity.

with projection bands in the more general setting of an Archimedean pre-Riesz
space $X$. We relate them to projection bands in a vector lattice cover $Y$ of
$X$. If $X$ is pervasive, then a projection band in $X$ extends to a projection
band in $Y$, whereas the restriction of a projection band $B$ in $Y$ is not a
projection band in $X$, in general. We give conditions under which the
restriction of $B$ is a projection band in $X$. We introduce atoms and discrete
elements in $X$ and show that every atom is discrete. The converse implication
is true, provided $X$ is pervasive. In this setting, we link atoms in $X$ to
atoms in $Y$. If $X$ contains an atom $a>0$, we show that the principal band
generated by $a$ is a projection band. Using atoms in a finite dimensional
Archimedean pre-Riesz space $X$, we establish that $X$ is pervasive if and only
if it is a vector lattice.

disks, and thus the primary initial source of carbon in the atmospheres of
forming giant planets. However, recent observations of protoplanetary disks
point towards low volatile carbon abundances in many systems, including at
radii interior to the CO snowline. One potential explanation is that gas phase
carbon is chemically reprocessed into less volatile species, which are frozen
on dust grain surfaces as ice. This mechanism has the potential to change the
primordial C/H ratio in the gas. However, current observations primarily probe
the upper layers of the disk. It is not clear if the low volatile carbon
abundances extend to the midplane, where planets form. We have run a grid of
198 chemical models, exploring how the chemical reprocessing of CO depends on
disk mass, dust grain size distribution, temperature, cosmic ray and X-ray
ionization rate, and initial water abundance. Building on our previous work
focusing on the warm molecular layer, here we analyze the results for our grid
of models in the disk midplane at 12 au. We find that either an ISM level
cosmic ray ionization rate or the presence of UV photons due to a low dust
surface density are needed to chemically reduce the midplane CO gas abundance
by at least an order of magnitude within 1 Myr. In the majority of our models
CO does not undergo substantial reprocessing by in situ chemistry and there is
little change in the gas phase C/H and C/O ratios over the lifetime of the
typical disk. However, in the small sub-set of disks where the disk midplane is
subject to a source of ionization or photolysis, the gas phase C/O ratio
increases by up to nearly 9 orders of magnitude due to conversion of CO into
volatile hydrocarbons.

representation learning. However, without transfer learning, the learned model
is fixed as is, which is not adaptable for handling various unseen scenarios.
In this paper, beyond representation learning, we consider how to formulate
person image matching directly in deep feature maps. We treat image matching as
finding local correspondences in feature maps, and construct query-adaptive
convolution kernels on the fly to achieve local matching. In this way, the
matching process and results are interpretable, and this explicit matching is
more generalizable than representation features to unseen scenarios, such as
unknown misalignments, pose or viewpoint changes. To facilitate end-to-end
training of this architecture, we further build a class memory module to cache
feature maps of the most recent samples of each class, so as to compute image
matching losses for metric learning. Through direct cross-dataset evaluation,
the proposed Query-Adaptive Convolution (QAConv) method gains large
improvements over popular learning methods (about 10%+ mAP), and achieves
comparable results to many transfer learning methods. Besides, a model-free
temporal cooccurrence based score weighting method called TLift is proposed,
which improves the performance to a further extent, achieving state-of-the-art
results in cross-dataset person re-identification. Code is available at

Rademacher random variables

$\boldsymbol{a} = (a_1, \dotsc, a_n)$, its concentration probability is the
quantity $\rho(\boldsymbol{a}):=\sup_{x\in \mathbb{Z}}\Pr(\epsilon_1
a_1+\dots+\epsilon_n a_n = x)$. The Littlewood-Offord problem asks for bounds
on $\rho(\boldsymbol{a})$ under various hypotheses on $\boldsymbol{a}$, whereas
the inverse Littlewood-Offord problem, posed by Tao and Vu, asks for a
characterization of all vectors $\boldsymbol{a}$ for which
$\rho(\boldsymbol{a})$ is large. In this paper, we study the associated
counting problem: How many integer vectors $\boldsymbol{a}$ belonging to a
specified set have large $\rho(\boldsymbol{a})$? The motivation for our study
is that in typical applications, the inverse Littlewood-Offord theorems are
only used to obtain such counting estimates. Using a more direct approach, we
obtain significantly better bounds for this problem than those obtained using
the inverse Littlewood--Offord theorems of Tao and Vu and of Nguyen and Vu.
Moreover, we develop a framework for deriving upper bounds on the probability
of singularity of random discrete matrices that utilizes our counting result.
To illustrate the methods, we present the first `exponential-type' (i.e.,
$\exp(-n^c)$ for some positive constant $c$) upper bounds on the singularity
probability for the following two models: (i) adjacency matrices of dense
signed random regular digraphs, for which the previous best known bound is
$O(n^{-1/4})$ due to Cook; and (ii) dense row-regular $\{0,1\}$-matrices, for
which the previous best known bound is $O_{C}(n^{-C})$ for any constant $C>0$
due to Nguyen.

state, using simultaneous observations in the optical (TNG, NOT, TJO), X-ray
(XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER), infrared (GTC) and UV (Swift) bands. Optical and
X-ray pulsations were detected simultaneously in the X-ray high intensity mode
in which the source spends $\sim$ 70% of the time, and both disappeared in the
low mode, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. In addition,
optical and X-ray pulses were emitted within a few km, had similar pulse shape
and distribution of the pulsed flux density compatible with a power-law
relation $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-0.7}$ connecting the optical and the 0.3-45 keV
X-ray band. Optical pulses were detected also during flares with a pulsed flux
reduced by one third with respect to the high mode; the lack of a simultaneous
detection of X-ray pulses is compatible with the lower photon statistics. We
show that magnetically channeled accretion of plasma onto the surface of the
neutron star cannot account for the optical pulsed luminosity ($\sim 10^{31}$
erg/s). On the other hand, magnetospheric rotation-powered pulsar emission
would require an extremely efficient conversion of spin-down power into pulsed
optical and X-ray emission. We then propose that optical and X-ray pulses are
instead produced by synchrotron emission from the intrabinary shock that forms
where a striped pulsar wind meets the accretion disk, within a few light
cylinder radii away, $\sim$ 100 km, from the pulsar.

  linear advection problems",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a reconstruction-based a posteriori error estimate for linear
advection problems in one space dimension. In our framework, a stable
variational ultra-weak formulation is adopted, and the equivalence of the
$L_2$-norm of the error with the dual graph norm of the residual is
established. This dual norm is showed to be localizable over vertex-based patch
subdomains of the computational domain under the condition of the orthogonality
of the residual to the piecewise affine hat functions. We show that this
condition is valid for some well-known numerical methods including
continuous/discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin methods.
Consequently, a well-posed local problem on each patch is identified, which
leads to a global conforming reconstruction of the discrete solution. We prove
that this reconstruction provides a guaranteed upper bound on the $L_2$ error.
Moreover, up to a constant, it also gives local lower bounds on the $L_2$
error, where the generic constant is proven to be independent of
mesh-refinement, polynomial degree of the approximation, and the advective
velocity. This leads to robustness of our estimates with respect to the
advection as well as the polynomial degree. All the above properties are
verified in a series of numerical experiments, additionally leading to
asymptotic exactness. Motivated by these results, we finally propose a
heuristic extension of our methodology to any space dimension, achieved by
solving local least-squares problems on vertex-based patches. Though not
anymore guaranteed, the resulting error indicator is numerically robust with
respect to both advection velocity and polynomial degree, for a collection of

community for explaining both the dark matter and dark energy evolution. The
Chaplygin cosmologies, a well known name in this group have been investigated
matched with observations from different sources. Obviously, Chaplygin
cosmologies have to obey restrictions in order to be consistent with the
observational data. As a consequence, alternative unified models, differing
from Chaplygin model, are of special interest. In the present work we consider
a specific example of such a unified cosmological model, that is quantified by
only a single parameter $\mu$, that can be considered as a minimal extension of
the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmology. We investigate its observational
boundaries together with an analysis of the universe at large scale. Our study
shows that at early time the model behaves like a dust, and as time evolves, it
mimics a dark energy fluid depicting a clear transition from the early
decelerating phase to the late cosmic accelerating phase. Finally, the model
approaches the cosmological constant boundary in an asymptotic manner. We
remark that for the present unified model, the estimations of $H_0$ are
slightly higher than its local estimation and thus alleviating the $H_0$
tension.

entanglement measure in quantum information theory, due to the fact that it is
easy to compute and serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement. More
recently, the $\kappa$-entanglement of a bipartite state was shown to be the
first entanglement measure that is both easily computable and has a precise
information-theoretic meaning, being equal to the exact entanglement cost of a
bipartite quantum state when the free operations are those that completely
preserve the positivity of the partial transpose [Wang and Wilde, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 125(4):040502, July 2020]. In this paper, we provide a non-trivial link
between these two entanglement measures, by showing that they are the extremes
of an ordered family of $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity entanglement measures,
each of which is identified by a parameter $\alpha\in[ 1,\infty] $. In this
family, the original logarithmic negativity is recovered as the smallest with
$\alpha=1$, and the $\kappa$-entanglement is recovered as the largest with
$\alpha=\infty$. We prove that the $\alpha $-logarithmic negativity satisfies
the following properties: entanglement monotone, normalization, faithfulness,
and subadditivity. We also prove that it is neither convex nor monogamous.
Finally, we define the $\alpha$-logarithmic negativity of a quantum channel as
a generalization of the notion for quantum states, and we show how to
generalize many of the concepts to arbitrary resource theories.

  neuron populations using latent variable models",,,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sensory neurons often have variable responses to repeated presentations of
the same stimulus, which can significantly degrade the stimulus information
contained in those responses. This information can in principle be preserved if
variability is shared across many neurons, but depends on the structure of the
shared variability and its relationship to sensory encoding at the population
level. The structure of this shared variability in neural activity can be
characterized by latent variable models, although they have thus far typically
been used under restrictive mathematical assumptions. Here we introduce two
nonlinear latent variable models for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.
We first present a general nonlinear latent variable model that is agnostic to
the stimulus tuning properties of the individual neurons, and is hence well
suited for exploring neural populations whose tuning properties are not well
characterized. This motivates a second class of model, the Generalized Affine
Model, which simultaneously determines each neuron's stimulus selectivity and a
set of latent variables that modulate these stimulus-driven responses both
additively and multiplicatively. While these approaches can detect very general
nonlinear relationships in shared neural variability, we find that neural
activity recorded in anesthetized primary visual cortex (V1) is best described
by a single additive and single multiplicative latent variable, i.e. an `affine
model'. In contrast, application of the same models to recordings in awake
macaque prefrontal cortex discover more general nonlinearities to compactly
describe the population response variability. These results thus demonstrate
how nonlinear latent variable models can be used to describe population
response variability, and suggest that a range of methods is necessary to study
different brain regions under different experimental conditions.

suggests that the metagalactic ionizing background is strongly fluctuating at
$z > 5.5$. Models for ionizing background fluctuations predict a strong
positive bias on large scales, so the environments of massive $>10^{12}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ dark matter halos, e.g. $z\sim6$ quasar hosts, would be ideal
laboratories to constrain the sources of ionizing photons. While the quasars
themselves should overwhelm any plausible ionizing photon contribution from
neighboring galaxies, proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) have
recently been discovered in the foreground of $z\sim6$ quasars, and the
Ly$\alpha$ forest in the shadow of these DLAs could probe the local ionization
environment. Using Gpc$^3$ simulations of $z=6$ ionizing background
fluctuations, we show that while the Ly$\alpha$ forest signal from ionization
bias around a quasar host halo should be strong, it is likely suppressed by the
associated intergalactic matter overdensity. We also show that the quasar
itself may still overwhelm the clustering signal via a ""ghost"" of the proximity
effect from the quasar radiation causing a large-scale bias in the ionizing
photon mean free path. This ghost proximity effect is sensitive to the lifetime
and geometry of quasar emission, potentially unlocking a new avenue for
constraining these fundamental quasar properties. Finally, we present
observations of a $z\sim6$ quasar with a proximate DLA which shows a strong
excess in Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at the predicted location of the ghost
proximity effect.

dominated objects in the Universe. Their dynamical masses are commonly derived
using the kinematics of stars under the assumption of equilibrium. However,
these objects are satellites of massive galaxies (e.g.\ the Milky Way) and thus
can be influenced by their tidal fields. We investigate the implication of the
assumption of equilibrium focusing on the Sculptor dSph by means of ad-hoc
$N$-body simulations tuned to reproduce the observed properties of Sculptor
following the evolution along some observationally motivated orbits in the
Milky Way gravitational field. For this purpose, we used state-of-the-art
spectroscopic and photometric samples of Sculptor's stars. We found that the
stellar component of the simulated object is not directly influenced by the
tidal field, while $\approx 30\%-60\%$ the mass of the more diffuse DM halo is
stripped. We conclude that, considering the most recent estimate of the
Sculptor proper motion, the system is not affected by the tides and the stellar
kinematics represents a robust tracer of the internal dynamics. In the
simulations that match the observed properties of Sculptor, the present-day
dark-to-luminous mass ratio is $\approx 6$ within the stellar half-light radius

to understand their physical properties, as well as the triggering and
quenching mechanisms of star formation. We aim at connecting morphology and
star-formation properties of low-mass galaxies (median stellar mass $\sim$
10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) at low redshift ($z<0.36$).
  We use a sample of medium-band selected star-forming galaxies from the
GOODS-North field. H$\alpha$ images for the sample are created combining both
spectral energy distribution fits and HST data. Using them, we mask the star
forming regions to obtain an unbiased two-dimensional model of the light
distribution of the host galaxies. For this purpose we use $\texttt{PHI}$, a
new Bayesian photometric decomposition code. We apply it independently to 7 HST
bands assuming a S\'ersic surface brightness model.
  Star-forming galaxy hosts show low S\'ersic index (with median $n$ $\sim$
0.9), as well as small sizes (median $R_e$ $\sim$ 1.6 kpc), and negligible
change of the parameters with wavelength (except for the axis ratio, which
grows with wavelength). Using a clustering algorithm, we find two different
classes of star-forming galaxies: A more compact, redder, and high-$n$ (class
A) and a more extended, bluer and lower-$n$ one (class B). We also find
evidence that the first class is more spheroidal-like. In addition, we find
that 48% of the analyzed galaxies present negative color gradients (only 5% are
positive).
  The host component of low-mass star-forming galaxies at $z<0.36$ separates
into two different classes, similar to what has been found for their higher
mass counterparts. The results are consistent with an evolution from class B to
class A. Several mechanisms from the literature, like minor and major mergers,
and violent disk instability, can explain the physical process behind the
likely transition between the classes. [abridged]

recently emerged as new promising routes towards demonstrating near-term
quantum advantage (or supremacy) over classical systems. In these systems
samples are typically drawn from probability distributions which --- under
plausible complexity-theoretic conjectures --- cannot be efficiently generated
classically. Rather than first define a physical system and then determine
computational features of the output state, we ask the converse question: given
direct access to the quantum state, what features of the generating system can
we efficiently learn? In this work we introduce the Variational Quantum
Unsampling (VQU) protocol, a nonlinear quantum neural network approach for
verification and inference of near-term quantum circuits outputs. In our
approach one can variationally train a quantum operation to unravel the action
of an unknown unitary on a known input state; essentially learning the inverse
of the black-box quantum dynamics. While the principle of our approach is
platform independent, its implementation will depend on the unique architecture
of a specific quantum processor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the VQU
protocol on a quantum photonic processor. Alongside quantum verification, our
protocol has broad applications; including optimal quantum measurement and
tomography, quantum sensing and imaging, and ansatz validation.

massive galaxies is one of the open problems in cosmology. Strong gravitational
lensing is one of the few methods that allow us to constrain the IMF outside of
the Local Group. Aims: The goal of this study is to statistically constrain the
distribution in the IMF mismatch parameter, defined as the ratio between the
true stellar mass of a galaxy and that inferred assuming a reference IMF, of
massive galaxies from the BOSS CMASS sample. Methods: We take 23 strong lenses
drawn from the CMASS sample, measure their Einstein radii and stellar masses
using multi-band photometry from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, then fit a model
distribution for the IMF mismatch parameter and dark matter halo mass to the
whole sample. We use a prior on halo mass from weak lensing measurements and
account for strong lensing selection effects in our model. Results: Assuming an
NFW density profile for the dark matter distribution, we infer a value
$\mu_{\mathrm{IMF}} = -0.04\pm0.11$ for the average base-10 logarithm of the
IMF mismatch parameter, defined with respect to a Chabrier IMF. A Salpeter IMF
is in tension with our measurements. Conclusions: Our results are consistent
with a scenario in which the region of massive galaxies where the IMF
normalization is significantly heavier than that of the Milky Way is much
smaller than the scales $5\sim10$~kpc probed by the Einstein radius of the
lenses in our sample, as recent spatially resolved studies of the IMF in
massive galaxies suggest. The MCMC chains describing the posterior probability
distribution of the model are available online, together with the code used to
obtain them.

either that a large fraction of our objects require $\beta < 1.5$, or that a
model allowing for an excess of sub-mm emission (e.g., a broken dust emissivity
law, or a very cold dust component 10 K) is required. We provide relations to
convert far-infrared colours to dust temperature and $\beta$ for JINGLE-like
galaxies. For JINGLE the FIR colours correlate more strongly with
star-formation rate surface-density rather than the stellar surface-density,
suggesting heating of dust is greater due to younger rather than older
stellar-populations, consistent with the low proportion of early-type galaxies

origin of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking needed to achieve the correct
vacuum alignment. Both questions are addressed in a simple extension of the
Mirror Twin Higgs model with an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and a scalar
field that spontaneously breaks both twin hypercharge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Due
to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an approximate $U(2)$ symmetry in the

Higgs, is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with a weak-scale mass. Couplings
between the hypercharge scalar and matter provide a new dynamical source of
twin sector fermion masses. Depending on the nature and size of these
couplings, a variety of experimental signatures may arise, including quark and
lepton flavor violation, neutrino masses and mixings as well as direct collider
probes of the hypercharged scalar. These signals are correlated with the twin

accretion; they are expected to be significantly less populous than gas giants.
Yet, the observed occurrence rates of sub-Saturns and Jupiters are comparable

of the habitable zone, which allows for liquid surface water on terrestrial
planets, moves out past the system's original frost line, providing an
opportunity for outer planetary system surface habitability. We use a 1D
coupled climate/photochemistry code to study the impact of the stellar
environment on the planetary atmospheres of Earth-like planets/moons throughout
its time in the post-main sequence habitable zone. We also explore the ground
UV environments of such planets/moons and compare them to Earth's. We model the
evolution of star-planet systems with host stars ranging from 1.0 to 3.5
M$_\odot$ throughout the post-main sequence, calculating stellar mass loss and
its effects on planetary orbital evolution and atmospheric erosion. The maximum
amount of time a rocky planet can spend continuously in the evolving post-MS
habitable zone ranges between 56 and 257 Myr for our grid stars. Thus, during
the post-MS evolution of their host star, subsurface life on cold planets and
moons could become remotely detectable once the initially frozen surface melts.
Frozen planets or moons, like Europa in our Solar System, experience a
relatively stable environment on the horizontal branch of their host stars'
evolution for millions of years.

further tailor the TMR response at different temperatures for each material. In

to the highest fields measured for all three compounds owing to the large,

operators (each with two variants: ""left-to-right"" and ""shuffled""), two of

Furthermore, in two out of three crossovers, the ""left-to-right"" version
performs better than the ""shuffled"" version.

implemented in the Q-band receivers of the STRIP instrument of the Large Scale
Polarization Explorer experiment. Its applicability, however, is completely
general. The model has been implemented by superposing the response of two
linearly polarized feedhorns with a $\pi$/2 phase difference, thus taking into
account for the effect of the polarizer, that behaves differently for the two
polarizations of the incoming electric field. The model has been verified by
means of radiation pattern measurements performed in the anechoic chamber at
the Physics Department of the University of Milan. We measured both arms of the
orthomode transducer, in order to check that the diagram at one port is the 90_
rotation of the diagram at the other port. Simulations and measurements show an
agreement at the level of fraction of a dB up to the first sidelobes, thus
confirming the model.

Lorentz-violating parameter delta can be derived. Here, we investigate a
related process, nu_i -> nu_i + nu_f + bar_nu_f, where nu_i is an incoming

with a superluminal velocity that is slightly slower than that of the initial

parameters at high energy differ for the different neutrino mass eigenstates.
Neutrino splitting is not subject to any significant energy threshold condition
and could yield quite a substantial contribution to decay and energy loss
processes at high energy, even if the differential Lorentz violation among
neutrino flavors is severely constrained by other experiments. We also discuss

spherical harmonic analysis for HEALPix data, which is a central component to
computing and analyzing the angular power spectrum of the massive CMB data
sets. The method uses a novel combination of a non-uniform fast Fourier
transform, the double Fourier sphere method, and Slevinsky's fast spherical

(points), the computational complexity of the method is $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2

favorably with $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ runtime complexity of the current methods
available in the HEALPix software when multiple maps need to be analyzed at the

appears to provide better accuracy over the entire angular power spectrum of

charge conjugation, parity transformation and time reversal must be conserved,
particles and their antiparticles should have the same mass and lifetime but
opposite charge and magnetic moment. Here, we test CPT symmetry in a nucleus
containing a strange quark, more specifically in the hypertriton. This
hypernucleus is the lightest one yet discovered and consists of a proton, a
neutron, and a $\Lambda$ hyperon. With data recorded by the STAR
detector{\cite{TPC,HFT,TOF}} at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, we measure
the $\Lambda$ hyperon binding energy $B_{\Lambda}$ for the hypertriton, and
find that it differs from the widely used value{\cite{B_1973}} and from
predictions{\cite{2019_weak, 1995_weak, 2002_weak, 2014_weak}}, where the
hypertriton is treated as a weakly bound system. Our results place stringent
constraints on the hyperon-nucleon interaction{\cite{Hammer2002,
STAR-antiH3L}}, and have implications for understanding neutron star interiors,
where strange matter may be present{\cite{Chatterjee2016}}. A precise
comparison of the masses of the hypertriton and the antihypertriton allows us
to test CPT symmetry in a nucleus with strangeness for the first time, and we
observe no deviation from the expected exact symmetry.

standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additional model parameters are typically varied
one or two at a time, in a series of separate tests. The purpose of this paper
is to highlight that information is lost by not also examining the correlations
between these additional parameters, which arise when their effects on model
predictions are similar, even if the parameters are not varied simultaneously.
We show how these correlations can be quantified with simulations and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. As an example, we assume that $\Lambda$CDM is
the true underlying model, and calculate the correlations expected between the
phenomenological lensing amplitude parameter, $A_L$, the running of the
spectral index, $n_{\rm run}$, and the primordial helium mass fraction, $Y_P$,
when these parameters are varied one at a time along with the $\Lambda$CDM
parameters in fits to the $\textit{Planck}$ 2015 temperature power spectrum.
These correlations are not small, ranging from 0.31 ($A_L-n_{\rm run}$) to
$-0.93$ ($n_{\rm run}-Y_P$). We find that the values of these three parameters
from the $\textit{Planck}$ data are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM expectations
within $0.9\sigma$ when the correlations are accounted for. This does not
explain the 1.8-2.7$\sigma$ $\textit{Planck}$ preference for $A_L>1$, but
provides an additional $\Lambda$CDM consistency test. For example, if $A_L>1$
was a symptom of an underlying systematic error or some real but unknown
physical effect that also produced spurious correlations with $n_{\rm run}$ or
$Y_P$ our test might have revealed this. We recommend that future cosmological
analyses examine correlations between additional model parameters in addition
to investigating them separately, one a time.

making full use of the data sparsity and adapting the Quickscorer algorithm to
the block-distributed setting. We evaluate our approach using datasets with
millions of features, and demonstrate that we are able to achieve multiple
orders of magnitude reduction in communication cost for sparse data, with no
loss in accuracy, while providing a more scalable design. As a result, we are
able to reduce the training time for high-dimensional data, and allow more
cost-effective scale-out without the need for expensive network communication.

to calibrate financial asset price models using an Artificial Neural Network
(ANN). Determining optimal values of the model parameters is formulated as
training hidden neurons within a machine learning framework, based on available
financial option prices. The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in
which we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many
different asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we
evaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the
neurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by
ANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization
method, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable
technique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible,
getting stuck in local minima. Numerical experiments confirm that this
machine-learning framework can be employed to calibrate parameters of
high-dimensional stochastic volatility models efficiently and accurately.

metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be beneficial for reactions where the rate
of reaction is limited by low rates of diffusion or high pressure drop. This
advantageous pore structure can be obtained by defect formation, mostly via
post-synthetic acid etching, which has been studied extensively on water-stable
MOFs. Here we show that a water-unstable HKUST-1 MOF can also be modified in a
corresponding manner by using phosphoric acid as a size-selective etching agent
and a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol as a dilute solvent.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that the etching process which is time- and
acidity- dependent, can result in formation of defective HKUST-1 with extra
interconnected hexagonal macropores without compromising on the bulk
crystallinity. These findings suggest an intelligent scalable synthetic method
for formation of hierarchical porosity in MOFs that are prone to hydrolysis,
for improved molecular accessibility and diffusion for catalysis.

addition we observed SN 2016adj as a target of opportunity in February 2016 for
13 hours. No significant gamma-ray emission has been detected for any of the

Paris-Harrington statement, Kripke was looking for a proof of G\""odel's
Incompleteness Theorem which was model-theoretic, natural (without
self-reference), and easy. Fulfilment gives a versatile tool for both Proof and
Model Theory.
  We begin with short proofs to a number of classical results. With two new
results: there is an easily definable subring $R$ of the primitive recursive
functions such that for any non-principal ultrafilter $D$ on $\omega$, $R/D$ is
a recursively saturated model of Peano arithmetic; and for any r.e. theory
$\textsf{T}$ and for any given r.e. set, we can feasibly find a $\Sigma_1^0$
formula which semi-represents it in $\textsf{T}$.
  We then give a version of Herbrand's Theorem, and of the Hilbert-Ackermann
method of proving consistency, answering a problem of D.
Guaspari:\[\{\ulcorner\phi\urcorner\in\Pi^0_k:\phi\text{ is
}\Sigma^0_k\text{-conservative over $\textsf{PA}$}\}\]is a complete $\Pi^0_2$
set.
  We extend H. Friedman's method for results of such as
$\Sigma^1_2\textsf{-AC}$ is $\Pi^1_3$-conservative over
$(\Pi^1_1\textsf{-CA})_{<\varepsilon_0}\upharpoonright$, along with uniform
versions\[\forall\alpha<\varepsilon_0\;(\Pi^1_1\textsf{-CA})_{\alpha}\upharpoonright\,\vdash\textsf{RFN}_{\Pi^1_3}({\Sigma^1_2}\textsf{-AC})\]
Then there are some model-theoretic applications, starting with
non-$\omega$-models. We extend the theorem of D. Scott involving Weak K\""onig's
Lemma, and describe the order types of elementary initial segments of
recursively saturated models. For $\omega$-models, we extend Friedman's theorem
on minimal models of analysis, and develop indicators for countable fragments
of $\mathcal L_{\infty\omega}$, with some representability results in
$\omega$-logic.
  We close with an exposition of the Paris-Harrington statement.

zero. However, this occurs in a region of parameter space which has a stronger

changes in morphology, blood viscosity, wall elasticity and flow rate. In this
work, an axisymmetric rigid model was used to study the behaviour of the flow
pattern with varying constriction degree ($d_0$), mean Reynolds number
($\bar{Re}$) and Womersley number ($\alpha$). Velocity fields were acquired
experimentally using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry and generated
numerically. For the acquisition of data, $\bar{Re}$ was varied from 385 to

structures: a central jet around the tube axis and a recirculation zone
adjacent to the inner wall of the tube, where vortices shed. Using the
vorticity fields, the trajectory of vortices was tracked and their displacement
over their lifetime calculated. The analysis led to a scaling law equation for

grows the network architecture incrementally in a two phase process as it
learns the weights using adaptive first order gradient algorithm, therefore
omitting the requirement of preselecting the number of hidden layers, nodes and

The Kalman Filter-based Heuristic Ensemble (KFHE) is a recent ensemble method
that exploits the sensor fusion properties of the Kalman filter to combine
several classifier models, and that has been shown to be very effective. This
work proposes a multi-label version of KFHE, ML-KFHE, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the KFHE method on multi-label datasets. Two variants are
introduced based on the underlying component classifier algorithm,
ML-KFHE-HOMER, and ML-KFHE-CC which uses HOMER and Classifier Chain (CC) as the
underlying multi-label algorithms respectively. ML-KFHE-HOMER and ML-KFHE-CC
sequentially trains multiple HOMER and CC multi-label classifiers and
aggregates their outputs using the sensor fusion properties of the Kalman

datasets and eight other algorithms, including state-of-the-art ensemble
methods, show that for both versions, the ML-KFHE framework improves the
ensembling process significantly with respect to bagging based combinations of
HOMER and CC, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of ML-KFHE. Also, the
ML-KFHE-HOMER variant was found to perform consistently and significantly
better than existing multi-label methods including existing approaches based on

localization prevents efficient adiabatic doping in the strong lattice regime

further show that the slowing down problem in one dimension can be circumvented

experimentally feasible using Feshbach resonance techniques. This protocol is
expected to be efficient as well in two dimensions where the localization

fission cross sections in ratio to elastic hydrogen scattering in a

detector has measured precision fission cross section ratios using actinide
references such as $^{235}$U(n,f) and $^{238}$U(n,f). However, by employing a
more precise reference such as the H(n,el) cross section there is the potential
to further reduce the evaluation uncertainties of the measured cross sections.
In principle the fissionTPC could provide a unique measurement by
simultaneously measuring both fission fragments and proton recoils over a large
solid angle. We investigate one method with a hydrogenous gas target and with
the neutron energy determined by the proton recoil kinematics. This method
enables the measurement to be performed in a white-source neutron beam and with
the current configuration of the fissionTPC. We show that while such a
measurement is feasible in the energy range of 0.5 MeV to $\sim$10 MeV,
uncertainties on the proton detection efficiency and the neutron energy
resolution do not allow us to preform a fission ratio measurement to the
desired precision. Utilizing either a direct measurement of the neutron
time-of-flight for the recoil proton or a mono-energetic neutron source or some
combination of both would provide a path to a sub-percent precision
measurement.

luminosity of $L \approx 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$; and the spectrum shows a
persistent blackbody temperature $T \gtrsim 20,000$ K with broad H I and He II
emission. The lines are initially centered at zero velocity, but by 100 days
the H I lines disappear while the He II develops a blueshift of $\gtrsim 5,000$
km s$^{-1}$. Both the early- and late-time morphologies have been seen in other
TDEs, but the complete transition between them is unprecedented. The evolution
can be explained by combining an extended atmosphere, undergoing slow
contraction, with a wind in the polar direction becoming visible at late times.

indicate a stripped star, while the proposed model implies that much of the

studies in which the failure time for study units is the outcome variable of
interest. Data of this form are characterized by the fact that the failure time
is not directly observed but rather is known relative to an observation time;
i.e., the failure times are either left- or right-censored. Due to its
structure, the analysis of such data can be challenging. To circumvent these
challenges and to provide for a flexible modeling construct which can be used
to analyze current status data, herein, a partially linear additive
transformation model is proposed. In the formulation of this model, constrained
$B$-splines are employed to model the monotone transformation function and
nonlinear covariate effects. To provide for more efficient estimates, a
penalization technique is used to regularize the estimation of all unknown
functions. An easy to implement hybrid algorithm is developed for model fitting
and a simple estimator of the large-sample variance-covariance matrix is
proposed. It is shown theoretically that the proposed estimators of the
finite-dimensional regression coefficients are root-$n$ consistent,
asymptotically normal, and achieve the semi-parametric information bound while
the estimators of the nonparametric components attain the optimal rate of
convergence. The finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology is

a collection of bags, where each bag consists of several instances which

algorithm is to find a mapping from the instances of an unseen bag to its
target value. The instance-MIR algorithm treats all the instances separately
and maps each instance to a label. The final bag label is then taken as the
mean or the median of the predictions for that given bag. While it is
conceptually simple, taking a single statistic to summarize the distribution of
the labels in each bag is a limitation. In spite of this performance
bottleneck, the instance-MIR algorithm has been shown to be competitive when
compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. We address the aforementioned
issue by computing the kernel mean embeddings of the distributions of the
predicted labels, for each bag, and learn a regressor from these embeddings to
the bag label. We test our algorithm (instance-kme-MIR) on five real world

decomposition at each iteration which takes most of the computation time. In
order to reduce the cost, we propose an inexact algorithm framework based on a
polynomial subspace extraction. The idea is to use an additional
polynomial-filtered iteration to extract an approximated eigenspace, and
project the iteration matrix on this subspace, followed by an optimization
update. The accuracy of the extracted subspace can be controlled by the degree
of the polynomial filters. This kind of subspace extraction also enjoys the
warm start property: the subspace of the current iteration is refined from the
previous one. Then this framework is instantiated into two algorithms: the
polynomial-filtered proximal gradient method and the polynomial-filtered
alternating direction method of multipliers. We give a theoretical guarantee to
the two algorithms that the polynomial degree is not necessarily very large.
They share the same convergence speed as the corresponding original methods if
the polynomial degree grows with an order $\Omega(\log k)$ at the $k$-th
iteration. If the warm-start property is considered, the degree can be reduced
to a constant, independent of the iteration $k$. Preliminary numerical
experiments on several low-rank matrix optimization problems show that the
polynomial filtered algorithms usually provide multi-fold speedups.

dendrogram technique to the C$^{18}$O data-cube and 8 dense N$_{2}$H$^{+}$
cores by using {\sc FellWalker}. Basic physical properties of filaments such as
mass, length, width, velocity field, and velocity dispersion are derived. It is
found that L1478 consists of several filaments with slightly different
velocities. Especially the filaments which are supercritical are found to
contain dense cores detected in N$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Comparison of non-thermal
velocity dispersions derived from C$^{18}$O and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ for the
filaments and dense cores indicates that some of dense cores share similar
kinematics with those of the surrounding filaments while several dense cores
have different kinematics with those of their filaments. This suggests that the
formation mechanism of dense cores and filaments can be different in individual
filaments depending on their morphologies and environments.

domain name they are communicating with by exploiting the fact that many
characters look alike. The attack becomes serious and is raising broad
attention when recently many brand domains have been attacked such as Apple
Inc., Adobe Inc., Lloyds Bank, etc. We first design a survey of human
demographics, brand familiarity, and security backgrounds and apply it to 2,067
participants. We build a regression model to study which factors affect
participants' ability in recognizing homograph domains. We find that for
different levels of visual similarity, the participants exhibit different
abilities. 13.95% of participants can recognize non-homographs while 16.60% of
participants can recognize homographs whose the visual similarity with the
target brand domains is under 99.9%; but when the similarity increases to
99.9%, the number of participants who can recognize homographs significantly
drops down to only 0.19%; and for the homographs with 100% of visual
similarity, there is no way for the participants to recognize. We also find
that female participants tend to recognize homographs better the male but male
participants tend to able to recognize non-homographs better than females.
Security knowledge is a significant factor affecting both homographs and
non-homographs; surprisingly, people who have strong security knowledge tend to
be able to recognize homographs but not non-homographs. Furthermore, people who
work or are educated in computer science or computer engineering do not appear
as a factor affecting the ability in recognizing homographs; however,
interestingly, right after they are explained about the homograph attack,
people who work or are educated in computer science or computer engineering are
the ones who can capture the situation the most quickly.

computational power and accurate grid models for use in real time, leading to
growing concerns in the secure and economic operation of the power grid.
Existing operational control actions are typically determined offline, which
are less optimized. This paper presents a novel paradigm, Grid Mind, for
autonomous grid operational controls using deep reinforcement learning. The
proposed AI agent for voltage control can learn its control policy through
interactions with massive offline simulations, and adapts its behavior to new
changes including not only load/generation variations but also topological
changes. A properly trained agent is tested on the IEEE 14-bus system with tens
of thousands of scenarios, and promising performance is demonstrated in

However, the voltage-induced MA is too weak to deterministically switch the

large-scale structures in laminar and turbulent channel flows are considered. A
key feature of the analysis is that the Orr--Sommerfeld and Squire operators
are each considered separately. Physically this corresponds to considering two
separate processes: (i) the response of wall-normal velocity fluctuations to
external forcing; and (ii) the response of streamwise velocity fluctuations to
wall-normal velocity fluctuations. In this way we exploit the fact that, for
streamwise-constant fluctuations, the dynamics governing the wall-normal
velocity are independent of the mean velocity profile (and therefore the mean
shear). The analysis is performed for both plane Couette flow and plane
Poiseuille flow; and for each we consider linear amplification mechanisms about
both the laminar and turbulent mean velocity profiles. The analysis reveals two
things. First, that the most amplified structures (with a spanwise spacing of
approximately $4h$, where $h$ is the channel half height) are to a great extent
encoded in the Orr-Sommerfeld operator alone, thus helping to explain their
prevalence. Second---and consistent with numerical and experimental
observations---that Couette flow is significantly more efficient than
Poiseuille flow in leveraging wall-normal velocity fluctuations to produce
large-scale streamwise streaks.

unsupervised anomaly detection models, i.e., One-Class SVM (OCSVM),

contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The labels of the transactions
are used for supervised learning models only. The performance of each model is
evaluated through 5-fold cross validation in terms of Area Under the Receiver

best performance with AUROC = 0.989 and AUROC = 0.988, respectively. While for
unsupervised approaches, RBM achieves the best performance with AUROC = 0.961,
followed by GAN with AUROC = 0.954. The experimental results show that
supervised models perform slightly better than unsupervised models in this

  We introduce DeepSense, which is the first carrier sense mechanism that

algorithmic framework that can learn the coding mechanisms being employed by
such protocols to identify signals that are hidden within noise. Our evaluation
shows that DeepSense performs carrier sense across 26 different LPWAN protocols
and configurations below the noise floor and can operate in the presence of
frequency shifts as well as concurrent transmissions. Beyond carrier sense, we
also show that DeepSense can support multi bit-rate LoRa networks by
classifying between 21 different LoRa configurations and flexibly adapting
bitrates based on signal strength. In a deployment of a multi-rate LoRa

this question is to understand metastable features of the economic networks.
Ising model has been suggested for studying such features in the literature. In
the homogenous networks one needs at least a minimum activation, forcing an
Ising network to switch its local equilibria, where such minimum is independent
of the nodes characteristics. In the scale free networks however, when one aims
to push the network to switch its vacuum, she faces the question of which nodes
are better to be stimulated to minimize the cost. In the paper it has been
shown that stimulation of the high degree nodes costs less in general. Despite
regular networks, in the scale free networks, the stimulation cost depends on
the networks features such as assortativity. Though we have utilized the Ising
model to tackle a problem in economics, our analysis shed lights on many other
problems concerning stimulations of socio-economic systems.

continuous face scales with 100% coverage in theory. The insightful
understanding of relations between ERF and face scales motivates an efficient

build a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for contexts

doing so, our contributions are threefold: (i) we design our gaze redirection

distinguish between on and off policy training. Namely, we posit that it is
sufficient to only update a policy $\pi$ for cases that satisfy the condition
$A(\frac{\pi}{\mu}-1)\leq0$, where $A$ is the advantage, and $\mu$ is another
policy. Furthermore, we show via theoretic derivation that a perceptron-like
loss function matches the clipped surrogate objective for PPO. With our new

effectively enabling off-policy training. To examine our derivations, we can
combine the on-policy PPO clipped surrogate (which we show to be equivalent

first verify the combined method on the OpenAI Gym pendulum toy problem. Next,
we use our method to train a quadrotor position controller in a simulator. Our
trained policy is efficient and lightweight enough to perform in a low cost

Q-learning, as the most popular model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm, directly parameterizes and updates value functions without
explicitly modeling the environment. Recently, [Jin et al. 2018] studies the
sample complexity of Q-learning with finite states and actions. Their algorithm
achieves nearly optimal regret, which shows that Q-learning can be made sample
efficient. However, MDPs with large discrete states and actions [Silver et al.

novel algorithm that works for MDPs with a more general setting, which has
infinitely many states and actions and assumes that the payoff function and

distribution. Moreover, in some cases, feature enhancement of salient regions

these algorithms are perfectly suited to the rich domain of video games, which
contains many relevant problems with a multitude of successful strategies and
often also multiple dimensions along which solutions can vary.
  This paper introduces a novel modification of the MAP-Elites algorithm called
MAP-Elites with Sliding Boundaries (MESB) and applies it to the design and
rebalancing of Hearthstone, a popular collectible card game chosen for its
number of multidimensional behavior features relevant to particular styles of
play. To avoid overpopulating cells with conflated behaviors, MESB slides the
boundaries of cells based on the distribution of evolved individuals.
Experiments in this paper demonstrate the performance of MESB in Hearthstone.
Results suggest MESB finds diverse ways of playing the game well along the
selected behavioral dimensions. Further analysis of the evolved strategies
reveals common patterns that recur across behavioral dimensions and explores
how MESB can help rebalance the game.

form along the injection front. This process is relevant in the case of oil
recovery from soil. When the replaced material is a viscous fluid, it forms a
finger-like pattern, known as viscous fingering. Interestingly, most replaced
materials are, in reality, viscoelastic, i.e., they behave as an elastic solid
over short timescales but flow as a viscous liquid over longer timescales.
Therefore, it is important to study the scenario in which the replaced material
is a viscoelastic fluid. In this study, we observe the appearance of
delamination-induced fingering when an incompressible organic fluid is injected
into an oleophilic Hele--Shaw cell filled with an aqueous viscoelastic fluid
composed of a wormlike micellar solution. We find a transition in the injection
pattern: during the injection, the thick fingering pattern of the interface
near the inlet changes to thin fingers with a characteristic size of four times
the cell thickness. We examine the material properties, and conclude that the
fingering pattern observed at later times is caused by the delamination of
viscoelastic fluid from the substrate.

quantities like volume or density -- the most important and informative
properties of asteroids -- affecting conclusions about their physical nature.
Our knowledge on shapes and spins of small solar system bodies comes mostly
from visual, disk-integrated photometry. In this work we present a method for
asteroid model uncertainty assessment based on visual photometry (lightcurves
and sparse-in-time absolute measurements) allowing the determination of
realistic volume uncertainty, as well as spin axis orientation, rotational
period and local surface features. The sensitivity analysis is conducted by
creating clones of the nominal model and accepting the ones that fit the
observations within a confidence level. The uncertainties of model parameters
are extracted from the extreme values found in the accepted clone population.
Creation of such population of clones enables the conversion of a deterministic
asteroid model into stochastic one, and can be utilized to create observation
predictions with error bars. The method was used to assess the uncertainties of
fictitious test models and real targets, i.e. (21) Lutetia, (89) Julia, (243)
Ida, (433) Eros and (162173) Ryugu. We conclude that volumes, and subsequently,
densities of asteroids derived from lightcurve-based models likely have vastly
understated uncertainties, the biggest source of which is the inability to
establish the extent of the model along its spin axis.

the proposed ESSC-SL-CTSK-FS method is used to construct con-cise zero-order

clearly and easily. Experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to
confirm the advantages.

a first analysis of the general properties of the filament using Hazel under
the assumption of a single component model atmosphere, in this second part we
focus our attention on the observed Stokes profiles and the signatures which
cannot be explained with this model. We have found an optically thick filament
where the blue and the red components have the same sign in the linear
polarization as an indication of radiative transfer effects. Moreover, the
circular polarization signals inside the filament show the presence of strong
magnetic field gradients. We have also shown that even a filament with such
high absorption still shows signatures of the circular polarization generated
by the magnetic field below the filament. The reason is that the absorption of
the spectral line decays very quickly towards the wings, just where the
circular polarization has a larger amplitude. In order to separate both
contributions, we explore the possibility of a two component model but the
inference becomes impossible to overcome as a high number of solutions is

distinct phases of learning with markedly different layer growth. We then apply
a linearisation process to a general RelU neural net and show how nonlinearity
breaks down the growth symmetry observed in liner neural nets. Overall, our

factors of image pairs are unknown and different from each other, which is
common in real image SR. To tackle the difficulty, we develop two multi-scale
deep neural networks (MsDNN) in this work. Firstly, due to the high computation
complexity in high-resolution spaces, we process an input image mainly in two
different downscaling spaces, which could greatly lower the usage of GPU
memory. Then, to reconstruct the details of an image, we design a multi-scale
residual network (MsRN) in the downscaling spaces based on the residual blocks.
Besides, we propose a multi-scale dense network based on the dense blocks to
compare with MsRN. Finally, our empirical experiments show the robustness of
MsDNN for image SR when the upscaling factor is unknown. According to the

turbulent flows has been proposed in the study. It is defined as a calculation
of the turbulent flow for the desired parameter values with the help of a
reference solution. A typical PES calculation is composed of three consecutive
steps: Set up the asymptotic relationship between the desired solution and the
reference solution; Calculate the reference solution and the necessary
asymptotic coefficients; Extend the reference solution to the desired parameter
values. A controlled eddy simulation (CES) method has been developed to
calculate the reference solution and the asymptotic coefficients. The CES
method is a special type of large eddy simulation (LES) method in which a
weight coefficient and an artificial force distribution are used to model part
of the turbulent motions. The artificial force distribution is modeled based on
the eddy viscosity assumption. The reference weight coefficient and the
asymptotic coefficients can be determined through a weight coefficient
convergence study. The proposed PES/CES method has been used to simulate four
types of turbulent flows. They are decaying homogeneous and isotropic
turbulence, smooth wall channel flows, rough wall channel flows, and compressor
blade cascade flows. The numerical results show that the 0-order PES solution
(or the reference CES solution) has a similar accuracy as a traditional LES
solution, while its computational cost is much lower. A higher order PES method
has an even higher model accuracy.

existence of two extended clouds at [9, 14.3] and [15.3, 23.3] km/s toward the
site G8.14+0.23, which are connected in the position-velocity space through a
broad-bridge feature at the intermediate velocity range. A
""cavity/intensity-depression"" feature is evident in the blueshifted cloud, and
is spatially matched by the ""elongated redshifted cloud"". The spatial and
velocity connections of the clouds suggest their interaction in the site
G8.14+0.23. The analysis of deep near-infrared photometric data reveals the
presence of clusters of infrared-excess sources, illustrating ongoing star

computer vision applications. However, recognizing the weather conditions from
a single image remains challenging and has not been studied thoroughly.
Generally, most previous works treat weather recognition as a single-label
classification task, namely, determining whether an image belongs to a specific
weather class or not. This treatment is not always appropriate, since more than
one weather conditions may appear simultaneously in a single image. To address
this problem, we make the first attempt to view weather recognition as a
multi-label classification task, i.e., assigning an image more than one labels
according to the displayed weather conditions. Specifically, a CNN-RNN based
multi-label classification approach is proposed in this paper. The
convolutional neural network (CNN) is extended with a channel-wise attention
model to extract the most correlated visual features. The Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) further processes the features and excavates the dependencies
among weather classes. Finally, the weather labels are predicted step by step.
Besides, we construct two datasets for the weather recognition task and explore
the relationships among different weather conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The new
constructed datasets will be available at

spent in obtaining an optimal solution to certain instances that we encounter
in the real world scenarios. Often it turns out that input instances get
modified locally in some small ways due to changes in the application world.
The natural question here is, given an optimal solution for an old instance
$I_O$, can we construct an optimal solution for the new instance $I_N$, where
$I_N$ is the instance $I_O$ with some local modifications. Reoptimization of
NP-hard optimization problem precisely addresses this concern. It turns out
that for some reoptimization versions of the NP-hard problems, we may only hope
to obtain an approximate solution to a new instance. In this paper, we
specifically address the reoptimization of path vertex cover problem. The
objective in $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem is to compute a minimum subset $S$
of the vertices in a graph $G$ such that after removal of $S$ from $G$ there is
no path with $k$ vertices in the graph. We show that when a constant number of
vertices are inserted, reoptimizing unweighted $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem
admits a PTAS. For weighted $3$-$path$ vertex cover problem, we show that when
a constant number of vertices are inserted, the reoptimization algorithm
achieves an approximation factor of $1.5$, hence an improvement from known
$2$-approximation algorithm for the optimization version. We provide
reoptimization algorithm for weighted $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem $(k \geq
4)$ on bounded degree graphs, which is also an NP-hard problem. Given a
$\rho$-approximation algorithm for $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem on bounded
degree graphs, we show that it can be reoptimized within an approximation
factor of $(2-\frac{1}{\rho})$ under constant number of vertex insertions.

understanding of post-asymptotic giant-branch evolution because they allow a
precise determination of stellar and nebular properties. Also, objects with
individual distances serve as calibrators for the so-called statistical
distances based on secondary nebular properties. With independently known
distances, it is possible to check empirically our understanding of the
formation and evolution of planetary nebulae as suggested by existing
hydrodynamical simulations. We compared the expansion parallaxes that have
recently been determined for a number of planetary nebulae with the
trigonometric parallaxes provided by the Gaia Data Release 2. Except for two
out of 11 nebulae, we found good agreement between the expansion and the Gaia
trigonometric parallaxes without any systematic trend with distance. Therefore,
the Gaia measurements also prove that the correction factors necessary to
convert proper motions of shocks into Doppler velocities cannot be ignored.
Rather, the size of these correction factors and their evolution with time as
predicted by 1-D hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae is basically
validated. These correction factors are generally greater than unity and are
different for the outer shell and the inner bright rim of a planetary nebula.
The Gaia measurements also confirm earlier findings that spectroscopic methods
often lead to an overestimation of the distance. They also show that even
modelling of the entire system of star and nebula by means of sophisticated
photoionization modeling may not always provide reliable results.
  The Gaia measurements confirm the basic correctness of the present
radiation-hydrodynamics models, which predict that both the shell and the rim
of a planetary nebula are two independently expanding entities.

qubits encoded in magnetically insensitive hyperfine states that can leak and

New generations of large-bandwidth devices with reduced cost leverage the use

time domain, the same benefit can be obtained in an orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) system by precoding the information in the
frequency domain. Besides using multiple antennas, the focusing effect of TR
also comes from the use of a high rate back-off factor (BOF), which is the
signal up-sampling (or down-sampling) rate in the original time-domain TR
precoding. However, a frequency-domain TR precoding in the literature has only
considered BOF of one, which does not fully exploit the focusing property of
TR. In this paper, we discuss how to properly implement different BOFs using
frequency-domain TR precoding in the OFDM system. Moreover, we demonstrate that
increasing the BOF and/or the number of transmit antennas significantly
improves the focusing gain at the intended position. In contrast, the
unintended positions receive less useful power. Furthermore, closed-form
approximations of the mean-square-errors (MSEs) of equalized received signals
at either intended or unintended positions are derived, expressing the focusing
gain as a function of the BOF and the number of antennas. Numerical simulations
with multi-path channels are carried out to validate the MSE expressions.

object has been rapidly increased because of the development of worldwide
surveys these days. Taking advantage of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber
Spectroscopic Telescope survey, 44 newly Li-rich giants are reported, which are
confirmed with high-resolution observations. Based on the high-resolution and
high signal-to-noise spectra, we derived the atmospheric parameters and
elemental abundances with the spectral synthesis method. We performed a
detailed analysis of their evolutionary stages, infrared excess, projected
rotational velocity (v sin i), and the stellar population. We find that (1) The
Li-rich giants concentrate at the evolutionary status of the red giant branch
bump, red clump, and asymptotic giant branch; (2) Three of them are fast
rotators and none exhibit infrared excess. Our results imply that the origins
of Li enrichment are most likely to be associated with the extra mixing in the
stellar interior, and the external sources maybe only make a minor
contribution. Moreover, various Li-rich episodes take place at different
evolutionary stages.

intelligent adaption to a changeable environment with feedback facility from

stress the learning ability of CR in an unknown environment using a combination

environment is required. We also apply the general RL-CR to a specific problem
of automotive radar spectrum allocation to mitigate mutual interference. Using
RL-CR, each vehicle can autonomously choose a frequency subband according to
its own observation of the environment. Since radar's single observation is
quite limited compared to the overall information of the environment, a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network is utilized so that radar can decide the next
transmitted subband by aggregating its observations over time. Compared with
centralized spectrum allocation approaches, our approach has the advantage of
reducing communication between vehicles and the control center. It also
outperforms some other distributive frequency subband selecting policies in
reducing interference under certain circumstances.

Stokes Magnetograph (VSM) and the SDO helioseismic and magnetic imager (HMI).
Traditionally, potential field extrapolations are based on the assumption that
the magnetic field in the photosphere is approximately radial. The validity of
this assumption has not been tested yet. We investigate here the structure and
evolution of the three components of the solar large-scale magnetic field in
2010 - 2017, covering the ascending to mid-declining phase of solar cycle 24,
using SOLIS/VSM vector synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field. We
compare the observed VSM vector magnetic field to the potential vector field
derived using the VSM LOS magnetic field observations as an input. The new
vector field data allow us to derive the meridional inclination and the azimuth
angle of the magnetic field and to investigate their solar cycle evolution and
latitudinal profile of these quantities. SOLIS/VSM vector data show that the
photospheric magnetic field is in general fairly non-radial. In the meridional
plane the field is inclined toward the equator, reflecting the dipolar
structure of the solar magnetic field. Rotationally averaged meridional
inclination does not have significant solar cycle variation. While the vector
radial component $B_r$ and the potential radial component $B_r^{PFSS}$ are
fairly similar, the meridional and zonal components do not agree very well. We
find that SOLIS/VSM vector observations are noisy at high latitudes and suffer
from the vantage point effect more than LOS observations. This is due to
different noise properties in the LOS and transverse components of the magnetic
field, which needs to be addressed in future studies.

behavior in the limit of diverging average inter-event time, in which the
random walker feels the network as homogeneous, even though the activation
probability of nodes is heterogeneously distributed. Our results are supported

advances in sensory devices, and a growing interest in data mining. While
partial least squares (PLS) is traditionally used in the process literature for
designing soft sensors, the statistical literature has focused on sparse
learners, such as Lasso and relevance vector machine (RVM), to solve the high
dimensional data problem. In the current study, predictive performances of
three regression techniques, PLS, Lasso and RVM were assessed and compared
under various offline and online soft sensing scenarios applied on datasets
from five real industrial plants, and a simulated process. In offline learning,
predictions of RVM and Lasso were found to be superior to those of PLS when a
large number of time-lagged predictors were used. Online prediction results
gave a slightly more complicated picture. It was found that the minimum
prediction error achieved by PLS under moving window (MW), or just-in-time
learning scheme was decreased up to ~5-10% using Lasso, or RVM. However, when a
small MW size was used, or the optimum number of PLS components was as low as
~1, prediction performance of PLS surpassed RVM, which was found to yield
occasional unstable predictions. PLS and Lasso models constructed via online
parameter tuning generally did not yield better predictions compared to those
constructed via offline tuning. We present evidence to suggest that retaining a
large portion of the available process measurement data in the predictor
matrix, instead of preselecting variables, would be more advantageous for
sparse learners in increasing prediction accuracy. As a result, Lasso is
recommended as a better substitute for PLS in soft sensors; while performance
of RVM should be validated before online application.

not required to preserve the symmetry protecting exceptional rings in two
dimensions. The presence of symmetry-protected exceptional rings (SPERs) in two
dimensions is numerically demonstrated for a mechanical graphene with friction.
Furthermore, classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian degeneracies is
addressed by taking into account the above special characteristics of

arises from an effective perfect transparency: interfacial spin-orbit coupling

for RE matching that is able to process network traffic beyond 100 Gbps. The
key idea is to reduce the required FPGA resources by leveraging approximate
nondeterministic FAs (NFAs). The NFAs are compiled into a multi-stage
architecture starting with the least precise stage with a high throughput and
ending with the most precise stage with a low throughput. To obtain the reduced
NFAs, we propose new approximate reduction techniques that take into account
the profile of the network traffic. Our experiments showed that using our

face-related applications, ranging from registration, tracking and animation to
higher-level classification problems such as face, expression or attribute
recognition. While several solutions have been presented in the literature for
this task so far, reliably locating salient facial features across a wide range
of posses still remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose in this
paper a novel method for automatic facial landmark localization in 3D face data
designed specifically to address appearance variability caused by significant
pose variations. Our method builds on recent cascaded-regression-based methods
to facial landmarking and uses a gating mechanism to incorporate multiple
linear cascaded regression models each trained for a limited range of poses
into a single powerful landmarking model capable of processing arbitrary posed
input data. We develop two distinct approaches around the proposed gating
mechanism: i) the first uses a gated multiple ridge descent (GRID) mechanism in
conjunction with established (hand-crafted) HOG features for face alignment and
achieves state-of-the-art landmarking performance across a wide range of facial
poses, ii) the second simultaneously learns multiple-descent directions as well
as binary features (SMUF) that are optimal for the alignment tasks and in
addition to competitive landmarking results also ensures extremely rapid
processing. We evaluate both approaches in rigorous experiments on several
popular datasets of 3D face images, i.e., the FRGCv2 and Bosphorus 3D Face
datasets and image collections F and G from the University of Notre Dame. The
results of our evaluation show that both approaches are competitive in
comparison to the state-of-the-art, while exhibiting considerable robustness to
pose variations.

provides a center-outward ranking result and works as a detector for magnitude
outliers. Using the two measures, the functional boxplot of the trajectory
reveals center-outward patterns and potential outliers using the raw curves,
whereas the MSBD-WO plot illustrates such patterns and outliers in a space
spanned by MSBD and WO. The proposed methods are validated on hurricane path

reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework.
The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task

has been widely studied to investigate fluid-like states of materials, in which
constituent particles are not labeled as they can exchange their positions
without energy cost. On the other hand, in ferrogels consisting of magnetic
particles embedded in elastic polymer matrices, the particles are labeled by
their positions as their neighbors do not change over time. We resolve such an
issue of particle labeling, introducing a mapping of the elastic interaction
mediated by the springs onto a pairwise additive interaction (pseudo-springs)
between unlabeled particles. We further investigate magnetostriction and
changes in the elastic constants under altered magnetic interactions employing
the pseudo-spring potential. It is revealed that there are two different
response scenarios in the mechanical properties of the dipole-spring systems:
while systems at low packing fractions are hardened as the magnetic moments
increase in magnitude, at high packing fractions softening due to diminishing
effects from the steric force, associated with increases in the volume, is
observed. Validity of the theory is also verified by Monte-Carlo simulations
with both real and pseudo-springs. We expect that our DFT approach may shed

morphisms, i.e. a contravariant involutive identity-on-objects endofunctor.
Dagger categories with additional structure have been studied under different
names e.g. in categorical quantum mechanics and algebraic field theory. In this
thesis we study the dagger in its own right and show how basic category theory
adapts to dagger categories.
  We develop a notion of a dagger limit that we show is suitable in the
following ways: it subsumes special cases known from the literature; dagger
limits are unique up to unitary isomorphism; a wide class of dagger limits can
be built from a small selection of them; dagger limits of a fixed shape can be
phrased as dagger adjoints to a diagonal functor; dagger limits can be built
from ordinary limits in the presence of polar decomposition; dagger limits
commute with dagger colimits in many cases.
  Using cofree dagger categories, the theory of dagger limits can be leveraged
to provide an enrichment-free understanding of limit-colimit coincidences in
ordinary category theory. We formalize the concept of an ambilimit, and show
that it captures known cases. As a special case, we show how to define
biproducts up to isomorphism in an arbitrary category without assuming any
enrichment. Moreover, the limit-colimit coincidence from domain theory can be
generalized to the unenriched setting and we show that, under suitable
assumptions, a wide class of endofunctors has canonical fixed points.
  The theory of monads on dagger categories works best when all structure
respects the dagger: the monad and adjunctions should preserve the dagger, and
the monad and its algebras should satisfy the so-called Frobenius law. Then any
monad resolves as an adjunction, with extremal solutions given by the
categories of Kleisli and Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore algebras, which again have
a dagger.

These constraints pose significant challenges to the management of C-RANs and,
as we will show, considerably impact the allocation of processing and radio

  Accordingly, we analyze the power consumption of the C-RAN system, and we
formulate the power consumption minimization problem as a weighted joint

networks into their hyperbolic latent geometry. The method assumes that the
structure of networks is well described by the Popularity$\times$Similarity
$\mathbb{S}^1/\mathbb{H}^2$ static geometric network model, which can
accommodate arbitrary degree distributions and reproduces many pivotal
properties of real networks, including self-similarity patterns. The algorithm
mixes machine learning and maximum likelihood approaches to infer the
coordinates of the nodes in the underlying hyperbolic disk with the best
matching between the observed network topology and the geometric model. In its
fast mode, Mercator uses a model-adjusted machine learning technique performing
dimensional reduction to produce a fast and accurate map, whose quality already
outperform other embedding algorithms in the literature. In the refined
Mercator mode, the fast-mode embedding result is taken as an initial condition
in a Maximum Likelihood estimation, which significantly improves the quality of
the final embedding. Apart from its accuracy as an embedding tool, Mercator has
the clear advantage of systematically inferring not only node orderings, or
angular positions, but also the hidden degrees and global model parameters, and
has the ability to embed networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Overall,
our results suggest that mixing machine learning and maximum likelihood
techniques in a model-dependent framework can boost the meaningful mapping of
complex networks.

set of facial landmarks, defined as cephalometric landmarks. Previous works
demonstrated that the descriptive adequacy of these anatomical references for
an indirect application (photo-anthropometric description) increased the
marking precision of these points, contributing to a greater reliability of
these analyzes. However, most of them are performed manually and all of them
are subjectivity inherent to the expert examiners. In this sense, the purpose
of this work is the development and validation of automatic techniques to
detect cephalometric landmarks from digital images of frontal faces in forensic

processing techniques within a supervised learning procedures. The proposed
methodology obtains similar precision to a group of human manual cephalometric
reference markers and result to be more accurate against others

equation (NLSE) with the critical (quintic) or supercritical self-focusing
nonlinearity. We demonstrate that a family of solitons, which are unstable in
this setting against collapse, is stabilized by pinning to an attractive
defect, that may also include a parity-time (PT)-symmetric gain-loss component.
The model can be realized as a planar waveguide in optics, and in a
super-Tonks-Girardeau bosonic gas. For the attractive defect with the
delta-functional profile, a full family of the pinned solitons is found in an
exact form. In the absence of the gain-loss term, the solitons' stability is
investigated analytically too, by means of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion; in
the presence of the PT-balanced gain and loss, the stability is explored by
means of numerical methods. In particular, the entire family of pinned solitons
is stable in the quintic medium if the gain-loss term is absent. A stability
region for the pinned solitons persists in the model with an arbitrarily high
power of the self-focusing nonlinearity. A weak gain-loss component gives rise
to alternations of stability and instability in the system's parameter plane.
Those solitons which are unstable under the action of the supercritical
self-attraction are destroyed by the collapse. If the self-attraction-driven
instability is weak and the gain-loss term is present, unstable solitons
spontaneously transform into localized breathers. The same outcome may be
caused by a combination of the critical nonlinearity with the gain and loss.
Instability of the solitons is also possible when the PT-symmetric gain-loss
term is added to the subcritical nonlinearity. The system with self-repulsive
nonlinearity is briefly considered too, producing completely stable families of
pinned localized states.

several structural results on thin homotopy, and in particular we clarify the
difference between thin equivalence and retrace equivalence for
piecewise-smooth based loops on a smooth manifold, which are often used

questions on topological and functional analytic aspects of groups of based
loops, which we consider to be fundamental to establish a rigorous differential
geometric foundation of the holonomy formulation of gauge theory.

assuming the scaling holds for semi-inclusive distributions as well as for
inclusive distributions. The saturation momentum is usually given by Bjorken's
$x$ variable, but redefinition of the scaling variable can make the saturation
momentum a function of collision energy $W$. We treat the energy as a free
parameter (denoted $W^*$ to distinguish it from $W$) and associate the
energy-dependent saturation momentum $Q_{\rm sat}(W^*)$ with particle number
density. By using $Q_{\rm sat}(W^*)$ for a scaling variable $\tau$, we show
semi-inclusive distributions can be geometrically scaled. i.e., all

Dirichlet and Neumann. For bosonic fields, we get the so defined dimensional
reduction. Taking the simple example of a quartic interaction, we obtain that
the boundary condition (periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann) influence the new

that the model obtained reducing from $D$ dimensions to $D-1$ dimensions is

remains a challenge for ecologists because of their likely competition for
shared resources. Following Hutchinson's seminal suggestion, many theoreticians
have tried to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs
or slows down competitive exclusion. However, fluctuating-environment models
often only produce a dozen of coexisting species at best. Here, we investigate
how to create richer communities in fluctuating environments, using an
empirically parameterized model. Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of
Scranton and Vasseur (Theor Ecol 9(3):353-363, 2016), inspired by phytoplankton
communities, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms,
namely the storage effect and higher intra- than interspecific competition
strengths (i.e., strong self-regulation). We tuned the intra/inter competition
ratio based on empirical analyses, in which self-regulation dominates
interspecific interactions. Although a strong self-regulation maintained more
species (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two
coexistence mechanisms considered could ensure the coexistence of all species
alone. Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they
decreased persistence relative to a random environment. However, strong
self-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively so that all
species could persist with both mechanisms at work. Our results suggest that
combining different coexistence mechanisms into community models might be more
fruitful than trying to find which mechanism best explains diversity. We
additionally highlight that while biomass-trait distributions provide some
clues regarding coexistence mechanisms, they cannot indicate unequivocally
which mechanisms are at play.

incorporated radioisotopes bombard a series of p-n-junctions. However,
radiation damage to the semiconductors commonly used in solar cells limits beta
cells to extremely weak irradiations that generate concomitantly miniscule
electric powers, e.g. micro-Watts. By contrast, beta cells that generate many
orders-of-magnitude larger powers are possible with icosahedral boron-rich
semiconductors since their bombardment-induced atomic displacements
spontaneously self-heal. Furthermore, substitutions for Mg and Al atoms of
icosahedral-boron-rich semiconductors based on the MgAlB14 structure can
produce p-n junctions as electron transfers from doping-induced interstitial
extra-icosahedral atoms convert some normally p-type materials to n-type.
Moreover, electron-phonon interactions of the resulting readily displaceable
interstitial cations with charge carriers foster their forming large polarons.
Oppositely charged polarons repel one another at short range. These repulsions
suppress the recombination of n-type with p-type polarons thereby increasing
the beta-cell efficiency. All told, use of these icosahedral boron-rich
semiconductors could enable beta cells with electric powers that are many
orders of magnitude larger than those of existing beta cells. This development
opens a new avenue for generating electricity from nuclear decays.

biased galaxy samples that trace the same underlying matter density field, and
was proposed to alleviate the cosmic variance problem. Here we propose a novel
application of this approach, applying it to two different tracers one of which
is the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the epochs of reionization and
comic dawn. The second tracer is assumed to be a sample of high-redshift
galaxies, but the approach can be generalized and applied to other
high-redshift tracers. We show that the anisotropy of the ratio of the two
density fields can be used to measure the sky-averaged 21-cm signal, probe the
spectral energy distribution of radiative sources that drive this signal, and
extract large-scale properties of the second tracer, e.g., the galaxy bias.
Using simulated 21-cm maps and mock galaxy samples, we find that the method
works well for an idealized galaxy survey. However, in the case of a more
realistic galaxy survey which only probes highly biased luminous galaxies, the
inevitable Poisson noise makes the reconstruction far more challenging. This
difficulty can be mitigated with the greater sensitivity of future telescopes
along with larger survey volumes.

values for each synoptic map of the six data-sets separately with a
parametrized Gaussian function in order to calculate the possible shift (to be
called here the weak-field asymmetry) of the maximum of the Gaussian
distribution from zero. We estimate the statistical significance of the
weak-field asymmetry for each rotation. We also calculate several versions of
lower-resolution synoptic maps from the high-resolution maps and calculate
their rotational weak-field asymmetries. We find that the weak-field
asymmetries increase with decreasing map resolution. A very large fraction of
weak-field asymmetries are statistically significant, with the fraction of
significant weak-field asymmetries increasing with decreasing resolution.
Significant weak-field asymmetries of high- and low-resolution maps mainly
occur at the same times and have the same sign. Weak-field asymmetries for the
different data-sets and resolutions vary quite similarly in time, and their
mutual correlations are very high, especially for low-resolution maps. These
results give strong evidence for weak-field asymmetries reflecting a real

cluster candidates have risen exponentially in the last few years. Most

distance. As candidates, their detection has not been dynamically confirmed.
Therefore, it is currently unknown how many, and which ones, of the published
candidates, are true clusters, and which ones are chance alignments. We present
a method to detect and confirm star clusters based on the spatial distribution,
coherence in motion and appearance on the color-magnitude diagram. We explain
and apply it to one new star cluster, and several candidate star clusters
published in the literature. The presented method is based on data from the
Second Data Release of Gaia complemented with data from the VISTA Variables in
the V\'ia L\'actea survey for the innermost bulge regions. It consists of a
nearest neighbors algorithm applied simultaneously over spatial coordinates,
star color, and proper motions, in order to detect groups of stars that are
close in the sky, move coherently and define narrow sequences in the
color-magnitude diagram, such as a young main sequence or a red giant branch.
When tested in the bulge area ($-10<\ell\ {\rm (deg)}<+10$; $-10<b\ {\rm

clusters. We report here the detection of one new, likely old star cluster,

1-facets) of this tessellation are the support of a Cox point process, while
the vertices (zero-dimensional facets or simply 0-facets) are the support of a
Bernoulli point process. Taking the superposition $Z$ of these two processes,
two points of $Z$ are linked by an edge if and only if they are sufficiently
close and located on the same edge (1-facet) of the supporting tessellation. We
study the percolation of the random graph arising from this construction and
prove that a 0-1 law, a subcritical phase as well as a supercritical phase
exist under general assumptions. Our proofs are based on a coarse-graining
argument with some notion of stabilization and asymptotic essential
connectedness to investigate continuum percolation for Cox point processes. We
also give numerical estimates of the critical parameters of the model in the
planar case, where our model is intended to represent telecommunications
networks in a random environment with obstructive conditions for signal
propagation.

connected to the central processor via fronthaul and can store popular contents

multicast beamforming, BS clustering, and cache allocation under quality of

on the future file requests. To handle it, a two-stage optimization scheme is
proposed by utilizing historical knowledge of users' requests and channel state

penalty-based approach, and the periodic cache updating is optimized with a
distributed alternating method. Simulation results indicate that the proposed
scheme significantly outperforms conventional schemes and performs extremely
close to a genie-aided lower bound in the low caching region.

importance for efficient decision-making process in the agricultural sector.
However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties, most forecasting models for

obtaining further information of future crop yields, a probability density
forecasting model based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel
function (QRF-SJ) is proposed. The nonlinear structure of random forest is
applied to change the quantile regression model for building the probabilistic
forecasting model. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in
approach of Sheather and Jones are used in the kernel density estimation. A
case study using the annual crop yield of groundnut and millet in Ghana is
presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed
technique. The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and
prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops show that the
constructed prediction intervals capture the observed yields with high coverage
probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-SJ method has a very
high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage
probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each
weather variable in building the quantile regression forest model. The farmer

volume fraction map (SyMVF) from rapid simultaneous relaxometry imaging (RSRI)
has a potential problem, that it does not incorporate information from
surrounding pixels. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that
utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to overcome this problem.
Methods: RSRI and magnetization transfer images from 20 healthy volunteers were
included. A CNN was trained to reconstruct RSRI-related metric maps into a
myelin volume-related index (generated myelin volume index: GenMVI) map using
the myelin volume index map calculated from magnetization transfer images
(MTMVI) as reference. The SyMVF and GenMVI maps were statistically compared by
testing how well they correlated with the MTMVI map. The correlations were
evaluated based on: (i) averaged values obtained from 164 atlas-based ROIs, and
(ii) pixel-based comparison for ROIs defined in four different tissue types
(cortical and subcortical gray matter, white matter, and whole brain). Results:
For atlas-based ROIs, the overall correlation with the MTMVI map was higher for
the GenMVI map than for the SyMVF map. In the pixel-based comparison,
correlation with the MTMVI map was stronger for the GenMVI map than for the
SyMVF map, and the difference in the distribution for the volunteers was
significant (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, P<.001) in all tissue types. Conclusion:
The proposed method is useful, as it can incorporate more specific information
about local tissue properties than the existing method.

in which heavy noise is hidden. Under low light conditions, images taken by
digital cameras have low contrast in dark or bright regions. This is due to a
limited dynamic range that imaging sensors have. For these reasons, various
contrast enhancement methods have been proposed so far. These methods, however,
have two problems: (1) The loss of details in bright regions due to
over-enhancement of contrast. (2) The noise is amplified in dark regions
because conventional enhancement methods do not consider noise included in
images. The proposed method aims to overcome these problems. In the proposed
method, a shadow-up function is applied to adaptive gamma correction with
weighting distribution, and a denoising filter is also used to avoid noise
being amplified in dark regions. As a result, the proposed method allows us not
only to enhance contrast of dark regions, but also to avoid amplifying noise,
even under strong noise environments.

innervate the voluntary movement of skeletal muscle through spinal interneurons
(the 4th layer of the Rexed gray board layers), and anterior horn motorneurons
(which control trunk and proximal limb muscles). Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a
highly disabling disease often caused by traffic accidents. The recovery of CST
and the functional reconstruction of spinal anterior horn motor neurons play an
essential role in the treatment of SCI. However, the localization and
reconstruction of CST are still challenging issues; the accuracy of the
geometric reconstruction can directly affect the results of the surgery. The
main contribution of this paper is the reconstruction of the CST based on the
fiber orientation distributions (FODs) tractography. Differing from
tensor-based tractography in which the primary direction is a determined
orientation, the direction of FODs tractography is determined by the
probability. The spherical harmonics (SPHARM) can be used to approximate the
efficiency of FODs tractography. We manually delineate the three ROIs (the
posterior limb of the internal capsule, the cerebral peduncle, and the anterior
pontine area) by the ITK-SNAP software, and use the pipeline software to
reconstruct both the left and right sides of the CST fibers. Our results
demonstrate that FOD-based tractography can show more and correct anatomical
CST fiber bundles.

optimisation problem in graph theory: the Hamiltonian Completion Problem (HCP)
on undirected graphs. In this problem, the objective is to add as few edges as
possible to a given undirected graph in order to obtain a Hamiltonian graph.
This problem has mainly been studied in the context of various specific kinds
of undirected graphs (e.g. trees, unicyclic graphs and series-parallel graphs).
The proposed algorithm, however, concentrates on solving HCP for general
undirected graphs. It can be considered to belong to the category of
matheuristics, because it integrates an exact linear time solution for trees
into a local search algorithm for general graphs. This integration makes use of
the close relation between HCP and the minimum path partition problem, which
makes the algorithm equally useful for solving the latter problem. Furthermore,
a benchmark set of problem instances is constructed for demonstrating the
quality of the proposed algorithm. A comparison with state-of-the-art solvers
indicates that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve high-quality results.

energy-dominated universe in a good agreement with observations in the
framework of Swiss-cheese Brane-world cosmology. Two different Brane-world
cosmologies with black strings have been introduced for any cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ using two empirical forms of the scale factor. In both
models, we have performed a fine-tuning between the brane tension and the
cosmological constant so that the EoS parameter $\omega(t)\rightarrow -1$ for
the current epoch where the redshift $z\simeq 0$. We then used these fine-tuned
values to calculate and plot all parameters and energy conditions. The
deceleration-acceleration cosmic transition is allowed in both models, and the
jerk parameter $j\rightarrow 1$ at late-times. Both solutions predict a future
dark energy-dominated universe in which $\omega=-1$ with no crossing to the
phantom divide line. While the pressure in the first solution is always
negative, the second solution predicts a better behavior of cosmic pressure
where the pressure is negative only in the late-time accelerating era but
positive in the early-time decelerating era. Since black strings have been
proved to be unstable by some authors, this instability can actually reflect
doubts on the stability of cosmological models with black strings (Swiss-cheese
type brane-worlds cosmological models). For this reason, we have carefully
investigated the stability through energy conditions and sound speed. Because
of the presence of quadratic energy terms in Swiss-cheese type brane-world
cosmology, we have tested the new nonlinear energy conditions in addition to
the classical energy conditions. We have also found that constructing
non-singular and cyclic solutions through certain ansatze in Swiss-cheese
Brane-worlds are not possible.

we examine both items, the sparsity and the selection of suitable $\sigma$'s,

The system exhibits the typical continuous second-order transition from
oscillatory state to death state, when the oscillation amplitude is small.
However, interestingly, when the amplitude of oscillations is large we find
that the system shows an abrupt transition from oscillatory to death state, a
transition termed ""explosive death"". So the quorum-sensing form of interaction
can induce the usual second-order transition, as well as sudden first-order
transitions. Further in case of the explosive death transitions, the
oscillatory state and the death state coexist over a range of coupling

distinct instability families are associated with different Alfvenic or

exploring these instabilities, for grains in a homogeneous medium subject to an
external acceleration. We vary parameters such as the ratio of Lorentz-to-drag
forces on dust, plasma $\beta$, size scale, and acceleration. All regimes
studied drive turbulent motions and dust-to-gas fluctuations in the saturated
state, can rapidly amplify magnetic fields into equipartition with velocity
fluctuations, and produce instabilities that persist indefinitely (despite
random grain motions). Different parameters produce diverse morphologies and
qualitatively different features in dust, but the saturated gas state can be
broadly characterized as anisotropic magnetosonic or Alfvenic turbulence.
Quasi-linear theory can qualitatively predict the gas turbulent properties.
Turbulence grows from small to large scales, and larger-scale modes usually
drive more vigorous gas turbulence, but dust velocity and density fluctuations
are more complicated. In many regimes, dust forms structures (clumps,
filaments, sheets) that reach extreme over-densities (up to $\gg 10^{9}$ times
mean), and exhibit substantial sub-structure even in nearly-incompressible gas.
These can be even more prominent at lower dust-to-gas ratios. In other regimes,
dust self-excites scattering via magnetic fluctuations that isotropize and
amplify dust velocities, producing fast, diffusive dust motions.

standard camera and an event-based camera. However, traditional models could

Therefore, in this paper, we present the first neural asynchronous approach to

two components, 1) an optimized noisy quantum computing (QC) simulator with
flexible error modeling accelerated by eliminating redundant computation, and
2) an architectural simulation infrastructure to construct behavior models for

processor and control systems to ensure simulation accuracy. It can capture the

stiffer EoS as parameter $n$ increases. The $M-I$ graph is in agreement with

Mehdipour & Costantini show a strong anti-correlation between the column
density of the ionized wind and the radio loudness parameter, providing
evidence that jets may thrive in thin disks. This is in contrast with decades
of analytic and numerical work suggesting jet formation is contingent on the
presence of an inner, geometrically thick disk structure, which serves to both
collimate and accelerate the jet. Thick disks emerge in radiatively inefficient
disks which are associated with sub-Eddington as well as super-Eddington
accretion regimes yet we show that the inverse correlation between winds and
jets survives where it should not, namely in a luminosity regime normally
attributed to radio quiet active galaxies which are modeled with thin disks.
This along with other lines of evidence argues against thick disks as the
foundation behind the radio loud/radio quiet dichotomy, opening up the
possibility that jetted versus non jetted black holes may be understood within
the context of radiatively efficient thin disk accretion.

local self-similar or self-affine structure and looks more naturally than one
of IFS. The contractivity factors of IFS(RIFS) determine fractal characteristic

detection and categorization using an event camera. Compared to traditional
frame-based cameras, choosing event cameras results in high temporal resolution
(order of microseconds), low power consumption (few hundred mW) and wide
dynamic range (120 dB) as attractive properties. However, event-based object
recognition systems are far behind their frame-based counterparts in terms of
accuracy. To this end, this paper presents an event-based feature extraction
method devised by accumulating local activity across the image frame and then
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the normalized neighborhood
region. Subsequently, we propose a backtracking-free k-d tree mechanism for
efficient feature matching by taking advantage of the low-dimensionality of the
feature representation. Additionally, the proposed k-d tree mechanism allows
for feature selection to obtain a lower-dimensional dictionary representation
when hardware resources are limited to implement dimensionality reduction.
Consequently, the proposed system can be realized on a field-programmable gate
array (FPGA) device leading to high performance over resource ratio. The
proposed system is tested on real-world event-based datasets for object
categorization, showing superior classification performance and relevance to
state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we verified the object detection
method and real-time FPGA performance in lab settings under non-controlled

mass-transfer particle tracking (MTPT) models have the ability to do so because
masses of all compounds may change along trajectories. Additionally, the
probability mass functions (PMF) of these MTPT models may be compared to
continuous solutions with probability density functions, when a consistent
definition of entropy (or similarly, the dilution index) is constructed. This
definition reveals that every numerical model incurs a computational entropy.
Similar to Akaike's entropic penalty for larger numbers of adjustable
parameters, the computational complexity of a model (e.g., number of nodes)
adds to the entropy and, as such, must be penalized. The MTPT method can use a
particle-collision based kernel or an SPH-derived adaptive kernel. The latter
is more representative of a locally well-mixed system (i.e., one in which the
dispersion tensor equally represents mixing and solute spreading), while the
former better represents the separate processes of mixing versus spreading. We
use computational means to demonstrate the viability of each of these methods.

  Wind Power Forecast Error",,,,,"cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the uncertainty of distributed wind generations (DWGs), a better
understanding of the probability distributions (PD) of their wind power
forecast errors (WPFEs) can help market participants (MPs) who own DWGs perform
better during trading. Under the premise of an accurate PD model, considering
the correlation among DWGs and absorbing the new information carried by the
latest data are two ways to maintain an accurate PD. These two ways both
require the historical and latest wind power and forecast data of all DWGs.
Each MP, however, only has access to the data of its own DWGs and may refuse to
share these data with MPs belonging to other stakeholders. Besides, because of
the endless generation of new data, the PD updating burden increases sharply.
Therefore, we use the distributed strategy to deal with the data collection
problem. In addition, we further apply the incremental learning strategy to
reduce the updating burden. Finally, we propose a distributed incremental
update scheme to make each MP continually acquire the latest conditional PD of
its DWGs' WPFE. Specifically, we first use the Gaussian-mixture-model-based
(GMM-based) joint PD to characterize the correlation among DWGs. Then, we
propose a distributed modified incremental GMM algorithm to enable MPs to
update the parameters of the joint PD in a distributed and incremental manner.
After that, we further propose a distributed derivation algorithm to make MPs
derive their conditional PD of WPFE from the joint one in a distributed way.
Combining the two original algorithms, we finally achieve the complete
distributed incremental update scheme, by which each MP can continually obtain
its latest conditional PD of its DWGs' WPFE via neighborhood communication and
local calculation with its own data. The effectiveness, correctness, and
efficiency of the proposed scheme are verified using the dataset from the NREL.

preforms with reinforcement through-the-thickness, making it possible to
combine good mechanical performance in-plane and out-of-plane. In this study,
the tufting technology is used to strength through-the-thickness of stacked
layers. This reinforcement technique has extensively gained attention in the
composite industry due to its ability to reinforce thick pieces. The present
study focuses on the mechanical behaviour of tufted preforms before resin
impregnation due to their application in the forming steps during the
manufacturing process. Therefore, an experimental investigation of the
mechanical behaviour (tensile, bending and in-plane shear) was carried out in
order to outline the influence of tufting on the mechanical properties of the
final structure.

  June 2019, Crete, Greece, Greece",,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the past earthquakes, different low ductile failure modes are observed
in the gravity design structures and thus, the most of existing damage indices
may fail to assess the damage of gravity design structures accurately in
referring to the two main performance levels: immediate occupancy and ultimate
limit state. Therefore, this study investigates the energy dissipated by the
brittle structures and the possible damage indices based on energy for the
damage assessment of gravity design frames. In the framework of an Energy-Based
Seismic Design Approach, we need the assessment of the Demand and on the
Capacity, both expressed in Energy. A methodology for the assessment of the
seismic energy demands imposed on structures is already proposed, but not such
methodology that makes consensus is proposed for the calculation of the Energy
dissipation Capacity avoiding the Hysteretic models. The estimation of the
energy expended by the building during an earthquake excitation is a tricky
issue. For this purpose, this study considers the wavelet based energy
estimation and compares it with different approaches for measuring the damages
of a structure: the dominant inelastic period of a building and the more
classical measure, the inter-story drift. IDA analysis are performed in energy,
drift and inelastic period. Furthermore, the damage assessment results based on
the expended energy for three gravity design buildings are compared and
discussed relatively to the results expressed in inelastic period and drift.
Finally, this study concludes that no significant effects of number of
inelastic cycles to the damage assessment results for low ductile structures.
However, this study also highlights the effects of number of inelastic cycles
to the damage for medium and high ductile structures.
