processing inequality (DPI), with respect to various divergences, e.g., quantum
$\chi^2_{\kappa}$divergences and quantum relative entropy. More specifically,
the data processing inequality states that the divergence between two arbitrary
quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ does not increase under the action of any
quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$. For a fixed channel $\mathcal{E}$ and a state
$\sigma$, the divergence between output states $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ and
$\mathcal{E}(\sigma)$ might be strictly smaller than the divergence between
input states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, which is characterized by the strong data
processing inequality (SDPI). Among various input states $\rho$, the largest
value of the rate of contraction is known as the SDPI constant. An important
and widely studied property for classical channels is that SDPI constants
tensorize. In this paper, we extend the tensorization property to the quantum
regime: we establish the tensorization of SDPIs for the quantum
$\chi^2_{\kappa_{1/2}}$ divergence for arbitrary quantum channels and also for
a family of $\chi^2_{\kappa}$ divergences (with $\kappa \ge \kappa_{1/2}$) for
arbitrary quantum-classical channels.

Our
goal is to investigate the interplay between the entropic and topological
influence on a phase transition. The former is manifest through the number of
invisible states $r$, while the latter is controlled by the network node-degree
distribution decay exponent $\lambda$. We show that the phase diagram, in this
case, is characterised by two marginal values $r_{c1}(\lambda)$ and
$r_{c2}(\lambda)$, which separate regions with different critical behaviours.
Below the $r_{c1}(\lambda)$ line the system undergoes only second order phase
transition; above the $r_{c2}(\lambda)$ - only a first order phase transition
occurs; and in-between the lines both of these phase transitions occur at
different temperatures. This behaviour differs from the one, observed on the
lattice, where the Ising model with invisible states is only characterised with
one marginal value $r_{c}\simeq 3.62$ separating the first and second order
regimes.

We detected 71 molecules (140 including different isotopologs), most of which
are present in the cold and quiescent ambient cloud. Of particular interest
among the detected molecules are the cis isomer of HCOOH, the complex organic
molecules HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH, a wide variety of carbon chains,
nitrogen oxides like N2O, and saturated molecules like CH3SH. In general,
fractional molecular abundances in L483 are systematically lower than in TMC-1
(especially for carbon chains), tend to be higher than in L1544 and B1-b, and
are similar to those in L1527. Apart from the overabundance of carbon chains in
TMC-1, we find that L483 does not have a marked chemical differentiation with
respect to starless/prestellar cores like TMC-1 and L1544, although it does
chemically differentiate from Class 0 hot corino sources like IRAS 16293-2422.
This fact suggests that the chemical composition of the ambient cloud of some
Class 0 sources could be largely inherited from the dark cloud
starless/prestellar phase. We also derived isotopic ratios for a variety of
molecules, some of which show isotopic anomalies like an extreme depletion in
13C for one of the two isotopologs of c-C3H2, a drastic enrichment in 18O for
SO and HNCO (SO being also largely enriched in 17O), and different abundances
for the two 13C substituted species of C2H and the two 15N substituted species
of N2H+. We report the first detection in space of some minor isotopologs like
c-C3D. The exhaustive chemical characterization of L483 presented here,
together with similar studies of other prestellar and protostellar sources,
should allow us to identify the main factors that regulate the chemical

using effective nuclear forces of finite-range. Special attention is paid to
the so-called dynamical method for locating the transition point, which, apart
from the stability of the uniform nuclear matter against clusterization, also
considers contributions due to finite-size effects. In particular,
contributions to the transition density and pressure from the direct and
exchange energies are carefully analyzed. To this end, finite-range forces of
Gogny, Modified Gogny Interaction (MDI) and Simple Effective Interaction (SEI)
types are used in the numerical applications. The results from the dynamical
approach are compared with those from the popular thermodynamical method that
neglects the surface and Coulomb effects in the stability condition. The
dependence of the core-crust transition on the stiffness of the symmetry energy
of the finite-range models is also addressed. Finally, we analyze the impact of
the transition point on the mass, thickness and fraction of the moment of
inertia of the neutron star crust. Prominent differences in these crustal
properties of the star are found between using the transition point obtained
with the dynamical method or the thermodynamical method. It is concluded that
the core-crust transition needs to be ascertained as precisely as possible in
order to have realistic estimates of the observed phenomena where the crust
plays a significant role.

spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black holes (BHs) in the
Horndeski theory. Spontaneous scalarization of BHs is a phenomenon that the
scalar field spontaneously obtains a nontrivial profile in the vicinity of the
event horizon via the nonminimal couplings and eventually the BH possesses a
scalar charge. In the theory in which spontaneous scalarization takes place,
the Schwarzschild solution with a trivial profile of the scalar field exhibits
a tachyonic instability in the vicinity of the event horizon, and evolves into
a hairy BH solution. Our analysis will extend the previous studies about the
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theory to other classes of the Horndeski
theory. First, we clarify the conditions for the existence of the vanishing
scalar field solution $\phi=0$ on top of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and we
apply them to each individual generalized galileon coupling. For each coupling,
we choose the coupling function with minimal power of $\phi$ and
$X:=-(1/2)g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$ that satisfies the above
condition, which leaves nonzero and finite imprints in the radial perturbation
of the scalar field. Second, we investigate the radial perturbation of the
scalar field about the $\phi=0$ solution on top of the Schwarzschild spacetime.
While each individual generalized galileon coupling except for a generalized
quartic coupling does not satisfy the hyperbolicity condition or realize a
tachyonic instability of the Schwarzschild spacetime by itself, a generalized
quartic coupling can realize it in the intermediate length scales outside the
event horizon. Finally, we investigate a model with generalized quartic and
quintic galileon couplings, which includes the Einstein-scalar-GB theory as the
special case.

in how they configure their in-ground optical fiber into an IP network. This
greater control has been made possible by (i) the maturation of software

technology. Whereas traditionally, at network design time, each IP link was
assigned a fixed optical path and bandwidth, modern colorless and directionless
Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (CD ROADMs) allow a remote SDN
controller to remap the IP topology to the optical underlay on the fly.
Consequently, ISPs face new opportunities and challenges in the design and
operation of their backbone networks.
  Specifically, ISPs must determine how best to design their networks to take
advantage of the new capabilities; they need an automated way to generate the
least expensive network design that still delivers all offered traffic, even in
the presence of equipment failures. This problem is difficult because of the
physical constraints governing the placement of optical regenerators, a piece
of optical equipment necessary for maintaining an optical signal over long
stretches of fiber. As a solution, we present an integer linear program (ILP)
which (1) solves the equipment-placement network design problem; (2) determines
the optimal mapping of IP links to the optical infrastructure for any given
failure scenario; and (3) determines how best to route the offered traffic over
the IP topology. To scale to larger networks, we also describe an efficient
heuristic that finds nearly optimal network designs in a fraction of the time.
Further, in our experiments our ILP offers cost savings of up to 29% compared

We have implemented GoT in a framework called Spacetime, written in Python.
  In its purest form, GoT is impractical for real systems, because of the
unbounded growth of the version graph and because passing diff'ed histories
over the network makes remote communication too slow. We present our solution

all elements of the physical word ranging from individual objects to complex

explore in this paper the possibility to recover superquadrics from range

using contemporary deep-learning models, more specifically, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). We pose the superquadric recovery problem as a
regression task and develop a CNN regressor that is able to estimate the
parameters of a superquadric model from a given range image. We train the
regressor on a large set of synthetic range images, each containing a single

Shakeout. Instead of randomly discarding units as Dropout does at the training
stage, Shakeout randomly chooses to enhance or reverse each unit's contribution
to the next layer. This minor modification of Dropout has the statistical
trait: the regularizer induced by Shakeout adaptively combines $L_0$, $L_1$ and
$L_2$ regularization terms. Our classification experiments with representative
deep architectures on image datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that
Shakeout deals with over-fitting effectively and outperforms Dropout. We
empirically demonstrate that Shakeout leads to sparser weights under both
unsupervised and supervised settings. Shakeout also leads to the grouping
effect of the input units in a layer. Considering the weights in reflecting the
importance of connections, Shakeout is superior to Dropout, which is valuable
for the deep model compression. Moreover, we demonstrate that Shakeout can
effectively reduce the instability of the training process of the deep
architecture.

theory at short distances becomes conformal. Weyl conformal geometry also has a
built-in geometric Stueckelberg mechanism: it is broken spontaneously to
Riemannian geometry after a Weyl gauge transformation (of ""gauge fixing"") while
Stueckelberg mechanism re-arranges the degrees of freedom, conserving their
number ($n_{df}$). The Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$) of local scale
transformations acquires a mass after absorbing a compensator (dilaton),
decouples, and Weyl connection becomes Riemannian. Mass generation has thus a
dynamic origin, as a transition from Weyl to Riemannian geometry. We show that
a ""gauge fixing"" symmetry transformation of the original Weyl quadratic gravity
action in its Weyl geometry formulation immediately gives the Einstein-Proca
action for the Weyl gauge field and a positive cosmological constant, plus
matter action (if present). As a result, the Planck scale is an {\it emergent}
scale, where Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein action is
the broken phase of Weyl action. This is in contrast to local scale invariant
models (no gauging) where a negative kinetic term (ghost dilaton) remains
present and $n_{df}$ is not conserved when this symmetry is broken. The mass of
$\omega_\mu$, setting the non-metricity scale, can be much smaller than
$M_\text{Planck}$, for ultraweak values of the coupling ($q$). If matter is
present, a positive contribution to the Planck scale from a scalar field
($\phi_1$) vev induces a negative (mass)$^2$ term for $\phi_1$ and spontaneous
breaking of the symmetry under which it is charged. These results are immediate
when using a Weyl geometry formulation of an action instead of its Riemannian
picture. Briefly, Weyl gauge symmetry is physically relevant and its role in
high scale physics should be reconsidered.

short blocklengths and requires long blocklengths to achieve high shaping gain,
which makes its implementation very challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use enumerative sphere shaping (ESS) and investigate its performance for the
nonlinear fiber optical channel. ESS has lower rate loss than CCDM at the same
shaping rate, which makes it a suitable candidate to be implemented in
real-time high-speed optical systems. In this paper, we first show that finite
blocklength ESS and CCDM exhibit higher effective signal-to-noise ratio than
their infinite blocklength counterparts. These results show that for the
nonlinear fiber optical channel, large blocklengths should be avoided. We then
show that for a 400 Gb/s dual-polarization 64-QAM WDM transmission system, ESS
with short blocklengths outperforms both uniform signaling and CCDM. Gains in

delegates log auditing to the Blockchain, and has the advantages in reducing

modern scenarios with mobile and web clients.
  The ContractChecker collects the logs from both clients and the cloud server,
and verifies the consistency by cross-checking the logs. By this means, it does
not only detects the attacks from malicious clients and server forging their
logs, but also is able to mitigate those attacks and recover the system from

of ContractChecker protocols against the proposed new attacks.
  For evaluating the cost, we build a functional prototype of the

establish a General Pair Weighting (GPW) framework, which casts the sampling
problem of deep metric learning into a unified view of pair weighting through
gradient analysis, providing a powerful tool for understanding recent
pair-based loss functions; (2) we show that with GPW, various existing

multi-similarity loss (MS loss) under the GPW, which is implemented in two
iterative steps (i.e., mining and weighting). This allows it to fully consider
three similarities for pair weighting, providing a more principled approach for
collecting and weighting informative pairs. Finally, the proposed MS loss
obtains new state-of-the-art performance on four image retrieval benchmarks,

generally, CRRA investors) and the brokers who lend them cash for leveraged
bets on a high Sharpe asset (i.e. the market portfolio). Rather than, say, the
broker posting a monopoly price for margin loans, the gambler agrees to use a
greater quantity of margin debt than he otherwise would in exchange for an
interest rate that is lower than the broker would otherwise post. The gambler
thereby attains a higher asymptotic capital growth rate and the broker enjoys a
greater rate of intermediation profit than would obtain under non-cooperation.
If the threat point represents a vicious breakdown of negotiations (resulting
in zero margin loans), then we get an elegant rule of thumb:
$r_L^*=(3/4)r+(1/4)(\nu-\sigma^2/2)$, where $r$ is the broker's cost of funds,
$\nu$ is the compound-annual growth rate of the market index, and $\sigma$ is
the annual volatility. We show that, regardless of the particular threat point,
the gambler will negotiate to size his bets as if he himself could borrow at

changing in-plane lattice parameters, through helium ion irradiation. Upon
increase of the ion fluence, we observe a MIT with a crossover from metallic to

measurements in SVO at low temperatures reveals that the observed MIT is mainly
ascribed to electron-electron interactions rather than disorder-induced

density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT)
calculations, further confirming the decrease of the bandwidth and the enhanced
electron-electron interactions resulting from the expansion of out-of-plane

to describe activities that conform to usual events while the irregular events
which do not conform to the normal are referred to as abnormal. It is far more
common to observe normal data than to obtain abnormal data in visual
surveillance. In this paper, we propose an approach where we can obtain
abnormal data by transforming normal data. This is a challenging task that is
solved through a multi-stage pipeline approach. We utilize a number of
techniques from unsupervised segmentation in order to synthesize new samples of
data that are transformed from an existing set of normal examples. Further,
this synthesis approach has useful applications as a data augmentation
technique. An incrementally trained Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN)
is used to carefully select the set of abnormal samples that can be added.
Finally through this synthesis approach we obtain a comparable set of abnormal
samples that can be used for training the CNN for the classification of normal
vs abnormal samples. We show that this method generalizes to multiple settings
by evaluating it on two real world datasets and achieves improved performance
over other probabilistic techniques that have been used in the past for this
task.

this conception is counterproductive, because it gives incorrect ideas about
the structure of the vortex tangle as a set of bundles containing parallel
lines. The only type of dynamics of vortex filaments inside these bundles is
possible, namely, Kelvin waves running along the filaments. At the same time,
as shown in numerous numerical simulations, a vortex tangle consists of a set
of entangled vortex loops of different sizes and having a random walk
structure. These loops are subject to large deformations (due to highly
nonlinear dynamics), they reconnect with each other and with the wall, split
and merge, creating a lot of daughter loops. They also bear Kelvin waves on
them, but the latter have little impact.

information transmitted from an extracellular input to a cellular response.
However, recent studies have demonstrated that the decrease in the transmitted
information with respect to extracellular input fluctuations (extrinsic noise)
is smaller when the intrinsic noise is larger. Therefore, it has been suggested
that robustness against extrinsic noise increases with the level of the
intrinsic noise. We call this phenomenon intrinsic noise-induced robustness
(INIR). As previous studies on this phenomenon have focused on complex
biochemical reactions, the relation between INIR and the input--output of a
system is unclear. Moreover, the mechanism of INIR remains elusive. In this
paper, we address these questions by analyzing simple models. We first analyze
a model in which the input--output relation is linear. We show that the
robustness against extrinsic noise increases with the intrinsic noise,
confirming the INIR phenomenon. Moreover, the robustness against the extrinsic
noise is more strongly dependent on the intrinsic noise when the variance of
the intrinsic noise is larger than that of the input distribution. Next, we
analyze a threshold model in which the output depends on whether the input
exceeds the threshold. When the threshold is equal to the mean of the input,
INIR is realized, but when the threshold is much larger than the mean, the
threshold model exhibits stochastic resonance, and INIR is not always apparent.
The robustness against extrinsic noise and the transmitted information can be
traded off against one another in the linear model and the threshold model
without stochastic resonance, whereas they can be simultaneously increased in
the threshold model with stochastic resonance.

of anomaly detection and signature-based methods. An IDS gathers observations,
analyzes behavioral patterns, and reports suspicious events for further
investigation. A notorious issue anomaly detection systems (ADSs) and IDSs face
is the possibility of high false alarms, which even state-of-the-art systems
have not overcome. This is especially a problem with large and complex systems.
The number of non-critical alarms can easily overwhelm administrators and
increase the likelihood of ignoring future alerts. Mitigation strategies thus
aim to avoid raising `too many' false alarms without missing potentially
dangerous situations. There are two major categories of false alarm-mitigation
strategies: (1) methods that are customized to enhance the quality of anomaly
scoring; (2) approaches acting as filtering methods in contexts that aim to
decrease false alarm rates. These methods have been widely utilized by many
scholars. Herein, we review and compare the existing techniques for false alarm
mitigation in ADSs. We also examine the use of promising techniques in
signature-based IDS and other relevant contexts, such as commercial security
information and event management tools, which are promising for ADSs. We
conclude by highlighting promising directions for future research.

time-frequency bins containing the direct propagation of the speech. The
influence of the transient noise, which severely contaminates the onset test,
is mitigated by a proper transient noise determination scheme. Then for voice
features, a two-stage procedure is designed based on the extracted bins and an
effective dereverberation method, with robust but possibly biased estimation
from middle frequency bins followed by further refinement in higher frequency
bins. The proposed method effectively alleviates the estimation bias caused by
the linear arrangement of microphones, and has stable performance under noisy

we study Andreev reflection in graphene-superconductor junction, where graphene
has two nonequal Dirac Cones split in energy and therefore time reversal
symmetry is broken. Due to the anti-chiral edge states of the current graphene
model, an incident electron travelling along the edges makes distinct
contribution to Andreev reflections. In a two-terminal device, because Andreev
retro-reflection is not allowed for just the anti-chiral edges, in this case
the mutual scattering between edge and bulk states is necessary, which leads
that the coefficient of Andreev retro-reflection is always symmetrical about
the incident energy. In a four-terminal junction, however, the edges are
parallel to the interface of superconductor and graphene, so at the interface
an incident electron travelling along the edges can be retro-reflected as a
hole into bulk modes, or specularly reflected as a hole into anti-chiral edge
states again. It is noted that, the coefficient of specular Andreev reflection
keeps symmetric as to the incident energy of electron which is consistent with
the reported results before, however the coefficient of Andreev
retro-reflection shows an unexpected asymmetrical behavior due to the presence
of anti-chiral edge states. Our results present some new ideas to study the
anti-chiral edge modes and Andreev reflection for a graphene model with the

important? Often this question is answered using structural properties such as
high connectedness or centrality in the network. However, static structural
connectedness does not necessarily translate to dynamical importance. To
demonstrate this, we simulate the kinetic Ising spin model on generated
networks and one real-world weighted network. The dynamic impact of nodes is
assessed by causally intervening on node state probabilities and measuring the
effect on the systemic dynamics. The results show that structural features such
as network centrality or connectedness are actually poor predictors of the
dynamical impact of a node on the rest of the network. A solution is offered in
the form of an information theoretical measure named integrated mutual
information. The metric is able to accurately predict the dynamically most
important node ('driver' node) in networks based on observational data of
non-intervened dynamics. We conclude that the driver node(s) in networks are
not necessarily the most well-connected or central nodes. Indeed, the common
assumption of network structural features being proportional to dynamical
importance is false. Consequently, great care should be taken when deriving
dynamical importance from network data alone. These results highlight the need
for novel inference methods that take both structure and dynamics into account.

even stable NS, which have been supported indirectly by observed X-ray plateau
of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) afterglow. Recently, Xue et al. (2019)
discovered a X-ray transient CDF-S XT2 that is powered by a magnetar from
merger of double NS via X-ray plateau and following stepper phase. However, the
decay slope after the plateau emission is a little bit larger than the
theoretical value of spin-down in electromagnetic (EM) dominated by losing its
rotation energy. In this paper, we assume that the feature of X-ray emission is
caused by a supra-massive magnetar central engine for surviving thousands of
seconds to collapse black hole. Within this scenario, we present the
comparisons of the X-ray plateau luminosity, break time, and the parameters of
magnetar between CDF-S XT2 and other short GRBs with internal plateau samples.
By adopting the collapse time to constrain the equation of state (EOS), we find
that three EOSs (GM1, DD2, and DDME2) are consistent with the observational
data. On the other hand, if the most released rotation energy of magnetar is
dominated by GW radiation, we also constrain the upper limit of ellipticity of
NS for given EOS, and it is range in $[0.32-1.3]\times 10^{-3}$. Its GW signal
can not be detected by aLIGO or even for more sensitive Einstein Telescope in

maintenance of cooperation is still an evolutionary riddle. In this context,
ecological life-history traits which affect the efficiency of selection may
play a role, though these are often ignored. We consider here species such as
bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and plants which exhibit resting stages in the
form of a quiescent state or a seedbank. When quiescent, individuals are
inactive and reproduce upon activation, while under seed bank parents produce
offspring remaining dormant for different amount of time. We assume weak
frequency-dependent selection modeled using game-theory and the prisoners
dilemma (cooperation/defect) as payoff matrix. The cooperators and defectors
are allowed to evolve different quiescence or dormancy times. By means of
singular perturbation theory we reduce the model to a one-dimensional equation
resembling the well known replicator equation, where the gain functions are
scaled with lumped parameters reflecting the time scale of the resting state of
the cooperators and defectors. If both time scales are identical cooperation
cannot persist in a homogeneous population. If, however, the time scale of the
cooperator is distinctively different from that of the defector, cooperation
may become a locally asymptotically stable strategy. Interestingly enough, in
the seedbank case the cooperator needs to be faster than the defector, while in
the quiescent case the cooperator has to be slower. We use adaptive dynamics to
identify situations where cooperation may evolve and form a convergent stable
ESS. We conclude by highlighting the relevance fo these results for many
non-model species and the maintenance of cooperation in microbial, invertebrate
or plant populations.

networks are used as controller parametrization since they can handle nonlinear

length. Network parametrizations are sampled at each sampling time and then
held constant throughout the prediction horizon. Controls still vary over the
prediction horizon due to varying feature vectors fed to the network.
Full-dimensional vehicles are modeled by polytopes. Under the assumption of
obstacle point data, and their extrapolation over a prediction horizon under
constant velocity assumption, collision avoidance reduces to linear inequality
checks. Steering and longitudinal acceleration controls are determined
simultaneously. The proposed method is designed for parallelization and
therefore well-suited to benefit from continuing advancements in hardware such

requiring alternating forward and reverse driving with maximal steering, and a

[4, 5]. Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer
electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice
potential [6-10]. The corresponding quasiparticle band structure, so-called
minibands, have remained elusive and no such features have been reported for
heterobilayers comprised of a TMD and another type of 2D material. Here, we
introduce a new X-ray capillary technology for performing micro-focused
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with a spatial
resolution on the order of 1 $\mu$m, enabling us to map the momentum-dependent
quasiparticle dispersion of heterobilayers consisting of graphene on WS$_2$ at
variable interlayer twist angles ($\theta$). Minibands are directly observed
for $\theta = 2.5^{\circ}$ in multiple mini Brillouin zones (mBZs), while they
are absent for a larger twist angle of $\theta = 26.3^{\circ}$. These findings
underline the possibility to control quantum states via the stacking
configuration in 2D heterostructures, opening multiple new avenues for

training a classifier? Even with very limited prior information? Active
learning, which can be regarded as an iterative optimization procedure, plays a
key role to construct a refined training set to improve the classification
performance in a variety of applications, such as text analysis, image
recognition, social network modeling, etc.
  Although combining representativeness and informativeness of samples has been
proven promising for active sampling, state-of-the-art methods perform well
under certain data structures. Then can we find a way to fuse the two active
sampling criteria without any assumption on data? This paper proposes a general
active learning framework that effectively fuses the two criteria. Inspired by
a two-sample discrepancy problem, triple measures are elaborately designed to
guarantee that the query samples not only possess the representativeness of the
unlabeled data but also reveal the diversity of the labeled data. Any
appropriate similarity measure can be employed to construct the triple
measures. Meanwhile, an uncertain measure is leveraged to generate the
informativeness criterion, which can be carried out in different ways.
  Rooted in this framework, a practical active learning algorithm is proposed,
which exploits a radial basis function together with the estimated
probabilities to construct the triple measures and a modified
Best-versus-Second-Best strategy to construct the uncertain measure,
respectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
algorithm consistently achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art
active learning algorithms.

our understanding of the solar atmosphere from small to large scales. The

  on Maximum Correntropy Criterion",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-label learning draws great interests in many real world applications.
It is a highly costly task to assign many labels by the oracle for one
instance. Meanwhile, it is also hard to build a good model without diagnosing
discriminative labels. Can we reduce the label costs and improve the ability to
train a good model for multi-label learning simultaneously?
  Active learning addresses the less training samples problem by querying the
most valuable samples to achieve a better performance with little costs. In
multi-label active learning, some researches have been done for querying the
relevant labels with less training samples or querying all labels without
diagnosing the discriminative information. They all cannot effectively handle
the outlier labels for the measurement of uncertainty. Since Maximum
Correntropy Criterion (MCC) provides a robust analysis for outliers in many
machine learning and data mining algorithms, in this paper, we derive a robust
multi-label active learning algorithm based on MCC by merging uncertainty and
representativeness, and propose an efficient alternating optimization method to
solve it. With MCC, our method can eliminate the influence of outlier labels
that are not discriminative to measure the uncertainty. To make further
improvement on the ability of information measurement, we merge uncertainty and
representativeness with the prediction labels of unknown data. It can not only
enhance the uncertainty but also improve the similarity measurement of
multi-label data with labels information. Experiments on benchmark multi-label
data sets have shown a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

behaviors is challenging and crucial for recommendation systems. Previous
methods employ sequential neural networks (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to
encode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden
representations for making recommendations. Although these methods achieve
satisfactory results, they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not
always practical. We argue that such left-to-right unidirectional architectures
restrict the power of the historical sequence representations. For this
purpose, we introduce a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
for sequential Recommendation (BERT4Rec). However, jointly conditioning on both
left and right context in deep bidirectional model would make the training
become trivial since each item can indirectly ""see the target item"". To address
this problem, we train the bidirectional model using the Cloze task, predicting
the masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and
right context. Comparing with predicting the next item at each position in a
sequence, the Cloze task can produce more samples to train a more powerful
bidirectional model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that
our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.

ecosystem, but micro-decisions of drivers and users need to be better
understood to assess the system-level impacts of TNCs. In this regard, we
contribute to the literature by estimating a) individuals' preferences of being
a rider, a driver, or a non-user of TNC services; b) preferences of ridehailing
users for ridepooling; c) TNC drivers' choice to switch to vehicles with better
fuel economy, and also d) the drivers' decision to buy, rent or lease new
vehicles with driving for TNCs being a major consideration. Elicitation of
drivers' preferences using a unique sample (N=11,902) of the U.S. population
residing in TNC-served areas is the key feature of this study. The statistical
analysis indicates that ridehailing services are mainly attracting personal
vehicle users as riders, without substantially affecting demand for transit.
Moreover, around 10% of ridehailing users reported postponing the purchase of a
new car due to the availability of TNC services. The model estimation results
indicate that the likelihood of being a TNC user increases with the increase in
age for someone younger than 44 years, but the pattern is reversed post 44
years. This change in direction of the marginal effect of age is insightful as
the previous studies have reported a negative association. We also find that
postgraduate drivers who live in metropolitan regions are more likely to switch
to fuel-efficient vehicles. These findings would inform transportation planners
and TNCs in developing policies to improve the fuel economy of the fleet.

conducted under one umbrella, whereas the admissions to the non-IIT Centrally
Funded Government Institutes (CFTIs) were conducted under a different umbrella,
the Central Seat Allocation Board.
  In 2015, a new Multi-Round Multi-Run Deferred Acceptance joint seat
allocation process was implemented, improving the efficiency and productivity
of concerned stakeholders. The process brings all CFTIs under one umbrella for
admissions: 100 institutes and approximately 39000 seats in 2018. In this
scheme, each candidate submits a single choice list over all available
programs, and receives no more than a single seat from the system, based on the
choices and the ranks in the relevant merit lists. Significantly, overbooking
of seats is forbidden.
  In this report, we provide details of our safe, fair and optimal algorithm.
Novel features include the ability to handle multiple merit lists, seat
guarantee across multiple rounds, implementing reservation, and de-reservation
rules, handling escalation of ranks due to a revision of marks by state boards
during the allocation process, and dealing with last minute de-recognition of
other backward caste categories. A notable rule required the allocation of
supernumerary seats to females, provided the program did not have a sufficient
desired percentage, while, at the same time, not reducing the number of seats
available to non-females.
  Looking forward, we posit first that it is inevitable that different colleges
will prefer different mechanisms of judging merit, and assigning relative rank.
We believe the ability of our algorithm to gracefully handle multiple merit
lists gives us hope to express optimism that all undergraduate admissions in
the country, beyond the CFTIs, can beneficially use the suggested scheme.

the front constraint, the diversity constraint, and the consistency loss to
enable effective single-view conditional generation and multi-view synthesis.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that our proposed approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3D reconstruction test error and
demonstrate its generalization ability on real world data.

of extreme mass-losing carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with
low gas-to-dust ratios that is not present in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
Typical gas-to-dust ratios are around $700$ for the extreme stars, but they can
be down to $\sim160$--$200$ and $\sim100$ for a few sources in the SMC and in
the LMC, respectively. The total dust production rate for the carbon star
population is $\sim 1.77\pm 0.45\times10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, for the

control the reflection/scattering characteristics of incident waves in a
deliberate manner to enhance the signal quality at the receiver, appears as a
promising candidate for future wireless communication systems. In this paper,
we bring the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the realm of index
modulation (IM) by proposing RIS-space shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial
modulation (RIS-SM) schemes. These two schemes are realized through not only
intelligent reflection of the incoming signals to improve the reception but
also utilization of the IM principle for the indices of multiple receive
antennas in a clever way to improve the spectral efficiency. Maximum
energy-based suboptimal (greedy) and exhaustive search-based optimal (maximum
likelihood) detectors of the proposed RIS-SSK/SM schemes are formulated and a
unified framework is presented for the derivation of their theoretical average
bit error probability. Extensive computer simulation results are provided to
assess the potential of RIS-assisted IM schemes as well as to verify our
theoretical derivations. Our findings also reveal that RIS-based IM, which
enables high data rates with remarkably low error rates, can become a potential
candidate for future wireless communication systems in the context of beyond
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions.

result in collisions, data loss, and energy dissipation. This paper proposes a
novel data reduction scheme, that exploits the spatial-temporal correlation

deployed sensor nodes. This strategy reduces the overall sampling/transmission
rates while preserving the quality of the data. Moreover, a back-end
reconstruction algorithm is deployed on the workstation (Sink). This algorithm
can reproduce the data that have not been sampled by finding the spatial and
temporal correlation among the reported data set, and filling the 'non-sampled'

deployed at the Grand-St-Bernard pass located between Switzerland and Italy. We
tested our approach using the previously mentioned data-set and compared it to
a recent adaptive sampling based data reduction approach. The obtained results
show that our proposed method consumes up to 60% less energy and can handle

objective has brought large improvements for many natural language processing

demonstrate that despite being trained on huge amounts of data, deep language
models still struggle to understand rare words. To fix this problem, we adapt
Attentive Mimicking, a method that was designed to explicitly learn embeddings
for rare words, to deep language models. In order to make this possible, we
introduce one-token approximation, a procedure that enables us to use Attentive
Mimicking even when the underlying language model uses subword-based
tokenization, i.e., it does not assign embeddings to all words. To evaluate our
method, we create a novel dataset that tests the ability of language models to
capture semantic properties of words without any task-specific fine-tuning.
Using this dataset, we show that adding our adapted version of Attentive
Mimicking to BERT does indeed substantially improve its understanding of rare
words.

and almost non-existent. Here, we consider a one-dimensional hyperbolic
interaction model, which we call as the Hyperbolic Calogero (HC) model. This is
classically integrable even in confining potentials (which have box-like
shapes). We present a first-order formulation of the HC model in an external
confining potential. Using the rich property of duality, we find multi-soliton
solutions of this confined integrable model. Absence of solitons correspond to
the equilibrium solution of the model. We demonstrate the dynamics of
multi-soliton solutions via brute-force numerical simulations. We studied the
physics of soliton collisions and quenches using numerical simulations. We have
examined the motion of dual complex variables and found an analytic expression
for the time period in a certain limit. We give the field theory description of
this model and find the background solution (absence of solitons) analytically
in the large-N limit. Analytical expressions of soliton solutions have been
obtained in the absence of external confining potential. Our work is of
importance to understand the general features of trapped interacting particles
that remain classically integrable and can be of relevance to the collective
behaviour of trapped cold atomic gases as well.

intelligent systems that detect the evolution of task performance, and take
control of individual speed precision strategies by providing effective
automatic performance feedback. At the earliest training stages, novices
frequently focus on getting faster at the task. This may, as shown here,
compromise the evolution of their precision scores, sometimes irreparably, if
it is not controlled for as early as possible. Artificial intelligence could
help make sure that a trainee reaches optimal individual speed accuracy
tradeoff by monitoring individual performance criteria, detecting critical
trends at any given moment in time, and alerting the trainee as early as
necessary when to slow down and focus on precision, or when to focus on getting
faster. It is suggested that, for effective benchmarking, individual training
statistics of novices are compared with the statistics of an expert surgeon.
The speed accuracy functions of novices trained in a large number of
experimental sessions reveal differences in individual speed versus precision
strategies, and clarify why such strategies should be automatically detected
and controlled for before further training on specific surgical task models, or
clinical models, may be envisaged. How expert benchmark statistics may be
exploited for automatic performance control is explained.

organization since the early conceptual efforts of the Gestalt school
(Wertheimer, Metzger, Koffka and others), the first quantitative measurements
testing for effects of symmetry on processes of Gestalt formation have seen the
day only recently. In this study, a psychophysical rating study and a
""foreground"" versus ""background"" choice response time experiment were run with
human observers to test for effects of bilateral symmetry on the perceived
strength of figure against ground in triangular Kanizsa configurations.
Displays with and without bilateral symmetry, identical physically specified to
total contour ratio and constant local contrast intensity within and across
conditions, but variable local contrast polarity and variable orientation in
the plane were presented in a random order to human observers. Configurations
with bilateral symmetry produced significantly stronger figure against ground
percepts reflected by greater subjective magnitudes and consistently higher
percentages of ""foreground"" judgments accompanied by significantly shorter
response times. These effects of symmetry depend neither on the orientation of
the axis of symmetry, nor on the contrast polarity of the physical inducers. It
is concluded that bilateral symmetry, irrespective of orientation,
significantly contributes to the, largely sign invariant, visual mechanisms of
shape segregation that determine the salience of figure against ground in
perceptually ambiguous image configurations.

transient sources from surveys obtained using the X-ray telescope aboard the

the Galactic Center. We calculated the ratio between the duty cycle we input in
our simulations and the one we measure after the simulations. We found that
fluctuations in outburst duration and recurrence times affect our estimation of
the duty cycle more than non detected outbursts. This biases our measures to
overestimate the simulated duty cycle of sources. Moreover, we determined that
compact surveys are necessary to detect outbursts with short duration because
they could fall in gaps between observations, if such gaps are longer than
their duration. On the other hand, long surveys are necessary to detect sources
with low duty cycle because the smallest duty cycle a survey can observe is
given by the ratio between the shortest outburst duration and the total length
of the survey. If one has a limited amount of observing time, these two effects
are competing, and a compromise is required which is set by the goals of the
proposed survey. We have also performed simulations with several artificial
survey strategies in order to evaluate the optimal observing campaign aimed at
detecting transients as well as at having the most accurate estimates of the

blue-shifted and red-shifted components, and then stack the spectra of each

recently established asymptotic methodology that leads to an explicit scalar

with classical approaches, the asymptotic model yields a significantly simpler

devoted to the effect of various junction conditions joining the beams to the

to provide significant and interesting features and, in particular, the choice
of junction conditions dramatically changes the distribution and sizes of stop

than compressional modes and the ability to model elastic surface waves using
the scalar wave equation (i.e. waves on a membrane), the paper provides new

is developed, which is simply a sparse HSI generated automatically from the
original HSI, but containing only the targets with the background is
suppressed. The detector is evaluated on real experiments, and the results of
which demonstrate its effectiveness for hyperspectral target detection
especially when the targets are well matched to the surroundings.

The previous version is the conference version",,"10.1007/s10618-011-0232-z",,"cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discovering patterns in a sequence is an important aspect of data mining. One
popular choice of such patterns are episodes, patterns in sequential data
describing events that often occur in the vicinity of each other. Episodes also
enforce in which order the events are allowed to occur.
  In this work we introduce a technique for discovering closed episodes.
Adopting existing approaches for discovering traditional patterns, such as
closed itemsets, to episodes is not straightforward. First of all, we cannot
define a unique closure based on frequency because an episode may have several
closed superepisodes. Moreover, to define a closedness concept for episodes we
need a subset relationship between episodes, which is not trivial to define.
  We approach these problems by introducing strict episodes. We argue that this
class is general enough, and at the same time we are able to define a natural
subset relationship within it and use it efficiently. In order to mine closed
episodes we define an auxiliary closure operator. We show that this closure
satisfies the needed properties so that we can use the existing framework for
mining closed patterns. Discovering the true closed episodes can be done as a
post-processing step. We combine these observations into an efficient mining
algorithm and demonstrate empirically its performance in practice.

coupled superfluid vortices in a disk with constant angular velocity. Each
vortex in the vortex lattice is quantized with vorticity one from the direct
inspection of their phases. As the angular velocity of the disk is greater than
a critical value, the first vortex will be excited as expected from theoretical
predictions. The subsequent two and more vortices are also generated by
increasingly rotating the disk, resulting in the remarkable step transitions
for the angular velocity to excite each individual vortex. When the vortex
number is large enough, the density of vortices is found to be linearly
proportional to the angular velocity, which matches the Feynman relation very
well.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next basket recommendation, which aims to predict the next a few items that a
user most probably purchases given his historical transactions, plays a vital
role in market basket analysis. From the viewpoint of item, an item could be
purchased by different users together with different items, for different
reasons. Therefore, an ideal recommender system should represent an item
considering its transaction contexts. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning
methods usually adopt the static item representations, which are invariant
among all of the transactions and thus cannot achieve the full potentials of
deep learning. Inspired by the pre-trained representations of BERT in natural
language processing, we propose to conduct context-aware item representation
for next basket recommendation, called Item Encoder Representations from
Transformers (IERT). In the offline phase, IERT pre-trains deep item
representations conditioning on their transaction contexts. In the online
recommendation phase, the pre-trained model is further fine-tuned with an
additional output layer. The output contextualized item embeddings are used to
capture users' sequential behaviors and general tastes to conduct
recommendation. Experimental results on the Ta-Feng data set show that IERT
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, which demonstrated the
effectiveness of IERT in next basket representation.

related tasks. More precisely, deep neural networks (DNNs) drastically
increased the performances of SLU systems, and numerous architectures have been
proposed. In the real-life context of theme identification of telephone
conversations, it is common to hold both a human, manual (TRS) and an
automatically transcribed (ASR) versions of the conversations. Nonetheless, and
due to production constraints, only the ASR transcripts are considered to build
automatic classifiers. TRS transcripts are only used to measure the
performances of ASR systems. Moreover, the recent performances in term of
classification accuracy, obtained by DNN related systems are close to the
performances reached by humans, and it becomes difficult to further increase
the performances by only considering the ASR transcripts. This paper proposes
to distillates the TRS knowledge available during the training phase within the
ASR representation, by using a new generative adversarial network called
M2H-GAN to generate a TRS-like version of an ASR document, to improve the theme
identification performances.
