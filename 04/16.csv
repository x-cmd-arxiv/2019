Sklar's theorem. This family is based on new copula-like densities on the
hypercube with non-uniform marginals which can be sampled efficiently, i.e.
with a complexity linear in the dimension of state space. Then, the proposed
variational densities that we suggest can be seen as arising from these
copula-like densities used as base distributions on the hypercube with Gaussian
quantile functions and sparse rotation matrices as normalizing flows. The
latter correspond to a rotation of the marginals with complexity $\mathcal{O}(d
\log d)$. We provide some empirical evidence that such a variational family can
also approximate non-Gaussian posteriors and can be beneficial compared to
Gaussian approximations. Our method performs largely comparably to
state-of-the-art variational approximations on standard regression and
classification benchmarks for Bayesian Neural Networks.

representations useful for a given task from raw input data. In terms of
overall performance metrics, machine learning solutions employing deep
representations frequently have been reported to greatly outperform those using
hand-crafted feature representations. At the same time, they may pick up on
aspects that are predominant in the data, yet not actually meaningful or
interpretable. In this paper, we therefore propose a systematic way to test the
trustworthiness of deep music representations, considering musical semantics.
The underlying assumption is that in case a deep representation is to be
trusted, distance consistency between known related points should be maintained
both in the input audio space and corresponding latent deep space. We generate
known related points through semantically meaningful transformations, both
considering imperceptible and graver transformations. Then, we examine within-
and between-space distance consistencies, both considering audio space and
latent embedded space, the latter either being a result of a conventional
feature extractor or a deep encoder. We illustrate how our method, as a
complement to task-specific performance, provides interpretable insight into
what a network may have captured from training data signals.

the beams of three antennas in an associated software tool (EIDOS) that can be

being incorporated, group properties of a NYMG changes, thus membership
probabilities change as well. A subset of stars show consistently large
membership probabilities regardless of the details of a chosen method for
ingesting additional members. Utilising these members, the NYMG models are
finalised. The finalised models are applied for evaluating memberships of all
claimed candidate members, resulting in a list of bona fide members. The mass

broader set of chemical environments exists on exoplanets, necessitating data
from a correspondingly broader set of chemical reactions. Similarly, the
conditions that exist in astrophysical environments are very different from
those traditionally probed in laboratory chemical kinetics studies. These are
areas where quantum mechanical theory, applied to important reactions via
well-validated chemical kinetics models, can fill a critical knowledge gap.
Quantum chemical calculations are also introduced to study interior of planets,
photochemical escape, and many critical chemical pathways (e.g. prebiotic
environments, contaminations, etc.) After years of development of the relevant
quantum chemical theories and significant advances in computational power,
quantum chemical simulations have currently matured enough to describe real
systems with an accuracy that competes with experiments. These approaches,
therefore, have become the best possible alternative in many circumstances
where performing experiments is too difficult, too expensive, or too dangerous,
or simply not possible. In this white paper, several existing quantum chemical
studies supporting exoplanetary science, planetary astronomy, and astrophysics
are described, and the potential positive impacts of improved models associated
with scientific goals of missions are addressed. In the end, a few
recommendations from the scientific community to strengthen related research

multiple groups of processes according to some total order, with each group
receiving the projection of the total order onto messages addressed to it. To
be scalable, atomic multicast needs to be genuine, meaning that only the
destination processes of a message should participate in ordering it. In this
paper we propose a novel genuine atomic multicast protocol that in the absence
of failures takes as low as 3 message delays to deliver a message when no other
messages are multicast concurrently to its destination groups, and 5 message
delays in the presence of concurrency. This improves the latencies of both the
fault-tolerant version of classical Skeen's multicast protocol (6 or 12 message
delays, depending on concurrency) and its recent improvement by Coelho et al.
(4 or 8 message delays). To achieve such low latencies, we depart from the
typical way of guaranteeing fault-tolerance by replicating each group with
Paxos. Instead, we weave Paxos and Skeen's protocol together into a single
coherent protocol, exploiting opportunities for white-box optimisations. We
experimentally demonstrate that the superior theoretical characteristics of our

adaptation to data set statistics through deep learning. This results in a
state-of-the-art surface normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and

measurement biases on cosmic shear power spectrum is through forward modelling

only affected by the mean of the multiplicative bias field over a survey and
the cross correlation between the additive bias field and the shear field. If
the mean multiplicative bias is zero then second order convolutive terms are
expected to be orders of magnitude smaller.

$G(n,\frac{1}{2})$ resulting in a graph $G\left(n,\frac{1}{2},k\right)$. The
goal is to recover the planted clique vertices by observing
$G\left(n,\frac{1}{2},k\right)$ . It is known that the clique can be recovered
as long as $k \geq \left(2+\epsilon\right)\log n $ for any $\epsilon>0$, but no
polynomial-time algorithm is known for this task unless $k=\Omega\left(\sqrt{n}

to understand this computational-statistical gap, we study the landscape of the
""sufficiently dense"" subgraphs of $G$ and their overlap with the planted
clique.
  Using the first moment method, we study the densest subgraph problems for
subgraphs with fixed, but arbitrary, overlap size with the planted clique, and
provide evidence of a phase transition for the presence of Overlap Gap Property
(OGP) at $k=\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$. OGP is a concept introduced
originally in spin glass theory and known to suggest algorithmic hardness when
it appears. We establish the presence of OGP when $k$ is a small positive power
of $n$ by using a conditional second moment method. As our main technical tool,
we establish the first, to the best of our knowledge, concentration results for
the $K$-densest subgraph problem for the Erdos-Renyi model

overparametrization, which is conceptually aligned with a large body of recent

originates from the unique band structure of magnetic WSMs and distinguishes
the spin-to-charge conversion effect in WSM/NM structures from that observed in
other systems, such as heterostructures involving heavy metals or topological

of solar radiation. Solar panel power production is primarily driven by the
amount of solar radiation and it is therefore important to have accurate
forecasts of solar radiation. Accurate forecasts that also give information on
the forecast uncertainties can help users of solar energy to make better solar
radiation based decisions related to the stability of the electrical grid. To
achieve this, we apply statistical post-processing techniques that determine
relationships between observations of global radiation (made within the KNMI
network of automatic weather stations in the Netherlands) and forecasts of
various meteorological variables from the numerical weather prediction (NWP)
model HARMONIE-AROME (HA) and the atmospheric composition model CAMS. Those
relationships are used to produce probabilistic forecasts of global radiation.
We compare 7 different statistical post-processing methods, consisting of two
parametric and five non-parametric methods. We find that all methods are able
to generate probabilistic forecasts that improve the raw global radiation
forecast from HA according to the root mean squared error (on the median) and
the potential economic value. Additionally, we show how important the
predictors are in the different regression methods. We also compare the
regression methods using various probabilistic scoring metrics, namely the
continuous ranked probability skill score, the Brier skill score and
reliability diagrams. We find that quantile regression and generalized random
forests generally perform best. In (near) clear sky conditions the
non-parametric methods have more skill than the parametric ones.

time-step restriction comes from a linear component, implicit-explicit (IMEX)
methods alleviate this restriction if the concern is linear stability. However,
where the SSP property is needed, IMEX SSP Runge-Kutta (SSP-IMEX) methods have
very restrictive time-steps. An alternative to SSP-IMEX schemes is to adopt an
integrating factor approach to handle the linear component exactly and step the
transformed problem forward using some time-evolution method. The strong
stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods were previously
established, where it was shown that it is possible to define explicit
integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods that preserve strong stability
properties satisfied by each of the two components when coupled with forward
Euler time-stepping. It was proved that the solution will be SSP if the
transformed problem is stepped forward with an explicit SSP Runge-Kutta method
that has non-decreasing abscissas. However, explicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods
have an order barrier of p=4, and sometimes higher order is desired. In this
work we consider explicit SSP two-step Runge--Kutta integrating factor methods
to raise the order. We show that strong stability is ensured if the two-step
Runge-Kutta method used to evolve the transformed problem is SSP and has
non-decreasing abscissas. We find such methods up to eighth order and present
their SSP coefficients. Adding a step allows us to break the fourth order
barrier on explicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods; furthermore, our explicit SSP
two-step Runge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing abscissas typically have
larger SSP coefficients than the corresponding one-step methods.

neutrinos coming from the source with other particles, e.g. intergalactic

detector may transform the original wave packet in pointer states. This
phenomenon, known as decoherence, becomes important in the reconstruction of
processes at the source. In this work we study neutrino emission in short GRBs
by adopting the Fireshell Model. We consider $e^{-}e^{+}$-pair annihilation as
the main channel for neutrino production. We compare the properties of the
neutrino-flux with the characteristic photon-signal produced once the
transparency condition is reached. We study the effects of flavor-oscillations
and decoherence as neutrinos travel from the region near the black-hole (BH)
event-horizon outwards. We consider the source to be in thermal equilibrium,
and calculate energy distribution functions for electrons and neutrinos. To
compute the effects of decoherence we use a Gaussian model. In this scenario
the emitted electron-neutrinos transform into pointer states consisting of
$67.8\%$ electron-neutrinos and $32.2\%$ as a combination of mu and tau

paramagnetic limiting. For the interpretation of these data, we use a model of
a clean single-band superconductor with an open Fermi surface in the shape of a

reveal that the in-plane upper critical field is Pauli paramagnetic limited,

this particular combination is the unusual inversion of the anisotropy,

was possible to observe that segregation between white and Hispanic citizens,

changed density of population during these twenty years, and, particularly, by
analyzing white and black people's segregation, our analysis reveals that a

inspiration from locusts, which can fly in dense swarms for hundreds of miles
without collision. In the locust's brain, a visual pathway of LGMD-DCMD (lobula

for UAV indoor navigation. Compared to previous works, we divided the UAV's
field of view into four subfields each handled by an LGMD neuron. Therefore,
four individual competitive LGMDs (C-LGMD) compete for guiding the directional
collision avoidance of UAV. With more degrees of freedom compared to ground

works have shown the feasibility of collapsing the cascade into a single,
direct model that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on a corpus of

or the direct model is stronger, and have only been conducted under the
unrealistic assumption that both are trained on equal amounts of data, ignoring
other available speech recognition and machine translation corpora.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that direct speech translation models require
more data to perform well than cascaded models, and while they allow including
auxiliary data through multi-task training, they are poor at exploiting such

end-to-end trainable models with two attention mechanisms, the first
establishing source speech to source text alignments, the second modeling
source to target text alignment. We show that such models naturally decompose

publicly available data from the second observing run of advanced LIGO and
advanced Virgo (O2). The mergers were discovered using the new search pipeline
described in Venumadhav et al. [Phys. Rev. D 100, 023011 (2019)], and are above
the detection thresholds as defined in Abbott et al. (LIGO Scientific and Virgo
Collaborations) [Phys. Rev. X 9, 031040 (2019).] Three of the mergers
(GW170121, GW170304, GW170727) have inferred probabilities of being of
astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} > 0.98$. The remaining three (GW170425,
GW170202, GW170403) are less certain, with $p_{\rm astro}$ ranging from 0.5 to
0.8. The newly found mergers largely share the statistical properties of
previously reported events, with the exception of GW170403, the least secure
event, which has a highly negative effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$ .
The most secure new event, GW170121 ($p_{\rm astro} > 0.99$), is also notable
due to its inferred negative value of $\chi_{\rm eff}$, which is inconsistent
with being positive at the ~95.8% confidence level. The new mergers nearly
double the sample of gravitational wave events reported from O2, and present a
substantial opportunity to explore the statistics of the binary black hole
population in the Universe. The number of detected events is not surprising
since we estimate that the detection volume of our pipeline may be larger than
that of other pipelines by as much as a factor of two (with significant
uncertainties in the estimate). The increase in volume is larger when the
constituent detectors of the network have very different sensitivities, as is
likely to be the case in current and future runs.

It is likely secondary,
i.e. produced by colliding solids. Here, we report ALMA Band 8 observations of
neutral carbon in the CO-rich debris disk around the 15--30 Myr old A-type star
HD 32297. We find that C$^0$ is located in a ring at $\sim$110 au with a FWHM
of $\sim$80 au, and has a mass of $(3.5\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$.
Naively, such a surprisingly small mass can be accumulated from CO
photo-dissociation in a time as short as $\sim$10$^4$ yr. We develop a simple
model for gas production and destruction in this system, properly accounting
for CO self-shielding and shielding by neutral carbon, and introducing a
removal mechanism for carbon gas. We find that the most likely scenario to
explain both C$^0$ and CO observations, is one where the carbon gas is rapidly
removed on a timescale of order a thousand years and the system maintains a
very high CO production rate of $\sim$15 M$_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$, much higher
than the rate of dust grind-down. We propose a possible scenario to meet these
peculiar conditions: the capture of carbon onto dust grains, followed by rapid
CO re-formation and re-release. In steady state, CO would continuously be
recycled, producing a CO-rich gas ring that shows no appreciable spreading over
time. This picture might be extended to explain other gas-rich debris disks.

descriptive complexity of the graph. While originally derived from a
combinatorial graph isomorphism test called the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, the
WL dimension can also be characterised in terms of the number of variables that
is required to describe the graph up to isomorphism in first-order logic with
counting quantifiers.
  It is known that the WL dimension is upper-bounded for all graphs that
exclude some fixed graph as a minor (Grohe, JACM 2012). However, the bounds
that can be derived from this general result are astronomic. Only recently, it
was proved that the WL dimension of planar graphs is at most 3 (Kiefer,
Ponomarenko, and Schweitzer, LICS 2017).
  In this paper, we prove that the WL dimension of graphs embeddable in a
surface of Euler genus $g$ is at most $4g+3$. For the WL dimension of graphs
embeddable in an orientable surface of Euler genus $g$, our approach yields an
upper bound of $2g+3$.

divergent. These expansions are to be understood as asymptotic expansions,
which encode the limiting behaviour of the path integral for positive small

to the divergent expansion. Still, the Borel sum might not encode the full
information of a function, because it misses exponentially small corrections.
In the present work, we consider a slight variation of the conventional Borel
summation, in which a generalised Borel transform (an inverse Laplace
transform) is followed by a directional Laplace transform. These new tools will
allow us to give perhaps better answers to typical problems in Borel summation:
missing exponential corrections and ambiguities in the Borel summation. In
addition, we will define resurgence as a connection between the discontinuity
of a function and the coefficients of its asymptotic expansion. From this

LP-rounding problems, we introduce a generalization of the classical marriage
problem (CMP) that we call the Fractional Marriage Problem. We show that the
Fractional Marriage Problem is NP-Complete by reduction from Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT). We show that when we view the classical marriage problem
(a.k.a. bipartite matching) as a sub-class of SAT we get a new class of
polynomial-time satisfiable SAT instances that we call CMP-SAT, different from
the classically known polynomial-time satisfiable SAT instances 2-SAT, Horn-SAT
and XOR-SAT.
  We next turn to the problem of recognizing CMP-SAT instances, first using SAT
embeddings, and then using their embeddings within the universe of Fractional
Marriage Problems (FMPs). In the process we are led to another generalization
of the CMP that we call the Symmetric Marriage Problem, which is polynomial
time decidable and leads to a slight enlargement of the CMP-SAT class. We
develop a framework for simplifying FMP problems to identify CMP instances that
we call Fragment Logic. Finally we give a result that sheds light on how
expressive the FMP need be to still be NP-Complete. The result gives a second
NP-Complete reduction of the FMP, this time to Tripartite Matching. We conclude
with a wide assortment of suggested additional problems.

imposes major challenges for the task of visual tracking. In contrast to most
other vision problems, tracking requires the learning of a robust
target-specific appearance model online, during the inference stage. To be
end-to-end trainable, the online learning of the target model thus needs to be
embedded in the tracking architecture itself. Due to the imposed challenges,
the popular Siamese paradigm simply predicts a target feature template, while
ignoring the background appearance information during inference. Consequently,
the predicted model possesses limited target-background discriminability.
  We develop an end-to-end tracking architecture, capable of fully exploiting
both target and background appearance information for target model prediction.
Our architecture is derived from a discriminative learning loss by designing a
dedicated optimization process that is capable of predicting a powerful model
in only a few iterations. Furthermore, our approach is able to learn key
aspects of the discriminative loss itself. The proposed tracker sets a new
state-of-the-art on 6 tracking benchmarks, achieving an EAO score of 0.440 on

Region Observations (BISTRO) survey at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We
find a trend of decreasing polarization fraction as a function of total
intensity, which we link to depolarization effects towards higher density
regions of the cloud. We then use the polarization data at 850 $\mu$m to infer
the plane-of-sky orientation of the large-scale magnetic field in Barnard 1.
This magnetic field runs North-South across most of the cloud, with the
exception of B1-c where it turns more East-West. From the dispersion of
polarization angles, we calculate a turbulence correlation length of $5.0 \pm
2.5$ arcsec ($1500$ au), and a turbulent-to-total magnetic energy ratio of $0.5
\pm 0.3$ inside the cloud. We combine this turbulent-to-total magnetic energy
ratio with observations of NH$_3$ molecular lines from the Green Bank Ammonia
Survey (GAS) to estimate the strength of the plane-of-sky component of the
magnetic field through the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. With a
plane-of-sky amplitude of $120 \pm 60$ $\mu$G and a criticality criterion
$\lambda_c = 3.0 \pm 1.5$, we find that Barnard 1 is a supercritical molecular
cloud with a magnetic field nearly dominated by its turbulent component.

to balance each other. Our study illustrates aspects of the universal unfolding

growing interest in using generative models to augment training data and
enhance the invariance to input changes. The generative pipelines in existing
methods, however, stay relatively separate from the discriminative re-id
learning stages. Accordingly, re-id models are often trained in a
straightforward manner on the generated data. In this paper, we seek to improve
learned re-id embeddings by better leveraging the generated data. To this end,
we propose a joint learning framework that couples re-id learning and data
generation end-to-end. Our model involves a generative module that separately
encodes each person into an appearance code and a structure code, and a
discriminative module that shares the appearance encoder with the generative
module. By switching the appearance or structure codes, the generative module
is able to generate high-quality cross-id composed images, which are online fed
back to the appearance encoder and used to improve the discriminative module.
The proposed joint learning framework renders significant improvement over the
baseline without using generated data, leading to the state-of-the-art
performance on several benchmark datasets.

reduce map uncertainty. Numerical analysis and experiments on an array of

toy-model is constructed to reproduce the development of the neutrino angular
distributions in the dense SN core in the absence of perturbations induced by
hydrodynamical instabilities. By iteratively solving the neutrino Boltzmann
equations including the collisional term, our model predicts that ELN crossings
can develop only in the proximity of the decoupling region and for a sharp
radial evolution of the baryon density, when the electron neutrino and
antineutrino number densities are comparable. Such conditions are likely to
occur only in the late SN stages. Interestingly, flavor instabilities induced

highly sensitive to any systematics in the measurement of the stellar
kinematics. For both distance measurements, we strongly advise to probe a large

systematic errors associated with the lens mass parameterisation.

understanding of the early Universe, and contrasting its upcoming observations
with predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model requires detailed theoretical
forecasts. Here, we exploit the large dynamic range of the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite, TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300, to derive multi-band galaxy
luminosity functions from $z=2$ to $z=10$. We put particular emphasis on the
exploration of different dust attenuation models to determine galaxy luminosity
functions for the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), and apparent wide NIRCam bands.
Our most detailed dust model is based on continuum Monte Carlo radiative
transfer calculations employing observationally calibrated dust properties.
This calibration results in constraints on the redshift evolution of the dust
attenuation normalisation and dust-to-metal ratios yielding a stronger redshift
evolution of the attenuation normalisation compared to most previous
theoretical studies. Overall we find good agreement between the rest-frame UV
luminosity functions and observational data for all redshifts, also beyond the
regimes used for the dust-model calibrations. Furthermore, we also recover the
observed high redshift ($z=4-6$) UV luminosity versus stellar mass relation,
the H$\alpha$ versus star formation rate relation, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity
function at $z=2$. The bright end ($M_{\rm UV}>-19.5$) cumulative galaxy number
densities are consistent with observational data. For the F200W NIRCam band, we
predict that JWST will detect $\sim 80$ ($\sim 200$) galaxies with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $10$ ($\sim 5$) within the NIRCam field of view,
$2.2\times2.2 \,{\rm arcmin}^{2}$, for a total exposure time of $10^5{\rm s}$
in the redshift range $z=8 \pm 0.5$. These numbers drop to $\sim 10$ ($\sim

the gravitational lensing formalism that we derived on a mathematical basis in
part IV of this series. We find that all degeneracies occur due to the
partition of the mass density along the line of sight. Usually, it is
partitioned into a background (cosmic) density and a foreground deflecting
object. The latter can be further partitioned into a main deflecting object and
perturbers. Weak deflecting objects along the line of sight are also added,
either to the deflecting object or as a correction of the angular diameter
distances, perturbing the cosmological background density. A priori, this is an
arbitrary choice of reference frame and partition. They can be redefined
without changing the lensing observables which are sensitive to the integrated
deflecting mass density along the entire line of sight. Reformulating the time
delay equation such that this interpretation of the degeneracies becomes easily
visible, we note that the source can be eliminated from this formulation, which
simplifies reconstructions of the deflecting mass distribution or the inference
of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Subsequently, we list necessary conditions to
break the formalism intrinsic degeneracies and discuss ways to break them by
model choices or including non-lensing observables like velocity dispersions
along the line of sight with their advantages and disadvantages. We conclude
with a systematic summary of all formalism intrinsic degeneracies and
possibilities to break them.

high efficiency of the prompt emission are long standing issues. One
possibility is strong collimation of a weakly magnetized relativistic jet by
the surrounding medium, which can considerably enhance the efficiency of the
photospheric emission. We derive a simple analytic criterion for the radiative
efficiency of a collimated jet showing that it depends most strongly on the
baryon loading. We confirm this analytic result by 3D numerical simulations,
and further find that mixing of jet and cocoon material at the collimation
throat leads to a substantial stratification of the outflow as well as sporadic
loading, even if the injected jet is uniform and continuous. One consequence of
this mixing is a strong angular dependence of the radiative efficiency. Another
is large differences in the Lorentz factor of different fluid elements that
lead to formation of internal shocks. Our analysis indicates that in both long
and short GRBs a prominent photospheric component cannot be avoided when
observed within an angle of a few degrees to the axis, unless the asymptotic
Lorentz factor is limited by baryon loading at the jet base to $\Gamma_\infty
<100$ (with a weak dependence on outflow power). Photon generation by newly
created pairs behind the collimation shock regulates the observed temperature
at $\sim 50~\theta_0^{-1}$ keV, where $\theta_0$ is the initial jet opening
angle, in remarkable agreement with the observed peak energies of prompt
emission spectra. Further consequences for the properties of the prompt
emission are discussed at the end.

with the energy-balance code CIGALE we calculate star formation rates, and
stellar masses for all our cluster members, and find the star formation rate
varies between 20-1600M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ over the entire 3Mpc radial range.
The central 0.5Mpc region itself has a total star formation rate of
800$\pm$200M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a star formation rate
density of (1.2$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{4}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$, which
is approximately five orders of magnitude greater than expected field values.
When comparing this cluster to those at lower redshifts we find that there is
an increase in star formation rate per unit volume towards the centre of the
cluster. This indicates that there is indeed a reversal in the star
formation/density relation in CLJ1449. Based on the radial star-formation rate
density profile, we see evidence for an elevation in the star formation rate
density, even out to radii of 3Mpc. At these radii the elevation could be an
order of magnitude greater than field values, but the exact number cannot be
determined due to ambiguity in the redshift associations. If this is the case
it would imply that this cluster is still accreting material which is possibly

inflationary models driven by a single scalar field with a standard type of
slowly varying potential function $V(\phi)$. Such potential functions generate
a nearly scale invariant spectrum and so they do not possess the requisite
suppression in power. In this paper we explore if canonical two-derivative
inflation models, with a step-like feature in the potential, can improve
agreement with data. We find that improvement can be made when one utilizes the
standard slow-roll approximation formula for the power spectrum. However, we
find that in order to have a feature in the power spectrum that is sufficiently
localized so as to not significantly disrupt higher $l$ or lower $l$, the
potential's step-like feature must be so sharp that the standard slow-roll
approximations break down. This leads us to perform an exact computation of the
power spectrum by solving for the Bunch-Davies mode functions numerically. We
find that the corresponding CMB multipoles do not provide a good agreement with

Simulated clusters must be carefully selected, a daunting task since most
properties are unknown. Alternatively, lookalikes produced in the proper large
scale environment can be used. Additionally, their statistical study give
access to the mean properties of the observed cluster including its most
probable history as well as its deviation from an average cluster. This paper
presents such a statistical study with 200 Virgo-like and 400+ cluster-size
random dark matter halos. Only 18%(0.5%) of these random halos comply within
3(2)-sigma with the mean values (radius, velocity dispersion, number of
substructures, spin, velocity, concentration, center of mass offset with
respect to the spherical center) of Virgo halos at z=0 and abide by a similar
merging history up to redshift 4. None are within 1-sigma because of
environmentally induced properties (number of substructures and velocity). For
further comparisons, random halos are selected to reproduce the mass
distribution of the lookalikes to cancel mass bias effects. Redshift 1 appears
then as a turning point: random to Virgo-like property ratios are alternatively
smaller/larger than 1. This highlights the importance of studying clusters

~80% of galaxies within 1000 km/s from DLAs and with impact parameters between
25 and 280 kpc. In particular, we discovered 5 high-confidence Lyman alpha
emitters associated with three DLAs, plus up to 9 additional detections across
five of the six fields. The majority of the detections are at relatively large
impact parameters (>50 kpc) with two detections being plausible host galaxies.
Among our detections, we report four galaxies associated with the most
metal-poor DLA in our sample (Z/Z_sun = -2.33), which trace an overdense
structure resembling a filament. By comparing our detections with predictions
from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)
cosmological simulations and a semi-analytic model designed to reproduce the
observed bias of DLAs at z>2, we conclude that our observations are consistent
with a scenario in which a significant fraction of DLAs trace the neutral
regions within halos with a characteristic mass of 10^11-10^12 M_sun, in
agreement with the inference made from the large-scale clustering of DLAs. We
finally show how larger surveys targeting ~25 absorbers have the potential of
constraining the characteristic masses of halos hosting high-redshift DLAs with
sufficient accuracy to discriminate between different models.

peaks ($\approx -19$ mag) separated by 100 days, and a subsequent slow decline
by 5 mag in 650 rest-frame days. The spectra are dominated by emission lines of
calcium and oxygen, with a width of only $3400$ km s$^{-1}$, superposed on a
strong blue continuum in the first year, and with a large ratio of $L_{\rm
[Ca\,II]}/L_{\rm [O\,I]}\approx 4$ at late times. There is no clear evidence
for hydrogen or helium associated with the SN at any phase. We model the light
curves with several potential energy sources: radioactive decay, central
engine, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. Regardless of the model,
the inferred progenitor mass near the end of its life (i.e., CO core mass) is
$\gtrsim 55$ M$_\odot$ and up to $120$ M$_\odot$, placing the event in the
regime of pulsational pair instability supernovae (PPISNe) or pair instability
supernovae (PISNe). The models of CSM interaction provide the most consistent
explanation for the light curves and spectra, and require a CSM mass of
$\approx 35$ M$_\odot$ ejected in the final decade before explosion. We further
find that SN 2016iet is located at an unusually large offset ($16.5$ kpc) from
its low metallicity dwarf host galaxy ($Z\approx 0.1$ Z$_\odot$, $M\approx
10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$), supporting the PPISN/PISN interpretation. In the final

a dim underlying galaxy host or an H II region. Despite the overall consistency
of the SN and its unusual environment with PPISNe and PISNe, we find that the

job sizes are stochastic. The goal is to find a fixed assignment of jobs to
machines, to minimize the expected value of the maximum load over all the
machines. For the identical machines special case when the size of a job is the
same across all machines, a constant-factor approximation algorithm has long
been known. Our main result is the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for the general case of unrelated machines. This is achieved by (i)
formulating a lower bound using an exponential-size linear program that is
efficiently computable, and (ii) rounding this linear program while satisfying
only a specific subset of the constraints that still suffice to bound the
expected makespan. We also consider two generalizations. The first is the
budgeted makespan minimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the
expected makespan subject to scheduling a target number (or reward) of jobs. We
extend our main result to obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for
this problem. The second problem involves $q$-norm objectives, where we want to
minimize the expected q-norm of the machine loads. Here we give an $O(q/\log

make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has
accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book
provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each
chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained,
teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further
developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.
  The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID
rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the
full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards
and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a
middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three
chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to
bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and
KL-divergence.
  The chapters on ""bandits with similarity information"", ""bandits with
knapsacks"" and ""bandits and agents"" can also be consumed as standalone surveys
on the respective topics.

properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Milky Way mass galaxies in
the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations. Very striking differences are
found. At z=0, gas column density and temperature profiles at large radii
($\sim 100$ kpc) correlate strongly with disk gas mass fraction in Illustris,
but not in TNG. The neutral gas at large radii is preferentially aligned in the
plane of the disk in TNG, whereas it is much more isotropic in Illustris. The
vertical coherence scale of the rotationally supported gas in the CGM is linked
to the gas mass fraction of the galaxy in Illustris, but not in TNG. A tracer
particle analysis allows us to show how these differences can be understood as
a consequence of the different sub-grid models of feedback in the two
simulations. A study of spatially matched galaxies in the two simulations shows
that in TNG, feedback by supernovae and AGN helps to create an extended smooth
reservoir of hot gas at high redshifts, that then cools to form a thin,
rotationally-supported disk at later times. In Illustris, AGN dump heat in the
form of hot gas bubbles that push diffuse material at large radii out of the
halo. The disk is formed by accretion of colder, recycled material, and this
results in more vertically extended gas distributions above and below the
Galactic plane. We conclude that variations in the structure of gas around
Milky Way mass galaxies are a sensitive probe of feedback physics in
simulations and are worthy of more observational consideration in future.

systems, often diverse species are simultaneously present and interact with
each other. Here, we derive a (time-dependent) particle-scale statistical
description, namely a dynamical density functional theory, for such
multi-species systems, extending existing works on one-component microswimmer
suspensions. In particular, our theory incorporates the effect of external
potentials, but also steric and hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers. For
the latter, a previously introduced force-dipole-based minimal (pusher or
puller) microswimmer model is used. As a limiting case of our theory, mixtures
of hydrodynamically interacting active and passive particles are captured as
well. After deriving the theory, we apply it to different planar swimmer
configurations. First, these are binary pusher--puller mixtures in external
traps. In the considered situations, we find that the majority species imposes
its behavior on the minority species. Second, for unconfined binary
pusher--puller mixtures, the linear stability of an orientationally disordered
state against the emergence of global polar orientational order (and thus
emergent collective motion) is tested analytically. Our statistical approach
predicts, qualitatively in line with previous particle-based computer
simulations, a threshold for the fraction of pullers and for their propulsion
strength that lets overall collective motion arise. Third, we let driven
passive colloidal particles form the boundaries of a shear cell, with confined
active microswimmers on their inside. Driving the passive particles then
effectively imposes shear flows, which persistently acts on the inside
microswimmers. Their resulting behavior reminds of the one of circle swimmers,
though with varying swimming radii.

measurements based on MgII2798, we find a wide range in black hole masses, from
M_BH=10^7.6 to 10^9.3 Msun. The Eddington ratios L_bol/L_Edd range from 0.16 to
1.1, but the majority of the HSC quasars are powered by M_BH=10^9 Msun
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting at sub-Eddington rates. The
Eddington ratio distribution of the HSC quasars is inclined to lower accretion
rates than those of Willott et al. (2010a), who measured the black hole masses
for similarly faint z=6 quasars. This suggests that the global Eddington ratio
distribution is wider than has previously been thought. The presence of
M_BH=10^9 Msun SMBHs at z=6 cannot be explained with constant sub-Eddington
accretion from stellar remnant seed black holes. Therefore, we may be
witnessing the first buildup of the most massive black holes in the first
billion years of the universe, the accretion activity of which is transforming
from active growth to a quiescent phase. Measurements of a larger complete
sample of z>6 low-luminosity quasars, as well as deeper observations with
future facilities will enable us to better understand the early SMBH growth in

individuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will
ultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Methods: A deep
learning method is developed and validated based on MRI scans of 2146 subjects
(803 for training and 1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression
to AD dementia in a time-to-event analysis setting. Results: The deep learning
time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia
with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.762 on 439 ADNI testing MCI subjects
with follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a
C-index of 0.781 on 40 AIBL testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from
18-54 months (quartiles: [18, 36,54]). The predicted progression risk also
clustered individual subjects into subgroups with significant differences in
their progression time to AD dementia (p<0.0002). Improved performance for
predicting progression to AD dementia (C-index=0.864) was obtained when the
deep learning based progression risk was combined with baseline clinical
measures. Conclusion: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means
for prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with
individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.

process in understanding some properties of the magnetically closed solar

importance of the numerical spatial resolution, footpoint heating timescales
and background heating on TNE. Inadequate transition region (TR) resolution can
lead to significant discrepancies in TNE cycle behaviour, with TNE being
suppressed in under-resolved loops. A convergence on the periodicity and plasma
properties associated with TNE required spatial resolutions of less than 2 km
for a loop of length 180 Mm. These numerical problems can be resolved using an
approximate method that models the TR as a discontinuity using a jump
condition, as proposed by Johnston et al. (2017a,b). The resolution
requirements (and so computational cost) are greatly reduced while retaining
good agreement with fully resolved results. Using this approximate method we
(i) identify different regimes for the response of coronal loops to
time-dependent footpoint heating including one where TNE does not arise and
(ii) demonstrate that TNE in a loop with footpoint heating is suppressed unless
the background heating is sufficiently small. The implications for the

programming language with a focus on path-dependent types $-$ types such as
$x.a_1\dots a_n.T$ that depend on the runtime value of a path $x.a_1\dots a_n$
to an object. Unfortunately, existing formulations of DOT can model only types
of the form $x.A$ which depend on variables rather than general paths. This
restriction makes it impossible to model nested module dependencies. Nesting
small components inside larger ones is a necessary ingredient of a modular,
scalable language. DOT's variable restriction thus undermines its ability to
fully formalize a variety of programming-language features including Scala's
module system, family polymorphism, and covariant specialization.
  This paper presents the pDOT calculus, which generalizes DOT to support types
that depend on paths of arbitrary length, as well as singleton types to track
path equality. We show that naive approaches to add paths to DOT make it
inherently unsound, and present necessary conditions for such a calculus to be
sound. We discuss the key changes necessary to adapt the techniques of the DOT
soundness proofs so that they can be applied to pDOT. Our paper comes with a
Coq-mechanized type-safety proof of pDOT. With support for paths of arbitrary
length, pDOT can realize DOT's full potential for formalizing Scala-like

weak-ferromagnetic (WFM) state at the Morin Transition temperature (T$_M$)
intrinsic to $\alpha$- Fe$_2$O$_3$. These samples, pressed and sintered in
identical conditions for the dielectric measurements, reveal moderate but clear
enhancement in the real part of the dielectric constant ($\epsilon'$) in the
WFM region. However, a relaxation-like behavior in the imaginary part of
$\epsilon''$ is observed only in nano plates or big cuboids. Further still,
this relaxation patten is observed only in lower frequency region, lasting upto
a few kHz and follows Arrhenius law within this limited range. The activation
energy deduced from the fitting is suggestive of polaronic conduction.
Temperature dependent Raman spectra reveal anomalies in all major phononic
modes and also in 2Eu mode in the vicinity of the Morin transition. A peak like
behavior in Raman Shifts, in conjuncture with anharmonic fitting reveals that
the nature of spin phonon coupling is different in pure AFM and WFM regions and

taking advantage of a key insight regarding the routing coefficients that link
capsules between adjacent network layers. Since the routing coefficients are
responsible for assigning object parts to wholes, and an object whole generally
contains similar intra-class and dissimilar inter-class parts, the routing
coefficients tend to form a unique signature for each object class. For fast
inference, a network is first trained in the usual manner using examples from
the training dataset. Afterward, the routing coefficients associated with the
training examples are accumulated offline and used to create a set of ""master""
routing coefficients. During inference, these master routing coefficients are
used in place of the dynamically calculated routing coefficients. Our method
effectively replaces the for-loop iterations in the dynamic routing procedure
with a single matrix multiply operation, providing a significant boost in
inference speed. Compared with the dynamic routing procedure, fast inference
decreases the test accuracy for the MNIST, Background MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and
Rotated MNIST datasets by less than 0.5% and by approximately 5% for CIFAR10.

spectropolarimetry began in the early 90's with the focus on observations in
the visible wavelength regions. Its extension to the infrared (IR) remains
largely unexplored. The IR iron lines around 15600\,$\rm{\AA}$, most commonly
known for their high magnetic sensitivity, also have a non-zero response to
line-of-sight velocity below $\log (\tau)=0.0$. In this paper we aim to tap
this potential to explore the possibility of using them to measure sub-surface
convective velocities. By assuming a snapshot of a three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulation to represent the quiet Sun, we investigate how
well the iron IR lines can reproduce the LOS velocity in the cube and up to
what depth. We use the recently developed spectropolarimetric inversion code
SNAPI and discuss the optimal node placements for the retrieval of reliable
results from these spectral lines. We find that the IR iron lines can measure
the convective velocities down to $\log (\tau)=0.5$, below the photosphere, not
only at original resolution of the cube but also when degraded with a
reasonable spectral and spatial PSF and stray light. Meanwhile, the commonly
used Fe~{\sc i} 6300\,\AA{} line pair performs significantly worse. Our
investigation reveals that the IR iron lines can probe the subsurface
convection in the solar photosphere. This paper is a first step towards
exploiting this diagnostic potential.

as posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform
periodically issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of

in some cases it could overcome Ostrogradsky's instabilities (with naturally
occurring piecewise Lagrangians). Our main conclusions regarding our MOND-like
proposal are: (i) it constitutes a possible recipe where Ostrogradsky
instabilities could be ""tamed""; (ii) it is a falsifiable approach in various
contexts and (iii) it might explain simultaneously some of the issues usual
modified gravity MOND and dark matter phenomenologies have difficulties
individually. These aspects seem relevant to start addressing practical ways to
differentiate modified gravity MOND from modified inertia and give insights

combined with theoretical calculations to reveal a preference for a particular
set of published spectroscopic values for the B$^2\Sigma^+$ state ($\Delta

waveforms across antennas allows flexibility in the transmit beampattern
design. In cognitive radar, a popular cost function is to minimize the
deviation against an idealized beampattern (which is arrived at with knowledge
of the environment). The optimization of the transmit beampattern becomes
particularly challenging in the presence of practical constraints on the
transmit waveform. One of the hardest of such constraints is the non-convex
constant modulus constraint, which has been the subject of much recent work. In
a departure from most existing approaches, we develop a solution that involves
direct optimization over the non-convex complex circle manifold. That is, we
derive a new projection, descent, and retraction (PDR) update strategy that
allows for monotonic cost function improvement while maintaining feasibility
over the complex circle manifold (constant modulus set). For quadratic cost
functions (as is the case with beampattern deviation), we provide analytical
guarantees of monotonic cost function improvement along with proof of
convergence to a local minima. We evaluate the proposed PDR algorithm against
other candidate MIMO beampattern design methods and show that PDR can
outperform competing wideband beampattern design methods while being
computationally less expensive. Finally, orthogonality across antennas is
incorporated in the PDR framework by adding a penalty term to the beampattern
cost function. Enabled by orthogonal waveforms, robustness to target direction
mismatch is also demonstrated.

representation model to detect grammatical errors. We propose a multi-head
multi-layer attention model that determines the appropriate layers in
Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT). The proposed
method achieved the best scores on three datasets for grammatical error
detection tasks, outperforming the current state-of-the-art method by 6.0
points on FCE, 8.2 points on CoNLL14, and 12.2 points on JFLEG in terms of
F_0.5. We also demonstrate that by using multi-head multi-layer attention, our
model can exploit a broader range of information for each token in a sentence
than a model that uses only the final layer's information.

identified as the two most promising counterparts, of these gravitational wave

existing optical search facilities have been dedicated to finding kilonovae,
factors such as dust obscuration and the daytime sky may thwart these searches
in a significant fraction of gavitational wave events. Radio-only searches,
being almost immune to these factors, are equally capable of finding the
counterparts and in fact offer a complementary discovery approach, despite the
modest fields of view for many of the present-day radio interferometers. Such
interferometers will be able to carry out competitive searches for the
electromagnetic counterparts through the galaxy targeting approach. Adapting
and improving on an existing algorithm by Rana et al. 2017. we present here a
method that optimizes the placement of radio antenna pointings, integration
time, and antenna slew. We simulate 3D gravitational wave localizations to find
the efficacy of our algorithm; with substantial improvements in slew overhead
and containment probability coverage, our algorithm performs significantly
better than simple galaxy-rank-ordered observations. We propose that telescopes
such as the Very Large Array, MeerKAT, Australia Telescope Compact Array and
the Gaint Meterwave Radio Telescope, having fields of view $\lesssim$1 deg$^2$

degrees or larger, will especially benefit from this optimized galaxy-targeting
approach for electromagnetic counterpart searches.

basic physical characteristic that plays a central role in determining the
planet's global circulation and energy redistribution. Moreover, recent studies
have also highlighted the importance of obliquities in sculpting not only the
physical features of exoplanets but also their orbital architectures. It is
therefore of key importance to identify and characterize the dominant processes
of excitation of non-zero axial tilts. Here we highlight a simple mechanism
that operates early on and is likely fundamental for many extrasolar planets
and perhaps even Solar System planets. While planets are still forming in the
protoplanetary disk, the gravitational potential of the disk induces nodal
recession of the orbits. The frequency of this recession decreases as the disk
dissipates, and when it crosses the frequency of a planet's spin axis
precession, large planetary obliquities may be excited through capture into a
secular spin-orbit resonance. We study the conditions for encountering this
resonance and calculate the resulting obliquity excitation over a wide range of
parameter space. Planets with semi-major axes in the range $0.3 \ \mathrm{AU}
\lesssim a \lesssim 2 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are the most readily affected, but
large-$a$ planets can also be impacted. We present a case study of Uranus and
Neptune and show that this mechanism likely cannot help explain their high
obliquities. While it could have played a role if finely tuned and envisioned
to operate in isolation, large-scale obliquity excitation was likely inhibited
by gravitational planet-planet perturbations.

to prevent a capacity-seeking sender (e.g. TCP) from keeping the buffer full.
An AQM can mark instead of dropping packets if they indicate support for
explicit congestion notification (ECN). Two modern AQMs (PIE and CoDel) are
designed to keep queuing delay to a target by dropping packets as load varies.
This memo uses Curvy RED and an idealised but sufficient model of TCP traffic
to explain why attempting to keep delay constant is a bad idea, because it
requires excessively high drop at high loads. This high drop itself takes over
from queuing delay as the dominant cause of delay, particularly for short
flows. At high load, a link is better able to preserve reasonable performance
if the delay target is softened into a curve rather than a hard cap. The
analysis proves that the same AQM can be deployed in different parts of a
network whatever the capacity with the same optimal configuration. A surprising
corollary of this analysis concerns cases with a highly aggregated number of
flows through a bottleneck. Although aggregation reduces queue variation, if
the target queuing delay of the AQM at that bottleneck is reduced to take
advantage of this aggregation, TCP will still increase the loss level because
of the reduction in round trip time. The way to resolve this dilemma is to
overprovision (a formula is provided). Nonetheless, for traffic with ECN
enabled, there is no harm in an AQM holding queuing delay constant or
configuring an AQM to take advantage of any reduced delay due to aggregation
without over-provisioning. Recently, the requirement of the ECN standard that
ECN must be treated the same as drop has been questioned. The insight that the
goals of an AQM for drop and for ECN should be different proves that this doubt
is justified.

a comprehensive library of star formation history shapes derived from

$\dot{m}$, and black hole mass, $M_{BH}$. We made use of theoretical insights,
results of numerical simulations, as well as UV and X-ray observations to
review the inner regions of AGN by including different accretion and ejection
modes, with special emphasis on the role of radiation in driving powerful
accretion disk winds from the inner regions around the central SMBH. We propose
five $\dot{m}$ regimes where the physics of the inner accretion and ejection
flow around SMBHs is expected to change, and that correspond observationally to
quiescent and inactive galaxies; low luminosity AGN (LLAGN); Seyferts and
mini-broad absorption line quasars (mini-BAL QSOs); narrow line Seyfert 1

super-Eddington sources. We include in this scenario radiation-driven disk
winds, which are strong in the high $\dot{m}$, large $M_{BH}$ regime, and
possibly present but likely weak in the moderate $\dot{m}$, small $M_{BH}$
regime. A great diversity of the accretion/ejection flows in AGN can be
explained to a good degree by varying just two fundamental properties: the
Eddington ratio $\dot{m}$ and the black hole mass $M_{BH}$, and by the
inclusion of accretion disk winds that can naturally be launched by the
radiation emitted from luminous accretion disks.

targets with luminosities of $(2.4 - 9.5) \times 10^8~L_\odot$, about one order
of magnitude smaller than optically luminous ($M_{\rm 1450} \lesssim -25$)

far show [CII]/FIR luminosity ratios similar to local star-forming galaxies.
Using the [CII]-based dynamical mass ($M_{\rm dyn}$) as a surrogate for bulge
stellar mass ($M_{\rm bulge}$), we find that a significant fraction of
low-luminosity quasars are located on or even below the local $M_{\rm BH} -
M_{\rm bulge}$ relation, particularly at the massive end of the galaxy mass
distribution. In contrast, previous studies of optically luminous quasars have
found that black holes are overmassive relative to the local relation. Given
the low luminosities of our targets, we are exploring the nature of the early
co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their hosts in a less biased way.
Almost all of the quasars presented in this work are growing their black hole
mass at much higher pace at $z \sim 6$ than the parallel growth model, in which
supermassive black holes and their hosts grow simultaneously to match the local
$M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relation at all redshifts. As the low-luminosity
quasars appear to realize the local co-evolutionary relation even at $z \sim
6$, they should have experienced vigorous starbursts prior to the currently
observed quasar phase to catch up with the relation.

metamorphic testing (MT) has been used to test such programs. In MT,
metamorphic relations (MRs) are developed from intrinsic characteristics of the

robust and scalable eigenvalue computations due to (a) the reduction in the
dimension of the problem to be discretized and (b) the absence of high
frequency ""pollution"" when using a Green's function to represent propagating
waves. In this paper, we detail the theoretical justification for a BIE
approach to the Stokes eigenvalue problem on simply and multiply-connected
planar domains, which entails a treatment of the uniqueness theory for
oscillatory Stokes equations on exterior domains. Then, using well-established
techniques for discretizing BIEs, we present numerical results which confirm
the analytical claims of the paper and demonstrate the efficiency of the
overall approach.

mainly caused by orbital harmonics ($f_8$ and $f_{11}$) or combination

thus fundamental to planning. Promising recent works have explored the ordering

However, such approaches only reason over partial order specifications. Having
observed that an ordering is inconsistent with respect to underlying

exponentially with the number of UAVs. Next, the structure of optimal

single multi-antenna UAV as opposed to multiple single-antenna UAVs without
loss of optimality. This result is also extended to a practical variant of the

respectively. Comparing the total masses of the eclipsing pair of 3.12 Msun, it
is obvious that XZ And is a general N-body system. The strong gravitational
perturbation between two companions invalidates the double-Keplerian model. It
is strange that two Keplerian periods with a 1:3 ratio are derived from the

the difficulty of estimating the safety state of a cyber-physical system while
an intrusion is underway but before damage can be effected by the attacker. To

the walk is conditioned to return to the root at time $2n$. Specifically, we
establish the asymptotic order (up to a constant factor) as $n\to\infty$, of
the maximal displacement from the root. Our results, which are shown to hold
for almost surely every surviving tree $T$ (subject to some mild moment
conditions), are broken up into two cases. When the offspring distribution
takes a value less than or equal to $1$ with positive probability, the maximal
displacement of the bridge is shown to be on the order of $n^{1/3}$.
Conversely, when the offspring distribution has minimum possible value equal to
at least $2$ (and is non-constant), the maximal displacement is shown to be of
order less than $n$, but greater than $n^{\gamma}$ (for any $\gamma<1$). Each
of these cases is in contrast to the case of a regular tree, on which the
bridge is known to be diffusive. To obtain our results, we show how the walk
tends to gravitate towards large clusters of vertices of minimal degree, where
it then proceeds to spend most of its time. The size and frequency of such
clusters is generally dependent on the minimum possible value attainable by the
offspring distribution, and it is this fact which largely accounts for the
existence of the two regimes.

technique, which is able to reconstruct several mechanical parameters of cancer
and normal tissue such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, interstitial
permeability and vascular permeability. To estimate the permeabilities,
estimation of the strain time constant (TC) is required, which is a challenging
task because of non-linearity of the exponential strain curve and noise present
in the experimental data. Moreover, noise in many strain frames becomes very
high because of motion artifacts from the sonographer, animal/patient and/or
the environment. Therefore, using these frames in computation of strain TC can
lead to inaccurate estimates of the mechanical parameters. In this letter, we
introduce a cubic spline based interpolation method, which uses only the good
frames (frame of high SNR) to reconstruct the information of the bad frames
(frames of low SNR) and estimate the strain TC. We prove with finite element
simulation that the proposed reconstruction method can improve the estimation
accuracy of the strain TC by 46% in comparison to the estimates from noisy
data, and 37% in comparison to the estimates from Kalman filtered data at an
SNR of 30dB. Based on the high accuracy of the proposed method in estimating
strain TC from poroelastography data, the proposed method can be preferred

\rho-\rho_J$ and $z_J \approx 4$ and $\rho_J \approx 0.842$ are the values at

differ for $\rho \gtrsim 0.88$. In this regime, $\Delta z \sim {\cal G}$ can be
described by a sum of two power-laws in $\Delta \rho$, i.e. $\Delta z \sim

show that the ratio $C_1/C_0$ is much larger for the DP model compared to to

where we have a probability distribution over possible realizations of the
data, called scenarios, and decisions are taken in two stages: we make
first-stage decisions knowing only the underlying distribution and before a
scenario is realized, and may take additional second-stage recourse actions
after a scenario is realized. The goal is typically to minimize the total
expected cost. A criticism of this model is that the underlying probability
distribution is itself often imprecise! To address this, a versatile approach
that has been proposed is the {\em distributionally robust 2-stage model}:
given a collection of probability distributions, our goal now is to minimize
the maximum expected total cost with respect to a distribution in this
collection.
  We provide a framework for designing approximation algorithms in such
settings when the collection is a ball around a central distribution and the
central distribution is accessed {\em only via a sampling black box}.
  We first show that one can utilize the {\em sample average approximation}
(SAA) method to reduce the problem to the case where the central distribution
has {\em polynomial-size} support. We then show how to approximately solve a
fractional relaxation of the SAA (i.e., polynomial-scenario
central-distribution) problem. By complementing this via LP-rounding algorithms
that provide {\em local} (i.e., per-scenario) approximation guarantees, we
obtain the {\em first} approximation algorithms for the distributionally robust
versions of a variety of discrete-optimization problems including set cover,
vertex cover, edge cover, facility location, and Steiner tree, with guarantees
that are, except for set cover, within $O(1)$-factors of the guarantees known

high-dimensional data. For matrix data, the dimension reduction can be more
effectively achieved through both row and column directions. In this paper, we
introduce a threshold factor models to analyze matrix-valued high-dimensional
time series data. The factor loadings are allowed to switch between regimes,
controlling by a threshold variable. The estimation methods for loading spaces,
threshold value, and the number of factors are proposed. The asymptotic
properties of these estimators are investigated. Not only the strengths of
thresholding and factors, but also their interactions from different directions
and different regimes play an important role on the estimation performance.
When the thresholding and factors are all strong across regimes, the estimation
is immune to the impact that the increase of dimension brings, which breaks the
curse of dimensionality. When the thresholding in two directions and factors
across regimes have different levels of strength, we show that estimators for
loadings and threshold value experience 'helping' effects against the curse of
dimensionality. We also discover that even when the numbers of factors are
overestimated, the estimators are still consistent. The proposed methods are
illustrated with both simulated and real examples.

the lower region of the aorta. It is typically an asymptomatic condition that
if left untreated can expand to the point of rupture. Mechanically-speaking,
rupture of an artery occurs when the local wall stress exceeds the local wall
strength. It is therefore understandable that numerous studies have attempted
to estimate the AAA wall stress. Recently the Intelligent Systems for Medicine
Laboratory (ISML) presented a very efficient method to compute AAA wall stress
using geometry from Computed Tomography (CT) images, and median arterial
pressure as the applied load. The ISML's method is embedded in the software
platform BioPARR - Biomechanics based Prediction of Aneurysm Rupture Risk,
freely available from http://bioparr.mech.uwa.edu.au/. The uniqueness of our
stress computation approach is three-fold: i) the results are insensitive to
unknown patient-specific mechanical properties of arterial wall tissue; ii) the
residual stress is accounted for, according to Y.C. Fung's Uniform Stress
Hypothesis; and iii) the analysis is automated and quick, making our approach
compatible with clinical workflows. In this study we evaluated 19 cases of AAA.
A proportion of these were classified as symptomatic. The results of the
analysis demonstrate, contrary to the common view, that neither the wall stress
magnitude nor the stress distribution correlate with the presence of clinical
symptoms.

important for studies on the evolution of galactic and protoplanetary disks.
Although high-order methods have been developed for hydrodynamic and
magneto-hydrodynamic equations, high-order improvement is desirable for solving
self-gravitational forces for thin disks. In this work, we present a new
numerical algorithm that is of linear complexity and of high-order accuracy.
This approach is fast since the force calculation is associated with a
convolution form, and the fast calculation can be achieved using Fast Fourier
Transform. The nice properties, such as the finite supports and smoothness, of
B-splines are exploited to stably interpolate a surface density and achieve a
high-order accuracy in forces. Moreover, if the mass distribution of interest
is exclusively confined within a calculation domain, the method does not
require artificial boundary values to be specified before the force
calculation. To validate the proposed algorithm, a series of numerical tests,
ranging from 1st- to 3rd-order implementations, are performed and the results
are compared with analytic expressions derived for 3rd- and 4th-order
generalized Maclaurin disks. We conclude that the improvement on the numerical
accuracy is significant with the order of the method, with only little increase
of the complexity of the method.

multiphase microstructures as a result of processing. When the coexisting
phases are elastically coherent, the elastic interactions between these phases
play a major role in the development of microstructures. To elucidate the key
effects of elastic stress on microstructural evolution when more than two
misfitting phases are present in the microstructure, we have developed a
microelastic phase-field model in two dimensions to study phase separation in
ternary alloy system. Numerical solutions of a set of coupled Cahn-Hilliard
equations for the composition fields govern the spatiotemporal evolution of the
three-phase microstructure. The model incorporates coherency strain
interactions between the phases using Khachaturyan's microelasticity theory. We
systematically vary the misfit strains (magnitude and sign) between the phases
along with the bulk alloy composition to study their effects on the
morphological development of the phases and the resulting phase separation
kinetics. We also vary the ratio of interfacial energies between the phases to
understand the interplay between elastic and interfacial energies on
morphological evolution. The sign and degree of misfit affect strain
partitioning between the phases during spinodal decomposition, thereby
affecting their compositional history and morphology. Moreover, strain
partitioning affects solute partitioning and alters the kinetics of coarsening
of the phases. The phases associated with higher misfit strain appear coarser
and exhibit wider size distribution compared to those having lower misfit. When
the interfacial energies satisfy complete wetting condition, phase separation
leads to development of stable core-shell morphology depending on the misfit
between the core (wetted) and the shell (wetting) phases.

distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. We
show the approach for two graph constructions obtained from the time series. In
the first approach the time series is embedded into a point cloud which is then
used to construct an undirected $k$-nearest neighbor graph. The second
construct relies on the recently developed ordinal partition framework. In
either case, a pairwise distance matrix is then calculated using the shortest
path between the graph's nodes, and this matrix is utilized to define a
filtration of a simplicial complex that enables tracking the changes in
homology classes over the course of the filtration. These changes are
summarized in a persistence diagram---a two-dimensional summary of changes in
the topological features. We then extract existing as well as new geometric and
entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other
commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based
point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are
more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined

recently introduced another kind of $\sigma$--stability for a nonempty subset
of a random metric space $(E,d)$, called $d$--$\sigma$--stability since it
depends on the random metric $d$. $d$--$\sigma$--stability coincides with the
previous $\sigma$--stability in the case of random normed modules, which
motivates us in this paper to generalize the precise form of Ekeland's
variational principle from a complete random normed module to a complete
$d$--$\sigma$--stable random metric space. Besides, this paper also utilize
$d$--$\sigma$--stability to generalize Nadler's fixed point theorem for a
multivalued contraction mapping from a complete metric space to a complete
random metric space. To our surprise, our simple fixed point theorem, however,
can derive the known basic fixed point theorems of contraction type for both

recommend 1) deriving the PS after applying MI (referred to as MI-derPassive);
2) conducting PSM within each imputed data set followed by averaging the
treatment effects to arrive at one summarized finding (INT-within) for mild
MDMs and averaging the PSs across multiply imputed datasets before obtaining
one treatment effect using PSM (INT-across) for more complex MDMs; 3) a

that single-world interpretation of quantum theory cannot be self-consistent.
In a new version of the paper, published in September 2018, the authors
moderate their original claim by concluding that quantum theory cannot be
extrapolated to complex systems, at least not in a straightforward manner. The
purpose of this article is to offer a careful reconstruction of the F-R
argument, which allows us to show that: (i) the argument can be more clearly
formulated with no reference to what subjects know or see, but rather only in
terms of quantum propositions, (ii) in contrast to what some commentators
suppose, the argument does not require the hypothesis of collapse to arrive to
its conclusion, and (iii) the contradiction resulting from the F-R argument is
inferred by making classical conjunctions between different and incompatible
contexts. On the basis of this clarification, we will finally argue that the
conclusion of the F-R argument is not as novel and original as its great impact
might make us to suppose.

  Often, two graphs are compared via a pairwise distance measure, with a small
distance indicating structural similarity and vice versa. Common choices
include spectral distances (also known as $\lambda$ distances) and distances
based on node affinities. However, there has of yet been no comparative study
of the efficacy of these distance measures in discerning between common graph
topologies and different structural scales.
  In this work, we compare commonly used graph metrics and distance measures,
and demonstrate their ability to discern between common topological features

multi-scale picture of graph structure, in which the effect of global and local
structure upon the distance measures is considered. We make recommendations on
the applicability of different distance measures to empirical graph data

recursive programs that satisfy both a functional specification and a symbolic
resource bound. The technique is type-directed and rests upon a novel type
system that combines polymorphic refinement types with potential annotations of
automatic amortized resource analysis. The type system enables efficient
constraint-based type checking and can express precise refinement-based
resource bounds. The proof of type soundness shows that synthesized programs
are correct by construction. By tightly integrating program exploration and
type checking, the synthesizer can leverage the user-provided resource bound to
guide the search, eagerly rejecting incomplete programs that consume too many
resources. An implementation in the resource-guided synthesizer ReSyn is used
to evaluate the technique on a range of recursive data structure manipulations.
The experiments show that ReSyn synthesizes programs that are asymptotically
more efficient than those generated by a resource-agnostic synthesizer.
Moreover, synthesis with ReSyn is faster than a naive combination of synthesis
and resource analysis. ReSyn is also able to generate implementations that have
a constant resource consumption for fixed input sizes, which can be used to
mitigate side-channel attacks.

and lose their high-Q superconducting properties at accelerating gradients
below the limits imposed by theory. The microscopic origins of SRF cavity
breakdown are still a matter of some debate. To investigate these microscopic
issues temperature and power dependent local third harmonic response was
measured on bulk Nb and Nb thin film samples using a novel near-field magnetic
microwave microscope between 2.9K-10K and 2GHz-6GHz. Both periodic and
non-periodic response as a function of applied RF field amplitude are observed.
We attribute these features to extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear responses of
the sample. The RF-current-biased Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model can
account for the periodic response and fits very well to the data using
reasonable parameters. The non-periodic response is consistent with vortex
semi-loops penetrating into the bulk of the sample once sufficiently high RF
magnetic field is applied, and the data can be fit to a Time-Dependent
Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) model of this process. The fact that these responses are
measured on a wide variety of Nb samples suggests that we have captured the
generic nonlinear response of air-exposed Nb surfaces.

ROI signals. Various sets of features are calculated and fed to a sequential
forward floating feature selection (SFFFS) to choose the most discriminative

unifying two subtasks, i.e., localization of action proposals and
classification of each proposal through a fully shared backbone. However, such
design of encapsulating all components of two subtasks in one single network
might restrict the training by ignoring the specialized characteristic of each
subtask. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled Single Shot temporal
Action Detection (Decouple-SSAD) method to mitigate such problem by decoupling
the localization and classification in a one-stage scheme. Particularly, two
separate branches are designed in parallel to enable each component to own
representations privately for accurate localization or classification. Each
branch produces a set of action anchor layers by applying deconvolution to the
feature maps of the main stream. Each branch produces a set of feature maps by
applying deconvolution to the feature maps of the main stream. High-level

It represents images as the output of a convolutional network with random

image prior is asymptotically equivalent to a stationary Gaussian process prior

to its ability of generating deep feature representation. However, how to
construct an efficient and powerful network suitable for hyperspectral data is
still under exploration. In this paper, a novel neural network model is
designed for taking full advantage of the spectral-spatial structure of
hyperspectral data. Firstly, we extract pixel-based intrinsic features from
rich yet redundant spectral bands by a subnetwork with supervised pre-training
scheme. Secondly, in order to utilize the local spatial correlation among
pixels, we share the previous subnetwork as a spectral feature extractor for
each pixel in a patch of image, after which the spectral features of all pixels
in a patch are combined and feeded into the subsequent classification
subnetwork. Finally, the whole network is further fine-tuned to improve its
classification performance. Specially, the spectral-spatial factorization
scheme is applied in our model architecture, making the network size and the
number of parameters great less than the existing spectral-spatial deep
networks for hyperspectral image classification. Experiments on the
hyperspectral data sets show that, compared with some state-of-art deep
learning methods, our method achieves better classification results while
having smaller network size and less parameters.

often employ the first-order algorithms in real-world applications and are
impressed by their superior performance regardless of ill-conditioned

settles this open problem and contributes to the broad interplay between

disjunctive invariants over numerical domains, which are inexpressible using
classical convex polyhedra. Using dynamic analysis and reformulating the
problem in non-standard ""max-plus"" and ""min-plus"" algebras, our method
constructs hulls over program trace points. Critically, we introduce and infer
a weak class of such invariants that balances expressive power against the
computational cost of generating nonconvex shapes in high dimensions.
  Existing dynamic inference techniques often generate spurious invariants that
fit some program traces but do not generalize. With the insight that generating
dynamic invariants is easy, we propose to verify these invariants statically
using k-inductive SMT theorem proving which allows us to validate invariants
that are not classically inductive.
  Results on difficult kernels involving nonlinear arithmetic and abstract

effectively represent the dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between
exogenous series and target series, but it only performs well in one-step time
prediction and short-term time prediction. In this paper, inspired by human
attention mechanism including the dual-stage two-phase (DSTP) model and the

propose DSTP-based RNN (DSTP-RNN) and DSTP-RNN-2 respectively for long-term

Estaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and
test data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared
to bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB
range. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in
images within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise
related detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution
images, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to
synthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering
edgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model
is also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image
augmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown
to act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances
which naturally leads to further future development and training of models that
segment an image directly. Image restoration by SRCNN on the rock images is of
significantly higher quality than traditional methods and suggests SRCNN
methods are a viable processing step in a digital rock workflow.

rule for biased estimation under the case of memory constraint. In order to
introduce the new estimation, a closed representation of the local estimators
obtained by the data in each batch is adopted, aiming to formulate a pro forma
linear regression between the local estimators and the true parameter of
interest. Least square method is then used within this framework to composite a
global estimator of the parameter. Thus, the main advantage over the classical
DC method is that the new GBC-DC method can absorb the information hidden in
the statistical structure and the variables in each batch of data.
Consequently, the resulting global estimator is strictly unbiased even if the
local estimator has a non-negligible bias. Moreover, the global estimator is
consistent, and even can achieve root-$n$ consistency, without the constraint
on the number of batches. Another attractive feature of the new method is
computationally simple and efficient, without use of any iterative algorithm
and local bias-correction. Specifically, the proposed GBC-DC method applies to

the ability to generalise predictions to new data. Within medical imaging, this
can occur when features are incorrectly assigned importance such as distinct
hospital specific artifacts, leading to poor performance on a new dataset from
a different institution without those features, which is undesirable. Most
regularization methods do not explicitly penalize the incorrect association of
these features to the target class and hence fail to address this issue. We
propose a regularization method, GradMask, which penalizes saliency maps
inferred from the classifier gradients when they are not consistent with the
lesion segmentation. This prevents non-tumor related features to contribute to
the classification of unhealthy samples. We demonstrate that this method can
improve test accuracy between 1-3% compared to the baseline without GradMask,
showing that it has an impact on reducing overfitting.

It aims to achieve precise position control at dynamic flight operation for a

generated by a leader aircraft. One crucial concern is the control robustness
that ensures the boundedness of position error subject to uncertainties and
disturbances to be regulated with accuracy. This paper develops a robust
nonlinear formation control algorithm to fulfill precise close formation
tracking control. The proposed control algorithm consists of baseline control
laws and disturbance observers. The baseline control laws are employed to
stabilize the nonlinear dynamics of close formation flight, while the
disturbance observers are introduced to compensate system uncertainties and
formation-related aerodynamic disturbances. The position control performance
can be guaranteed within the desired boundedness to harvest enough drag
reduction for a follower aircraft in close formation using the proposed design.
The efficacy of the proposed design is demonstrated via numerical simulations
of close formation flight of two aircraft.

If all interactions among test parameters or factors needed to be covered, the

strategy only requires covering $t$-wise interactions where $t$ is typically
very small. As a result, it becomes possible to significantly reduce test suite
size. Locating arrays aim to enhance the ability of combinatorial interaction
testing. In particular, $(\overline{1}, t)$-locating arrays can not only
execute all $t$-way interactions but also identify, if any, which of the

limited research either on how to generate locating arrays or on their minimum

the traditional methods used for single image denoising have always failed to

enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. This paper proposes a recurrent fully

Our model maps raw burst images directly to sRGB outputs, either to produce a
best image or to generate a multi-frame denoised image sequence. This process
has proven to be capable of accomplishing the low-level task of denoising, as
well as the high-level task of color correction and enhancement, all of which
is end-to-end processing through our network. Our method has achieved better
results than state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we have applied the model

different cameras and have obtained similar end-to-end enhancements.

modalities, cross-modal similarity search, which conducts nearest neighbor
search across different modalities, has been attracting increasing interest.
This paper presents a deep compact code learning solution for efficient
cross-modal similarity search. Many recent studies have proven that
quantization-based approaches perform generally better than hashing-based
approaches on single-modal similarity search. In this paper, we propose a deep
quantization approach, which is among the early attempts of leveraging deep
neural networks into quantization-based cross-modal similarity search. Our
approach, dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), explicitly
formulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private
subspaces for individual modalities, and representations in the shared subspace
and the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embedding of different
modality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition, in the shared
subspace, a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact
codes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network
architecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training, SPDQ can
preserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly
reduce quantization error. Experiments on two popular benchmarks corroborate
that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

theoretical investigation of the vdW magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based on
VSe2/MoS2 heterojunction, where the VSe2 monolayer acts as the ferromagnet with
the room-temperature ferromagnetism. We propose the concept of spin-orbit
torque (SOT) vdW MTJ with reliable reading and efficient writing operations.
The non-equilibrium study reveals a large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of
846 % at 300 Kelvin, identifying significantly its parallel and anti-parallel
states. Thanks to the strong spin Hall conductivity of MoS2, SOT is promising
for the magnetization switching of VSe2 free layer. Quantum-well states come
into being and resonances appear in MTJ, suggesting that the voltage control
can adjust transport properties effectively. The SOT vdW MTJ based on VSe2/MoS2
provides desirable performance and experimental feasibility, offering new
opportunities for 2D spintronics.

perturbations, but to the background evolution effect on the conversion between
entropy and curvature perturbations. We derive a general relation between the
time derivative of comoving curvature perturbations and entropy perturbations,
in terms of a conversion factor depending on the background evolution. Contrary
to previous results derived in the uniform density gauge assuming the gradient

  We apply it to the case of quasi-inflection inflation, showing that while
entropy perturbations are decreasing, $\mathcal{R}$ can grow on super-horizon
scales, due to a large increase of the conversion factor. This happens in the
time interval during which a sufficiently fast decrease of the equation of
state $w$ transforms into a growing mode that in slow-roll models would be a
decaying mode. The same mechanism also explains the super-horizon evolution of
$\mathcal{R}$ in globally adiabatic systems, for which entropy perturbations
vanish on any scale, such as ultra slow-roll inflation and its generalizations.

technologies in 5G. Acquiring an accurate channel estimate is the key to
facilitate advanced millimeter wave hybrid multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) precoding techniques. Millimeter wave MIMO channel estimation, however,
suffers from a considerably increased channel use overhead. This happens due to
the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains that prevent the digital
baseband from directly accessing the signal at each antenna. To address this
issue, recent research has focused on adaptive closed-loop and two-way channel
estimation techniques. In this paper, unlike the prior approaches, we study a
non-adaptive, hence rather simple, open-loop millimeter wave MIMO channel
estimation technique. We present a simple random design of channel subspace
sampling signals and show that they obey the restricted isometry property (RIP)
with high probability. We then formulate the channel estimation as a low-rank
subspace decomposition problem and, based on the RIP, show that the proposed
framework reveals resilience to a low signal-to-noise ratio. It is revealed
that the required number of channel uses ensuring a bounded estimation error is
linearly proportional to the degrees of freedom of the channel, whereas it
converges to a constant value if the number of RF chains can grow
proportionally to the channel dimension while keeping the channel rank fixed.
In particular, we show that the tighter the RIP characterization the lower the
channel estimation error is. We also devise an iterative technique that
effectively finds a suboptimal but stationary solution to the formulated
problem. The proposed technique is shown to have improved channel estimation
accuracy with a low channel use overhead as compared to that of previous
closed-loop and two-way adaptation techniques.

positions are primarily determined by $R_{\mathrm{SN}}(z)$ and $\mathrm{d}
N(E_\nu)/\mathrm{d} E_\nu$ and only slightly affected by the CG models.
However, the height of the spectra in each category of the CG models can vary
dramatically for different models, with variances of 13.2%, 23.6% and 14.9% for
GCG, MCG and ECG categories respectively. The averaged total flux in each

construction of an $(N,K)$ polar code, an action specifies its reduction to an
$(N,K-1)$ subcode, and reward is the decoding performance. A neural network
architecture consisting of both policy and value networks is proposed to
generate actions based on the observed states, aiming at maximizing the overall

exploration. To further improve learning efficiency and quality, an `integrated

generate a population of (sub-)optimal polar codes for each $(N,K)$, and then
uses them as prior knowledge to refine the policy in RL. Such a paradigm is
shown to accelerate the training process, and converge at better performances.
Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based polar constructions
achieve comparable, or even better, performances than the state of the art

to the equilibrium fluid by changing the dissipation strength. We study the
criticality of the absorbing phase transition. We find that the origin of
fluidic HU can be understood as the damping of a stochastic harmonic oscillator

fluctuation in the hyperuniform fluid can exhibit as either acoustic

reveals that the damping dissipation and active reciprocal interaction

the constraints on cost-effective millimeter wave operation imposed on the
number of available RF chains. Sparse subspace scanning techniques that search
for the best subspace sample from the sounded subspace samples have been
investigated for channel estimation.However, the performance of these

Reynolds numbers based on freestream velocity and chord length ranging from Rec
= 100, 000 to 1,000,000, all of them with 5 degree angle of attack. The results
of four well-resolved large-eddy simulations (LESs) are used to characterize
the effect of Reynolds number on APG TBLs subjected to approximately the same
pressure-gradient distribution (defined by the Clauser pressure-gradient
parameter beta). Comparisons of the wing profiles with zero-pressure-gradient
(ZPG) data at matched friction Reynolds numbers reveal that, for approximately
the same beta distribution, the lower-Reynolds-number boundary layers are more
sensitive to pressure-gradient effects. This is reflected in the values of the
inner-scaled edge velocity Ue+ , the shape factor H, the components of the
Reynolds-stress tensor in the outer region and the outer-region production of
turbulent kinetic energy. This conclusion is supported by the larger
wall-normal velocities and outer-scaled fluctuations observed in the lower-Rec
cases.Thus, our results suggest that two complementing mechanisms contribute to
the development of the outer region in TBLs and the formation of large-scale
energetic structures: one mechanism associated with the increase in Reynolds
number, and another one connected to the APG. Future extensions of the present
work will be aimed at studying the differences in the outer-region energizing
mechanisms due to APGs and increasing Reynolds number.

broadband emissions from radio to TeV $\gamma$-rays. The massive star possesses
an equatorial disc, which is inclined with the orbital plane of the pulsar. The
non-thermal emission from the system is believed to be produced by the pulsar
wind shock and the double-peak profiles in the X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray light
curves are related to the phases of the pulsar passing through the disc region
of the star. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between the pulsar
wind and stellar outflows, especially with the presence of the disc, and
present a multi-wavelength modelling of the emission from this system. We show
that the double-peak profiles of X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray light curves are
caused by the enhancements of the magnetic field and the soft photons at the
shock during the disc passages. As the pulsar is passing through the equatorial
disc, the additional pressure of the disc pushes the shock surface closer to
the pulsar, which causes the enhancement of magnetic field in the shock, and
thus increases the synchrotron luminosity. The TeV $\gamma$-rays due to the
inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of shocked electrons with seed photons from the
star is expected to peak around periastron which is inconsistent with
observations. However, the shock heating of the stellar disc could provide
additional seed photons for IC scattering during the disc passages, and thus
produces the double-peak profiles as observed in the TeV $\gamma$-ray light
curve. Our model can possibly be examined and applied to other similar
gamma-ray binaries, such as PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213, HESS J0632+057, and LS

variation in lighting, appearance, and background. While some success has been
achieved using deep neural networks, they typically require collecting a large
dataset that adequately samples all the axes of variation of hand images. It
would, therefore, be useful to find a representation of hand pose which is
independent of the image appearance~(like hand texture, lighting, background),
so that we can synthesize unseen images by mixing pose-appearance combinations.
In this paper, we present a novel technique that disentangles the
representation of pose from a complementary appearance factor in 2D monochrome
images. We supervise this disentanglement process using a network that learns
to generate images of hand using specified pose+appearance features. Unlike
previous work, we do not require image pairs with a matching pose; instead, we
use the pose annotations already available and introduce a novel use of cycle
consistency to ensure orthogonality between the factors. Experimental results
show that our self-disentanglement scheme successfully decomposes the hand
image into the pose and its complementary appearance features of comparable
quality as the method using paired data. Additionally, training the model with
extra synthesized images with unseen hand-appearance combinations by re-mixing
pose and appearance factors from different images can improve the 2D pose
estimation performance.

which $m$ balls acting in parallel as separate agents are placed into $n$ bins.
Algorithms operate in synchronous rounds, in each of which balls and bins
exchange messages once. The goal is to minimize the maximal load over all bins
using a small number of rounds and few messages.
  While the case of $m=n$ balls has been extensively studied, little is known
about the heavily loaded case. In this work, we consider parallel algorithms
for this somewhat neglected regime of $m\gg n$. The naive solution of
allocating each ball to a bin chosen uniformly and independently at random
results in maximal load $m/n+\Theta(\sqrt{m/n\cdot \log n})$ (for $m\geq n \log
n$) w.h.p. In contrast, for the sequential setting Berenbrink et al (SIAM J.
Comput 2006) showed that letting each ball join the least loaded bin of two
randomly selected bins reduces the maximal load to $m/n+O(\log\log m)$ w.h.p.
To date, no parallel variant of such a result is known.
  We present a simple parallel threshold algorithm that obtains a maximal load
of $m/n+O(1)$ w.h.p. within $O(\log\log (m/n)+\log^* n)$ rounds. The algorithm
is symmetric (balls and bins all ""look the same""), and balls send $O(1)$
messages in expectation per round. The additive term of $O(\log^* n)$ in the
complexity is known to be tight for such algorithms (Lenzen and Wattenhofer
Distributed Computing 2016). We also prove that our analysis is tight, i.e.,
algorithms of the type we provide must run for $\Omega(\min\{\log\log
(m/n),n\})$ rounds w.h.p.
  Finally, we give a simple asymmetric algorithm (i.e., balls are aware of a
common labeling of the bins) that achieves a maximal load of $m/n + O(1)$ in a
constant number of rounds w.h.p. Again, balls send only a single message per
round, and bins receive $(1+o(1))m/n+O(\log n)$ messages w.h.p.

for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. While most previous
works predict a single future, multiple futures with different behavior can
potentially occur. Moreover, if the predicted future is too short (e.g., less
than one second), it may not be fully usable by a human or other systems. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for future human pose prediction capable
of predicting multiple long-term futures. This makes the predictions more
suitable for real applications. Also, from the input video and the predicted
human behavior, we generate future videos. First, from an input human video, we
generate sequences of future human poses (i.e., the image coordinates of their
body-joints) via adversarial learning. Adversarial learning suffers from mode
collapse, which makes it difficult to generate a variety of multiple poses. We
solve this problem by utilizing two additional inputs to the generator to make
the outputs diverse, namely, a latent code (to reflect various behaviors) and
an attraction point (to reflect various trajectories). In addition, we generate
long-term future human poses using a novel approach based on unidimensional
convolutional neural networks. Last, we generate an output video based on the
generated poses for visualization. We evaluate the generated future poses and
videos using three criteria (i.e., realism, diversity and accuracy), and show
that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art works.

Although the multiplicity of these outlets should ensure a variety of

ownership may void this assumption. This observation motivates the study of the
impact of ownership on the global media landscape and its influence on the
coverage the actual viewer receives. To this end, the selection of reported
events has been shown to be informative about the high-level structure of the
news ecosystem. However, existing methods only provide a static view into an
inherently dynamic system, providing underperforming statistical models and
hindering our understanding of the media landscape as a whole.
  In this work, we present a dynamic embedding method that learns to capture
the decision process of individual news sources in their selection of reported
events while also enabling the systematic detection of large-scale
transformations in the media landscape over prolonged periods of time. In an
experiment covering over 580M real-world event mentions, we show our approach

situ. However, these deposits are a product of a collision within the

simulating the collection process by Rosetta instruments (specifically COSIMA,
MIDAS). In Paper I we reported that velocity is a key driver in determining the
appearance of deposits. Here in Paper II we use materials with different
monomer sizes, and study the effect of tensile strength on the appearance of
deposits. We find that mass transfer efficiency increases from $\sim$1 up to
$\sim$10% with increasing monomer diameter from 0.3 $\mu$m to 1.5 $\mu$m (i.e.
tensile strength decreasing from $\sim$12 to $\sim$3 kPa), and velocities
increasing from 0.5 to 6 m/s. Also, the relative abundance of small fragments
after impact is higher for material with higher tensile strength. The
degeneracy between the effects of velocity and material strength may be lifted
by performing a closer study of the deposits. This experimental method makes it
possible to estimate the mass transfer efficiency in the COSIMA instrument.
Extrapolating these results implies that more than half of the dust collected
during the Rosetta mission has not been imaged. We analysed two COSIMA targets
containing deposits from single collisions. The collision that occurred closest
to perihelion passage led to more small fragments on the target.

migration, and capture the inwardly drifting planetesimals into mean motion
resonances. The equilibrium eccentricity of planetesimals in resonances, and
the minimum size of planetesimal that can trigger resonance trapping, have been
analyzed and formulated. However, the analytical works based on the assumption
that the disk is axisymmetric, which is violated by the asymmetric structures
developed by planets. We perform long-term 2D hydrodynamic simulations to study
the dynamics of planetesimals in the $j:(j+1)$ first-order exterior resonances,
and reexamine the theoretical expressions. We find the expression of
equilibrium eccentricity underestimates the values for resonances with $j < 5$,
in particular the 1:2 resonance that the underestimation can be $30 - 40\%$.
Within the parameter space we explored, we find the equilibrium eccentricity
and the minimum size are reduced in an asymmetric disk. The amount of
discrepancy in eccentricity depends on the degree of asymmetric structures. For
cases of Earth-sized planets, where the disk is less disturbed, the
planetesimal's eccentricity can reach to the values predicted by our modified
expression. For gaseous planets, however, the eccentricity can be $0.01 - 0.02$
smaller in value. We find the minimum size is 10 times smaller, and the factor
seems to be independent of the planet's mass. The influences of asymmetric
profiles on the eccentricity and the minimum size could affect the outcome of

activity. The discovery of a phase-variable absorption feature in the X-ray
spectrum of SGR 0418+5729, interpreted as cyclotron resonant scattering,
suggests the presence of very strong non-dipolar components in the magnetic
fields of magnetars. We performed a deep XMM-Newton observation of pulsar 1E
2259+586, to search for spectral features due to intense local magnetic fields.
In the phase-averaged X-ray spectrum, we found evidence for a broad absorption
feature at very low energy (0.7 keV). If the feature is intrinsic to the
source, it might be due to resonant scattering/absorption by protons close to
star surface. The line energy implies a magnetic field of ~ 10^14 G, roughly
similar to the spin-down measure, ~ 6x10^13 G. Examination of the X-ray
phase-energy diagram shows evidence for a further absorption feature, the
energy of which strongly depends on the rotational phase (E >~ 1 keV ). Unlike
similar features detected in other magnetar sources, notably SGR 0418+5729, it
is too shallow and limited to a small phase interval to be modeled with a
narrow phase-variable cyclotron absorption line. A detailed phase-resolved
spectral analysis reveals significant phase-dependent variability in the
continuum, especially above 2 keV. We conclude that all the variability with
phase in 1E 2259+586 can be attributed to changes in the continuum properties
which appear consistent with the predictions of the Resonant Compton Scattering
model.

multiple users called actors are guilty of using steganography, which is
typically defined as the Steganographer Identification Problem (SIP). One might
use the conventional steganalysis algorithms to separate stego objects from
cover objects and then identify the guilty actors. However, the guilty actors
may be lost due to a number of false alarms. To deal with the SIP, most of the
state-of-the-arts use unsupervised learning based approaches. In their
solutions, each actor holds multiple digital objects, from which a set of
feature vectors can be extracted. The well-defined distances between these
feature sets are determined to measure the similarity between the corresponding
actors. By applying clustering or outlier detection, the most suspicious
actor(s) will be judged as the steganographer(s). Though the SIP needs further
study, the existing works have good ability to identify the steganographer(s)

will present foundational concepts and review advanced methodologies in SIP.

training speaker identity. At test time, unit discovery is performed on speech
from an unseen speaker, followed by unit decoding conditioned on a known target

vocoder to synthesise speech in the target speaker's voice. For discretisation,
categorical variational autoencoders (CatVAEs), vector-quantised VAEs (VQ-VAEs)

been proposed as a major source of the CN radical observed in cometary

The chemistry of cyanogen in the cold interstellar medium can be investigated
through its metastable isomer, CNCN (isocyanogen). Its formation may provide a
clue on the widely abundant CN radical observed in cometary atmospheres. We
performed an unbiased spectral survey of the L1544 proto-typical prestellar
core, using the IRAM-30m and have analysed, for this paper, the nitrogen
chemistry that leads to the formation of isocyanogen. We report on the first
detection of CNCN, NCCNH+, C3N, CH3CN, C2H3CN, and H2CN in L1544. We built a
detailed chemical network for NCCN/CNCN/HC2N2+ involving all the nitrogen
bearing species detected (CN, HCN, HNC, C3N, CNCN, CH3CN, CH2CN, HCCNC, HC3N,
HNC3, H2CN, C2H3CN, HCNH+, HC3NH+) and the upper limits on C4N, C2N. The main
cyanogen production pathways considered in the network are the CN + HNC and N +
C3N reactions. The comparison between the observations of the nitrogen bearing
species and the predictions from the chemical modelling shows a very good
agreement, taking into account the new chemical network. The expected cyanogen
abundance is greater than the isocyanogen abundance by a factor of 100.
Although cyanogen cannot be detected through its rotational spectrum, the
chemical modelling predicts that it should be abundant in the gas phase and
hence might be traced through the detection of isocyanogen. It is however
expected to have a very low abundance on the grain surfaces compared to HCN.

noisy signal using linear least squares (LLS). Frequency estimation is a
nonlinear problem, and typically, methods such as Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS)
(batch) or a digital phase locked loop (DPLL) (online) are employed for such an
estimate. However, with the linearization approach presented here, one can
harness the efficiency of LLS to obtain very good estimates, while experiencing
little penalty for linearizing. In this paper, the mathematical basis of this
algorithm is described, and the bias and variance are analyzed analytically and
numerically. With the batch version of this algorithm, it will be demonstrated
that the estimator is just as good as NLS. But because LLS is non recursive,
the estimate it produces much more efficiently than from NLS. When the proposed
algorithm is implemented online, it will be demonstrated that performance is
comparable to a digital phase locked loop, with some stability and tracking
range advantages.

practical implications in a number of scientific and engineering problems. In a
quiescent fluid, a slowly settling particle orients so that it settles with its
broad side first. This is an effect of the torque due to convective inertia of
the fluid set in motion by the settling particle, which maximises the drag
experienced by the particle. Turbulent flows tend to randomise the particle
orientation. Recently the settling of non-spherical particles in turbulence was
analysed neglecting the effect of convective fluid inertia, but taking into
account the effect of the turbulent fluid-velocity gradients on the particle
orientation. These studies reached the opposite conclusion, namely that a rod
settles preferentially with its tip first, wheras a disk settles with its edge
first, therefore minimizing the drag on the particle. Here, we consider both
effects, the convective inertial torque as well as the torque due to
fluctuating velocity gradients, and ask under which circumstances either one or
the other dominate. To this end we estimate the ratio of the magnitudes of the
two torques. Our estimates suggest that the fluid-inertia torque prevails in
high-Reynolds number flows. In this case non-spherical particles are expected
to settle with a maximal drag. But when the Reynolds number is small then the
torque due to fluid-velocity gradients may dominate, causing the particle to
settle with its broad side first.

disorders that are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children.
The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioural
observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to over-prescribing
of drugs due to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field towards more
quantitative fashion, we need advanced and scalable machine learning
infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental
health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for
classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We
designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a
single layer perceptron which results in improved quality of extracted features
and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a
data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature
vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of
machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset
provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1035 subjects coming
from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms
other state of the art methods from 13 imaging centers with increase in
classification accuracy up to 20% with maximum accuracy of 80%. The machine
learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better
quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 minutes vs. 6
hours on other methods). The implemented code is available as GPL license on

impact or influence of a scientific paper, the evolution of follow-up work
inspired by the paper and their interactions through citation links have rarely
been explored to quantify how the paper enriches the depth and breadth of a
research field. We propose a novel data structure, called Influence Dispersion
Tree (IDT) to model the organization of follow-up papers and their dependencies
through citations. We also propose the notion of an ideal IDT for every paper
and show that an ideal (highly influential) paper should increase the knowledge
of a field vertically and horizontally. Upon suitably exploring the structural
properties of IDT, we derive a suite of metrics, namely Influence Dispersion
Index (IDI), Normalized Influence Divergence (NID) to quantify the influence of
a paper. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ideal IDT configuration should
have equal depth and breadth (and thus minimize the NID value). We establish
the superiority of NID as a better influence measure in two experimental
settings. First, on a large real-world bibliographic dataset, we show that NID
outperforms raw citation count as an early predictor of the number of new
citations a paper will receive within a certain period after publication.
Second, we show that NID is superior to the raw citation count at identifying
the papers recognized as highly influential through Test of Time Award among
all their contemporary papers (published in the same venue). We conclude that
in order to quantify the influence of a paper, along with the total citation
count, one should also consider how the citing papers are organized among
themselves to better understand the influence of a paper on the research field.

industry and Nature. Turbulent flows promote efficient transport and mixing by
their inherent randomness. Laminar flows lack such a natural mixing mechanism
and efficient transport is far more challenging. However, laminar flow is
essential to many problems and insight into its transport characteristics of
great importance. Laminar transport, arguably, is best described by the
Lagrangian fluid motion (`advection') and the geometry, topology and coherence
of fluid trajectories. Efficient laminar transport being equivalent to `chaotic
advection' is a key finding of this approach.
  The Lagrangian framework enables systematic analysis and design of laminar
flows. However, the gap between scientific insights into Lagrangian transport
and technological applications is formidable primarily for two reasons. First,
many studies concern two-dimensional (2D) flows yet the real world is three
dimensional (3D). Second, Lagrangian transport is typically investigated for
idealised flows yet practical relevance requires studies on realistic 3D flows.
  The present review aims to stimulate further development and utilisation of
know-how on 3D Lagrangian transport and its dissemination to practice. To this
end 3D practical flows are categorised into canonical problems. First, to
expose the diversity of Lagrangian transport and create awareness of its broad
relevance. Second, to enable knowledge transfer both within and between
scientific disciplines. Third, to reconcile practical flows with fundamentals
on Lagrangian transport and chaotic advection. This may be a first incentive to
structurally integrate the `Lagrangian mindset' into the analysis and design of
3D practical flows.

for clearing price and transacted volume. Bid and ask volumes are left as free
parameters, permitting possibly heavy-tailed or very skewed order flow
conditions. In highly liquid auctions, the clearing price distribution
converges to an asymptotically normal central limit, with mean and variance in
terms of supply/demand-valuation distributions and order flow imbalance. By
means of simulations, we illustrate the influence of variations in order flow
and valuation distributions on price/volume, noting a distinction between high-
and low-volume auction price variance. To verify the validity of the model
statistically, we predict a year's worth of daily closing price distributions
for 5 constituents of the Eurostoxx 50 index; Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and
QQ-plots demonstrate with ample statistical significance that the model
predicts closing price distributions accurately, and compares favourably with

resetting systems. Restart can either accelerate or hinder the completion of a
first passage process. The transition between these two phases is characterized
by the behavioral change in the order parameter of the system namely the
optimal restart rate. Like in the original theory of Landau, the optimal
restart rate can undergo a first or second order transition depending on the
details of the system. Nonetheless, there exists no unified framework which can
capture the onset of such novel phenomena. We unravel this in a comprehensive
manner and show how the transition can be understood by analyzing the first
passage time moments. Power of our approach is demonstrated in two canonical
paradigm setup namely the Michaelis Menten chemical reaction and diffusion
under restart.

orbiting a dominant central mass, gravitational potential of the disc plays an
important dynamical role. Its impact on the motion of external objects, as well
as on the dynamics of the disc itself, can usually be studied using secular
approximation. This is often done using softened gravity to avoid singularities
arising in calculation of the orbit-averaged potential --- disturbing function
--- of a razor-thin disc using classical Laplace-Lagrange theory. We explore
the performance of several softening formalisms proposed in the literature in
reproducing the correct eccentricity dynamics in the disc potential. We
identify softening models that, in the limit of zero softening, give results
converging to the expected behavior exactly, approximately or not converging at
all. We also develop a general framework for computing secular disturbing
function given an arbitrary softening prescription for a rather general form of
the interaction potential. Our results demonstrate that numerical treatments of
the secular disc dynamics, representing the disc as a collection of $N$
gravitationally interacting annuli, are rather demanding: for a given value of
the (dimensionless) softening parameter, $\varsigma\ll 1$, accurate
representation of eccentricity dynamics requires $N \sim C\varsigma^{-\chi}\gg
1$, with $C\sim O(10)$, $1.5\lesssim \chi\lesssim 2$. In discs with sharp edges
a very small value of the softening parameter $\varsigma$ ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$)
is required to correctly reproduce eccentricity dynamics near the disc
boundaries; this finding is relevant for modelling planetary rings.

poorly-decoded regions. Having observed that, in both cases, the detected

introduce a drastically different strategy: It relies on the intuition that the

Therefore, resynthesizing the image from the resulting semantic map will yield
significant appearance differences with respect to the input image. In other

planetary and stellar tides in their subsequent orbital decay have been
extensively studied in the context of planetary formation and evolution
theories. Planets orbiting close to their host stars undergo close encounters,
atmospheric photoevaporation, orbital evolution, and tidal interactions. In
many of these theoretical studies, it is assumed that the interior properties
of gas giants remain static during orbital evolution. Here we present a model
that allows for changes in the planetary radius as well as variations in the
planetary and stellar dissipation parameters, caused by the planet's
contraction and change of rotational rates from the strong tidal fields. In
this semi-analytical model, giant planets experience a much slower
tidal-induced circularization compared to models that do not consider these
instantaneous changes. We predict that the eccentricity damping time-scale
increases about an order of magnitude in the most extreme case for too inflated
planets, large eccentricities, and when the planet's tidal properties are
calculated according to its interior structural composition. This finding
potentially has significant implications on interpreting the
period-eccentricity distribution of known giant planets as it may naturally
explain the large number of non-circularized, close period currently known.
Additionally, this work may help to constrain some models of planetary
interiors, and contribute to a better insight about how tides affect the
orbital evolution of extrasolar systems.

  To keep its queue short, an AQM drops (or marks) packets to make the TCP

Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a
high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a
sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive
local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points

redMaPPer richness appears to be a better proxy for the expected present-day
galaxy cluster mass than for the mass at the observational redshift. Assuming
cosmology and galaxy cluster mass accretion history, it is possible to convert
$M(t_0)$ to the mass at the galaxy cluster redshift $M(t_z)$. We found a
significant evolution of the $\lambda(z)$-$M(t_z)$ over all the covered
redshift range. Consequently, we provide a new redshift-dependent richness-mass
relation for the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue. This results demonstrates
the efficiency of this new methodology to probe the evolution of scaling
relations compared to individual galaxy cluster mass estimation.

prospects for detection and identification. We consider very young star-forming
galaxies at $z=15$ and incorporate the contribution from pre-main-sequence
(PMS) stars. Unlike in the present-day galaxies, primordial protostars are not
embedded in dusty gas clouds, and hence the light from them can be visible at a
wide range of wavelengths. We use MESA code to follow the PMS evolution and use
the BT-Settl model to calculate the SED of individual PMS stars. We show that
PMS stars contribute to boost the flux in the mid-infrared, and that the galaxy
SED at very early evolutionary phases is overall redder than at later phases.
The infrared flux contribution is comparable to that caused by emission lines
powered by massive stars. We argue that the contribution from PMS stars is
important for characterizing young galaxies in the early Universe and also for
target selection with future deep galaxy surveys.

energy budget on specific critical components (e.g., pilot symbols,
acknowledgement packets, etc.) to (i) increase the jamming effectiveness, as
more targets can be jammed with the same energy budget; and (ii) decrease the
likelihood of being detected, as the channel is jammed for a shorter period of
time. One of the fundamental challenges in designing defense mechanisms against
an advanced jammer is understanding which jamming strategies yields the lowest
throughput, for a given channel condition and a given amount of energy. To the
best of our knowledge, this problem still remains unsolved. To fill this gap,
in this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of several most viable advanced
jamming schemes in the widely-used MIMO networks. We first mathematically model
a number of advanced jamming schemes at the signal processing level, so that a
quantitative relationship between the jamming energy and the jamming effect is
established. Based on the model, theorems are derived on the optimal advanced
jamming scheme for an arbitrary channel condition. The theoretical findings are
validated through extensive simulations and experiments on a 5-radio 2x2 MIMO
testbed. Our results show that the theorems are able to predict jamming
efficiency with high accuracy. Moreover, we show that the theorems can be
incorporated to state-of-art reinforcement learning based jamming algorithms

recent ideas from learning of unsupervised image denoisers to unstructured 3D

noisy pixel observation is a random realization of a distribution around a
clean pixel value, which allows appropriate learning on this distribution to
eventually converge to the correct value. Regrettably, this assumption is not
valid for unstructured points: 3D point clouds are subject to total noise, i.
e., deviations in all coordinates, with no reliable pixel grid. Thus, an
observation can be the realization of an entire manifold of clean 3D points,
which makes a na\""ive extension of unsupervised image denoisers to 3D point

steers converges to the unique closest out of the many possible modes on a

that of supervised learning with clean data when given enough training examples

Different mechanisms have been proposed to relate atrial
fibrillation (AF) and coronary flow impairment, even in absence of relevant
coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the underlying hemodynamics remains
unclear. Aim of the present work is to computationally explore whether and to
what extent ventricular rate during AF affects the coronary perfusion.
  Methods. AF is simulated at different ventricular rates (50, 70, 90, 110, 130
bpm) through a 0D-1D multiscale validated model, which combines the left
heart-arterial tree together with the coronary circulation. Artificially-built
RR stochastic extraction mimics the \emph{in vivo} beating features. All the
hemodynamic parameters computed are based on the left anterior descending (LAD)
artery and account for the waveform, amplitude and perfusion of the coronary
blood flow.
  Results. Alterations of the coronary hemodynamics are found to be associated
either to the heart rate increase, which strongly modifies waveform and
amplitude of the LAD flow rate, and to the beat-to-beat variability. The latter
is overall amplified in the coronary circulation as HR grows, even though the
input RR variability is kept constant at all HRs.
  Conclusions. Higher ventricular rate during AF exerts an overall coronary
blood flow impairment and imbalance of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand
ratio. The combined increase of heart rate and higher AF-induced hemodynamic
variability lead to a coronary perfusion impairment exceeding 90-110 bpm in AF.
Moreover, it is found that coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is no longer a
good measure of the myocardial perfusion for HR higher than 90 bpm.

for the outflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions
with respect to the plane of the disc. These are expressed in terms of the
global properties of the host galaxy and of the central AGN to allow for an
easy and direct comparison with existing observations in a variety of galactic
hosts with measured properties, and out to distances $\sim 10$ kpc from the
centre. The results are compared with a state-of-the-art compilation of
observed outflows in 19 galaxies with different measured gas and dynamical

for CT or MRI images because they contain overlapping shadows of
thoracoabdominal structures including lungs, bowel gases, and other bony
structures such as ribs. Additional difficulties include unclear object
boundaries, the complex shape of the vertebra, inter-patient variability, and

deep-learning methods. Pose-driven learning is used to selectively identify the
five lumbar vertebra in an accurate and robust manner. With knowledge of the
vertebral positions, M-net is employed to segment the individual vertebra.
Finally, fine-tuning segmentation is applied by combining the level-set method
with the previously obtained segmentation results. The performance of the
proposed method was validated using clinical data, resulting in center position

were brought to rest in 75~$\mu$s and over a distance of 33~mm and kept
stationary for times $t_{\mathrm{trap}}$ in the $0-525$~$\mu$s range, before
being re-accelerated for detection by pulsed field ionization. The use of a
home-built valve producing short gas pulses with a duration of about 20~$\mu$s
enabled the reduction of losses arising from collisions with atoms in the
trailing part of the gas pulses. Cooling the decelerator to 4.7~K further
suppressed losses by transitions induced by blackbody radiation and by
collisions with atoms desorbing from the decelerator surface. The main
contribution (60\%) to the atom loss during deceleration is attributed to the
escape out of the decelerator moving traps of atoms having energies higher than
the trap saddle point, spontaneous emission and collisions with atoms in the
trailing part of the gas pulses causing each only about 20\% of the atom loss.
At 4.7 K, the atom losses in the trapping phase of the experiments were found
to be almost exclusively caused by spontaneous emission and the trap lifetimes
were found to correspond to the natural lifetimes of the Rydberg-Stark states.
Increasing the temperature to 100 K enhanced the trap losses by transitions
stimulated by blackbody radiation.

to improve the performance of causality extraction, we introduce a multihead

Colony Optimisation (ACO) generally provides good solutions on small to medium

large and complex, in which ACO fails to scale well. Partial-ACO is a new ACO
variant designed to scale to larger problem instances. Therefore this paper
investigates the application of Partial-ACO on the problem of fleet
optimisation, demonstrating the capacity of Partial-ACO to successfully scale
to larger problems. Indeed, for real-world fleet optimisation problems supplied
by a Birmingham based company with up to 298 jobs and 32 vehicles, Partial-ACO
can improve upon their fleet traversal times by over 44%. Moreover, Partial-ACO
demonstrates its ability to scale with considerably improved results over

sub-regions are identified in the filament, and are supersonic with Mach number
of 2.7-4.0. The study of the dynamical states shows supercritical nature of the
sub-regions (except central part), which could not be supported by a
combination of thermal and turbulent motions. Young stellar objects are seen
toward the entire filament, but more concentrated toward its ends. Dense
molecular cores are observed mainly toward the filament ends, and are close to
virial equilibrium. Position-velocity plots trace velocity gradients (~1
km/s/pc) toward both the ends. An oscillatory pattern in velocity is also
observed toward the filament, indicating its fragmentation. The collapse
timescale of the filament is computed to be ~3.5 Myr. Using the 13CO data, the
structure function in velocity of the filament is found to be very similar as
seen in the Musca cloud for lags ~1-3 pc, and deviates from the Larson's
velocity-size relationship. The observed oscillatory pattern in the structure
function at higher lags suggests the existence of large-scale and ordered
velocity gradients as well as the fragmentation process through accretion along
the filament. Considering all the observed results along with their

respectively. No optical counterpart down to V=25.9 and I=24.7 (3$\sigma$) is
detected, which suggests a companion mass of 0.1-0.2 $M_\odot$. Combined with
the low X-ray luminosity, this is consistent with a black widow nature of PSR
J1636-2354A. Inspecting the 8-year Fermi-LAT catalogue, we found a $\gamma$-ray
source, 4FGL J1836.8-2354, with a positional uncertainty consistent with the
globular cluster, but not with the radio position of the millisecond pulsar.

turns out that the apparent shape and size of the shadow depend on the ASG
parameters ($\zeta, \gamma$) in addition to other black hole parameters ($M,
a$). The size of black hole shadows monotonically decreases and shadows get
more distorted with increasing values of ASG parameters when compared with the

hole spin and ASG parameters. Noteworthy, we find that the deflection angle of
the light has been modified by ASG parameters to generalize the Kerr deflection

In the vanishing limits of ASG parameters, our results smoothly reduced to the
Kerr black holes. The inferred circularity deviation $\Delta C\leq 0.10$ for
the M87* black hole shadow merely constrains the ASG parameter $\zeta$,

information about the microstructure of biological tissues via the frequency
dependence of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). ADC dependence on OGSE
frequency has been explored in numerous rodent studies, but applications in the
human brain have been limited and have suffered from low contrast between
different frequencies, long scan times and a limited exploration of the nature
of the ADC dependence on frequency. Methods: Multiple frequency OGSE
acquisitions were acquired in healthy subjects at 7 T to explore the power-law
frequency dependence of ADC, the ""diffusion dispersion"". Further, a method for
optimizing the estimation of the ADC difference between different OGSE
frequencies was developed, which enabled the design of a highly efficient
protocol for mapping diffusion dispersion. Results: For the first time,
evidence of a linear dependence of ADC on the square root of frequency in
healthy human white matter was obtained. Using the optimized protocol, high
quality, full-brain maps of apparent diffusion dispersion rate were also
demonstrated at an isotropic resolution of 2 mm in a scan time of 6 minutes.
Conclusion: This work sheds light on the nature of diffusion dispersion in the
healthy human brain and introduces full brain diffusion dispersion mapping at
clinically relevant scan times. These advances may lead to new biomarkers of
pathology or improved microstructural modelling.

effects of structures such as neighborhood or school. The RE approach has
recently been applied to age-period-cohort (APC) models that are unidentified
because the predictors are exactly linearly dependent. However, it has not been
fully understood how the RE specification identifies these otherwise
unidentified APC models. We address this challenge by first making explicit
that RE-APC models have greater -- not less -- rank deficiency than the
traditional fixed-effects model, followed by two empirical examples. We then
provide intuition and a mathematical proof to explain that for APC models with
one RE, treating one effect as an RE is equivalent to constraining the
estimates of that effect's linear component and the random intercept to be
zero. For APC models with two RE's, the effective constraints implied by the
model depend on the true (i.e., in the data-generating mechanism) non-linear
components of the effects that are modeled as RE's, so that the estimated
linear components of the RE's are determined by the true non-linear components
of those effects. In conclusion, RE-APC models impose arbitrary though highly
obscure constraints and thus do not differ qualitatively from other constrained
APC estimators.

construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects
distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of
the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely
on numerical integration to reveal that only the Bayesian method achieves both
unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and
consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our
simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments
demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations
and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental
efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian

high as that of an ideally mixed solid solution (SS) of multiple elements in
near-equal proportions. However, enthalpic interactions inevitably render such
chemically disordered SSs rare and metastable, except at very high
temperatures. Here we highlight a structural feature that sets these
concentrated SSs apart from traditional solvent-solute ones: the HEAs possess a
wide variety of (local) chemical ordering (LCO). Our atomistic simulations
employing an empirical interatomic potential for NiCoCr reveal that the LCO of
the multi-principal-element SS changes conspicuously with alloy processing
conditions, producing a wide range of generalized planar fault energy in terms
of both its sample-average and spatial variation. We further demonstrate that
the LCO heightens the ruggedness of the energy landscape and raises activation
barriers governing dislocation activities. This not only influences the
selection of dislocation pathways in slip, faulting, twinning, and martensitic
transformation, but also increases the lattice friction to dislocation motion
via a new mechanism of nanoscale segment detrapping that elevates the
mechanical strength. All these open a vast playground not accessible to
ground-state SSs or intermetallics, offering rich opportunities to tune
properties.

using n(lm+l+m-1)/2 multiplications if m is odd and using (n(lm+l+m-1)+l-1)/2
multiplications if m is even. Waksman's and Islam's algorithm for odd n needs
(n-1)(lm+l+m-1)/2+lm multiplications [10,19], thus in both cases less
multiplications are required by our algorithm. We also give an algorithm for
even n using n(lm+l+m-1)/2 multiplications without making use of divisions,

Furthermore we present a novelty for matrix multiplication: In this paper we
show that some non-bilinear algorithms with special properties can be used as
recursive algorithms. In comparison to bilinear algorithms for small nxn
matrices say n<20 we obtain some better results. From these non-bilinear
algorithms we finally obtain approximate non-bilinear algorithms. For instance
we obtain an approximate non-bilinear algorithm for 5x5 matrices that uses only

offers an alternative for predicting upcoming machine failures based on

  In this paper, we introduce a cut-free sequent calculus for game logic, and
two cut-free sequent calculi that manipulate annotated formulas, one for game

mu-calculus where the semantics is given by monotone neighbourhood models
instead of Kripke structures. We show these systems are sound and complete, and
that completeness of Parikh's axiomatization follows. Our approach builds on
recent ideas and results by Afshari & Leigh (LICS 2017) in that we obtain

has been studied since 1992, primarily through comparisons with the

Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. In this paper, we introduce a DP-coloring analogue
of the chromatic polynomial called the DP color function, denoted
$P_{DP}(G,m)$, and ask several fundamental open questions about it, making
progress on some of them. Motivated by known results related to the list color
function, we show that while the DP color function behaves similar to the list
color function for some graphs, there are also some surprising differences. For
example, Wang, Qian, and Yan recently showed that if $G$ is a connected graph
with $l$ edges, then $P_{\ell}(G,m)=P(G,m)$ whenever $m > \frac{l-1}{\ln(1+

$G$, with girth $g$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) < P(G,m)$ when $m$ is sufficiently

graph $G$. We develop techniques to compute $P_{DP}(G,m)$ exactly and apply
them to certain classes of graphs such as chordal graphs, unicyclic graphs, and
cycles with a chord. Finally, we make progress towards showing that for any

system (IFS) and the affinity dimension, defined as the unique solution $s_0$
to $P(s_0)=1$, were introduced by K. Falconer in his seminal 1988 paper on
self-affine fractals. The affinity dimension prescribes a value for the
Hausdorff dimension of a self-affine set which is known to be correct in
generic cases and in an increasing range of explicit cases. It was shown by
Feng and Shmerkin in 2014 that the affinity dimension depends continuously on
the IFS. In this article we prove that when the linear parts of the affinities
which define the IFS are $2 \times 2$ matrices which strictly preserve a common
cone, the sub-additive pressure is locally real analytic as a function of the
matrix coefficients of the linear parts of the affinities. In this setting we
also show that the sub-additive pressure is piecewise real analytic in $s$,
implying that the affinity dimension is locally analytic in the matrix
coefficients. Combining this with a recent result of B\'ar\'any, Hochman and
Rapaport we obtain results concerning the analyticity of the Hausdorff
dimension for certain families of planar self-affine sets.

microlensing campaign. This is a remarkable microlensing event because its
source is photometrically bright and variable, which makes it possible to
perform an asteroseismic analysis using ground-based data. We find that the
source star is an oscillating red giant with average timescale of $\sim 9$ d.
The asteroseismic analysis also provides us source properties including the
source angular size ($\sim 27~\mu{\rm as}$) and distance ($\sim 11.5$ kpc),
which are essential for inferring the properties of the lens. When fitting the
light curve, we test the feasibility of Gaussian Processes (GPs) in handling
the correlated noise caused by the variable source. We find that the parameters
from the GP model are generally more loosely constrained than those from the
traditional $\chi^2$ minimization method. We note that this event is the first
microlensing system for which asteroseismology and GPs have been used to
account for the variable source. With both finite-source effect and microlens
parallax measured, we find that the lens is likely a $\sim 0.045~M_{\odot}$
brown dwarf at distance $\sim 9.0$ kpc, or a $\sim 0.073~M_{\odot}$ ultracool
dwarf at distance $\sim 9.8$ kpc. Combining the estimated lens properties with
a Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model, we find a $\sim 35$ per cent
probability for the lens to be a bulge object and $\sim 65$ per cent to be a
background disc object.

related to the non-smoothness of the friction law we have studied two models:
(model I) a friction-excited chain of weakly coupled oscillators excited by a
frictional moving belt and (model II) a chain of Van der Pol oscillators. The
two models show very similar dynamical features. Both exhibit discrete
breathers (i.e. spatially localized periodic solutions) solutions for low
coupling and show propagation along the chain of high amplitude limit cycles
for stronger elastic coupling between the unit cells. In both models the
transition from discrete breathers to propagating limit cycles happens through
a nucleation process and, above a certain critical coupling, the velocity of
propagation scales linearly with the elastic coupling coefficient. We suggest
that dynamical features similar to what was demonstrated in this work are
expected for models that are different quantitatively but preserve the same
single-unit topology.

for rigid bodies in intermittent contact with each other where the contact is
assumed to be a planar non-convex contact patch. The planar non-convex contact
patch can either be a topologically connected set or disconnected set. Such
algorithms are useful in planning and control for robotic manipulation. Most
works in rigid body dynamic simulation assume that the contact between objects
is a point contact, which may not be valid in many applications. In this paper,
by using the convex hull of the contact patch, we build on our recent work on
simulating rigid bodies with convex contact patches, for simulating the motion
of objects with planar non-convex contact patches. We formulate a discrete-time
mixed complementarity problem where we solve the contact detection and
integration of the equations of motion simultaneously. Thus, our method is a
geometrically-implicit method and we prove that in our formulation, there is no
artificial penetration between the contacting rigid bodies. We solve for the
equivalent contact point (ECP) and contact impulse of each contact patch
simultaneously along with the state, i.e., configuration and velocity of the
objects. We provide empirical evidence to show that our method can seamlessly
capture the transition between different contact modes like patch contact to
multiple or single point contact during the simulation.

is widely associated with the merger of compact objects. Several studies have
modelled the evolution of the electromagnetic emission using the synchrotron
emission produced by the deceleration of both a relativistic top-hat jet seen
off-axis, and a wide-angle quasi-spherical outflow (both using numerical
studies). In this study we present an analytical model of the synchrotron and
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission for an off-axis top-hat jet and a
quasi-spherical outflow. We calculate the light curves obtained from an
analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or
slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow
are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We
show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger
than that of the off-axis jet during the first $\sim$ 10 - 20 days, and weaker
during the next $\gtrsim$ 80 days. Moreover, we show that if the off-axis jet
is decelerated in a wind-like medium, then the SSC emission is very likely to
be detected. Applying a MCMC code to our model (for synchrotron emission only),
we find the best-fit values for the radio, optical and X-ray emission of GRB
170817A which are in accordance with observations. For GRB 170817A, we find
using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical
outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase as $F_\nu\propto t^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha\lesssim 0.8$ and $\alpha>3$, respectively. Finally, we obtain the
correspondent SSC light curves which are in accordance with the
very-high-energy gamma-ray upper limits derived with the GeV - TeV

been an outstanding problem for many years. We offer a simple solution to this
problem in two dimensions that is based on our solution to another more basic
open problem of scattering theory, namely finding scattering potentials
$v(x,y)$ in two dimensions whose scattering problem is exactly solvable for
energies not exceeding a critical value $E_c$. This extends the notion of
quasi-exact solvability to scattering theory and yields a simple condition
under which the first Born approximation gives the exact expression for the
scattering amplitude whenever the wavenumber for the incident wave is not
greater than $\alpha:=\sqrt{E_c}$. Because this condition only restricts the
$y$-dependence of $v(x,y)$, we can use it to determine classes of such
potentials that have certain desirable scattering features. This leads to a
partial inverse scattering scheme that we employ to achieve perfect broadband
unidirectional invisibility in two dimensions. We discuss an optical
realization of the latter by identifying a class of two-dimensional isotropic
active media that do not scatter incident TE waves with wavenumber in the range
$(\alpha/\sqrt 2,\alpha]$ and source located at $x=\infty$, while scattering
the same waves if their source is relocated to $x=-\infty$.

believed that successful cultural products balance novelty and conventionality:
they provide something familiar but at least somewhat divergent from what has
come before, and occupy a satisfying middle ground between ""more of the same""
and ""too strange"". We test this belief using a large dataset of over half a
million works of fanfiction from the website Archive of Our Own (AO3), looking
at how the recognition a work receives varies with its novelty. We quantify the
novelty through a term-based language model, and a topic model, in the context
of existing works within the same fandom. Contrary to the balance theory, we
find that the lowest-novelty are the most popular and that popularity declines
monotonically with novelty. A few exceptions can be found: extremely popular
works that are among the highest novelty within the fandom. Taken together, our
findings not only challenge the traditional theory of the hedonic value of
novelty, they invert it: people prefer the least novel things, are repelled by
the middle ground, and have an occasional enthusiasm for extreme outliers. It
suggests that cultural evolution must work against inertia --- the appetite
people have to continually reconsume the familiar, and may resemble a
punctuated equilibrium rather than a smooth evolution.

  We partition the set of CM points of sufficiently high conductor in $X_{{\bf
Q}_{p}}$ into finitely many explicit `basins' $B_{V}$, indexed by the
irreducible components $V $ of the mod-$p$ reduction of the canonical model of
$X$. We prove that a sequence $z_{n}$ of local Galois orbits of CM points with
$p$-conductor going to infinity has a limit in $X_{p}^{\rm an}$ if and only if
it is eventually supported in a single basin $B_{V}$. If so, the limit is the
unique point of $X_{p}^{\rm an}$ whose mod-$p$ reduction is the generic point
of $V$.
  The result is proved in the more general setting of Shimura curves over
totally real fields. The proof combines Gross's theory of quasicanonical
liftings with a new formula for the intersection numbers of CM curves and
vertical components in a Lubin--Tate space.

with the tadpole/seagull term, which renormalized version called, {\sl the mass
gap}. It is explicitly present in the full gluon self-energy. The true
dynamical role of the mass gap was hidden in the QCD ground state. To disclose
it the splintering between the transverse conditions for the full gluon
self-energy and its subtracted counterpart has been derived. We have
established the equation of motion for the full gluon propagator on account of
the mass gap. It allows to fix the dynamical and gauge structures of the full
gluon propagator with a newly-derived generalized gauge. It is uniquely given
as a function of the gluon momentum. All this makes it possible to present
novel non-perturbative analytical approach to QCD, which we call the mass gap
approach. It extends the mass gap concept to be accounted for the QCD ground
state as well. We have found the general non-perturbative solution for the full
gluon propagator with exactly defined finite gluon pole mass, and it is
different from the excitations with the effective gluon masses. Despite the
exact gauge symmetry is broken in the ground state, the renormalizability of
the theory is not affected due to the important role of the Slavnov-Taylor
identity in the renormalization beyond the perturbation theory. For this the
non-perturbative multiplicative renormalization program for the full massive
gluon propagator has been formulated. Our approach does not allow the massive
gluons to be the mass-shell objects, and thus prevents them to appear as
physical states at large distances (confinement of massive gluons).

interstellar dust much further from the star than the position of the bow shock
created by an interaction of the stellar and interstellar plasma flows. In this
case the number density of dust for a certain dust grains radius can be
calculated analytically based on the classical `cold model'. The dust density
distribution for the mixture of dust grains with different radii is calculated.
We also calculated intensity maps of the thermal infrared emission at 24~$\mu$m
from dust due to heating by the stellar radiation. It is shown that the
obtained maps of the infrared emission extremely depends on the model
parameters: material of dust grains, dust size distribution assumed in the
interstellar medium, the approach used to calculate the dust temperature. The
bright distinct arc at the intensity maps is seen for graphite dust grains and
almost disappears for silicates. Absolute values of intensity in the case of
graphite are several order of magnitudes larger than for silicates due to more
intensive heating of graphite. Possible application of the presented theory is
proposed as an algorithm for analysis of the observational images of the

metric space into a low-dimensional Euclidean space in a way that best
preserves pairwise distances. We study a notion of MDS on infinite metric
measure spaces, along with its optimality properties and goodness of fit. This
allows us to study the MDS embeddings of the geodesic circle $S^1$ into
$\mathbb{R}^m$ for all $m$, and to ask questions about the MDS embeddings of
the geodesic $n$-spheres $S^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$. Furthermore, we address
questions on convergence of MDS. For instance, if a sequence of metric measure
spaces converges to a fixed metric measure space $X$, then in what sense do the
MDS embeddings of these spaces converge to the MDS embedding of $X$?
Convergence is understood when each metric space in the sequence has the same
finite number of points, or when each metric space has a finite number of
points tending to infinity. We are also interested in notions of convergence
when each metric space in the sequence has an arbitrary (possibly infinite)
number of points.

A variety of applications
consider utility in real-life situations, which has lead to the emergence of
utility-oriented mining (also called utility mining) in the recent decade.
Utility mining has attracted a great amount of attention, but most of the
existing studies have been developed to deal with itemset-based data.
Time-ordered sequence data is more commonly seen in real-world situations,
which is different from itemset-based data. Since they are time-consuming and
require large amount of memory usage, current utility mining algorithms still
have limitations when dealing with sequence data. In addition, the mining
efficiency of utility mining on sequence data still needs to be improved,
especially for long sequences or when there is a low minimum utility threshold.
In this paper, we propose an efficient Projection-based Utility Mining (ProUM)
approach to discover high-utility sequential patterns from sequence data. The
utility-array structure is designed to store the necessary information of the
sequence-order and utility. ProUM can significantly improve the mining
efficiency by utilizing the projection technique in generating utility-array,
and it effectively reduces the memory consumption. Furthermore, a new upper
bound named sequence extension utility is proposed and several pruning
strategies are further applied to improve the efficiency of ProUM. By taking
utility theory into account, the derived high-utility sequential patterns have
more insightful and interesting information than other kinds of patterns.
Experimental results showed that the proposed ProUM algorithm significantly
outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of execution time, memory
usage, and scalability.

recommendations to a user where the feedback is typically limited to an
accept/reject or a rating model. However, these simple modes of feedback may
only provide limited insights as to why a user likes or dislikes an item and
what aspects of the item the user has considered. Interactive recommender
systems present an opportunity to engage the user in the process by allowing
them to interact with the recommendations, provide feedback and impact the
results in real-time. Evaluation of the impact of the user interaction
typically requires an extensive user study which is time consuming and gives
researchers limited opportunities to tune their solutions without having to
conduct multiple rounds of user feedback. Additionally, user experience and
design aspects can have a significant impact on the user feedback which may
result in not necessarily assessing the quality of some of the underlying
algorithmic decisions in the overall solution. As a result, we present an
evaluation framework which aims to simulate the users interacting with the
recommender. We formulate metrics to evaluate the quality of the interactive
recommenders which are outputted by the framework once simulation is completed.
While simulation along is not sufficient to evaluate a complete solution, the
results can be useful to help researchers tune their solution before moving to

around $T'_{\rm 90}\sim 4000$ s, $E'_{\rm p,c}\sim 0.7$ keV, $E'_{\rm iso,c}
\sim 8\times10^{49}$ erg and $L'_{\rm iso,c}\sim 2.5\times10^{46}$ erg

also find that the values of ${\Gamma_0}$ are broadly distributed between few

model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched
until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches

designated M51 OT2019-1 (also ZTF19aadyppr, AT 2019abn, ATLAS19bzl), by the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The OT rose over 15 days to an observed
luminosity of $M_r=-13$ (${\nu}L_{\nu}=9\times10^6~L_{\odot}$), in the
luminosity gap between novae and typical supernovae (SNe). Spectra during the
outburst show a red continuum, Balmer emission with a velocity width of
$\approx400$ km s$^{-1}$, Ca II and [Ca II] emission, and absorption features
characteristic of an F-type supergiant. The spectra and multiband light curves
are similar to the so-called ""SN impostors"" and intermediate-luminosity red
transients (ILRTs). We directly identify the likely progenitor in archival
Spitzer Space Telescope imaging with a $4.5~\mu$m luminosity of
$M_{[4.5]}\approx-12.2$ and a $[3.6]-[4.5]$ color redder than 0.74 mag, similar
to those of the prototype ILRTs SN 2008S and NGC 300 OT2008-1. Intensive
monitoring of M51 with Spitzer further reveals evidence for variability of the
progenitor candidate at [4.5] in the years before the OT. The progenitor is not
detected in pre-outburst Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR images. The
optical colors during outburst combined with spectroscopic temperature
constraints imply a higher reddening of $E(B-V)\approx0.7$ mag and higher
intrinsic luminosity of $M_r\approx-14.9$
(${\nu}L_{\nu}=5.3\times10^7~L_{\odot}$) near peak than seen in previous ILRT
candidates. Moreover, the extinction estimate is higher on the rise than on the
plateau, suggestive of an extended phase of circumstellar dust destruction.
These results, enabled by the early discovery of M51 OT2019-1 and extensive
pre-outburst archival coverage, offer new clues about the debated origins of
ILRTs and may challenge the hypothesis that they arise from the
electron-capture induced collapse of extreme asymptotic giant branch stars.

of their defining equivalence classes. Those are determined by a pair of
scaling exponents taking into account a large number of microstates as for the
thermodynamical limit. Yet, a generalisation to this formulation makes it
possible to establish an entropic connection between Markovian and
non-Markovian statistical systems through a set of fundamental entropies
$S_{\pm}$, which have been studied in other contexts and exhibit, among their
attributes, two interesting aspects: They behave as additive for a large number
of degrees of freedom while they are substantially non-additive for a small
number of them. Furthermore, an ample amount of special entropy measures,
either additive or non-additive, are contained in such asymptotic
classification. Under this scheme we analyse the equivalence classes of
Tsallis, Sharma-Mittal and R\'enyi entropies and study their features in the
thermodynamic limit as well as the correspondences among them.

address the accelerating risk of failure in providing essential services such
as water supply today and in the future. Here, we investigate the resilience of
urban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that
citizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability
and robustness of critical system elements, or 'capitals' (water resources,
infrastructure, finances, management efficacy and community adaptation). We
translate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven
contrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled systems
dynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks,
and we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges
under various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio.
Systematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water
resilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a
continuous gradient from water insecure and non-resilient to secure and
resilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge
steady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and
non-resilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have
developed excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping
point from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are
insufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to
varying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the
governance of urban water systems under global change pressures.

passive sensing system which focuses on the reference signals embedded in the
sub-frames of LTE resource grid. It compares the received signal with the
expected reference signal, extracts the evaluated channel state information
(CSI) and analyzes it to estimate the change in the environment. For vehicle
detection and subsequent classification, our setup is similar to a passive
radar in forward scattering radar (FSR) mode. Instead of performing the radio
frequency (RF) signals directly, we take advantage of the processing that
happens in a LTE receiver user equipment (UE). We tap into the channel
estimation and equalization block and extract the CSI value. CSI value reflects
the property of the communication channel between communication base station
(eNodeB) and UE. We use CSI values for with and vehicle and without vehicle
case in outdoor open road environment. Being a receiver only system, there is
no need for any transmission and related regulations. Therefore, this system is
low cost, power efficient and difficult to detect. Also, most of its processing
will be done by the existing LTE communication receiver (UE). In this paper, we
establish our claim by analyzing field-collected data. Live LTE downlink (DL)
signal is captured using modeled LTE UE using software defined radio (SDR). The
detection analysis and classification performance shows promising results and
ascertains that, LTE-CommSense is capable of detection and classification of
different types of vehicles in outdoor road environment.

for big spatial data is access. This can be achieved through space-filling
curves, as they have the property that nearby points on the curve are also
nearby in space. They are able to handle higher dimensional data, too. Higher
dimensional data is widely used e.g. in CityGML and is becoming more and more
important. In a laboratory experiment on a tropical rain forest tree data set
of 2.5 million points taken from an 18-dimensional space, it is demonstrated
that the recently constructed scaled Gray-Hilbert curve index performs better
than its standard static version, saving a significant amount of space for a
projection of the data set onto 8 attributes. The implementation is based on a
binary tree in a data-driven process, in a similar way as e.g. the R-tree. Its
scalability allows the handling of different kinds of data distributions which
are reflected in the tree structure of the index. The relative efficiency of
the scaled Gray-Hilbert curve in comparison with the best static version is
seen to depend on the distribution of the point cloud. A local sparsity measure
derived from properties of the corresponding trees can distinguish point clouds
with different tail distributions. The different resulting binary trees are
visualised to illustrate the influences of the different tail distributions

well-posed, due to the passive pressure. One of the implications is that the
anomalous energy dissipation, anticipated by Onsager (1949), cannot occur in
inviscid flows. In the complete absence of viscous effects, the ultimate
accumulation of enstrophy in sealed domains is bound to become arbitrarily

and also made great progress in sematic segmentation. As a result, many
researchers also believe that deep learning is the most powerful tool for pixel
level image segmentation. Could deep learning achieve the same pixel level
accuracy as traditional image segmentation techniques by mapping the features
of the object into a non-linear function? This paper gives a short survey of
the accuracies achieved by deep learning so far in image classification and
image segmentation. Compared to the high accuracies achieved by deep learning
in classifying limited categories in international vision challenges, the image
segmentation accuracies achieved by deep learning in the same challenges are
only about eighty percent. On the contrary, the image segmentation accuracies
achieved in international biomedical challenges are close to ninty five
percent. Why the difference is so big? Since the accuracies of the competitors
methods are only evaluated based on their submitted results instead of
reproducing the results by submitting the source codes or the software, are the
achieved accuracies verifiable or overhyped? We are going to find it out by
analyzing the working principle of deep learning. Finally, we compared the
accuracies of state of the art deep learning methods with a threshold selection
method quantitatively. Experimental results showed that the threshold selection
method could achieve significantly higher accuracy than deep learning methods
in image segmentation.

engineering method in the field of pipe network calculation. Only electrical
analogs of hydraulic networks were used before the Hardy Cross method. A
problem with flow resistance versus electrical resistance makes these
electrical analog methods obsolete. The method by Hardy Cross is taught
extensively at faculties, and it remains an important tool for the analysis of
looped pipe systems. Engineers today mostly use a modified Hardy Cross method
which considers the whole looped network of pipes simultaneously (use of these
methods without computers is practically impossible). A method from a Russian
practice published during the 1930s, which is similar to the Hardy Cross
method, is described, too. Some notes from the work of Hardy Cross are also
presented. Finally, an improved version of the Hardy Cross method, which
significantly reduces the number of iterations, is presented and discussed. We
also tested multi-point iterative methods, which can be used as a substitution
for the Newton-Raphson approach used by Hardy Cross, but in this case this
approach did not reduce the number of iterations. Although many new models have
been developed since the time of Hardy Cross, the main purpose of this paper is
to illustrate the very beginning of modelling of gas and water pipe networks
and ventilation systems. As a novelty, a new multi-point iterative solver is
introduced and compared with the standard Newton-Raphson iterative method.

from the compensation of emission losses due to the polymorphic nature of the

STREL a novel spatio-temporal logic that enables the specification of
spatio-temporal requirements and their monitoring over the execution of mobile

two novel spatial operators reach and escape from which is possible to derive
other spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround. These
operators enable a monitoring procedure where the satisfaction of the property
at each location depends only on the satisfaction of its neighbours, opening
the way to future distributed online monitoring algorithms. We propose both a
qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint semirings, an
algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and optimisation. We
prove that, for a subclass of models, all the spatial properties expressed with
reach and escape, using euclidean distance, satisfy all the model
transformations using rotation, reflection and translation. Finally, we provide
an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and, to demonstrate the feasibility

$f_{\rm IGM}$, is not properly constrained. Here we propose a method of
estimating $f_{\rm IGM}$ using a putative sample of FRBs with the measurements
of both DM and luminosity distance $d_{\rm L}$. The latter can be obtained if
the FRB is associated with a distance indicator (e.g. a gamma-ray burst or a
gravitational wave event), or the redshift $z$ of the FRB is measured and
$d_{\rm L}$ at the corresponding $z$ is available from other distance
indicators (e.g. type Ia supernovae) at the same redshift. Since $d_{\rm
L}/{\rm DM}$ essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method
can determine $f_{\rm IGM}$ independent of cosmological parameters. We
parameterize $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift and model the DM
contribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming
$f_{\rm IGM}$ has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by
means of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and
cosmology-independent estimate of the present value of $f_{\rm IGM}$ with a
$\sim 12\%$ uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of $d_{\rm

The major challenge has been to determine whether these materials are
fundamentally different from or essentially similar to their hole-doped

strongly constrain the possible explanations for what is the essential physics
that leads to high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates, which is
still not agreed upon. Here we argue that experimental results over the past 30
years on electron-doped cuprate materials have provided conclusive answers to
these fundamental questions, by establishing that both in hole- and
electron-doped cuprates, superconductivity originates in pairing of hole
carriers in the same band. We discuss a model to describe this physics that is
different from the generally accepted ones, and calculate physical observables
that agree with experiment, in particular tunneling characteristics. We argue
that our model is simpler, more natural and more compelling than other models.

energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved
yet due to its challenging nature. The gap in the literature is due to the
advancements in the technology and drawbacks of the optimization algorithms and
the introduction of different new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly
proposed optimization algorithms which have produced better accuracy on the
benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of
energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a
detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of
energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. The detailed discussion has
been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort,
visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge
computing techniques used in smart homes.

set $SH(\mathbf{S}) = \{p(X) \equiv (Tr(A_1 X), \dots, Tr(A_m X))^T : X \in
\mathbf{\Delta}_n\}$, where ${\bf \Delta}_n$ is the {\it spectraplex}, $\{ X

membership} (SHM) to be the problem of testing if a given $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$
lies in $SH(\mathbf{S})$. On the one hand when $A_i$'s are diagonal matrices,
SHM reduces to the {\it convex hull membership} (CHM), a fundamental problem in
LP. On the other hand, a bounded SDP feasibility is reducible to SHM. By
building on the {\it Triangle Algorithm} (TA) \cite{kalchar,kalsep}, developed
for CHM and its generalization, we design a TA for SHM, where given
$\varepsilon$, in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations it either computes a
hyperplane separating $b$ from $SH(\mathbf{S})$, or $X_\varepsilon \in
\mathbf{\Delta}_n$ such that $\Vert p(X_\varepsilon) - b \Vert \leq \varepsilon
R$, $R$ maximum error over $\mathbf{\Delta}_n$. Under certain conditions
iteration complexity improves to $O(1/\varepsilon)$ or even $O(\ln
1/\varepsilon)$. The worst-case complexity of each iteration is $O(mn^2)$, plus
testing the existence of a pivot, shown to be equivalent to estimating the
least eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix. This together with a semidefinite
version of Carath\'eodory theorem allow implementing TA as if solving a CHM,
resorting to the {\it power method} only as needed, thereby improving the
complexity of iterations. The proposed Triangle Algorithm for SHM is simple,
practical and applicable to general SDP feasibility and optimization. Also, it
extends to a spectral analogue of SVM for separation of two spectrahulls.

a unique fuel economy database (fueleconomy.gov), users self-reported fuel
economy estimates and government fuel economy ratings are analyzed for more

complicated owing to the presence of important methodological concerns
including potential interrelationship between vehicles within the same garage
and unobserved heterogeneity. To address these concerns, bivariate seemingly
unrelated fixed and random parameter models are presented. With government test
cycle ratings tending to over-estimate the actual on-road fuel economy, a
significant variation is observed in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles
across garages. A wide variety of factors such as driving style, fuel economy
calculation method, and several vehicle specific characteristics are
considered. Drivers who drive for maximum gas mileage or drives with the
traffic flow have greater on-road fuel economy relative to the government
official ratings. Contrarily, volatile drivers have smaller on-road fuel
economy relative to the official ratings. Compared to the previous findings,
our analysis suggests that the relationship between fuel type and fuel economy
gaps is complex and not unidirectional. Regarding several vehicle and
manufacturer related variables, the effects do not just significantly vary in
magnitude but also in the direction, underscoring the importance of accounting

  Against GPS Spoofing","Accepted to IEEE Internet of Things Journal",,,,"cs.SY cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One prominent security threat that targets unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is
the capture via GPS spoofing in which an attacker manipulates a UAV's global
positioning system (GPS) signals in order to capture it. Given the anticipated
widespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop
new security solutions against such attacks. In this paper, a mathematical
framework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS
spoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the
optimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS
spoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this
end, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically
derived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack.
Then, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS
spoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative
localization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs
instead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the
proposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model
the interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the
drone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light
of the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the
game are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed
algorithm. Simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg
strategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy
selection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture

dissemination schemes in VANETs. To this end, an actor-based modeling language,
Rebeca, is used which is equipped with a variety of model checking engines. To
illustrate the applicability of VeriVANca, modeling and analysis of two warning
message dissemination schemes are presented. Some scenarios for these schemes
are presented to show that concurrent behaviors of the system components may
cause uncertainty in both behavior and performance which may not be detected by
simulation-based techniques. Furthermore, the scalability of VeriVANca is
examined by analyzing a middle-sized model.

affected reference signals of LTE downlink signal to obtain knowledge about the
environmental change. This work presents the characterization of LTE-CommSense
instrument to detect presence or absence of objects in outdoor environment.
Additionally, we analyze its capability of detecting and distinguishing when
multiple objects are present. For performance evaluation and characterization
of this instrument, we derive object detection accuracy, FAR, FRR and
resolution which we believe are the most important figures of merit in this
case. As the operation of LTE-CommSense is to detect events instead of objects,
we redefine the concept of resolution for LTE-CommSense. Two different
proposals to represent the redefined resolution viz. Neyman Pearson principle
based and Cramer Rao principle based resolution are presented here. All the
performance metrics are derived using practical data captured using an SDR
platform modeled as a LTE-CommSense receiver. We observe that, LTE-CommSense
provides better performance in detecting presence or absence of objects at near
range.

studies are being proceeded to build cloud applications with exquisite quality
based on users demands. In achieving the same, one of the applied criteria is
checkpoint based load balancing in real time scheduling through which suitable
cloud service is chosen from a group of cloud services candidates. Valuable
information can be collected to rank the services within this checkpoint based
load balancing. In order to attain ranking, different services are needed to be
invoked in the cloud, which is time consuming and wastage of services
invocation. To avoid the same, this chapter proposes an algorithm for
predicting the ranks of different cloud services by using the values from
previously offered services.

the end of their contracts or at the time of leaving the company. It is a
defined benefit plan and is often given as an alternative to a pension plan. In
Botswana, there is now a new pattern whereby companies give their employees the
option to receive their gratuity at various stages before the end of their
contracts. In particular, some companies give their employees an option to
receive their gratuity on a monthly basis rather than having them wait for a
year or more. Many employees find this option attractive, but is it
economically sound? This paper sheds light on this question by quantifying the
economic benefits of the tax relief provided by government relative to
investing the monthly-received funds in a risk-free savings account or helping
repay a loan. The principles and methods used herein can be adapted and applied
to different taxation systems.
