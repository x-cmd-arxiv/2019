successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta,
Nadam are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential
moving averages of squared past gradients. In many applications, e.g. learning
with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these
algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in
nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the
exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit
example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to
the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous
analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues
can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past
gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix
the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.

this reason, it provides new mechanisms of pattern formation. In particular,
active gels made of protein motors and filaments are far-from-equilibrium
systems that exhibit spontaneous flow,[Kruse2004, Voituriez2005] leading to
active turbulence in two and three dimensions[Sanchez2012, Kumar2018] and
coherent flow in three dimensions[Wu2017] (3D). Although these dynamic flows
reveal a characteristic length scale resulting from the interplay between
active forcing and passive restoring forces, the observation of static and
long-range spatial patterns in active gels has remained elusive. In this work,
we demonstrate that a 2D free-standing nematic active gel, formed spontaneously
by depletion forces from a 3D solution of kinesin motors and microtubule
filaments, actively buckles out-of-plane into a centimeter-sized periodic
corrugated sheet that is stable for several days at low activity. Importantly,
the corrugations are formed in the absence of flow and their wavelength and
stability are controlled by the motor concentration, in agreement with a
hydrodynamic theory. At higher activities these patterns are transient with the
gel becoming turbulent at longer times. Our results underline the importance of
both passive and active forces in shaping active gels and indicate that a
static material can be sculpted through an active mechanism.

  Estimation","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1805.10410",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain
stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision
data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion
of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement
unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman
filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design.
This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic
corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact
points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous
differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable
state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is
independent of the system's trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither
the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on
the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties
and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying
nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases,
add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric
versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly
used quaternion-based EKF though both simulations and experiments on a
Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture,
while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the
developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with
the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in

proposed, which exploits the specific properties of the feedback signal and is
suitable for non-stationary signal distributions. The method is evaluated for

excellent performance, even with $1$-bit quantization. In addition, it is shown
that learning is surprisingly robust to noisy feedback where random bit flips

the companion and red giant core shrinks from 52 $\rm{R}_{\odot}$ to 3.6

isolated resonances exist, decaying Rabi oscillations may occur. The
overlapping of exciton-polariton resonances also affects strongly the decay
dynamics at close distances to the nanodisk, giving rise to complex decaying
population oscillations. At very close distances of the emitter to the nanodisk
the ultrastrong coupling regime appears, where after a very fast oscillatory

$(\epsilon,\delta)$-second-order stationary point with
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\delta^4 + n/\delta^3)$
stochastic gradient complexity for nonconvex finite-sum problems. As a
by-product, SSRGD finds an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point with
$O(n+\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. These results are almost
optimal since Fang et al. [2018] provided a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ for finding even just an $\epsilon$-first-order
stationary point. We emphasize that SSRGD algorithm for finding second-order
stationary points is as simple as for finding first-order stationary points
just by adding a uniform perturbation sometimes, while all other algorithms for
finding second-order stationary points with similar gradient complexity need to
combine with a negative-curvature search subroutine (e.g., Neon2 [Allen-Zhu and

  Organisations",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0214911",,"physics.soc-ph nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical structures are ubiquitous in human and animal societies, but a
fundamental understanding of their raison d'\^etre has been lacking. Here, we
present a general theory in which hierarchies are obtained as the optimal
design that strikes a balance between the benefits of group productivity and
the costs of communication for coordination. By maximising a generic
representation of the output of a hierarchical organization with respect to its
design, the optimal configuration of group sizes at different levels can be
determined. With very few ingredients, a wide variety of hierarchically ordered
complex organisational structures can be derived. Furthermore, our results
rationalise the ubiquitous occurrence of triadic hierarchies, i.e., of the
universal preferred scaling ratio between $3$ and $4$ found in many human and
animal hierarchies, which should occur according to our theory when production
is rather evenly contributed by all levels. We also provide a systematic
approach for optimising team organisation, helping to address the question of
the optimal `span of control'. The significantly larger number $\sim 3-20$ of
subordinates a supervisor typically manages is rationalised to occur in
organisations where the production is essentially done at the bottom level and
in which the higher levels are only present to optimise coordination and
control.

phonon-localization has not yet been observed experimentally in real materials.
Here we propose that surface-roughness dominated nanowires are ideal candidates

access the same memory location and at least one of them tries to modify its

data race is a special case of a determinacy race which can be eliminated by
associating a mutual-exclusion lock or allowing atomic accesses to the memory
location. However, such solutions can reduce parallelism by serializing all
accesses to that location. For associative and commutative updates, reducers
allow parallel race-free updates at the expense of using some extra space. We
ask the following question. Given a fixed budget of extra space to mitigate the
cost of races in a parallel program, which memory locations should be assigned
reducers and how should the space be distributed among the reducers in order to
minimize the overall running time? We argue that the races can be captured by a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), with nodes representing memory cells and arcs
representing read-write dependencies between cells. We then formulate our
optimization problem on DAGs. We concentrate on a variation of this problem
where space reuse among reducers is allowed by routing extra space along a
source to sink path of the DAG and using it in the construction of reducers
along the path. We consider two reducers and the corresponding duration
functions (i.e., reduction time as a function of space budget). We generalize
our race-avoiding space-time tradeoff problem to a discrete resource-time
tradeoff problem with general non-increasing duration functions and resource
reuse over paths. For general DAGs, the offline problem is strongly NP-hard
under all three duration functions, and we give approximation algorithms. We
also prove hardness of approximation for the general resource-time tradeoff

where an optimal competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$ has long been conjectured and
remains a tantalizing open question.
  In this paper, we show improved results in the i.i.d arrival model. We show

version of the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, an interferometric setup able to
detect the presence of a bomb triggered by a single photon without exploding
it. In our case, a quantum bomb subject to a gravitational force is initially
in a superposition of being inside and outside one of the interferometer arms.
We show that the bomb can be lifted without blowing up. This occurs when a
photon traversing the interferometer is detected at a port that is always dark
when the bomb is located outside the arm. The required potential energy is
provided by the photon (which plays the role of the meter) even though it was
not absorbed by the bomb. A natural interpretation is that the photon traveled
through the arm which does not contain the bomb -- otherwise the bomb would
have exploded -- but it implies the surprising conclusion that the energy
exchange occurred at a distance despite a local interaction Hamiltonian. We use
the weak value formalism to support this interpretation and find evidence of
contextuality. Regardless of interpretation, this interaction-free quantum
measurement engine is able to lift the most sensitive bomb without setting it
off.

arbitrary choices to be made before evolving the system. We show that it is
possible to make them by using the geometric mean metric, which is determined
dynamically by the system, rather than using an arbitrary external metric, as
in general relativity. These choices represent opportunities to recast the

graph $G$, called the chromatic symmetric function, $X_G$, which was
generalized to noncommuting variables, $Y_G$, by Gebhard-Sagan in 2001.
Recently there has been a renaissance in the study of $X_G$, in particular in
classifying when $X_G$ is a positive linear combination of elementary symmetric
or Schur functions.
  We extend this study from $X_G$ to $Y_G$, including establishing the
multiplicativity of $Y_G$, and showing $Y_G$ satisfies the $k$-deletion
property. Moreover, we completely classify when $Y_G$ is a positive linear
combination of elementary symmetric functions in noncommuting variables, and
similarly for Schur functions in noncommuting variables, in the sense of
Bergeron-Hohlweg-Rosas-Zabrocki. We further establish the natural
multiplicative generalization of the fundamental theorem of symmetric
functions, now in noncommuting variables, and obtain numerous new bases for
this algebra whose generators are chromatic symmetric functions in noncommuting
variables. Finally, we show that of all known symmetric functions in
noncommuting variables, only all elementary and specified Schur ones can be
realized as $Y_G$ for some $G$.

crucial galaxy parameters used to constrain galaxy evolution, e.g. stellar mass
(M$_*$) and star formation rate (SFR), under different environmental

galaxy detection and flux measurement in imaging data at different wavelengths.
The reliability of these automatic measurements, however, is subject to
mis-identification and poor fitting due to the morphological irregularities
present in resolved nearby galaxies (e.g. clumps, tidal disturbances,
star-forming regions) and its environment (galaxies in overlap). Our aim is to
provide accurate multi-wavelength photometry (from the UV to the IR, including
GALEX, SDSS, and WISE) in a sample of $\sim$ 600 nearby (z<0.1) isolated
mergers, as well as estimations of M$_*$ and SFR. We performed photometry
following a semi-automated approach using SExtractor, confirming by visual
inspection that we successfully extracted the light from the entire galaxy,
including tidal tails and star-forming regions. We used the available SED
fitting code MAGPHYS in order to estimate M$_*$ and SFR. We provide the first
catalogue of isolated merging galaxies of galaxy mergers including
aperture-corrected photometry in 11 bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, W1, W2, W3,
and W4), morphological classification, merging stage, M$_*$, and SFR. We found
that SFR and M$_*$ derived from automated catalogues can be wrong by up to
three orders of magnitude as a result of incorrect photometry. Contrary to
previous methods, our semi-automated method can reliably extract the flux of a
merging system completely. Even when the SED fitting often smooths out some of
the differences in the photometry, caution using automatic photometry is
suggested as these measurements can lead to large differences in M$_*$ and SFR

feature of the proposed method is that the natural handling characteristics of
the production vehicle is exploited to reduce the complexity of the
conventional control methods. For safety s sake, most production vehicles are
built to exhibit an understeer handling characteristics to some extent. By
monitoring how much the vehicle is biased into the understeer state, the
controller attempts to adjust this amount in a way that improves the vehicle
cornering performance. With this particular strategy, an innovative controller
can be designed without road friction information, which complicates the
conventional control methods. In addition, unlike the conventional controllers,
the reference yaw rate that is highly dependent on road friction need not be
defined due to the proposed control structure. The optimal control problem is
formulated in a model predictive control framework to handle the constraints
efficiently, and simulations in various test scenarios illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

from single file diffusion to normal diffusion as the channel becomes wide
enough for particles to hop past each other. In the crossover regime, where
hopping events are rare, the diffusion coefficient in the long time limit can
be related to a hopping time that measures the average time it takes a particle
to escape the local cage formed by its neighbours. In this work, we show that a
transition state theory that calculates the free energy barrier for two
particles attempting to pass each other in the small system isobaric ensemble
is able to quantitatively predict the hopping time in a system of
two-dimensional soft repulsive discs [$U(r_{ij})=(\sigma/r_{ij})^{\alpha}$]
confined to a hard walled channel over a range of channel radii and degrees of
particle softness measured in terms of $1/\alpha$. The free energy barrier
exhibits a maximum at intermediate values of $\alpha$ that moves to smaller
values of $1/\alpha$ (harder particles) as the channel becomes narrower.
However, the presence of the maximum is only observed in the hopping times for
wide channels because the interaction potential dependence of the kinetic
prefactor plays an increasingly important role for narrower channels. We also
begin to explore how our transition state theory approach can be used to
optimize and control dynamics in confined quasi-one-dimensional fluids.

following an evader using a probabilistic framework. In this work, we consider
a non-holonomic robot with a limited visibility depth sensor in an indoor
environment with obstacles. The mobile robot that follows the target is
considered a pursuer and the agent being followed is considered an evader. We
propose a probabilistic framework for both the pursuer and evader to achieve
their conflicting goals. We introduce a smart evader that has information about
the location of the pursuer. The goal of this variant of the evader is to avoid
being tracked by the pursuer by using the visibility region information
obtained from the pursuer, to further challenge the proposed smart pursuer. To
validate the efficiency of the framework, we conduct several experiments in
simulation by using Gazebo and evaluate the success rate of tracking an evader
in various environments with different pursuer to evader speed ratios. Through
our experiments we validate our hypothesis that a smart pursuer tracks an
evader more effectively than a pursuer that just navigates in the environment
randomly. We also validate that an evader that is aware of the actions of the
pursuer is more successful at avoiding getting tracked by a smart pursuer than
a random evader. Finally, we empirically show that while a smart pursuer does
increase it's average success rate of tracking compared to a random pursuer,
there is an increased variance in its success rate distribution when the evader
becomes aware of its actions.

Lakatos coined such terms as `monster-barring' and `monster-adjusting' to
describe strategies for dealing with entities whose properties seem to falsify
a conjecture. Thirdly, and most recently, mathematicians dubbed the largest of

implemented without Trotter error in depth $O(\kappa)$ where $\kappa$ is the
number of assignable colors. We also specify general strategies for
implementing QAOA circuits on all-to-all connected hardware graphs and linearly
connected hardware graphs inspired by fermionic simulation techniques.
Performance is validated on graph coloring problems that are known to be
challenging for a given classical algorithm. The general strategy of using
$XY$-mixers is borne out numerically, demonstrating a significant improvement
over the general $X$-mixer, and moreover the generalized $W$-state yields
better performance than easier-to-generate classical initial states when $XY$
mixers are used.

a range of ages, stellar luminosities, and stellar masses. Using C2H and HCN
hyperfine structure fitting and HCN/H13CN isotopologue analysis, we extract
optical depth, excitation temperature, and column density radial profiles for a
subset of disks. C2H is marginally optically thick (\tau ~1-5) and HCN is quite
optically thick (\tau ~ 5-10) in the inner 200 AU. The extracted temperatures
of both molecules are low (10-30K), indicative of either sub-thermal emission
from the warm disk atmosphere or substantial beam dilution due to chemical
substructure. We explore the origins of C2H morphological diversity in our
sample using a series of toy disk models, and find that disk-dependent overlap
between regions with high UV fluxes and high atomic carbon abundances can
explain a wide range of C2H emission features (e.g. compact vs. extended and
ringed vs. ringless emission). We explore the chemical relationship between
C2H, HCN, and C18O and find a positive correlation between C2H and HCN fluxes,
but no relationship between C2H or HCN with C18O fluxes. We also see no
evidence that C2H and HCN are enhanced with disk age. C2H and HCN seem to share
a common driver, however more work remains to elucidate the chemical
relationship between these molecules and the underlying evolution of C, N, and

introduced. Under this loss function, a class of minimax estimators that
uniformly dominate the maximum likelihood estimator is derived. Crucially,
these methods have the property that for estimating a given component
parameter, the full data vector is utilised. Estimators in this class can be
fine-tuned to limit shrinkage away from the maximum likelihood estimator,
thereby avoiding implausible estimates of the sum of the parameters. Further
light is shed on this new class of estimators by showing that it can be derived
by Bayesian and empirical Bayesian methods. In particular, we exhibit a
generalisation of the Clevenson-Zidek estimator, and prove its admissibility.
Moreover, a class of prior distributions for which the Bayes estimators
uniformly dominate the maximum likelihood estimator under the new loss function
is derived. A section is included involving weighted loss functions, notably
also leading to a procedure improving uniformly on the maximum likelihood

highlights that the charge and spin couplings show very similar behaviour in

different trend in the lower doping regimes. A qualitative equivalence of
generalized charge stiffness constant with the effective Drude weight and
Coulomb interaction is established based on the comparison with other
theoretical and experimental results. The fall in charge stiffness with
increase in doping then implies reduction in the magnitude of effective Coulomb
repulsion between the mobile carriers. This leads to an enhanced possibility of
fermionic pairing with increase in doping in the possible presence of some
other attraction producing mechanism from a source outside the t-J-like models.
Moreover, under certain conditions in the weakly correlated phase, the t-J-like
models themselves are able to produce attractive interaction for pairing.

over standard LSM is that its computational cost is significantly less and it
can be used for denoising coherent and incoherent noise in migration images.
Its disadvantage is that the NNLSM quasi-reflectivity image is only an

detected population of supermassive black holes are unconstrained at present.
Despite the existence of several potentially feasible channels for the
production of initial seeds in the high redshift universe, since even actively
growing seeds are not directly observable at these epochs, discriminating
between models remains challenging. Several new observables that encapsulate
information about seeding have been proposed in recent years, and these offer
exciting prospects for truly unraveling the nature of black hole seeds in the
coming years. One of the key challenges for this task lies in the complexity of
the problem, the required disentangling of the confounding effects of accretion
physics and mergers, as mergers and accretion events over cosmic time stand to
erase these initial conditions. Nevertheless, some unique signatures of seeding
do survive and still exist in: local scaling relations between black holes and
their galaxy hosts at low-masses; in high-redshift luminosity functions of
accreting black holes; and in the total number and mass functions of
gravitational wave coalescence events from merging binary black holes. One of
the clearest discriminants for seed models are these high redshift
gravitational wave detections of mergers from space detectable in the
milliHertz range. These predicted event rates offer the most direct constraints
on the properties of initial black hole seeds. Improving our theoretical
understanding of black hole dynamics and accretion will also be pivotal in
constraining seeding models in combination with the wide range of
multi-messenger data.

This approach suffers from the important disadvantage of not scaling well to
real-life problems in which the memory requirements become enormous. We propose
a memoryless method that combines standard supervised neural networks with
self-organizing maps to solve the continual learning problem. The role of the
self-organizing map is to adaptively cluster the inputs into appropriate task
contexts - without explicit labels - and allocate network resources
accordingly. Thus, it selectively routes the inputs in accord with previous

develop a simple yet effective adaptation method for DS-trained models, bias

of the solution in terms of an integral of solutions to classical elliptic
problems. We reformulate this integral into an expression whose continuous and
discrete formulations are stable; the discrete formulations are stable
independent of all discretization parameters. We subsequently apply the reduced
basis method to accomplish model order reduction for the integrand. Our choice
of quadrature in discretization of the integral is a global Gaussian quadrature
rule that we observe is more efficient than previously proposed quadrature
rules. Finally, the model reduction approach enables one to compute solutions
to multi-query fractional Laplace problems with order of magnitude less cost
than a traditional solver.

Monte Carlo (MCMC) search algorithms are required to generate samples of tree
models according to their posterior probabilities. The critical component of
such an MCMC algorithm is to construct good Metropolis-Hastings steps for
updating the tree topology. However, such algorithms frequently suffering from
local mode stickiness and poor mixing. As a result, the algorithms are slow to
converge. Hitherto, authors have primarily used discrete-time birth/death
mechanisms for Bayesian (sums of) regression tree models to explore the model
space. These algorithms are efficient only if the acceptance rate is high which
is not always the case. Here we overcome this issue by developing a new search
algorithm which is based on a continuous-time birth-death Markov process. This
search algorithm explores the model space by jumping between parameter spaces
corresponding to different tree structures. In the proposed algorithm, the
moves between models are always accepted which can dramatically improve the
convergence and mixing properties of the MCMC algorithm. We provide theoretical
support of the algorithm for Bayesian regression tree models and demonstrate
its performance.

investigated jellyfish locomotion by conducting \textit{in silico} comparative
studies and explored swimming performance across different fluid scales (e.g.,
Reynolds Number), bell contraction frequencies, and contraction phase
kinematics for a jellyfish with a fineness ratio of 1 (ratio of bell height to
bell diameter). To study these relationships, an open source implementation of
the immersed boundary method was used (\textit{IB2d}) to solve the fully
coupled fluid-structure interaction problem of a flexible jellyfish bell in a
viscous fluid. Thorough 2D parameter subspace explorations illustrated optimal
parameter combinations in which give rise to enhanced swimming performance. All
performance metrics indicated a higher sensitivity to bell actuation frequency
than fluid scale or contraction phase kinematics, via Sobol sensitivity
analysis, on a high performance parameter subspace. Moreover, Pareto-like
fronts were identified in the overall performance space involving the cost of
transport and forward swimming speed. Patterns emerged within these performance
spaces when highlighting different parameter regions, which complemented the
global sensitivity results. Lastly, an open source computational model for

find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of

decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more
complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications
get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of
individuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers)

mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and

the searching behavior of donkeys. The algorithm imitates transportation
behavior such as searching and selecting routes for movement by donkeys in the
actual world. Two modes are established for implementing the search behavior
and route-selection in this algorithm. These are the Smuggler and Donkeys. In
the Smuggler mode, all the possible paths are discovered and the shortest path
is then found. In the Donkeys mode, several donkey behaviors are utilized such
as Run, Face & Suicide, and Face & Support. Real world data and applications
are used to test the algorithm. The experimental results consisted of two
parts, firstly, we used the standard benchmark test functions to evaluate the
performance of the algorithm in respect to the most popular and the state of
the art algorithms. Secondly, the DSO is adapted and implemented on three
real-world applications namely; traveling salesman problem, packet routing, and
ambulance routing. The experimental results of DSO on these real-world problems

materials in the presence of topological state remains an unsolved issue. Here,
we explore magnetic correlations in the kagome magnet Co_3Sn_2S_2. Using muon
spin-rotation, we present evidence for competing magnetic orders in the kagome
lattice of this compound. Our results show that while the sample exhibits an
out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, an in-plane antiferromagnetic state
appears at temperatures above 90 K, eventually attaining a volume fraction of
80% around 170 K, before reaching a non-magnetic state. Strikingly, the
reduction of the anomalous Hall conductivity above 90 K linearly follows the
disappearance of the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further
show that the competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying
either an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure. Our results taken
together suggest the thermal and quantum tuning of Berry curvature field via
external tuning of magnetic order. Our study shows that Co_3Sn_2S_2 is a rare
example where the magnetic competition drives the thermodynamic evolution of

extend these results to the unconstrained setting by describing an algorithm

are two-fold: the use of a surrogate objective which varies the relative
importance between $g$ and $c$ throughout the algorithm, and a geometric sweep
over possible $\gamma$ values. Our algorithmic guarantees are complemented by a
hardness result showing that no polynomial-time algorithm which accesses $g$

outperforms its unitary counterpart in terms of achievable rate, outage

orthogonal matrices is half that of unitary matrices in the real-valued domain.

presented. It is updated with the most recent evaluated decay databases and
with our Total Absorption Gamma-ray Spectroscopy measurements performed during
the last decade. For the first time the spectral measurements from the Daya Bay
experiment are compared with the detected antineutrino energy spectrum computed
with the updated summation method without any renormalisation. The results
exhibit a better agreement than is obtained with the Huber-Mueller model in the
2 to 5 MeV range, the region which dominates the detected flux. An unexpected
systematic trend is found that the detected antineutrino flux computed with the
summation model decreases with the inclusion of more Pandemonium free data. The
detected flux obtained now lies only 1.9% above that detected in the Daya Bay
experiment, a value that may be reduced with forthcoming new Pandemonium free
data leaving less and less room to the reactor anomaly. Eventually, the new
predictions of individual antineutrino spectra for the $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu,
$^{241}$Pu and $^{238}$U are used to compute the dependence of the reactor
antineutrino spectral shape on the fission fractions.

conditions which guarantee that a $p$-ary function in an even number of
variables is bent, for $p$ a prime number greater than 2. The key condition is
that the component Cayley graphs associated to the values of the function are
strongly regular, and either all of Latin square type, or all of negative Latin
square type. Such a Latin or negative Latin square type bent function is
regular or weakly regular, respectively. Its dual function has component Cayley
graphs with the same parameters as those of the original function. We also give
a criterion for bent functions involving structure constants of association
schemes. We prove that if a $p$-ary function with component Cayley graphs of
feasible degrees determines an amorphic association scheme, then it is bent.
Since amorphic association schemes correspond to strongly regular graph
decompositions of Latin or negative Latin square type, this result is
equivalent to our main theorem. We show how to construct bent functions from
orthogonal arrays and give some examples.

developed in the recent years with the goal of expanding space exploration

both high-thrust and low-thrust propulsion options are challenging due to the
coupling between logistics mission design and trajectory evaluation.
Specifically, this computational burden arises because the deliverable mass
fraction (i.e., final-to-initial mass ratio) and time of flight for low-thrust
trajectories can can vary with the payload mass; thus, these trajectory metrics
cannot be evaluated separately from the campaign-level mission design. To
tackle this challenge, this paper develops a novel event-driven space logistics
network optimization approach using mixed-integer linear programming for space
campaign design. An example case of optimally designing a cislunar propellant
supply chain to support multiple lunar surface access missions is used to
demonstrate this new space logistics framework. The results are compared with
an existing stochastic combinatorial formulation developed for incorporating
low-thrust propulsion into space logistics design; our new approach provides
superior results in terms of cost as well as utilization of the vehicle fleet.
The event-driven space logistics network optimization method developed in this

automatic generation of dynamical equations based on a dictionary of modeling

support for metacommunity dynamics with migration between samples. To
significantly speed up simulations using Community Simulator, our Python
package implements a new Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for finding
equilibrium states of community dynamics that exploits a recently discovered
duality between ecological dynamics and convex optimization. We present data
showing that this EM algorithm improves performance by between one and two

traditional utility-owned devices (e.g., shunt capacitors), or contemporary
smart inverters that come with distributed generation units (e.g., photovoltaic

state values in a network, in the presence of additive communication noise is
proposed. Conventionally, the maximum is estimated locally at each node by
updating the node state value with the largest received measurements in every
iteration. However, due to the additive channel noise, the estimate of the
maximum at each node drifts at each iteration and this results in nodes
diverging from the true max value. Max-plus algebra is used as a tool to study
this ergodic process. The subadditive ergodic theorem is invoked to establish a
constant growth rate for the state values due to noise, which is studied by
analyzing the max-plus Lyapunov exponent of the product of noise matrices in a
max-plus semiring. The growth rate of the state values is upper bounded by a
constant which depends on the spectral radius of the network and the noise
variance. Upper and lower bounds are derived for both fixed and random graphs.
Finally, a two-run algorithm robust to additive noise in the network is
proposed and its variance is analyzed using concentration inequalities.
Simulation results supporting the theory are also presented.

Analysis, encode topological properties of data and have already proved pivotal
in many different applications of data science. However, since the (metric)
space of persistence diagrams is not Hilbert, they end up being difficult
inputs for most Machine Learning techniques. To address this concern, several
vectorization methods have been put forward that embed persistence diagrams
into either finite-dimensional Euclidean space or (implicit) infinite
dimensional Hilbert space with kernels. In this work, we focus on persistence
diagrams built on top of graphs. Relying on extended persistence theory and the
so-called heat kernel signature, we show how graphs can be encoded by
(extended) persistence diagrams in a provably stable way. We then propose a
general and versatile framework for learning vectorizations of persistence
diagrams, which encompasses most of the vectorization techniques used in the
literature. We finally showcase the experimental strength of our setup by
achieving competitive scores on classification tasks on real-life graph
datasets.

aggregates information by effectively incorporating importance weights.
Importantly, we show that both modules can use entailment functions pre-trained

This framework improves the Abelian projection in the gauge-independent manner.
For quarks in the fundamental representation, we have demonstrated some
numerical evidences for the restricted field dominance in the string tension,
which means that the string tension extracted from the restricted part of the
Wilson loop reproduces the string tension extracted from the original Wilson
loop. However, it is known that the restricted field dominance is not observed
for the Wilson loop in higher representations if the restricted part of the
Wilson loop is extracted by adopting the Abelian projection or the field
decomposition naively in the same way as in the fundamental representation. In
this paper, therefore, we focus on confinement of quarks in higher
representations. By virtue of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson
loop operator, we propose suitable gauge-invariant operators constructed from
the restricted field to reproduce the correct behavior of the original Wilson
loop averages for higher representations. Moreover, we perform lattice
simulations to measure the static potential for quarks in higher
representations using the proposed operators. We find that the proposed
operators well reproduce the behavior of the original Wilson loop average,
namely, the linear part of the static potential with the correct value of the
string tension, which overcomes the problem that occurs in naively applying
Abelian-projection to the Wilson loop operator for higher representations.

can be learned from fully-sampled autocalibration (ACS) data. Recently, the
structure of the linear GRAPPA method has been translated into a nonlinear deep

In this work, we apply a similar principle to translate the linear AC-LORAKS

constraints) into a nonlinear deep learning method named LORAKI. Since
AC-LORAKS is iterative and convolutional, LORAKI takes the form of a
convolutional RNN. This new architecture admits a wide range of sampling
patterns, and even calibrationless patterns are possible if synthetic ACS data
is generated. The performance of LORAKI was evaluated with retrospectively
undersampled brain datasets, with comparisons against other related

Methods based on L1-regularization have been widely used for performing sparse

encourage sparsity, they do not take into account structural information of the

it is equipped with an initial stabilizing controller, we provide sharp
finite-time guarantees on the accurate recovery of both the sparsity structure

matrices with high probability, provided that the length of the sample

polynomially in the number of nonzero elements in the system matrices, but
logarithmically in the system dimensions --- this improves on existing sample
complexity bounds for the sparse system identification problem. We further
extend these results to obtain sharp bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of the

  Information","To appear in ICASSP 2019",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is a commonly used algorithm
for recovering $K$-sparse signals $\x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from linear model
$\y=\A\x$, where $\A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix. A
fundamental question in the performance analysis of OMP is the characterization
of the probability that it can exactly recover $\x$ for random matrix $\A$.
Although in many practical applications, in addition to the sparsity, $\x$
usually also has some additional property (for example, the nonzero entries of
$\x$ independently and identically follow the Gaussian distribution), none of
existing analysis uses these properties to answer the above question. In this
paper, we first show that the prior distribution information of $\x$ can be
used to provide an upper bound on $\|\x\|_1^2/\|\x\|_2^2$, and then explore the
bound to develop a better lower bound on the probability of exact recovery with
OMP in $K$ iterations. Simulation tests are presented to illustrate the
superiority of the new bound.

Particularly, the attention mechanism is properly incorporated into an

characteristics in native utterances are extracted and transplanted onto

feedback. Previous works focused on speech conversion using prosodic
transplantation techniques based on PSOLA algorithm. Motivated by the visual
differences found in spectrograms of native and non-native speeches, we
investigated applying GAN to generate self-imitating feedback by utilizing
generator's ability through adversarial training. Because this mapping is
highly under-constrained, we also adopt cycle consistency loss to encourage the
output to preserve the global structure, which is shared by native and
non-native utterances. Trained on 97,200 spectrogram images of short utterances
produced by native and non-native speakers of Korean, the generator is able to
successfully transform the non-native spectrogram input to a spectrogram with
properties of self-imitating feedback. Furthermore, the transformed spectrogram
shows segmental corrections that cannot be obtained by prosodic
transplantation. Perceptual test comparing the self-imitating and correcting
abilities of our method with the baseline PSOLA method shows that the
generative approach with cycle consistency loss is promising.

binary edge image and need to use 2D interpolation operation. This paper
proposes a new transform method figuratively named as funnel transform which
can efficiently and rapidly detect straight lines. The funnel transform
consists of three 1D Fourier transforms and one nonlinear variable-metric
transform (NVMT). It only needs to exploit 1D interpolation operation for
achieving its NVMT, and can directly handle grayscale images by using its
high-pass filter property, which significantly improves the performance of the
closely-related approaches. Based on the slope-intercept line equation, the
funnel transform can more uniformly turn the straight lines formed by
ridge-typical and step-typical edges into the local maximum points (peaks). The
parameters of each line can be uniquely extracted from its corresponding peak
coordinates. Additionally, each peak can be theoretically specified by a 2D
delta function, which makes the peaks and lines more easily identified and
detected, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental results
demonstrate that the funnel transform has advantages including smaller
computational complexity, lower hardware cost, higher detection probability,
greater location precision, better parallelization properties, stronger
anti-occlusion and noise robustness.

refines the salient expression features in accretive manner by incorporating
accretion layers (AL) in the network. The response of the AL holds the hybrid
feature maps generated by prior laterally connected convolution layers.
Moreover, LEARNet architecture incorporates the cross decoupled relationship
between convolution layers which helps in preserving the tiny but influential
facial muscle change information. The visual responses of the proposed LEARNet
depict the effectiveness of the system by preserving both high- and micro-level
edge features of facial expression. The effectiveness of the proposed LEARNet

conservation problem of discrete ES-FP collision operator is solved by
multiplying each term in it by extra conservative coefficients whose values are
very closed to unity. Their differences to unity are in the same order of the
numerical error in approximating the ES-FP operator in discrete velocity space.
All the macroscopic conservative variables (mass, momentum and energy) are
conserved in the present modified discrete ES-FP collision operator. Since the
conservation property in discrete element of physical space is very important
for numerical scheme when discontinuity and large gradient exist in flow field,
a finite volume framework is adopted for the transport term of ES-FP equation.
For $nD$-$3V$ ($n<3$) cases, a $nD$-quasi $nV$ reduction is specially proposed
for ES-FP equation and the corresponding FP-DVM method, which can greatly
reduce the computational cost. The validity and accuracy of both ES-FP equation

solution and DSMC result. Especially, the FP-DVM predictions match well with

has allowed for estimates of its spectral type as early Ae, with obvious
evidence of matter outflow. We derive its current A(V)$\approx$ 7.2 and L = 750
L(sun) thus confirming that V1318 Cyg S should belong to the Herbig Ae stars,
making it, along with BD+40o4124 and V1686 Cyg, the third luminous young star

that the inclination of its dense and slow ($\approx$ 100 km/s) outflow is low.

blind test was jointly organised by the JAXA-HRMS team (Japan Aerospace

CosmOrbitrap consortium analysed them without prior information. Thanks to the
high analytical performances of the prototype and our HRMS data

field of wireless communications and electromagnetic spectrum management. In
recent years, deep learning has been used to solve the problem of radio signal
classification and has achieved good results. However, the radio signal data
currently used is very limited in scale. In order to verify the performance of
the deep learning-based radio signal classification on real-world radio signal
data, in this paper we conduct experiments on large-scale real-world ACARS and
ADS-B signal data with sample sizes of 900,000 and 13,000,000, respectively,
and with categories of 3,143 and 5,157 respectively. We use the same
Inception-Residual neural network model structure for ACARS signal
classification and ADS-B signal classification to verify the ability of a
single basic deep neural network model structure to process different types of
radio signals, i.e., communication bursts in ACARS and pulse bursts in ADS-B.
We build an experimental system for radio signal deep learning experiments.
Experimental results show that the signal classification accuracy of ACARS and
ADS-B is 98.1% and 96.3%, respectively. When the signal-to-noise ratio (with
injected additive white Gaussian noise) is greater than 9 dB, the
classification accuracy is greater than 92%. These experimental results
validate the ability of deep learning to classify large-scale real-world radio
signals. The results of the transfer learning experiment show that the model
trained on large-scale ADS-B datasets is more conducive to the learning and
training of new tasks than the model trained on small-scale datasets.

approaches are applicable at the early and maximum stage of the event when

that the emission of the EUV wave front mainly comes from a height range up to
90-104 Mm, decreasing later to 7-35 Mm. Including the varying height of the EUV
wave front allows us to correct the wave kinematics for the projection effects,
resulting in velocities in the range 217-266 km/s. For the 13 February 2009

revolution as an emerging technology with many different applications in the
military, civilian, and commercial fields. The advent of autonomous drones has
initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation
during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive
issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to
potential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is
to propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet
{(Internet of drones (IoD))}. Two approaches will be used in performing the
safety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach, and (2) a
quantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the
international safety standards, namely ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the
safety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques.
The methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk
mitigation, and finally, draws the safety recommendations associated with a
drone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the
quantitative safety assessment using Bayesian Networks (BN) for probabilistic
modeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model
the safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario
is presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach. These two analyses, qualitative and
quantitative, enable { all involved stakeholders} to detect, explore and
address the risks of UAV flights, which will help the industry to better manage
the safety concerns of UAVs.

Machine learning-based solutions have been already used as a tool to supersede

features from malicious and legitimate samples to estimate statistical
difference in-order to create adversarial examples. Hence, to evaluate the
vulnerability of machine learning algorithms in malware detection, we propose
five different attack scenarios to perturb malicious applications (apps). By
doing this, the classification algorithm inappropriately fits the discriminant
function on the set of data points, eventually yielding a higher
misclassification rate. Further, to distinguish the adversarial examples from
benign samples, we propose two defense mechanisms to counter attacks. To
validate our attacks and solutions, we test our model on three different

emotional intensities during an interaction is in increasing demand. Most of
existing work focuses on determining which emotion(s) participants are
expressing from facial expressions but largely overlooks the emotional
intensities spontaneously revealed by other social cues, especially body
languages. In this paper, we present a real-time method for robots to capture
fluctuations of participants' emotional intensities from their body poses.
Unlike conventional joint-position-based approaches, our method adopts local
joint transformations as pose descriptors which are invariant to subject body
differences as well as the pose sensor positions. In addition, we use a Long
Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) architecture to take the
specific emotion context into account when estimating emotional intensities
from body poses. The dataset evaluation suggests that the proposed method is
effective and performs better than baseline method on the test dataset. Also, a
series of succeeding field tests on a physical robot demonstrates that the
proposed method effectively estimates subjects emotional intensities in
real-time. Furthermore, the robot equipped with our method is perceived to be
more emotion-sensitive and more emotionally intelligent.

these subclasses are well studied in the literature. Nevertheless, there are
few results on superclasses of unigraphs. In this paper, we introduce two types
of generalizations of unigraphs: $k$-unigraphs and $k$-strong unigraphs. We say
that a graph $G$ is a $k$-unigraph if $G$ can be partitioned into $k$
unigraphs. $G$ is a $k$-strong unigraph if not only each subgraph is a unigraph
but also the whole graph can be uniquely determined up to isomorphism, by using
the degree sequences of all the subgraphs in the partition. We describe a
relation between $k$-strong unigraphs and the subgraph isomorphism problem. We
show some properties of $k$-(strong) unigraphs and algorithmic results on
calculating the minimum $k$ such that a graph $G$ is a $k$-(strong) unigraph.

new unusual AMFs. Firstly, these are the flares occurring in the regions with
unbalanced magnetic flux. Secondly, and most interesting, it is possible to
identify the AMFs with much more complex spatial configurations, e.g.,
involving five luminous ribbons with a nontrivial arrangement. As follows from

compare the inferred explosion energies of these simulations and observations

the observations is $\mu_{\rm obs} = -0.13\pm 0.05$ ($\log_{10}(E/10^{51}\,

three CCSN codes have sufficient simulations to compare with observations:
CHIMERA, CoCoNuT-FMT, and FORNAX. Currently, FORNAX has the largest sample of
simulations. The two-dimensional FORNAX simulations show a correlation between
explosion energy and progenitor mass, ranging from linear to quadratic, $E_{\rm
sim} \propto M^{1-2}$; this correlation is consistent with inferences from
observations. In addition, we infer the ratio of the observed-to-simulated
explosion energies, $\Delta=\log_{10}(E_{\rm obs}/E_{\rm sim})$. For the
CHIMERA set, $\Delta=0.33\pm0.06$; for CoCoNuT-FMT, $\Delta=0.62\pm0.05$; for
FORNAX2D, $\Delta=0.73\pm0.05$, and for FORNAX3D, $\Delta=0.95\pm0.06$. On
average, the simulations are less energetic than inferred energies from
observations ($\Delta \approx 0.7$), but we also note that the variation among
the simulations (max($\Delta$)-min($\Delta$) $\approx 0.6$) is as large as this
average offset. This suggests that further improvements to the simulations
could resolve the discrepancy. Furthermore, both the simulations and the
observations are heavily biased. In this preliminary comparison, we model these
biases, but to more reliably compare the explosion energies, we recommend
strategies to un-bias both the simulations and observations.

The results show that our framework can accurately characterize the maximum
state estimation errors caused by an attacker who carefully designs the attack
sequence to strike a balance between the attack magnitude and stealthiness, due
to the simultaneous presence of attack detection and mitigation. Moreover,
based on the proposed framework, we analyze the impact of false positives and
negatives in detecting attacks on the system performance. The results are
important for the system defenders in the joint design of attack detection and
mitigation to reduce the impact of these attack detection errors.Finally, as
MDP solutions are not scalable for high-dimensional systems, we apply
Q-learning with linear and non-linear (neural networks based) function
approximators to solve the attacker's problem in these systems and compare

C++ and easy I/O using MATLAB. Most of the available libraries are either in
MATLAB/Python/R which are very slow and not suitable for large-scale learning,

find that the correction persists unless a phase transition is crossed, or the
subsystem symmetry is explicitly broken. Surprisingly, these results uncover
that the SSPT order of the cluster state persists beyond the cluster phase,

large fraction of nodes having degrees in a limited sector of their

the rate function governing the probability to observe a condensed state, which
shows that condensation of degrees is a rare statistical event akin to similar
condensation phenomena recently observed in several other systems. Monte Carlo

done through calibration, allowing gaze predictions for a subject to be mapped

closing, illumination perturbations) which usually plague single image

Experiments on 3 public datasets validate our approach which constantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods even when using only one calibration

spanning from a wide range of scales. Previous research has investigated
information fusion of connected layers or multiple branches in a block, seeking
to strengthen the power of multi-scale representations. Despite their great
successes, existing practices often allocate the neurons for each scale
manually, and keep the same ratio in all aggregation blocks of an entire
network, rendering suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose to learn
the neuron allocation for aggregating multi-scale information in different
building blocks of a deep network. The most informative output neurons in each
block are preserved while others are discarded, and thus neurons for multiple
scales are competitively and adaptively allocated. Our scale aggregation
network (ScaleNet) is constructed by repeating a scale aggregation (SA) block
that concatenates feature maps at a wide range of scales. Feature maps for each
scale are generated by a stack of downsampling, convolution and upsampling
operations. The data-driven neuron allocation and SA block achieve strong
representational power at the cost of considerably low computational
complexity. The proposed ScaleNet, by replacing all 3x3 convolutions in ResNet
with our SA blocks, achieves better performance than ResNet and its outstanding
variants like ResNeXt and SE-ResNet, in the same computational complexity. On
ImageNet classification, ScaleNets absolutely reduce the top-1 error rate of
ResNets by 1.12 (101 layers) and 1.82 (50 layers). On COCO object detection,
ScaleNets absolutely improve the mmAP with backbone of ResNets by 3.6 (101

experiments/observations from millimeter scales up to galactic scales and
beyond. However, there are reasons to believe that GR may need to be modified
because it includes singularities (it is an incomplete theory) and also it
requires fine-tuning to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe
through the cosmological constant. Thus, it is important to check various
experiments and observations beyond the above range of scales for possible
hints of deviations from the predictions of GR. If such hints are found it is
important to understand which classes of modified gravity theories are
consistent with them. The goal of this review is to summarize recent progress
on these issues. On sub millimeter scales we show an analysis of the data of
the Washington experiment (Kapner et al. (2007)) searching for modifications of
Newton's Law on sub-millimeter scales and demonstrate that a spatially
oscillating signal is hidden in this dataset. We show that even though this
signal cannot be explained in the context of standard modified theories (viable
scalar tensor and $f(R)$ theories), it is a rather generic prediction of
nonlocal gravity theories. On cosmological scales we review recent analyses of
Redshift Space Distortion data which measure the growth rate of cosmological
perturbations at various redshifts and show that these data are in some tension
with the $\Lambda$CDM parameter values indicated by Planck/2015 CMB data at
about 3$\sigma$ level. This tension can be reduced by allowing for an evolution
of the effective Newton constant that determines the growth rate of
cosmological perturbations. We conclude that even though this tension between
the data and the predictions of GR could be due to systematic/statistical
uncertainties of the data, it could also constitute early hints of a new
gravitational theory.

translate VIS face images into fake NIR images whose distributions are intended
to approximate those of true NIR images, which is achieved by proposing a new

NIR domain while preserving common facial representation between VIS and NIR

encoder in the original generator of CycleGAN. For implementing the facial
feature extractor, herein the MobileFaceNet is pretrained on a VIS face
database, and is able to extract effective features. Secondly, the
domain-invariant feature learning is enhanced by considering a new pixel
consistency loss. Lastly, we establish a new WHU VIS-NIR database which varies
in face rotation and expressions to enrich the training data. Experimental
results on the Oulu-CASIA NIR-VIS database and the WHU VIS-NIR database show
that the proposed FFE-based CycleGAN (FFE-CycleGAN) outperforms

management such that the system consists of masses connected with two types of
nonlinear springs, ""stiffening"" and ""softening"" types, alternating along the
length. We show, analytically and numerically, that the lattice makes a
topological transition simply by changing the excitation amplitude and invoking
nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we witness the emergence of a new family of
finite-frequency edge modes, not observed in linear phononic systems. We also
report the existence of kink solitons at the topological transition point.
These correspond to heteroclinic orbits that form a closed curve in the phase
portrait separating the two topologically-distinct regimes. These findings
suggest that nonlinearity can be used as a strategic tuning knob to alter
topological characteristics of phononic crystals. These also provide fresh
perspectives towards understanding a new family of nonlinear solutions in light

decoupling of such dynamics into intra- and inter-unitary orbits. The
(singular) control problem consists of finding a trajectory of the state
variables solving a radial equation in the minimum amount of time, starting at
the completely mixed state and ending at the state with the maximum achievable
purity.
  The boundary value problem determined by the time-minimum singular optimal
control problem is studied numerically. If controls are unbounded, simulations
show that multiple local minimal solutions might exist. To find the unique
globally minimal solution, we must repeat the algorithm for various initial
conditions and find the best solution out of all of the candidates. If controls
are bounded, optimal controls are given by bang-bang controls using the
Pontryagin minimum principle. Using a switching map we construct optimal
solutions consisting of singular arcs. If controls are bounded, the analysis of
our model also implies classical analysis done previously for this problem.

by exchanging single unit with a rate given by a kernel $K(j,k)$. Despite EDG
model's common use in the applied sciences, its rigorous mathematical treatment
is very recent. In this article we study the large time behaviour of EDG
equations. We show two sets of results depending on the properties of the
kernel $(i)$ $K(j,k)=b_{j}a_{k}$ and $(ii)$ $K(j,k)=ja_{k}+b_{j}
+\varepsilon\beta_{j}\alpha_{k}$. For type I kernels, under the detailed
balance assumption, we show that the system admits equilibrium solutions up to
a critical mass $\rho_{s}$ above which there is no equilibrium. We prove that
if the system has an initial mass above $\rho_{s}$ then the solutions converge
to critical equilibrium distribution in a weak sense while strong convergence
can be shown when initial mass is below $\rho_{s}$. For type II kernels, we
make no assumption of detailed balance and equilibrium is obtained via a
contraction property. We provide two separate results depending on the
monotonicity of the kernel or smallness of the total mass. For the first case
we show exponential convergence in the number of clusters norm and for the
second we prove exponential convergence in the total mass norm.

deploy a motion capturing system to obtain high quality skeleton modality,
which provides more comprehensive motion information including skeleton,
trajectory, acceleration with higher accuracy, sampling frequency, and more
skeleton markers. (2) we introduce an EMG modality which is usually used as an
effective indicator in the biomechanics area, also it has yet to be well

few techniques focus specifically on selfie cartoonization, since cartoon
images usually contain artistic abstraction (e.g., large smoothing areas) and
exaggeration (e.g., large/delicate eyebrows). In this paper, we address this
problem by proposing a selfie cartoonization Generative Adversarial Network
(scGAN), which mainly uses an attentive adversarial network (AAN) to emphasize
specific facial regions and ignore low-level details. More specifically, we
first design a cycle-like architecture to enable training with unpaired data.
Then we design three losses from different aspects. A total variation loss is
used to highlight important edges and contents in cartoon portraits. An
attentive cycle loss is added to lay more emphasis on delicate facial areas
such as eyes. In addition, a perceptual loss is included to eliminate artifacts
and improve robustness of our method. Experimental results show that our method
is capable of generating different cartoon styles and outperforms a number of
state-of-the-art methods.

digital care management programs ex-ante, a shortcoming of current risk score
based approaches. This study focuses on defining impactability by identifying
those patients most likely to benefit from technology enabled care management,
delivered through a digital health platform, including a mobile app and
clinician web dashboard. Anonymized insurance claims data were used from a
commercially insured population across several U.S. states and combined with
inferred sociodemographic data and data derived from the patient-held mobile
application itself. Our approach involves the creation of two models and the
comparative analysis of the methodologies and performances therein. We first
train a cost prediction model to calculate the differences in predicted
(without intervention) versus actual (with onboarding onto digital health
platform) healthcare expenditure for patients (N = 1,242). This enables the
classification of impactability if differences in predicted versus actual costs
meet a predetermined threshold. A random forest machine learning model was then
trained to accurately categorize new patients as impactable versus not
impactable, reaching an overall accuracy of 71.9%. We then modify these
parameters through grid search to define the parameters that deliver optimal
performance. A roadmap is proposed to iteratively improve the performance of
the model. As the number of newly onboarded patients and length of use
continues to increase, the accuracy of predicting impactability will improve
commensurately as more advanced machine learning techniques such as deep
learning become relevant. This approach is generalizable to analyzing the
impactability of any intervention and is a key component of realising closed
loop feedback systems for continuous improvement in healthcare.

three mature fields of data mining and machine learning. In recent years,
attributed subgraph mining is emerging as a new powerful data mining task in
the intersection of these areas. Given a graph and a set of attributes for each
vertex, attributed subgraph mining aims to find cohesive subgraphs for which (a
subset of) the attribute values has exceptional values in some sense. While
research on this task can borrow from the three abovementioned fields, the
principled integration of graph and attribute data poses two challenges: the
definition of a pattern language that is intuitive and lends itself to
efficient search strategies, and the formalization of the interestingness of
such patterns. We propose an integrated solution to both of these challenges.
The proposed pattern language improves upon prior work in being both highly
flexible and intuitive. We show how an effective and principled algorithm can
enumerate patterns of this language. The proposed approach for quantifying
interestingness of patterns of this language is rooted in information theory,
and is able to account for prior knowledge on the data. Prior work typically
quantifies interestingness based on the cohesion of the subgraph and for the
exceptionality of its attributes separately, combining these in a parametrized
trade-off. Instead, in our proposal this trade-off is implicitly handled in a
principled, parameter-free manner. Extensive empirical results confirm the
proposed pattern syntax is intuitive, and the interestingness measure aligns
well with actual subjective interestingness.

  Control",,,,,"cs.SE cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous traffic control systems are large-scale systems with critical
goals. Due to the dynamic nature of the surrounding world of these systems,
assuring the satisfaction of their properties at runtime and in the presence of
a change is important. A prominent approach to assure the correct behavior of
these systems is verification at runtime, which has strict time and memory
limitations. To tackle these limitations, we propose Magnifier, an iterative,
incremental, and compositional verification approach that operates on a
component-based model. The Magnifier idea is zooming on the component affected
by a change, verifying the correctness of properties of interest of the system
after adapting the component to the change, and then zooming out and tracing
the change if it propagates. If the change propagates, all components affected
by the change are adapted and are composed to form a new component. Magnifier
repeats the same process for the new component. This iterative process
terminates whenever the propagation of the change stops. In Magnifier, we use
the Coordinated Adaptive Actor model (CoodAA) of traffic control systems. We
present a formal semantics for CoodAA as a network of Timed Input-Output
Automata (TIOAs). The change does not propagate if TIOAs of the adapted
component and its environment are compatible. We implement our approach in
Ptolemy II. The results of our experiments indicate that the proposed approach
improves the verification time and the memory consumption compared to a
non-compositional approach.
