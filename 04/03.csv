principles the Ru-$t_{2g}$ Wannier function based model for the Kitaev
spin-liquid candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We find the non-local Coulomb
repulsion to be sizable compared to the local one. In addition we obtain the
contribution to the Hamiltonian from the spin-orbit coupling and find it to
also contain non-negligible non-local terms. We invoke strong coupling
perturbation theory to investigate the influence of these non-local elements of
the Coulomb repulsion and the spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic interactions.
We find that the non-local Coulomb repulsions cause a strong enhancement of the
magnetic interactions, which deviate from experimental fits reported in the
literature. Our results contribute to the understanding and design of quantum
spin liquid materials via first principles calculations.

Ferrier","Direction Selection in Stochastic Directional Distance Functions",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researchers rely on the distance function to model multiple product
production using multiple inputs. A stochastic directional distance function
(SDDF) allows for noise in potentially all input and output variables. Yet,
when estimated, the direction selected will affect the functional estimates
because deviations from the estimated function are minimized in the specified
direction. The set of identified parameters of a parametric SDDF can be
narrowed via data-driven approaches to restrict the directions considered. We
demonstrate a similar narrowing of the identified parameter set for a shape
constrained nonparametric method, where the shape constraints impose standard
features of a cost function such as monotonicity and convexity.
  Our Monte Carlo simulation studies reveal significant improvements, as
measured by out of sample radial mean squared error, in functional estimates
when we use a directional distance function with an appropriately selected
direction. From our Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that selecting a
direction that is approximately orthogonal to the estimated function in the
central region of the data gives significantly better estimates relative to the
directions commonly used in the literature. For practitioners, our results
imply that selecting a direction vector that has non-zero components for all
variables that may have measurement error provides a significant improvement in
the estimator's performance. We illustrate these results using cost and
production data from samples of approximately 500 US hospitals per year
operating in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, and find that the shape
constrained nonparametric methods provide a significant increase in flexibility
over second order local approximation parametric methods.

spatial components of both magnetic and electric fields are located at zone
interfaces and are evolved using the constrained transport formalism. Direct
application of Stokes' theorem to Faraday's and Ampere's laws ensures that the
resulting discretization is divergence-free for the magnetic field and
charge-conserving for the electric field. Hydrodynamic variables retain,
instead, the usual zone-centred representation commonly adopted in
finite-volume schemes. Temporal discretization is based on Runge-Kutta
implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes in order to resolve the temporal scale
disparity introduced by the stiff source term in Ampere's law. The implicit
step is accomplished by means of an improved and more efficient Newton-Broyden
multidimensional root-finding algorithm. The explicit step relies on a
multidimensional Riemann solver to compute the line-averaged electric and
magnetic fields at zone edges and it employs a one-dimensional Riemann solver
at zone interfaces to update zone-centred hydrodynamic quantities. For the
latter, we introduce a five-wave solver based on the frozen limit of the
relaxation system whereby the solution to the Riemann problem can be decomposed
into an outer Maxwell solver and an inner hydrodynamic solver. A number of
numerical benchmarks demonstrate that our method is superior in stability and
robustness to the more popular charge-conserving divergence cleaning approach
where both primary electric and magnetic fields are zone-centered. In addition,
the employment of a less diffusive Riemann solver noticeably improves the
accuracy of the computations.

  embeddings","Accepted at NeurIPS 2020, extented version with proofs",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph kernels based on the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and
corresponding neural architectures recently emerged as powerful tools for
(supervised) learning with graphs. However, due to the purely local nature of
the algorithms, they might miss essential patterns in the given data and can
only handle binary relations. The $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm
addresses this by considering $k$-tuples, defined over the set of vertices, and
defines a suitable notion of adjacency between these vertex tuples. Hence, it
accounts for the higher-order interactions between vertices. However, it does
not scale and may suffer from overfitting when used in a machine learning
setting. Hence, it remains an important open problem to design WL-based graph
learning methods that are simultaneously expressive, scalable, and
non-overfitting. Here, we propose local variants and corresponding neural
architectures, which consider a subset of the original neighborhood, making
them more scalable, and less prone to overfitting. The expressive power of (one
of) our algorithms is strictly higher than the original algorithm, in terms of
ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. Our experimental study confirms
that the local algorithms, both kernel and neural architectures, lead to vastly
reduced computation times, and prevent overfitting. The kernel version
establishes a new state-of-the-art for graph classification on a wide range of
benchmark datasets, while the neural version shows promising performance on
large-scale molecular regression tasks.

rapid collapse to a black hole for masses even smaller than the ones associated
to GW170817; during the first milliseconds, oscillations of the postmerger
remnant at frequencies higher than the ones obtained in the one-family

disk, for binaries of low total mass. Finally, based on a population synthesis
analysis, we present estimates of the number of mergers for: two hadronic

that for unequal mass systems and intermediate values of the total mass, the
merger of a hadronic star and a strange quark star is very likely (GW170817 has
a possible interpretation into this category of mergers). On the other hand,
mergers of two strange quark stars are strongly suppressed.

Frontier Fields program and independent estimation of neutral hydrogen in the

overlap allows an analysis of cosmic reionization which utilizes a direct
combination of CMB and these astrophysical measurements and potentially breaks
degeneracies in parameters describing the physics of reionization. For the

and recombination rates to be free-form and by allowing underlying cosmological
parameters to vary with CMB (temperature and polarization anisotropies and
lensing) data from Planck 2018 release and a compilation of astrophysical data.
We find an excellent agreement between the low-$\ell$ Planck 2018 HFI
polarization likelihood and astrophysical data in determining the integrated
optical depth. By combining both data, we report for a minimal reconstruction
$\tau=0.051^{+0.001+0.002}_{-0.0012-0.002}$ at 68\% and 95\% CL, which, for the
errors in the current astrophysical measurements quoted in the literature, is
nearly twice better than the projected cosmic variance limited CMB

comprehension. Several time-locked stereotyped EEG responses to
word-presentations -- known collectively as event-related potentials (ERPs) --
are thought to be markers for semantic or syntactic processes that take place
during comprehension. However, the characterization of each individual ERP in
terms of what features of a stream of language trigger the response remains
controversial. Improving this characterization would make ERPs a more useful
tool for studying language comprehension. We take a step towards better
understanding the ERPs by fine-tuning a language model to predict them. This
new approach to analysis shows for the first time that all of the ERPs are
predictable from embeddings of a stream of language. Prior work has only found
two of the ERPs to be predictable. In addition to this analysis, we examine
which ERPs benefit from sharing parameters during joint training. We find that
two pairs of ERPs previously identified in the literature as being related to
each other benefit from joint training, while several other pairs of ERPs that
benefit from joint training are suggestive of potential relationships.
Extensions of this analysis that further examine what kinds of information in
the model embeddings relate to each ERP have the potential to elucidate the
processes involved in human language comprehension.

Average Approximation (SAA) without compromising important theoretical
properties, such as convergence in probability and the consistency of an
independent and identically distributed (iid) sample. We consider each scenario
as a polyhedron of the mix of first-stage and second-stage decision variables.
According to John's theorem, the Lowner-John ellipsoid of each polyhedron will
be unique which means that different scenarios will have correspondingly
different Lowner-John ellipsoids. By optimizing the objective function
regarding both feasible regions of the polyhedron and its unique Lowner-John
ellipsoid, respectively, we obtain a pair of optimal values, which would be a
coordinate on a two-dimensional plane. The scenarios, whose coordinates are
close enough on the plane, will be treated as one scenario; thus our method
reduces the sample size of an iid sample considerably. Instead of using a large
iid sample directly, we would use the cluster of low-cost computers to
calculate the coordinates of a massive number of scenarios and build a
representative and significantly smaller sample to feed the solver. We show
that our method will obtain the optimal solution of a very large sample without
compromising the solution quality. Furthermore, our method would be
implementable as a distributed computational infrastructure with many but
low-cost computers.

perturbations do not change the stability of the late-time attractor of the

existence and uniqueness of a $G_X$-martingale problem provided there is a
bounded continuous duality function $H$ on $E_X \times E_Y$ together with a
dual process $Y$ on $E_Y$ which is the unique solution of a $G_Y$-martingale
problem. For the corresponding solutions $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ and $(Y_t)_{t\ge 0}$,
duality with respect to a function $H$ in its simplest form means that the
relation $\mathbb E_x[H(X_t,y)] = \mathbb E_y[H(x,Y_t)]$ holds for all $(x,y)
\in E_X \times E_Y$ and $t\ge 0$. While duality is well-known to imply
uniqueness of the $G_X$-martingale problem, we give here a set of conditions
under which duality also implies existence without using approximating
sequences of processes of a different kind (e.g.\ jump processes to approximate
diffusions) which is a widespread strategy for proving existence of solutions
of martingale problems. Given the process $(Y_t)_{t\ge 0}$ and a duality
function $H$, to prove existence of $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ one has to show that the
r.h.s.\ of the duality relation defines for each $y$ a measure on $E_X$, i.e.\
there are transition kernels $(\mu_t)_{t\geq 0}$ from $E_X$ to $E_X$ such that
$\mathbb E_y[H(x,Y_t)] = \int \mu_t(x,dx')\, H(x',y)$ for all $(x,y) \in E_X

models, such as the Fleming-Viot measure-valued diffusion and its spatial
counterparts (with both, discrete and continuum space), as well as branching
systems, such as Feller's branching diffusion. While our main result as well as
all examples come with (locally) compact state spaces, we discuss the strategy
to lift our results to genealogy-valued processes or historical processes,
leading to non-compact (discrete and continuum) state spaces. Such applications
will be tackled in forthcoming work based on the present article.

function is necessary to obtain case-specific valid plans. This study intends
to facilitate this process by proposing a patient-specific inverse planning
algorithm for HDR prostate brachytherapy: GPU-based multi-criteria optimization
(gMCO).
  Two GPU-based optimization engines including simulated annealing (gSA) and a
quasi-Newton optimizer (gL-BFGS) were implemented to compute multiple plans in
parallel. After evaluating the equivalence and the computation performance of
these two optimization engines, one preferred optimization engine was selected
for the gMCO algorithm. Five hundred sixty-two previously treated prostate HDR
cases were divided into validation set (100) and test set (462). In the
validation set, the number of Pareto optimal plans to achieve the best plan
quality was determined for the gMCO algorithm. In the test set, gMCO plans were
compared with the physician-approved clinical plans.
  Over 462 cases, the number of clinically valid plans was 428 (92.6%) for
clinical plans and 461 (99.8%) for gMCO plans. The number of valid plans with
target V100 coverage greater than 95% was 288 (62.3%) for clinical plans and
414 (89.6%) for gMCO plans. The mean planning time was 9.4 s for the gMCO
algorithm to generate 1000 Pareto optimal plans.
  In conclusion, gL-BFGS is able to compute thousands of SA equivalent
treatment plans within a short time frame. Powered by gL-BFGS, an ultra-fast
and robust multi-criteria optimization algorithm was implemented for HDR
prostate brachytherapy. A large-scale comparison against physician approved
clinical plans showed that treatment plan quality could be improved and
planning time could be significantly reduced with the proposed gMCO algorithm.

The coloring
problem on undirected graphs has been well studied, whereas there are very few
results for coloring problems on directed graphs. An oriented k-coloring of an
oriented graph G=(V,A) is a partition of the vertex set V into k independent
sets such that all the arcs linking two of these subsets have the same
direction. The oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph G is the smallest
k such that G allows an oriented k-coloring. Deciding whether an acyclic
digraph allows an oriented 4-coloring is NP-hard. It follows, that finding the
chromatic number of an oriented graph is an NP-hard problem. This motivates to
consider the problem on oriented co-graphs. After giving several
characterizations for this graph class, we show a linear time algorithm which
computes an optimal oriented coloring for an oriented co-graph. We further
prove how the oriented chromatic number can be computed for the disjoint union
and order composition from the oriented chromatic number of the involved
oriented co-graphs. It turns out that within oriented co-graphs the oriented
chromatic number is equal to the length of a longest oriented path plus one. We
also show that the graph isomorphism problem on oriented co-graphs can be
solved in linear time.

used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The TRGB luminosity is typically
measured in the I-band, where the luminosity has little dependency on stellar
age or stellar metallicity. As the TRGB is brighter at wavelengths redder than
the I-band, observational gains can be made if the TRGB luminosity can be
robustly calibrated at longer wavelengths. This is of particular interest given
the infrared capabilities that will be available with the James Webb Space
Telescope and an important calibration consideration for using TRGB distances
as part of an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Here, we use
simulated photometry to investigate the dependency of the TRGB luminosity on
stellar age and metallicity as a function of wavelength (475 nm - 4.5 micron).
We find intrinsic variations in the TRGB magnitude to increase from a few
hundredths of a magnitude at 800-900 nm to ~0.6 mag by 1.5 micron. We show that
variations at the longer infrared wavelengths can be reduced to 0.02-0.05 mag
(1-2% accuracy in distance) with careful calibrations that account for changes
in age and metal content. These represent the minimum uncertainties;
observational uncertainties will be higher. Such calibration efforts may also
provide independent constraints of the age and metallicity of stellar halos
where TRGB distances are best measured. At 3.6 and 4.5 micron, the TRGB
magnitude is predicted to vary up to ~0.15 mag even after corrections for
stellar age and metallicity, making these wavelengths less suitable for
precision distances.

Since 1998, a planet-search around main sequence stars within 50~pc

at La Silla Observatory. Aims. With an observing time span of more than 20
years, the CORALIE survey is able to detect long term trends in data with
masses and separations large enough to select ideal targets for direct imaging.
Detecting these giant companion candidates will allow us to start bridging the
gap between radial velocity detected exoplanets and directly imaged planets and
brown dwarfs. Methods. Long-term precise Doppler measurements with the CORALIE
spectrograph reveal radial velocity signatures of massive planetary companions
and brown dwarfs on long-period orbits. Results. In this paper we report the
discovery of new companions orbiting HD~181234, HD~13724, HD~25015, HD~92987

years and a mass domain of 2.93 to 26.77 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, the latter of
which straddles the nominal boundary between planets and brown dwarfs.
Conclusion. We have reported the detection of five new companions and updated
parameters of four known extrasolar planets. We identify at least some of these
companions to be promising candidates for imaging and further characterisation.

explore the overall HIMF as well as its dependence on local environment. To
avoid any selection bias because of the different distances of these
large-scale structures, we first used the two-dimensional stepwise

nearest-neighbour method to subdivide the sample into four environments of
decreasing local density and derived the Schechter parameters for each
subsample. A strong trend is observed, for the slope $\alpha$ of the low-mass
end of the HIMF. The slope changes from being nearly flat, i.e. $\alpha =
-0.99\pm0.19$ for galaxies residing in the densest bin, to the steep value of
$\alpha = -1.31\pm0.10$ in the lowest density bin. The characteristic mass,
however, does not show a clear trend between the highest and lowest density

leading order in large N, the entanglement entropies for any such state are
precisely the same as those of another state defined by appropriate
single-trace effective sources; thus, if the leading order entanglement
entropies are geometrical for the single-trace states of a CFT, they are
geometrical for all the multi-trace states as well. Next, we consider the
perturbative calculation of 1/N corrections to the CFT entanglement entropies,
demonstrating that these show qualitatively different features, including
non-analyticity in the sources and/or divergences in the naive perturbative
expansion. These features are consistent with the expectation that the 1/N
corrections include contributions from bulk entanglement on the gravity side.

without coherence peaks for $\mathcal{N}=0$, (ii)quantized zero-bias
conductance peak (ZBCP) with height $2e^{2}/h$ for $\mathcal{N}=1$, and
(iii)ZBCP spitting for $\mathcal{N}=2$. At zero bias voltage $eV=0$,
$\sum_{\sigma\sigma'} R_{\sigma\sigma'} = \sum_{\sigma\sigma'}

is rotated at approximately $90^\circ$ for the $\mathcal{N}=1$ state.

and the spin rotation angle can become $180^\circ$.

To properly infer the narrator's intention, one needs to apply a certain degree
of common sense and social intuition. To test the capabilities of NLP systems
to recover such intuition, we introduce the new task of inferring what is the
advice-seeking goal behind a personal narrative. We formulate this as a cloze
test, where the goal is to identify which of two advice-seeking questions was
removed from a given narrative.
  The main challenge in constructing this task is finding pairs of semantically
plausible advice-seeking questions for given narratives. To address this
challenge, we devise a method that exploits commonalities in experiences people
share online to automatically extract pairs of questions that are appropriate
candidates for the cloze task. This results in a dataset of over 20,000
personal narratives, each matched with a pair of related advice-seeking
questions: one actually intended by the narrator, and the other one not. The
dataset covers a very broad array of human experiences, from dating, to career
options, to stolen iPads. We use human annotation to determine the degree to
which the task relies on common sense and social intuition in addition to a
semantic understanding of the narrative. By introducing several baselines for
this new task we demonstrate its feasibility and identify avenues for better
modeling the intention of the narrator.

simulate the dynamics of, and interpret the chemical species observed in

knowledge of the spectrum of MeV to GeV protons at the edge of the cloud as
well as a model for the propagation of CRs into molecular clouds. Some models
for the propagation of CRs in molecular clouds assume the CRs to stream freely
along magnetic field lines, while in others they propagate diffusively due to
resonant scattering off of magnetic disturbances excited by MHD turbulence
present in the medium. We discuss the conditions under which CR diffusion can
operate in a molecular cloud, calculate the local CR spectrum and ionization
rate in both a free-streaming and diffusive propagation model, and highlight
the different results from the two models. We also apply these two models to
the propagation through the ISM to obtain the spectrum seen by Voyager 1, and
show that such a spectrum favors a diffusive propagation model.

precise differential measurements of the evaporation rate of liquid nitrogen in
a storage dewar within which various materials are immersed. The results
revealed no statistically-significant detections of heating in the 27 elements

X-ray binaries (XRBs), based on one zone model, indicate super-solar abundance
of elements, e.g. Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co. The one zone model considers
similar hydrodynamics of underlying winds. In order to find a possible origin
of these overabundances, we explore nucleosynthesis in advective, geometrically
thick, sub-Keplerian, accretion disc in XRBs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
and further in outflows launched from the disc. Based on flow hydrodynamics and
solving nuclear network code therein by semi-implicit Euler method, we obtain
abundance evolution of the elements. Although the density is very low, due to
very high temperature of advective disc than Keplerian Shakura-Sunyaev disc
(SSD), it is quite evident that significant nucleosynthesis occurs in the
former. As the temperature at the base of the outflow is constrained by the
temperature of disc, nucleosynthesis also occurs in the outflow contingent upon
its launching temperature. Till now, the outer region of XRB and AGN discs is
understood to be colder SSD and inner region to be advective disc, together
forming a disc-wind system. Hence, newly evolved abundances after processing
through outflow can change the abundances of different elements present in the
environment of the whole disc-wind system. We find 2-6 times overabundant Mg,
Si, Ar, Cr with respect to the respective solar abundances, which is consistent
observationally. Thus for most XRBs, when only iron lines are present,
inclusion of these evolved abundances is expected to change the observational
analysis drastically.

deterministic quasiperiodic potential. Specifically, we address how the ground
state of the Aubry-Andre model, at its critical point, responds to an
instantaneous local quench. At this critical point, both the single-particle
wavefunctions and the density of states are fractal. We find, numerically, that
the overlap between post-quench and pre-quench wavefunctions, as well as the
""core-hole"" Green function, evolve in a complex, non-monotonic way with system
size and time respectively. We interpret our results in terms of the fractal
density of states at this critical point. In a given sample, as the post-quench
time increases, the system resolves increasingly finely spaced minibands,
leading to a series of alternating temporal regimes in which the response is
flat or algebraically decaying. In addition, the fractal critical wavefunctions
give rise to a quench response that varies strongly from site to site across
the sample, which produces broad distributions of many-body observables. Upon
averaging this broad distribution over samples, we recover coarse-grained power
laws and dynamical exponents characterizing the x-ray edge singularity. We
discuss how these features can be probed in ultra-cold atomic gases using
radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey interference.

Sgr II is, however, more compact than usual UFDs, placed in between star

supported by a trust-based social network, where indications of possible
representatives were based on individuals opinions. Individual contributions
went beyond a simple vote-counting and were based on proxy voting. These
mechanisms generated a high level of representativeness of the selected
committee, weakening the possibility of relations of patronage. By
incorporating the integrity of individuals and its perception, here we address
the question of the trustability of the resulting committee. Our results show
that this voting rule provides high representativeness for small committees
with a high level of integrity. Furthermore, the voting system displays
robustness to a strategic and untruthful application of the voting algorithm.

(and a set of quantum states which can be obtained as the limiting cases of
these states) are investigated from a number of perspectives, and it is shown
that the quantum phase properties are dependent on the quantum state
engineering operations performed. Specifically, the analytic expressions for
quantum phase distributions and angular $Q$ distribution as well as measures of
quantum phase fluctuation and phase dispersion are obtained. The uniform phase
distribution of the initial Fock states is observed to be transformed by the
unitary operation (i.e., displacement operator) into non-Gaussian shape, except
for the initial vacuum state. It is observed that the phase distribution is
symmetric with respect to the phase of the displacement parameter and becomes
progressively narrower as its amplitude increases. The non-unitary (photon
addition/subtraction) operations make it even narrower in contrast to the Fock
parameter, which leads to broadness. The photon subtraction is observed to be a
more powerful quantum state engineering tool in comparison to the photon
addition. Further, one of the quantum phase fluctuation parameters is found to
reveal the existence of antibunching in both the engineered quantum states
under consideration. Finally, the relevance of the engineered quantum states in
the quantum phase estimation is also discussed, and photon added displaced Fock
state is shown to be preferable for the task.

rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) for high-redshift galaxies
($z \geq 6$). The faint-end of the galaxy LF at these redshifts provides
powerful constraints on different dark matter models that suppress small-scale
structure formation. In this work we perform full hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation using an alternative DM model composed of
extremely light bosonic particles ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV), also known as fuzzy
dark matter (FDM), and examine the predictions for the galaxy stellar mass
function and luminosity function at $z \geq 6$ for a range of FDM masses. We
find that for FDM models with bosonic mass $m = 5\times10^{-22}$ eV, the number
density of galaxies with stellar mass $\rm M_* \sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ is
suppressed by $\sim 40\%$ at z = 9, $\sim 20\%$ at z = 5, and the UV LFs within
magnitude range of -16 < $M_{\rm UV}$ < -14 is suppressed by $\sim 60\%$ at $z
= 9$, $\sim 20\%$ at $z = 5$ comparing to the CDM counterpart simulation.
Comparing our predictions with current measurements of the faint-end LFs ($-18
\leqslant M_{\rm UV} \leqslant -14$), we find that FDM models with $m_{22} <
5\times10^{-22}$ are ruled out at $3\sigma$ confidence level. We expect that
future LF measurements by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will extend
down to $M_{\rm UV} \sim -13$ for $z \lesssim 10$, with a survey volume that is
comparable to the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) would have the capability to
constrain FDM models to $m\; \gtrsim 10^{-21}$ eV.

then in turn used to obtain a criticality value for each system component and
to rank the components in descending manner. Simulations tools are generally
used to perform importance measure based analysis, but they require expensive
computations and thus they are not suitable for large systems. A more scalable
approach is to utilize the importance measures to obtain all the necessary

higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving to verify such relationships and thus
making sure that all the essential conditions are accompanied by the proven

individual. Most often, clinical investigators analyze an individual's N-of-1
trial data with usual t-tests or simple nonparametric methods. These simple
methods do not account for serial correlation in repeated observations coming
from the individual. Existing methods accounting for serial correlation require
simulation, multiple N-of-1 trials, or both. Here, we develop t-tests that
account for serial correlation in a single individual. The development includes
effect size and precision calculations, both of which are useful for study
planning. We then evaluate and compare their Type I and II errors and interval
estimators to those of usual t-tests analogues via Monte Carlo simulation. The
serial t-tests clearly outperform the usual t-tests commonly used in reporting
N-of-1 results. Examples from N-of-1 clinical trials in fibromyalgia patients
and from a behavioral health setting exhibit how accounting for serial
correlation can change inferences. These t-tests are easily implemented and
more appropriate than simple methods commonly used; however, caution is needed
when analyzing only a few observations. Keywords: Autocorrelation; Cross-over

Word Embeddings with Automatic Relevance Determination priors, relaxing the
assumption that all embedding dimensions have equal weight. Second, I apply
work identifying latent variable models to anchor the dimensions of the
resulting embeddings, identifying them, and making them interpretable and
usable in a regression. I then apply this model and anchoring approach to two
cases, the shift in internationalist rhetoric in the American presidents'
inaugural addresses, and the relationship between bellicosity in American
foreign policy decision-makers' deliberations. I find that inaugural addresses
became less internationalist after 1945, which goes against the conventional
wisdom, and that an increase in bellicosity is associated with an increase in
hostile actions by the United States, showing that elite deliberations are not
cheap talk, and helping confirm the validity of the model.

magnetic field strength in proto-planetary discs remain rare. While linear
polarisation of dust and molecular lines can give insight into the magnetic
field structure, only observations of the circular polarisation produced by
Zeeman splitting provide a direct measurement of magnetic field strenghts. One
of the most promising probes of magnetic field strengths is the paramagnetic
radical CN. Here we present the first Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) observations of the Zeeman splitting of CN in the disc of TW~Hya.
The observations indicate an excellent polarisation performance of ALMA, but
fail to detect significant polarisation. An analysis of eight individual CN
hyperfine components as well as a stacking analysis of the strongest
(non-blended) hyperfine components yields the most stringent limits obtained so
far on the magnetic field strength in a proto-planetary disc. We find that the
vertical component of the magnetic field $|B_z|<0.8$~mG ($1\sigma$ limit). We
also provide a $1\sigma$ toroidal field strength limit of $<30$~mG. These
limits rule out some of the earlier accretion disc models, but remain
consistent with the most recent detailed models with efficient advection. We
detect marginal linear polarisation from the dust continuum, but the almost
purely toroidal geometry of the polarisation vectors implies that his is due to
radiatively aligned grains.

edge, $v_{edge}$, of the iron-peak Fe/Co/Ni $H$-band emission feature and the
optical light curve shape of normal, transitional and sub-luminous type Ia
Supernovae (SNe Ia). We explain this correlation in terms of SN Ia physics.
$v_{edge}$ corresponds to the sharp transition between the complete and
incomplete silicon burning regions in the ejecta. It measures the point in
velocity space where the outer $^{56}$Ni mass fraction, $X_{\rm{Ni}}$, falls to
the order of 0.03-0.10. For a given $^{56}$Ni mass, $M(^{56}Ni)$, $v_{edge}$ is
sensitive to the specific kinetic energy $E_{\rm kin}$($M(^{56}Ni)/M_{WD}$) of
the corresponding region. Combining $v_{edge}$ with light curve parameters
(i.e., s$_{BV}$, $\Delta m_{15,s}$ in $B$ and $V$) allows us to distinguish
between explosion scenarios. The correlation between $v_{edge}$ and light-curve
shape is consistent with explosion models near the Chandrasekhar limit.
However, the available sub-$M_{Ch}$ WD explosion model based on SN 1999by
exhibits velocities which are too large to explain the observations. Finally,
the sub-luminous SN 2015bo exhibits signatures of a dynamical merger of two WDs
demonstrating diversity among explosion scenarios at the faint end of the SNe
Ia population.

show how SLS allows for novel design methodologies that, for the first time,

Bose-Einstein condensates, in analogy to spin-orbit coupling. Using a suitably
designed microwave chip, the quadratic Zeeman shift, normally uniform in space,
can be made to be spatio-temporally varying, leading to a coupling between
spatial and nematic degrees of freedom. A phase diagram is explored where three
quantum phases with the nematic order emerge: easy-axis, easy-plane with
single-well and easy-plane with double well structure in momentum space. By
including spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions, we also obtain the
low energy excitation spectra in these three phases. Lastly, we show that the
nematic-orbit coupling leads to a periodic nematic density modulation in
relation to the period $\lambda_T$ of the cosinusoidal quadratic Zeeman term.
Our results point to the rich possibilities for manipulation of tensorial
degrees of freedom in ultracold gases without requiring Raman lasers, and
therefore, obviating light-scattering induced heating.

boundary annotations to train deep neural networks for accurate tumor
segmentation. We propose the use of weak labels about whether an image presents
tumor or whether it is absent to extend training over images that lack these
annotations. Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised framework that employs
unpaired image-to-image translation between two domains, presence vs. absence
of cancer, as the unsupervised objective. We conjecture that translation helps
segmentation -- both require the target to be separated from the background. We
encode images into two codes: one that is common to both domains and one that
is unique to the presence domain. Decoding from the common code yields healthy
images; decoding with the addition of the unique code produces a residual
change to this image that adds cancer. Translation proceeds from presence to
absence and vice versa. In the first case, the tumor is re-added to the image
and we successfully exploit the residual decoder to also perform segmentation.
In the second case, unique codes are sampled, producing a distribution of
possible tumors. To validate the method, we created challenging synthetic tasks
and tumor segmentation datasets from public BRATS (brain, MRI) and LitS (liver,
CT) datasets. We show a clear improvement (0.83 Dice on brain, 0.74 on liver)

have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and
Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15),
resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical
sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma(r) = 0.020$. In this work
we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from
main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz).
Far-field maps of 7,360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to
measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of
temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the
multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and
WMAP maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted
leakage to simulations induces a bias of $\Delta r = 0.0027 \pm 0.0019$. Future
results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such
leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the
levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that
plan to definitively probe large-field inflation.

discovered a compact region with supersonic motions. These motions may be
caused either by stellar wind, or a bipolar outflow from a protostellar disc.
Young stellar objects were identified and classified in the area under study.
Two star-forming regions were identified. One of them is a region of ongoing
star formation in the head of the molecular cloud observed there and another
one is a burst of star formation in the cloud tail.

target constructs under study are hidden, such as dimensions of affect. This is
especially relevant in machine learning, where subjective labels derived from
related observable signals (e.g., audio, video, text) are needed to support
model training and testing. Current research trends focus on correcting
artifacts and biases introduced by annotators during the annotation process
while fusing them into a single annotation. In this work, we propose a novel
annotation approach using triplet embeddings. By lifting the absolute
annotation process to relative annotations where the annotator compares
individual target constructs in triplets, we leverage the accuracy of
comparisons over absolute ratings by human annotators. We then build a
1-dimensional embedding in Euclidean space that is indexed in time and serves
as a label for regression. In this setting, the annotation fusion occurs
naturally as a union of sets of sampled triplet comparisons among different
annotators. We show that by using our proposed sampling method to find an
embedding, we are able to accurately represent synthetic hidden constructs in
time under noisy sampling conditions. We further validate this approach using
human annotations collected from Mechanical Turk and show that we can recover
the underlying structure of the hidden construct up to bias and scaling
factors.

analytically at a given oscillating extensional stagnation point in a
viscoelastic fluid. The analysis identifies a Deborah number (De) dependent
Weissenberg number (Wi) transition below which the stress is linear in Wi, and
above which the stress grows exponentially in Wi. Next, stress and velocity are
found from numerical simulations in an oscillating 4-roll mill geometry. The

observed. The flow around tips of a time-reversible flexing filament in a
viscoelastic fluid is shown to exhibit an oscillating extension along particle
trajectories, and the stress response exhibits similar transitions. However in
the high amplitude, high De regime the stress feedback on the flow leads to non
time-reversible particle trajectories that experience asymmetric stretching and
compression, and the stress grows more significantly in this regime. These
results help explain past observations of large stress concentration for large
amplitude swimmers and non-monotonic dependence on De of swimming speeds.

great interest in adaptive design and active learning. Motivated by two
scientific examples, this paper presents a strategy of selecting the design
points for a regression model when the underlying regression function is
discontinuous. The first example we undertook was for the purpose of
accelerating imaging speed in a high resolution material imaging; the second
was use of sequential design for the purpose of mapping a chemical phase
diagram. In both examples, the underlying regression functions have
discontinuities, so many of the existing design optimization approaches cannot
be applied because they mostly assume a continuous regression function.
Although some existing adaptive design strategies developed from treed
regression models can handle the discontinuities, the Bayesian approaches come
with computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for
posterior inferences and subsequent design point selections, which is not
appropriate for the first motivating example that requires computation at least
faster than the original imaging speed. In addition, the treed models are based
on the domain partitioning that are inefficient when the discontinuities occurs

statistical properties with a fixed design will be presented first, and then
these properties will be used to propose a new criterion of selecting the

developed which only utilizes information from sensors that are mounted on the

Record (EHR) notes that can be useful for biomedical research provided natural
language processing (NLP) methods are available to extract and structure this

NLP literature for cancer. Methods: We identified studies describing an NLP
method to extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from
PubMed, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion
criteria were used in this study. We excluded articles where the extraction
techniques used were too broad to be represented as frames and also where very
low-level extraction methods were used. 79 articles were included in the final
review. We organized this information according to frame semantic principles to
help identify common areas of overlap and potential gaps. Results: Frames were
created from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer information such as
cancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis,
prostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients. These frames
included both a definition as well as specific frame elements (i.e. extractable
attributes). We found that cancer diagnosis was the most common frame among the
reviewed papers (36 out of 79), with recent work focusing on extracting
information related to treatment and breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: The
list of common frames described in this paper identifies important
cancer-related information extracted by existing NLP techniques and serves as a
useful resource for future researchers requiring cancer information extracted
from EHR notes. We also argue, due to the heavy duplication of cancer NLP
systems, that a general purpose resource of annotated cancer frames and
corresponding NLP tools would be valuable.

distribution. In contrast to previous studies all parameters of the
distribution are simultaneously modeled, namely the means and variances for
both wind components and also the correlation coefficient between them
employing flexible regression splines. To capture a possible mismatch between
the predicted and observed wind direction, ensemble forecasts of both wind
components are included using flexible two-dimensional smooth functions. This
encompasses a smooth rotation of the wind direction conditional on the season
and the forecasted ensemble wind direction.
  The performance of the new method is tested for stations located in plains,
mountain foreland, and within an alpine valley employing ECMWF ensemble
forecasts as explanatory variables for all distribution parameters. The
rotation-allowing model shows distinct improvements in terms of predictive
skill for all sites compared to a baseline model that post-processes each wind
component separately. Moreover, different correlation specifications are tested

station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of
hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable

outcome distributions under dynamic treatment regimes (DTR), developed in

three challenges posed by the complex data set: continuous-time measurement of
the treatment initiation process; sparse measurement of longitudinal outcomes
of interest, leading to incomplete data; and censoring due to dropout and
death. We derive a weighting strategy for continuous time treatment initiation;
use imputation to deal with missingness caused by sparse measurements and
dropout; and define a composite outcome that incorporates both death and CD4

immediate ART initiation leads to lower mortality and higher median values of

thin disk model but with a much larger disk scale height. The disks do not show
any sign of thermal instability over many thermal time scales. More than half
of the accretion is driven by radiation viscosity in the optically thin corona

thick part of the disk is driven by the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses from MRI
turbulence. Coronae with gas temperatures > 10^8 K are generated only in the
inner \approx 10 gravitational radii in both simulations, being more compact in
the higher accretion rate case. In contrast to the thin disk model, surface
density increases with increasing mass accretion rate, which causes less

  How one measures calibration remains a challenge: expected calibration error,
the most popular metric, has numerous flaws which we outline, and there is no
clear empirical understanding of how its choices affect conclusions in
practice, and what recommendations there are to counteract its flaws.
  In this paper, we perform a comprehensive empirical study of choices in
calibration measures including measuring all probabilities rather than just the
maximum prediction, thresholding probability values, class conditionality,
number of bins, bins that are adaptive to the datapoint density, and the norm
used to compare accuracies to confidences. To analyze the sensitivity of
calibration measures, we study the impact of optimizing directly for each
variant with recalibration techniques. Across MNIST, Fashion MNIST,
CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, we find that conclusions on the rank ordering of
recalibration methods is drastically impacted by the choice of calibration
measure. We find that conditioning on the class leads to more effective
calibration evaluations, and that using the L2 norm rather than the L1 norm
improves both optimization for calibration metrics and the rank correlation
measuring metric consistency. Adaptive binning schemes lead to more stablity of
metric rank ordering when the number of bins vary, and is also recommended. We
open source a library for the use of our calibration measures.

A_V=0.82{\pm}0.02mag, and LMC-like extinction curve including the
characteristic 2175{\AA} extinction feature. Such QSO absorption-line systems
have shown to be very rare in previous surveys, which have mostly revealed
sight-lines with low extinction. The present case therefore suggests that
previous samples have under-represented the fraction of dusty absorbers.
Building a complete sample of such systems is needed to assess the significance
of this effect.

novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights
from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).
LabHacks are fun, educational events that challenge student participants to
build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs
are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open
and sustainable design of laboratory equipment, in situ, in Africa. In this
case study we describe the LabHackathon model, discuss its application in a
pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it

substantial public interest in recent months. However, a number of significant
challenges are preventing online boycotts from reaching their potential. In
particular, complex webs of brands and subsidiaries can make it difficult for
participants to conform to the goals of a boycott. Similarly, participants and
organizers have limited visibility into a boycott's progress. This affects
their ability to use sociotechnical innovations from social computing to
incentivize participation. To address these challenges, this paper makes a
system contribution: a new boycott tool called Out of Site. Out of Site uses
lightweight automation to remove obstacles to successful online boycotts. We
describe the design challenges associated with Out of Site and report results
from two phases of deployment with the GrabYourWallet and Stop Animal Testing
boycott communities. Our findings highlight the potential of boycott-assisting
technologies and inform the design of this new class of technologies. Finally,
like is the case for many systems in social computing, while we designed Out of
Site for pro-social uses, there are a number of easily predictable ways in
which the system can be leveraged for anti-social purposes (e.g. exacerbating
filter bubble issues, empowering boycotts of businesses owned by racial,
ethnic, and religious minorities). As such, we developed for this project a
new, very straightforward design approach that treats preventing these
anti-social uses as a top-tier design concern. This approach stands in contrast
to the status quo of ignoring potential anti-social uses and/or considering
them to be a secondary design priority. We discuss how our simple approach may
help other research projects reduce their potential negative impacts with
minimal burden.

multigrid coarse-to-fine modeling strategy that avoids the requirement of
learning large filters to capture large displacement. This allows us to train
an extremely compact model (4.6MB) which operates in a progressive way over
multiple resolutions with shared weights. We train mgPFF on unsupervised,
free-form videos and show that mgPFF is able to not only estimate long-range
flow for frame reconstruction and detect video shot transitions, but also
readily amendable for video object segmentation and pose tracking, where it
substantially outperforms the published state-of-the-art without bells and

dependence of simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics
code. Employing a simplified neutrino heating-cooling scheme in the Prometheus
hydrodynamics module allows us to sample the angular resolution between 4
degrees and 0.5 degrees. With a newly-implemented static mesh refinement (SMR)
technique on the Yin-Yang grid, the angular coordinates can be refined in
concentric shells, compensating for the diverging structure of the spherical
grid. In contrast to previous studies with Prometheus and other codes, we find
that higher angular resolution and therefore lower numerical viscosity provides
more favorable explosion conditions and faster shock expansion. We discuss the
possible reasons for the discrepant results. The overall dynamics seem to
converge at a resolution of about 1 degree. Applying the SMR setup to
marginally exploding progenitors is disadvantageous for the shock expansion,
however, because kinetic energy of downflows is dissipated to internal energy
at resolution interfaces, leading to a loss of turbulent pressure support and a
steeper temperature gradient. We also present a way to estimate the numerical
viscosity on grounds of the measured turbulent kinetic-energy spectrum, leading
to smaller values that are better compatible with the flow behavior witnessed
in our simulations than results following calculations in previous literature.
Interestingly, the numerical Reynolds numbers in the turbulent, neutrino-heated
postshock layer (some 10 to several 100) are in the ballpark of expected
neutrino-drag effects on the relevant length scales in the turbulent postshock
layer. We provide a formal derivation and quantitative assessment of the

their outer envelopes due to a prominent iron opacity bump. In the past few
decades, one-dimensional hydrostatic and time-steady hydrodynamic models have
suggested a variety of WR responses to a super-Eddington force including
envelope inflation and optically thick winds. In this paper, I study these
responses using semianalytical estimates and WR models from both MESA and Ro &
Matzner; four conclusions are present. First, early-type WR stars do not harbor
inflated envelopes because they have either strong winds or insufficient
luminosities. Second, the condition for an opacity bump to harbor a sonic point
is expressible as a minimum mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm sp}(L_*)$. In
agreement with Grassitelli et al. and Ro, the majority of galactic early-type
WR stars can harbor sonic points at the iron opacity bump. However, about half
of those in the Large Magellanic Cloud cannot given typical wind parameters.
Third, WR winds driven by the iron opacity bump must have mass-loss rates that
exceed a global minimum of $10^{-5.8}-10^{-6}M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Lastly,
the observed early-type WR distribution follows a simple mass-loss relation
derived here if the radiation-to-gas pressure ratio is approximately $p_r/p_g
\sim 145$ in the wind; a value consistent with studies by Grafener et al. and
Nakauchi & Saio.

useful signal ranges through adaptive signal clipping. The resulting model is
robust enough to achieve 80.2% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset with
just 1.4 mW power budget, while 6 mW budget allows us to achieve 87.1%

to much greater than the binding energy of the progenitor star. As a result,
the shock wave generated from a supernova explosion can have a wide range of
Mach numbers. In this paper, we investigate the propagation of shocks with
arbitrary initial strengths in polytropic stellar envelopes using a suite of
spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulations. We interpret these results
using the three known self-similar solutions for this problem: the Sedov-Taylor
blastwave describes an infinitely strong shock and the self-similar solutions
from Coughlin et al. (2018b) (Paper I) and Coughlin et al. (2019) (Paper II)
describe a weak and infinitely weak shock (the latter being a rarefaction
wave). We find that shocks, no matter their initial strengths, evolve toward
either the infinitely strong or infinitely weak self-similar solutions at
sufficiently late times. For a given density profile, a single function
characterizes the long-term evolution of a shock's radius and strength.
However, shocks with strengths near the self-similar solution for a weak shock
(from Paper I) evolve extremely slowly with time. Therefore, the self-similar
solutions for infinitely strong and infinitely weak shocks are not likely to be
realized in low-energy stellar explosions, which will instead retain memory of
the shock strength initiated in the stellar interior.

these rules to allow learning on two separate tasks (a foraging and a

adapting the ANNs during the learning tasks, is comparable to that of offline

the linear interpolation of their endpoints on scale $n^{2/3}$. These
maximizing paths and their energies may be viewed via a coordinate system that
respects these scalings. What emerges by doing so is a system indexed by $x,y

$W_n\big( x,s ; y,t \big)$ specifying the scaled energy of the maximizing path
that moves in scaled coordinates between $(x,s)$ and $(y,t)$. The space-time
Airy sheet is, after a parabolic adjustment, the putative distributional limit
$W_\infty$ of this system as $n \to \infty$. The Airy sheet has recently been
constructed in [15] as such a limit of Brownian last passage percolation. In
this article, we initiate the study of fractal geometry in the Airy sheet. We

one-half. Points of violation correspond to special behaviour for scaled
maximizing paths, and we prove the result by investigating this behaviour,
making use of two inputs from recent studies of scaled Brownian LPP; namely,
Brownian regularity of profiles, and estimates on the rarity of pairs of

staged for review the process can require companies to dedicate an
extraordinary level of resources, both with respect to human resources, but
also with respect to the use of technology-based techniques to intelligently
sift through data. For several years, attorneys have been using a variety of
tools to conduct this exercise, and most recently, they are accepting the use
of machine learning techniques like text classification to efficiently cull
massive volumes of data to identify responsive documents for use in these
matters. In recent years, a group of AI and Machine Learning researchers have
been actively researching Explainable AI. In an explainable AI system, actions
or decisions are human understandable. In typical legal `document review'
scenarios, a document can be identified as responsive, as long as one or more
of the text snippets in a document are deemed responsive. In these scenarios,
if predictive coding can be used to locate these responsive snippets, then
attorneys could easily evaluate the model's document classification decision.
When deployed with defined and explainable results, predictive coding can
drastically enhance the overall quality and speed of the document review
process by reducing the time it takes to review documents. The authors of this

for legal teams. Unrestricted legal advice, such as attorney-client

exempt from disclosure in litigations or regulatory events. To protect this
information from being disclosed, companies and outside counsel must review
vast amounts of documents to determine those that contain privileged material.
This process is extremely costly and time consuming. As data volumes increase,
legal counsel employ methods to reduce the number of documents requiring review
while balancing the need to ensure the protection of privileged information.
Keyword searching is relied upon as a method to target privileged information
and reduce document review populations. Keyword searches are effective at
casting a wide net but return over inclusive results -- most of which do not
contain privileged information -- and without detailed knowledge of the data,
keyword lists cannot be crafted to find all privilege material.
Overly-inclusive keyword searching can also be problematic, because even while
it drives up costs, it also can cast `too far of a net' and thus produce
unreliable results.To overcome these weaknesses of keyword searching, legal
teams are using a new method to target privileged information called predictive
modeling. Predictive modeling can successfully identify privileged material but
little research has been published to confirm its effectiveness when compared
to keyword searching. This paper summarizes a study of the effectiveness of
keyword searching and predictive modeling when applied to real-world data. With

than evaluating pieces of web traffic individually, the methodology seeks to

Thanks to the polygonal finite element method, the elements with hanging nodes
are treated as polygonal elements and do not require any special treatment. The
mean value coordinates are used to approximate the unknown field variables and
a staggered solution scheme is adopted to compute the displacement and the

learning deep hashing with listwise supervision is challenging in 1) how to

the pairwise similarities of data points in the Hamming space. However, there
still remain two crucial bottlenecks: 1) the learning process of the full
pairwise similarity preservation is computationally unaffordable and unscalable
to deal with big data; 2) the available category information of data are not
well-explored to learn discriminative hash functions. To overcome these

into the asymmetric similarity approximation and discriminative hashing
function learning. Specifically, a semantic-aware latent embedding is
introduced to asymmetrically preserve the full pairwise similarities while
skillfully handle the cumbersome n times n pairwise similarity matrix.
Meanwhile, a semantic-aware autoencoder is developed to jointly preserve the
data structures in the discriminative latent semantic space and perform data
reconstruction. Moreover, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is
proposed to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem. Extensive

flat Universe. Model-independent measurements are therefore worth studying.
Time delays measured in lensed quasars provide the time delay distances. When
compared with the luminosity distances from Supernova Ia observation, the
measurements can provide the curvature information under the Distance Sum Rule
of FLRW metric. This method is limited by the low redshifts of SNe Ia. In this
work, we propose gravitational waves from the Einstein Telescope as standard
sirens which reach higher redshifts covering the redshift range of lensed
quasars from Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, could provide much more stringent
constraints on the curvature. We first consider a conservative case where only
100 gravitational waves with electromagnetic counterparts are available, the
$1\sigma$ uncertainty for the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ is 0.057. In an
optimistic case with 1000 signals available, then $\Omega_k$ uncertainty is
0.027. Combining with SNe Ia from Dark Energy Survey, $\Omega_k$ can be further
constrained to 0.027 and 0.018, respectively.

  Under Probability Distortion",,,,,"q-fin.MF q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the concept of forward rank-dependent performance processes,
extending the original notion to forward criteria that incorporate probability
distortions. A fundamental challenge is how to reconcile the time-consistent
nature of forward performance criteria with the time-inconsistency stemming
from probability distortions. For this, we first propose two distinct
definitions, one based on the preservation of performance value and the other
on the time-consistency of policies and, in turn, establish their equivalence.
We then fully characterize the viable class of probability distortion
processes, providing a bifurcation-type result. Specifically, it is either the
case that the probability distortions are degenerate in the sense that the
investor would never invest in the risky assets, or the marginal probability
distortion equals to a normalized power of the quantile function of the pricing
kernel. We also characterize the optimal wealth process, whose structure
motivates the introduction of a new, distorted measure and a related market. We
then build a striking correspondence between the forward rank-dependent
criteria in the original market and forward criteria without probability
distortions in the auxiliary market. This connection also provides a direct
construction method for forward rank-dependent criteria. A byproduct of our
work are some new results on the so-called dynamic utilities and on
time-inconsistent problems in the classical (backward) setting.

formatters do not take into account the conventions adopted and configured by

dedicated to fixing formatting rule violations raised by format checkers using
a machine learning approach. For a given project, Styler first generates
training data by injecting violations of the project-specific rules in
violation-free source code files. Then, it learns fixes by feeding long
short-term memory neural networks with the training data encoded into token
sequences. Finally, it predicts fixes for real formatting violations with the
trained models. Currently, Styler supports a single checker, Checkstyle, which
is a highly configurable and popular format checker for Java. In an empirical
evaluation, Styler repaired 41% of 26,791 Checkstyle violations mined from 104
GitHub projects. Moreover, we compared Styler with the IntelliJ plugin
CheckStyle-IDEA and the machine-learning-based code formatters Naturalize and
CodeBuff. We found out that Styler fixes violations of a diverse set of
Checkstyle rules (24/25 rules), generates smaller repairs in comparison to the
other systems, and predicts repairs in seconds once trained on a project.
Through a manual analysis, we identified cases in which Styler does not succeed

Finally, the results suggest that Styler can be useful to help developers

fraction of the line flow constraints ever become active at the optimal
solution, despite variations in the load profile and generation costs. This
observation has far-reaching implications not only for power system
optimization, but also for the practical long-term planning, operation, and
control of the system. We formalize this empirical observation for problems
involving the DC power flow equations. We use a two-step constraint screening
approach to identify constraints whose satisfaction is implied by other
constraints in the problem, and can therefore be removed from the problem. For
the first screening step, we derive analytical bounds that quickly identify
redundancies in the flow limits on parallel lines. The second screening step
uses optimization-based constraint screening, where we solve a (relaxed)
optimization problem for each constraint to identify redundancies. Different
from existing methods, we specifically focus our approach on large ranges of
load variation such that the results are valid for long periods of time, thus
justifying the computational overhead required for the screening method.
Numerical results for a wide variety of standard test cases show that even with
load variations up to +/- 100% of nominal loading, we are able to eliminate a
significant fraction of the flow constraints. This large reduction in
constraints may enable a range of possible applications. As one illustrative

non-thermal X-ray and TeV shell structure. A molecular cloud at a distance of
3.2 kpc is spatially coincident with the western part of the SNR, and it is
likely hit by the SNR. The X-ray emission from this part of the shell is much
lower than from the rest of the SNR. Moreover, a compact GeV emission region
coincident with the cloud has been detected with a soft spectrum. These
observations seem to imply a shock-cloud collision scenario at this area, where
the stalled shock can no longer accelerate super-TeV electrons or maintain
strong magnetic turbulence downstream, while the GeV cosmic rays (CRs) are
released through this stalled shock. To test this hypothesis, we have performed
a detailed Fermi-LAT reanalysis of the HESS J1731-347 region with over 9 years
of data. We find that the compact GeV emission region displays a spectral
power-law index of -2.4, whereas the GeV emission from the rest of the SNR
(excluding the cloud region) has an index of -1.8. A hadronic model involving a
shock-cloud collision scenario is built to explain the -ray emission from this
area. It consists of three CR sources: run-away super-TeV CRs that have escaped
from the fast shock, leaked GeV CRs from the stalled shock, and the local CR
sea. The X-ray and -ray emission of the SNR excluding the shock-cloud
interaction region is explained in a one-zone leptonic model. Our shock-cloud
collision model explains well the GeV-TeV observations from both cloud regions
around HESS J1731-347, i.e. from the cloud in contact with the SNR and from the
more distant cloud which is coincident with the nearby TeV source HESS

a comparable contribution from the local CR sea.

is high. We introduce a novel image-based autonomous navigation technique that
leverages in policy structure using the Riemannian Motion Policy (RMP)
framework for deep learning of vehicular control. We design a deep neural
network to predict control point RMPs of the vehicle from visual images, from
which the optimal control commands can be computed analytically. We show that
our network trained in the Gibson environment can be used for indoor obstacle
avoidance and navigation on a real RC car, and our RMP representation
generalizes better to unseen environments than predicting local geometry or
predicting control commands directly.

adversarial generative flow (CAGlow). Instead of disentangling attributes from
latent space, we blaze a new trail for learning an encoder to estimate the
mapping from condition space to latent space in an adversarial manner. Given a
specific condition $c$, CAGlow can encode it to a sampled $z$, and then enable
robust conditional image synthesis in complex situations like combining person
identity with multiple attributes. The proposed CAGlow can be implemented in
both supervised and unsupervised manners, thus can synthesize images with
conditional information like categories, attributes, and even some unknown
properties. Extensive experiments show that CAGlow ensures the independence of
different conditions and outperforms regular Glow to a significant extent.

have motivated a wide range of works to extend these methods to process video
streams. In this paper, we explore the idea of hard attention aimed for
latency-sensitive applications. Instead of reasoning about every frame
separately, our method selects and only processes a small sub-window of the
frame. Our technique then makes predictions for the full frame based on the
sub-windows from previous frames and the update from the current sub-window.
The latency reduction by this hard attention mechanism comes at the cost of
degraded accuracy. We made two contributions to address this. First, we propose
a specialized memory cell that recovers lost context when processing
sub-windows. Secondly, we adopt a Q-learning-based policy training strategy
that enables our approach to intelligently select the sub-windows such that the
staleness in the memory hurts the performance the least. Our experiments
suggest that our approach reduces the latency by approximately four times
without significantly sacrificing the accuracy on the ImageNet VID video object
detection dataset and the DAVIS video object segmentation dataset. We further
demonstrate that we can reinvest the saved computation into other parts of the
network, and thus resulting in an accuracy increase at a comparable
computational cost as the original system and beating other recently proposed
state-of-the-art methods in the low latency range.

physical process of image formation. By inverting such renderer, one can think
of a learning approach to infer 3D information from 2D images. However,
standard graphics renderers involve a fundamental discretization step called
rasterization, which prevents the rendering process to be differentiable, hence
able to be learned. Unlike the state-of-the-art differentiable renderers, which
only approximate the rendering gradient in the back propagation, we propose a
truly differentiable rendering framework that is able to (1) directly render
colorized mesh using differentiable functions and (2) back-propagate efficient
supervision signals to mesh vertices and their attributes from various forms of
image representations, including silhouette, shading and color images. The key
to our framework is a novel formulation that views rendering as an aggregation
function that fuses the probabilistic contributions of all mesh triangles with
respect to the rendered pixels. Such formulation enables our framework to flow
gradients to the occluded and far-range vertices, which cannot be achieved by
the previous state-of-the-arts. We show that by using the proposed renderer,
one can achieve significant improvement in 3D unsupervised single-view
reconstruction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Experiments also
demonstrate that our approach is able to handle the challenging tasks in

particle tracking method, while in the optically thick regime, the UGKWP
becomes a diffusion equation solver. The local photon dynamics of the UGKWP, as
well as the proportion of wave-described and particle-described photons are
automatically adapted according to the numerical resolution and transport
regime. Compared to the $S_n$ -type UGKS, the UGKWP requires less memory cost

method, the statistical noise of UGKWP is greatly reduced and computational
efficiency is significantly improved in the optically thick regime. Several
numerical examples covering all transport regimes from the optically thin to

diverse preferences over the possible outcomes of the decisions. Our starting
point is the seminal work of Dwork et al. which introduced a notion of
individual fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair
of individuals who are similarly qualified according to the metric should
receive similar outcomes. We show that when individuals have diverse
preferences over outcomes, requiring IF may unintentionally lead to
less-preferred outcomes for the very individuals that IF aims to protect. A
natural alternative to IF is the classic notion of fair division, envy-freeness
(EF): no individual should prefer another individual's outcome over their own.
Although EF allows for solutions where all individuals receive a
highly-preferred outcome, EF may also be overly-restrictive. For instance, if
many individuals agree on the best outcome, then if any individual receives
this outcome, they all must receive it, regardless of each individual's
underlying qualifications for the outcome.
  We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual
fairness (PIIF) that is a relaxation of both individual fairness and
envy-freeness. At a high-level, PIIF requires that outcomes satisfy IF-style
constraints, but allows for deviations provided they are in line with
individuals' preferences. We show that PIIF can permit outcomes that are more
favorable to individuals than any IF solution, while providing considerably
more flexibility to the decision-maker than EF. In addition, we show how to
efficiently optimize any convex objective over the outcomes subject to PIIF for
a rich class of individual preferences. Finally, we demonstrate the broad
applicability of the PIIF framework by extending our definitions and algorithms
to the multiple-task targeted advertising setting introduced by Dwork and
Ilvento.

densely predicting the category for each pixel. High-level features from Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks already demonstrate their effectiveness in
semantic segmentation tasks, however the coarse resolution of high-level
features often leads to inferior results for small/thin objects where detailed
information is important. It is natural to consider importing low level
features to compensate for the lost detailed information in high-level
features.Unfortunately, simply combining multi-level features suffers from the
semantic gap among them. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, named
Gated Fully Fusion (GFF), to selectively fuse features from multiple levels
using gates in a fully connected way. Specifically, features at each level are
enhanced by higher-level features with stronger semantics and lower-level
features with more details, and gates are used to control the propagation of
useful information which significantly reduces the noises during fusion. We
achieve the state of the art results on four challenging scene parsing datasets
including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, COCO-stuff and ADE20K.

at a quantum-mechanical level under the assumption of a perfect lattice
rigidity of the spin-1/2 nodal magnetic ions, is examined via an exact mapping
correspondence with the effective spin-1/2 Ising model on a square lattice.
Although the considered magnetic structure is in principle unfrustrated due to
bipartite nature of a decorated square lattice, the model under investigation
may display anomalous spin frustration driven by a magnetoelastic coupling. It
turns out that the magnetoelastic coupling is a primary cause for existence of
the frustrated antiferromagnetic phases, which exhibit a peculiar coexistence
of antiferromagnetic long-range order of the nodal spins with a partial
disorder of the decorating spins with possible reentrant critical behaviour.
Under certain conditions, the anomalous spin frustration caused by the
magnetoelastic coupling is responsible for unprecedented absence of spontaneous
long-range order in the mixed-spin Ising model composed from half-odd-integer

this paper we argue that research on training agents capable of complex

reasoning and exploration in continuous, partially observable 3D environments.
The objective is to provide challenging scenarios and a robust baseline agent
architecture that can be trained on mid-range consumer hardware in under 24h.
Our scenarios combine two key advantages: (i) they are based on a simple but
highly efficient 3D environment (ViZDoom) which allows high speed simulation
(12000fps); (ii) the scenarios provide the user with a range of difficulty
settings, in order to identify the limitations of current state of the art

present paper is to solve the ambiguity by comparing the ambiguous field
vectors obtained in the same prominence observed on two consecutive days. The
effect of the solar rotation is to modify the scattering angle of the
prominence radiation, which modifies the symmetry of the ambiguous solutions.
This method, which is a kind of tomography, was successfully applied in the
past to the average magnetic field vector of 20 prominences observed at the Pic
du Midi. The aim of the present paper is to apply this method to a prominence
observed with spatial resolution at the THEMIS telescope (European site at
Izana, Tenerife Island). The magnetic field vector is measured by
interpretation of the Hanle effect observed in the He I D3 5875.6 A line,
within the horizontal field vector hypothesis for simplicity. The ambiguity is
first solved by comparing the two pairs of solutions obtained for a ""big pixel""
determined by averaging the observed Stokes parameters in a large region at the
prominence centre. Each pixel is then disambiguated by selecting the closest
solution in a propagation from the prominence centre to the prominence
boundary. The results previously obtained on averaged prominences are all
recovered. The polarity is found to be inverse with a small angle of about
-21{\deg} between the magnetic field vector and the long axis of the filament.
The magnetic field strength of about 6 G is found to slightly increase with
height, as previously observed. The new result is the observed decrease with
height, of the absolute value of the angle between the magnetic field vector
and the long axis of the filament. This result is in excellent agreement with
prominence magnetohydrodynamical models.

interpolating between exact AKLT Hamiltonians. As an example, in the case of
spin-$1$ physical degrees of freedom, it is shown that a quantum phase
transition of central charge $c = 1$ separates the Symmetry Protected
Topological (SPT) phase with spin-$1/2$ edge states from a topologically
trivial phase with spin-$1$ edge states. We also address some specificities of
the generalization to ${\rm SU}(N)$ with $N>2$, in particular regarding the
construction of parent Hamiltonians. For the AKLT state of the ${\rm SU}(3)$
model with the $3$-box symmetric representation, we prove that the edge states
are in the $8$-dimensional adjoint irrep, and for the ${\rm SU}(3)$ model with
adjoint irrep at each site, we are able to construct two different
reflection-symmetric AKLT Hamiltonians, each with a unique ground state which
is either even or odd under reflection symmetry and with edge states in the
adjoint irrep. Finally, examples of two-column and adjoint physical irreps for
${\rm SU}(N)$ with $N$ even and with edge states living in the antisymmetric
irrep with $N/2$ boxes are given, with a conjecture about the general formula
for their correlation lengths.

made up of Carbon and Arsenic atoms, with a chemical composition (CAs3) forms
an energetically and dynamically stable system. The optimized geometry of the
monolayer is slightly different from the buckled geometric configuration
observed for silicene and germanene. The results of electronic structure
calculations predict that it is a semi-metal. Interestingly, the electronic
band structure of this material possesses a linear dispersion and a Dirac cone
at the Fermi level around the high symmetric K point in the reciprocal lattice.
Thus, at low energy excitation (up to 105 meV), the charge carriers in this
system behave as massless Dirac-Fermions. Detailed analysis of partial density
of state suggests that the 2pz orbital of C atoms plays vital role in
determining the nature of the states, which has a linear dispersion and hence
the Dirac cone, around the Fermi level. Thus, the electronic properties of CAs3
monolayer are similar to those of graphene and other group IV based monolayers.
In addition, we have also investigated the influence of mechanical strain on
the properties of CAs3 monolayer. The buckled configuration becomes the planar
configuration for a tensile strain beyond 18%. Our results indicate that the
monolayer possesses linear dispersion in the electronic band structure for a
wide range of mechanical strain from -12 to 20%, though the position of Dirac
point may not lie exactly at the Fermi level. The linear dispersion disappears
for a compressive strain beyond -12% & it is due to the drastic changes in the
geometrical environment around C atom. Finally, we wish to point out that CAs3
monolayer belongs to the class of Dirac materials where the behaviour of
particles, at low energy excitations, are characterized by the Dirac-like
Hamiltonian rather than the Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

results. These models consume a huge amount of memory and computational
operations. However, most of the large-scale industrial applications are often
computational budget constrained. In practice, the peak workload of inference
service could be 10x higher than the average cases, with the presence of
unpredictable extreme cases. Lots of computational resources could be wasted
during off-peak hours and the system may crash when the workload exceeds system
capacity. How to support deep learning services with a dynamic workload
cost-efficiently remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we address the
challenge with a general and novel training scheme called model slicing, which
enables deep learning models to provide predictions within the prescribed
computational resource budget dynamically. Model slicing could be viewed as an
elastic computation solution without requiring more computational resources.
Succinctly, each layer in the model is divided into groups of a contiguous
block of basic components (i.e. neurons in dense layers and channels in
convolutional layers), and then partially ordered relation is introduced to
these groups by enforcing that groups participated in each forward pass always
starts from the first group to the dynamically-determined rightmost group.
Trained by dynamically indexing the rightmost group with a single parameter
slice rate, the network is engendered to build up group-wise and residual
representation. Then during inference, a sub-model with fewer groups can be
readily deployed for efficiency whose computation is roughly quadratic to the
width controlled by the slice rate. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with model slicing can effectively support on-demand workload with
elastic inference cost.

additional bootstrapping analysis. Here, we present a Bayesian probabilistic

posterior probability distributions of perfusion parameters and therefore
promises a robust and information-enriched alternative based on a framework of
probability distributions. In this manuscript, we use the Quantitative Imaging

(BTM) against a bootstrapped NLLS approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
Bayesian posterior probability distributions can be employed to assess

and precision of the BTM posterior distributions were validated and found to be
in good agreement with the NLLS approaches, and assessment of therapy response
with respect to uncertainty in parameter estimates was found to be excellent.
In conclusion, the Bayesian modeling approach provides an elegant means to

provides honest information about changes in parameter estimates.

updates to their end customers, and increasingly more platforms now invite and
pay the crowd to sample real-time information (e.g., traffic observations and

crowdsourced data to sample and buy over time is a critical question for a
platform's AoI management, requiring a good balance between its AoI and the
incurred sampling cost. This question becomes more interesting by considering
the stage after sampling, where multiple platforms coexist in sharing the
content delivery network of limited bandwidth, and one platform's update may
jam or preempt the others' under negative network externalities. When these
selfish platforms know each other's sampling cost, we formulate their
competition as a non-cooperative game and show they want to over-sample to
reduce their own AoIs, causing the price of anarchy (PoA) to be infinity. To
remedy this huge efficiency loss, we propose a trigger mechanism of
non-monetary punishment in a repeated game to enforce the platforms'
cooperation to approach the social optimum. We also study the more challenging
scenario of incomplete information that some new platform hides its private
sampling cost information from the other incumbent platforms in the Bayesian
game. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that even the platform with more
information may get hurt. We successfully redesign the trigger-and-punishment
mechanism to negate the platform's information advantage and ensure no
cheating. Our extensive simulations show that the mechanisms can remedy the
huge efficiency loss due to platform competition, and the performance improves
as we have more incumbent platforms with known cost information.

months. The light curve of SN 2016B exhibits intermediate properties between
those of Type IIP and IIL. The early decline is steep (1.68 $\pm$ 0.10 mag 100
d$^{-1}$), followed by a shallower plateau phase (0.47 $\pm$ 0.24 mag 100

$^{56}$Ni mass estimated from the radioactive tail of the bolometric light

the absorption trough of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in the photospheric spectra are

the myriad of sequenced regulatory architectures as well as to design novel
synthetic circuits. This work builds upon a beautiful recent experiment by
Urtecho et al. who measured the gene expression of over 10,000 promoters
spanning all possible combinations of a small set of regulatory elements. Using
this data, we demonstrate that a central claim in energy matrix models of gene
expression - that each promoter element contributes independently and
additively to gene expression - contradicts experimental measurements. We
propose that a key missing ingredient from such models is the avidity between
the -35 and -10 RNA polymerase binding sites and develop what we call a refined
energy matrix model that incorporates this effect. We show that this the
refined energy matrix model can characterize the full suite of gene expression
data and explore several applications of this framework, namely, how
multivalent binding at the -35 and -10 sites can buffer RNAP kinetics against
mutations and how promoters that bind overly tightly to RNA polymerase can
inhibit gene expression. The success of our approach suggests that avidity
represents a key physical principle governing the interaction of RNA polymerase

recently found a wide range of applications in optimization, machine learning,
and control. It can be considered a generalization of the classical stochastic
gradient algorithm (SGD), where instead of updating the weight vector along the
negative direction of the stochastic gradient, the update is performed in a
""mirror domain"" defined by the gradient of a (strictly convex) potential
function. This potential function, and the mirror domain it yields, provides
considerable flexibility in the algorithm compared to SGD. While many
properties of SMD have already been obtained in the literature, in this paper
we exhibit a new interpretation of SMD, namely that it is a risk-sensitive
optimal estimator when the unknown weight vector and additive noise are
non-Gaussian and belong to the exponential family of distributions. The
analysis also suggests a modified version of SMD, which we refer to as
symmetric SMD (SSMD). The proofs rely on some simple properties of Bregman
divergence, which allow us to extend results from quadratics and Gaussians to
certain convex functions and exponential families in a rather seamless way.

solutions are encoded in the ground state of a classical statistical mechanics
model of reversible logic gates arranged on a square grid and acting on bits
that represent the Boolean variables of the problem. The special feature of
this embedding is that the resulting model lacks a finite-temperature phase
transition, thus bypassing the first-order thermodynamic transition known to
occur in the random graph representation of XORSAT. In spite of this attractive
feature, the thermal relaxation into the ground state displays remarkably slow
glassy behavior. The question addressed in this paper is whether this planar
embedding can afford an efficient path to solution of k-regular k-XORSAT via
quantum adiabatic annealing. We first show that our model bypasses an avoided
level crossing and consequent exponentially small gap in the limit of small
transverse fields. We then present quantum Monte Carlo results for our
embedding of the k-regular k-XORSAT that strongly support a picture in which
second-order and first-order transitions develop at a finite transverse field
for k = 2 and k = 3, respectively. This translates into power-law and
exponential dependences in the scaling of energy gaps with system size,
corresponding to times-to-solution which are, respectively, polynomial and
exponential in the number of variables. We conclude that neither classical nor
quantum annealing can efficiently solve our reformulation of XORSAT, even
though the original problem can be solved in polynomial time by Gaussian
elimination.

diagnostic/billing codes within health pathways of patients. To define such a
grouping based on the sample of patients efficiently, frequent patterns of
activities are discovered and used to measure the similarity between the care
pathways of other patients to the patients in the sample group. This approach
results in an insightful definition of the group. The proposed approach is
evaluated using several datasets obtained from a large university medical
center. The evaluation shows F1-scores of around 0.7 for grouping kidney injury
and around 0.6 for diabetes.

  Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causality graphs are routinely estimated in social sciences, natural
sciences, and engineering due to their capacity to efficiently represent the
spatiotemporal structure of multivariate data sets in a format amenable for
human interpretation, forecasting, and anomaly detection. A popular approach to
mathematically formalize causality is based on vector autoregressive (VAR)
models and constitutes an alternative to the well-known, yet usually
intractable, Granger causality. Relying on such a VAR causality notion, this
paper develops two algorithms with complementary benefits to track time-varying
causality graphs in an online fashion. Their constant complexity per update
also renders these algorithms appealing for big-data scenarios. Despite using
data sequentially, both algorithms are shown to asymptotically attain the same
average performance as a batch estimator which uses the entire data set at
once. To this end, sublinear (static) regret bounds are established.
Performance is also characterized in time-varying setups by means of dynamic
regret analysis. Numerical results with real and synthetic data further support
the merits of the proposed algorithms in static and dynamic scenarios.

understanding the glassy dynamics of both soft materials and supercooled
molecular liquids. From an experimental point of view, such systems are
especially suited to perform particle tracking easily, and, therefore, are a
benchmark for novel optical techniques, applicable when primary particles
cannot be resolved. Differential Variance Analysis (DVA) is one such novel
technique that simplifies significantly the characterization of structural
relaxation processes of soft glassy materials, since it is directly applicable
to digital image sequences of the sample. DVA succeeds in monitoring not only
the average dynamics, but also its spatio-temporal fluctuations, known as
dynamic heterogeneities. In this work, we study the dynamics of dense
suspensions of Brownian beads in water, imaged through digital
video-microscopy, by using both DVA and single-particle tracking. We focus on
two commonly used signatures of dynamic heterogeneities: the dynamic
susceptibility, $\chi_4$, and the non-Gaussian parameter, $\alpha_2$. By direct
comparison of these two quantities, we are able to highlight similarities and
differences. We do confirm that $\chi_4$ and $\alpha_2$ provide qualitatively
similar information, but we find quantitative discrepancies in the scalings of
characteristic time and length scale on approaching the glass transition.

transfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain

the real data jointly. Moreover, by training two image style translators and
depth estimators symmetrically in an end-to-end network, our model achieves
better image style transfer and generates high-quality depth maps. The

previously proposed suboptimal AS algorithms, namely max-max-max (A^3) and
max-min-max (AIA) because these schemes are merely interested in optimizing the

worse performance for the remaining users. On the other hand, the TAS-maj

large scale annotation of representative data is challenging. For semantic
segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real ""target domain"" data models
that are trained on annotated images from a different ""source domain"", notably
a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic
segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while
ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we
aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA
model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several
complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain. As a
result, the performance of the trained semantic segmentation model on the
target domain is boosted. Our novel approach indeed achieves state-of-the-art
performance on different challenging synthetic-2-real benchmarks.

a correspondingly small variation in angular momentum loss rates. In contrast
to prior studies, we find that standard CV evolutionary tracks - without
additional angular momentum loss - are a reasonable fit to the donor masses

where using rough paths theory it is shown that implied volatility is
associated with a purely pathwise lift of the stock dynamics involving no
probability and no semimartingale theory in particular, leading to option
models without probability. Finally, an intermediate result by Bender et al.
(2008) is recalled. Using semimartingale theory, Bender et al. showed that one
could obtain option prices based only on the semimartingale quadratic variation
of the model, a pathwise property, and highlighted the difference between
historical and implied volatility. All three works confirm the idea that while
historical volatility is a statistical quantity, implied volatility is a
pathwise one. This leads to a 20 years mini-anniversary of pathwise pricing

always harder to be classified than coarse categories. However, most of the
recent deep learning based methods neglect the semantic structure of
fine-grained objects and do not take advantage of the traditional fine-grained
recognition techniques (e.g. coarse-to-fine classification). In this paper, we
propose a novel framework with a two-branch network (coarse branch and fine

hierarchical label tree. This framework can adaptively learn the semantic
information from the hierarchical levels. Specifically, we design a generalized
cross-entropy loss for the training of the proposed framework to fully exploit
the semantic priors via considering the relevance between adjacent levels and
enlarge the distance between samples of different coarse classes. Furthermore,
our method leverages only the fine branch when testing so that it adds no
overhead to the testing time. Experimental results show that our proposed

We see three reasons for this: First, private text messaging data is not shared

privacy-preserving similarity measure is non-trivial. Third, assessing the
quality of a similarity measure on text messaging data representing a

evaluate our approach by calculating similarities between Twitter histories of

is known that a separable preparation leads to a mean-squared estimation error
scaling as $1/N$ while an entangled preparation can in some conditions afford a
smaller error with $1/N^2$ scaling. This quantum superefficiency is however
very fragile to noise or decoherence, and typically disappears with any small
amount of random noise asymptotically at large $N$. To complement this
asymptotic characterization, we characterize how the estimation efficiency
evolves as a function of the size $N$ of the entangled system and its degree of
entanglement. We address a generic situation of qubit phase estimation, also
meaningful for frequency estimation. Decoherence is represented by the broad
class of noises commuting with the phase rotation, which includes depolarizing,
phase-flip, and thermal quantum noises. In these general conditions, explicit
expressions are derived for the quantum Fisher information quantifying the
ultimate achievable efficiency for estimation. We confront at any size $N$ the
efficiency of the optimal separable preparation to that of an entangled
preparation with arbitrary degree of entanglement. We exhibit the $1/N^2$
superefficiency with no noise, and prove its asymptotic disappearance at large
$N$ for any non-vanishing noise configuration. For maximizing the estimation
efficiency, we characterize the existence of an optimum $N_{\rm opt}$ of the
size of the entangled system along with an optimal degree of entanglement. For
nonunital noises, maximum efficiency is usually obtained at partial
entanglement. Grouping the $N$ qubits into independent blocks formed of $N_{\rm
opt}$ entangled qubits restores at large $N$ a nonvanishing efficiency that can
improve over that of $N$ independent qubits optimally prepared. One inactive
qubit in the entangled probe sometimes is most efficient for estimation.

performance gap results from inconsistencies. Second, we introduce a unified
four-stage STR framework that most existing STR models fit into. Using this
framework allows for the extensive evaluation of previously proposed STR

we analyze the module-wise contributions to performance in terms of accuracy,
speed, and memory demand, under one consistent set of training and evaluation

estimates the azimuth of a sound source directly from the waveform. Instead of
employing hand-crafted features commonly employed for binaural sound
localisation, such as the interaural time and level difference, our end-to-end
system approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract specific
features from the waveform that are suitable for localisation. Two systems are
proposed which differ in the initial frequency analysis stage. The first system
is auditory-inspired and makes use of a gammatone filtering layer, while the
second system is fully data-driven and exploits a trainable convolutional layer
to perform frequency analysis. In both systems, a set of dedicated
convolutional kernels are then employed to search for specific localisation
cues, which are coupled with a localisation stage using fully connected layers.
Localisation experiments using binaural simulation in both anechoic and
reverberant environments show that the proposed systems outperform a
state-of-the-art deep neural network system. Furthermore, our investigation of
the frequency analysis stage in the second system suggests that the CNN is able
to exploit different frequency bands for localisation according to the
characteristics of the reverberant environment.

CM12 yield function leads to a small skew in the solar cycle dependence of the

the NM sensitivity to low-rigidity (<10 GV) cosmic rays. This effect may be
important for an analysis of ground level enhancements, leading to a potential

Mi13 yield function is recommended for quantitative analyses of NM data,
especially for ground-level enhancements. The validity the force-field

Evidence from recent randomized trials and observational studies generally
supports early initiation but does not provide information about effects of

highly flexible structural proportional hazards model for characterizing the
effect of treatment initiation time on a survival distribution. The model can
be fitted using a weighted partial likelihood score function. Construction of
both the score function and the weights must accommodate censoring of the
treatment initiation time, the outcome, or both. The methods are applied to
data on 4903 individuals with HIV/TB co-infection, derived from electronic
health records in a large HIV care program in Kenya. We use a model formulation
that flexibly captures the joint effects of ART initiation time and ART
duration using natural cubic splines. The model is used to generate survival
curves corresponding to specific treatment initiation times; and to identify
optimal times for ART initiation for subgroups defined by CD4 count at time of
TB diagnosis. Our findings potentially provide ""higher resolution"" information
about the relationship between ART timing and mortality, and about the

emergencies, drills, and false alarms are becoming more and more common.
Compliance to an evacuation order made by an authority in case of emergency can
play a key role in the outcome of an emergency. In case an evacuee experiences
repeated emergency scenarios which may be a false alarm (e.g., an evacuation
drill, a false bomb threat, etc.) or an actual threat, the Aesop's cry wolf
effect (repeated false alarms decrease order compliance) can severely affect
his/her likelihood to evacuate. To analyse this key unsolved issue of
evacuation research, a game-theoretic approach is proposed. Game theory is used
to explore mutual best responses of an evacuee and an authority. In the
proposed model the authority obtains a signal of whether there is a threat or
not and decides whether to order an evacuation or not. The evacuee, after
receiving an evacuation order, subsequently decides whether to stay or leave
based on posterior beliefs that have been updated in response to the
authority's action. Best-responses are derived and Sequential equilibrium and
Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium are used as solution concepts (refining equilibria
with the intuitive criterion). Model results highlight the benefits of

  Retrieval","withdraw this paper due to minor problem in problem defination",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a task of cross-domain
image retrieval from a natural image gallery with free-hand sketch under a
zero-shot scenario. Previous works mostly focus on a generative approach that
takes a highly abstract and sparse sketch as input and then synthesizes the
corresponding natural image. However, the intrinsic visual sparsity and large
intra-class variance of the sketch make the learning of the conditional decoder
more difficult and hence achieve unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel stacked semantic-guided network to address the unique
characteristics of sketches in ZS-SBIR. Specifically, we devise multi-layer
feature fusion networks that incorporate different intermediate feature
representation information in a deep neural network to alleviate the intrinsic
sparsity of sketches. In order to improve visual knowledge transfer from seen
to unseen classes, we elaborate a coarse-to-fine conditional decoder that
generates coarse-grained category-specific corresponding features first (taking
auxiliary semantic information as conditional input) and then generates
fine-grained instance-specific corresponding features (taking sketch
representation as conditional input). Furthermore, regression loss and
classification loss are utilized to preserve the semantic and discriminative
information of the synthesized features respectively. Extensive experiments on
the large-scale Sketchy dataset and TU-Berlin dataset demonstrate that our
proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 20\% in
retrieval performance.

WASP-12b, acquired a year apart with the Wide Field Camera on the Isaac Newton

series of the pressure in finite density QCD. We adopt the approach in which
the radius of convergence is estimated first in a finite volume, and the
infinite-volume limit is taken later. This requires an estimator for the radius
of convergence that is reliable in a finite volume. Based on general arguments
about the analytic structure of the partition function in a finite volume, we
demonstrate that the ratio estimator cannot work in this approach, and propose
three new estimators, capable of extracting reliably the radius of convergence,
which coincides with the distance from the origin of the closest Lee-Yang zero.
We also provide an estimator for the phase of the closest Lee-Yang zero,
necessary to assess whether the leading singularity is a true critical point.
We demonstrate the usage of these estimators on a toy model, namely 4 flavors
of unimproved staggered fermions on a small $6^3 \times 4$ lattice, where both
the radius of convergence and the Taylor coefficients to any order can be
obtained by a direct determination of the Lee-Yang zeros. Interestingly, while
the relative statistical error of the Taylor expansion coefficients steadily
grows with order, that of our estimators stabilizes, allowing for an accurate
estimate of the radius of convergence. In particular, we show that despite the
more than 100\% error bars on high-order Taylor coefficients, the given
ensemble contains enough information about the radius of convergence.

performance is exponentially more efficient than all previous protocols based

AUC = 0.58 for classical Coulomb stress. They further showed that this result
was physically interpretable, with various stress metrics (e.g. sum of absolute

most of the DNN result. We here clarify that AUC c. 0.85 had already been
obtained using ROC curves for the same scalar metrics and by the same authors

terms using logistic regression (i.e., one neural network node) and obtain AUC

al. (2018). We further show that measured distance and mainshock average slip
can be used instead of stress, yielding an improved AUC = 0.86, again with a
simple logistic regression. This demonstrates that the proposed DNN so far does
not provide any new insight (predictive or inferential) in this domain.

images acquired with the Wide Field Camera 3. The resulting V, I
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the resolved stars is dominated by old
(age$\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr) red giant branch (RGB) stars. From the observed RGB tip,
we conclude that the stream is at the same distance as DDO 68, confirming the
physical association with it. A synthetic CMD analysis indicates that the large
majority of the star formation activity in the stream occurred at epochs
earlier than $\sim$1 Gyr ago, and that the star formation at epochs more recent
than $\sim$500 Myr ago is compatible with zero. The total stellar mass of the
stream is $\sim10^{6} M_{\odot}$, about 1/100 of that of DDO~68. This is a
striking example of hierarchical merging in action at the dwarf galaxy scales.

gap between the source and target domains. However, these studies largely
neglect the intra-domain variations in the target domain, which contain
critical factors influencing the testing performance on the target domain. In
this work, we comprehensively investigate into the intra-domain variations of
the target domain and propose to generalize the re-ID model w.r.t three types
of the underlying invariance, i.e., exemplar-invariance, camera-invariance and
neighborhood-invariance. To achieve this goal, an exemplar memory is introduced
to store features of the target domain and accommodate the three invariance
properties. The memory allows us to enforce the invariance constraints over
global training batch without significantly increasing computation cost.
Experiment demonstrates that the three invariance properties and the proposed
memory are indispensable towards an effective domain adaptation system. Results
on three re-ID domains show that our domain adaptation accuracy outperforms the
state of the art by a large margin. Code is available at:

studies is to discern the source(s) of short-lived now extinct nuclides and to
determine the ab-initio isotopic composition of our Solar System (ref. 1). The
proposed genesis of a short-lived now extinct radionuclide,10Be, by spallation
reactions of carbon and oxygen led to the hypothesis of enhanced irradiation in
the early Solar system (ref. 2-8). An alternative scenario of production of
10Be (t1/2 =1.386 +- 0.016 million years (ref.9)) by neutrino process in a low
mass star (11.8Msun) core collapse supernova has been recently suggested (ref.
10) that can explain the observed abundance of 10Be in the early Solar System.
Here, we report well resolved excesses in 7Li/6Li of up to ~21.5 percent in a
Type B1 Ca,-Al rich inclusion (CAI) from the Efremovka meteorite that correlate

with characteristic half-life of 53.12+- 0.07 days (ref. 11) to 7Li, entails
multiple episodes of enhanced irradiation in the ESS. The short half-life of
7Be limits its production by interaction of Solar energetic particles with the
nebular gas and solids and provides constraints on genealogy and chronology of
CAIs. Irradiation of precursor solids/gas of CAIs of Solar composition by a
superflare (Lx=10 exp(32) erg/sec) during the terminal phase of class I or II

For this reason it is natural to make two states equivalent if they differ by a
local gate. Since two states that differ by a local gate have the same
entanglement entropy, then the entanglement entropy defines a function in the
quotient space. In this paper we study this equivalence relation on (i) the set
$\mathbb{R}\hbox{Q}(3)$ of 3-qubit states with real amplitudes, (ii) the set
$Q\mathcal{C}$ of 3-qubit states that can be prepared with gates on the
Clifford group, and (iii) the set $Q\mathbb{R}\mathcal{C}$ of 3-qubit states in
$Q\mathcal{C}$ with real amplitudes. We show that the set $Q\mathcal{C}$ has
8460 states and the quotient space has 5 elements. We have
$\frac{Q\mathcal{C}}{\sim}=\{S_{0},S_{2/3,1},S_{2/3,2},S_{2/3,3},S_{1}\}$. As
usual, we will call the elements in the quotient space, orbits. We have that
the orbit $S_0$ contains all the states that differ by a local gate with the
state $|000\rangle$. There are 1728 states in $S_0$ and as expected, they have
zero entanglement entropy. All the states in the orbits
$S_{2/3,1},S_{2/3,2},S_{2/3,3}$ have entanglement entropy $2/3$ and each one of
these orbits has 1152 states. Finally, the orbit $S_{1}$ has 3456 elements and
all its states have maximum entanglement entropy equal to one. We also study
how the controlled not gates $CNOT(1,2)$ and $CNOT(2,3)$ act on these orbits.
For example, we show that when we apply a $CNOT(1,2)$ to all the states in
$S_0$, then 960 states go back to the same orbit $S_0$ and 768 states go to the
orbit $S_{2/3,1}$. Similar results are obtained for $\mathbb{R}Q\mathcal{C}$.

both $h$ and $\chi$ Persei populate narrow main sequences (MSs), while more
massive stars define the eMSTO, closely mimicking observations of young
Galactic and Magellanic Cloud clusters (with ages older than $\sim$30 Myr).
Previous studies based on clusters older than $\sim$30 Myr find that rapidly
rotating MS stars are redder than slow rotators of similar luminosity,
suggesting that stellar rotation may be the main driver of the eMSTO. By
combining photometry and projected rotational velocities from the literature of
stars in $h$ and $\chi$ Persei, we find no obvious relation between the
rotational velocities and colors of non-emission-line eMSTO stars, in contrast
with what is observed in older clusters. Similarly to what is observed in
Magellanic Cloud clusters, most of the extremely rapidly rotating stars,
identified by their strong H$\alpha$ emission lines, are located in the red
part of the eMSTOs. This indicates that stellar rotation plays a role in the
color and magnitude distribution of MSTO stars. By comparing the observations
with simulated CMDs, we find that a simple population composed of coeval stars
that span a wide range of rotation rates is unable to reproduce the color
spread of the clusters' MSs. We suggest that variable stars, binary
interactions, and stellar rotation affect the eMSTO morphology of these very

molecules and metals can in general be accurately captured by the \emph{ab
initio} $GW$ approach. However, the computational cost of such $GW$
calculations for typical interfaces is significant, given their large system
size and chemical complexity. In the past, approximate self-energy corrections,
such as those constructed from image-charge models together with gas-phase
molecular level corrections, have been used to compute level alignment with
good accuracy. However, these approaches often neglect dynamical effects of the
polarizability and require the definition of an image plane. In this work, we
propose a new approximation to enable more efficient $GW$-quality calculations
of interfaces, where we greatly simplify the calculation of the non-interacting
polarizability, a primary bottleneck for large heterogeneous systems. This is
achieved by first computing the non-interacting polarizability of each
individual component of the interface, e.g., the molecule and the metal,
without the use of large supercells; and then using folding and spatial
truncation techniques to efficiently combine these quantities. Overall this
approach significantly reduces the computational cost for conventional $GW$
calculations of level alignment without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover,
this approach captures both dynamical and nonlocal polarization effects without
the need to invoke a classical image-charge expression or to define an image
plane. We demonstrate our approach by considering a model system of benzene at
relatively low coverage on aluminum (111) surface. Although developed for such
interfaces, the method can be readily extended to other heterogeneous
interfaces.

particle in a 2-D Poiseuille flow with an electric field applied parallel to
the walls. For a thin electrical double layer, the particle exhibits a
slip-driven electrokinetic motion along the direction of the applied electric
field, which causes the particle to lead or lag the flow (depending on its
surface charge). The fluid disturbance caused by this slip-driven motion is
characterized by a rapidly decaying source-dipole field which alters the
inertial lift on the particle. We determine this inertial lift using the
reciprocal theorem. Assuming no wall effects, we derive an analytical
expression for a phoretic-lift which captures the modification to the inertial
lift due to electrophoresis. We also take wall effects into account and find
that the analytical expression is valid away from the walls. We find that for a
leading particle, the phoretic-lift acts towards the regions of high shear
(i.e. walls), while the reverse is true for a lagging particle. Using an
order-of-magnitude analysis, we obtain different components which contribute to
the inertial force and classify them on the basis of the interactions from
which they emerge. We show that the dominant contribution to the phoretic-lift
originates from the interaction of slip-driven source-dipole field with the
stresslet field (generated due to particle's resistance to strain in the
background flow). Furthermore, to contrast the slip-driven phenomenon from a
force-driven phenomenon in terms of their influence on the inertial migration,
we also study a non-neutrally buoyant particle. We show that the gravitational
effects alter the inertial lift primarily through the interaction of background
shear with buoyancy induced stokeslet field.

computer science. Its worst-case hardness lies at the core of computational
complexity theory, for example in the form of NP-hardness and the (Strong)
Exponential Time Hypothesis. In practice however, SAT instances can often be
solved efficiently. This contradicting behavior has spawned interest in the
average-case analysis of SAT and has triggered the development of sophisticated
rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures.
  Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, most theoretical
work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. In
contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable
occurrence. This can be modeled by a non-uniform distribution of the variables,
which can result in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.
  We study satisfiability thresholds of non-uniform random $2$-SAT with $n$

that can be associated with growing instabilities. The wavelengths of the
developing instability modes and their ratios depend on the flow parameters, so
the study of those structures can shed light on jet physics at the scales
involved. In this work, we use the fits to the jet ridgeline obtained from
different observations of S5 B0836$+$710 and apply stability analysis of
relativistic, sheared flows to derive an estimate of the physical parameters of
the jet. Based on the assumption that the observed structures are generated by
growing Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability modes, we have run numerical
calculations of stability of a relativistic, sheared jet over a range of
different jet parameters. We have spanned several orders of magnitude in
jet-to-ambient medium density ratio, and jet internal energy, and checked
different values of the Lorentz factor and shear layer width. This represents
an independent method to obtain estimates of the physical parameters of a jet.
By comparing the fastest growing wavelengths of each relevant mode given by the
calculations with the observed wavelengths reported in the literature, we have
derived independent estimates of the jet Lorentz factor, specific internal
energy, jet-to-ambient medium density ratio and Mach number. We obtain a jet
Lorentz factor $\gamma \simeq 12$, specific internal energy of $\varepsilon
\simeq 10^{-2}\,c^2$, jet-to-ambient medium density ratio of $\eta\approx
10^{-3}$, and an internal (classical) jet Mach number of $M_\mathrm{j}\approx
12$. We also find that the wavelength ratios are better recovered by a
transversal structure with a width of $\simeq 10\,\%$ of the jet radius. This
method represents a powerful tool to derive the jet parameters in all jets
showing helical patterns with different wavelengths.

standard semi-honest model. The protocols are built upon several
state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives such as lattice-based additively
homomorphic encryption, distributed oblivious RAM, and garbled circuits. We
provide several contributions to each of these primitives which are applicable
to other secure computation tasks. Both of our protocols rely on a new circuit
for the approximate top-$k$ selection from $n$ numbers that is built from $O(n

  We have implemented our proposed system and performed extensive experimental
results on four datasets in two different computation environments,
demonstrating more than $18-31\times$ faster response time compared to

Bi-secondary structures were introduced by Haslinger and Stadler and are pairs
of RNA secondary structures, i.e. diagrams having non-crossing arcs in the
upper half-plane. A bi-secondary structure is represented by drawing its
respective secondary structures in the upper and lower half-plane. An RNA
secondary structure has a loop decomposition, where a loop corresponds to a
boundary component, regarding the secondary structure as an orientable
fatgraph. The loop-decomposition of secondary structures facilitates the
computation of its free energy and any two loops intersect either trivially or
in exactly two vertices. In bi-secondary structures the intersection of loops
is more complex and is of importance in current algorithmic work in
bio-informatics and evolutionary optimization. We shall construct a simplicial
complex capturing the intersections of loops and compute its homology. We prove
that only the zeroth and second homology groups are nontrivial and furthermore
show that the second homology group is free. Finally, we provide evidence that

EA framework that has been shown to perform well in several domains, including
Genetic Programming (GP). Differently from traditional EAs where variation acts
blindly, GOMEA learns a model of interdependencies within the genotype, i.e.,
the linkage, to estimate what patterns to propagate. In this article, we study
the role of Linkage Learning (LL) performed by GOMEA in Symbolic Regression
(SR). We show that the non-uniformity in the distribution of the genotype in GP
populations negatively biases LL, and propose a method to correct for this. We
also propose approaches to improve LL when ephemeral random constants are used.
Furthermore, we adapt a scheme of interleaving runs to alleviate the burden of
tuning the population size, a crucial parameter for LL, to SR. We run
experiments on 10 real-world datasets, enforcing a strict limitation on
solution size, to enable interpretability. We find that the new LL method
outperforms the standard one, and that GOMEA outperforms both traditional and
semantic GP. We also find that the small solutions evolved by GOMEA are
competitive with tuned decision trees, making GOMEA a promising new approach to
SR.

problems of elastodynamics. Many fundamental forced-vibration problems
involving solid elastic cylinders have not yet been studied or solved using the
full three-dimensional (3D) theory of linear elasticity. One such problem is
the steady-state forced-vibration response of a simply-supported isotropic
solid elastic circular cylinder subjected to two-dimensional harmonic
standing-wave excitations on its curved surface. In this paper, we exploit
certain previously-obtained particular solutions to the Navier-Lam\'{e}
equation of motion and exact matrix algebra to construct an exact closed-form
3D elastodynamic solution to the problem. The method of solution is direct and
demonstrates a general approach that can be applied to solve other similar
forced-vibration problems involving elastic cylinders. Two complete analytical
solutions are in fact constructed corresponding to two different but
closely-related families of harmonic standing-wave excitations. The second of
these analytical solutions is evaluated numerically in order to study the
steady-state frequency response in some example excitation cases. In each case,
the solution generates a series of resonances that are in correspondence with a
subset of the natural frequencies of the simply-supported cylinder. The
considered problem is of general interest both as an exactly-solvable 3D
elastodynamics problem and as a benchmark forced-vibration problem involving a

For monitoring the conditions of a water body, the chlorophyll a concentration
can serve as a proxy for nutrients and oxygen supply. In situ measurements of
water quality parameters are often time-consuming, expensive and limited in
areal validity. Therefore, we apply remote sensing techniques. During field
campaigns, we collected hyperspectral data with a spectrometer and in situ
measured chlorophyll a concentrations of 13 inland water bodies with different
spectral characteristics. One objective of this study is to estimate
chlorophyll a concentrations of these inland waters by applying three machine
learning regression models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and an
Artificial Neural Network. Additionally, we simulate four different
hyperspectral resolutions of the spectrometer data to investigate the effects
on the estimation performance. Furthermore, the application of first order
derivatives of the spectra is evaluated in turn to the regression performance.
This study reveals the potential of combining machine learning approaches and
remote sensing data for inland waters. Each machine learning model achieves an
R2-score between 80 % to 90 % for the regression on chlorophyll a
concentrations. The random forest model benefits clearly from the applied
derivatives of the spectra. In further studies, we will focus on the
application of machine learning models on spectral satellite data to enhance
the area-wide estimation of chlorophyll a concentration for inland waters.

slowdown when particles become weakly self-propelled, followed by a speedup at
higher activities. Here we map ergodic supercooled states to standard passive
glassy physics, provided a monotonic shift of the glass packing fraction and
the replacement of the ambient temperature by the effective temperature.

To explain this phenomenon, we measure the size of domains were particles move

diffraction limit of the transrelativistic camera. After solving the motion,
when the measurement of the position of an additional point source is

three types: i) suppression-dominated perturbations that mainly reduce the
classification score of the true label, ii) promotion-dominated perturbations
that focus on boosting the confidence of the target label, and iii) balanced
perturbations that play a dual role in suppression and promotion. We also
provide image-level interpretability of adversarial examples. This links PSE of
pixel-level perturbations to class-specific discriminative image regions
localized by class activation mapping (Zhou et al. 2016). Further, we examine
the adversarial effect through network dissection (Bau et al. 2017), which
offers concept-level interpretability of hidden units. We show that there
exists a tight connection between the units' sensitivity to adversarial attacks
and their interpretability on semantic concepts. Lastly, we provide some new

  Materials and Methods: Hospital data breaches reported to the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services breach portal and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse
database were merged with the Medicare Hospital Compare data to assemble a
panel of non-federal acutecare inpatient hospitals for years 2011 to 2015. The
study panel included 2,619 hospitals. Changes in 30-day AMI mortality rate
following a hospital data breach were estimated using a multivariate regression
model based on a difference-in-differences approach.
  Results: A data breach was associated with a 0.338[95% CI, 0.101-0.576]
percentage point increase in the 30-day AMI mortality rate in the year
following the breach and a 0.446[95% CI, 0.164-0.729] percentage point increase
two years after the breach. For comparison, the median 30-day AMI mortality
rate has been decreasing about 0.4 percentage points annually since 2011 due to
progress in care. The magnitude of the breach impact on hospitals' AMI
mortality rates was comparable to a year's worth historical progress in
reducing AMI mortality rates.
  Conclusion: Hospital data breaches significantly increased the 30-day
mortality rate for AMI. Data breaches may disrupt the processes of care that
rely on health information technology. Financial costs to repair a breach may
also divert resources away from patient care. Thus breached hospitals should
carefully focus investments in security procedures, processes, and health
information technology that jointly lead to better data security and improved
patient outcomes.

eigenvector-based centralities, including PageRank and hub/authority scores, to
provide a common framework for two popular classes of multilayer networks:
multiplex networks (which have layers that encode different types of
relationships) and temporal networks (in which the relationships change over
time). Our approach involves the study of joint, marginal, and conditional
""supracentralities"" that one can calculate from the dominant eigenvector of a
supracentrality matrix [Taylor et al., 2017], which couples centrality matrices
that are associated with individual network layers. We extend this prior work
(which was restricted to temporal networks with layers that are coupled by
adjacent-in-time coupling) by allowing the layers to be coupled through a
(possibly asymmetric) interlayer-adjacency matrix $\tilde{{\bf A}}$, where the
entry $\tilde{A}_{tt'} \geq 0$ encodes the coupling between layers $t$ and
$t'$. Our framework provides a unifying foundation for centrality analysis of
multiplex and temporal networks; it also illustrates a complicated dependency
of the supracentralities on the topology and weights of interlayer coupling. By
scaling $\tilde{{\bf A}}$ by an interlayer-coupling strength $\omega\ge0$ and
developing a singular perturbation theory for the limits of weak
($\omega\to0^+$) and strong coupling ($\omega\to\infty$), we also reveal an
interesting dependence of supracentralities on the dominant left and right

relatively large pad area, around 1 $mm^2$; and a good timing resolution,
around 20-30 ps. Besides, in his current technological incarnation, the timing
resolution of the MTD LGAD sensors is severely degraded once the MIP particle
hits the inter-pad region since the signal amplification is missing for this
region. This limitation is named as the LGAD fill-factor problem. To overcome
the fill factor problem and the poor position resolution of the MTD LGAD
sensors, a p-in-p LGAD (iLGAD) was introduced. Contrary to the conventional
LGAD, the iLGAD has a non-segmented deep p-well (the multiplication layer).
Therefore, iLGADs should ideally present a constant gain value over all the
sensitive region of the device without gain drops between the signal collecting
electrodes; in other words, iLGADs should have a 100${\%}$ fill-factor by
design. In this paper, tracking and timing performance of the first iLGAD

Bayes' rule as infinite-dimensional optimization problem (Csiszar, 1975;
Donsker and Varadhan; 1975, Zellner; 1988). First, we use it to prove an
optimality result of standard Variational Inference (VI): Under the proposed
view, the standard Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) maximizing VI posterior is
preferable to alternative approximations of the Bayesian posterior. Next, we
argue for generalizing standard Bayesian inference. The need for this arises in
situations of severe misalignment between reality and three assumptions
underlying standard Bayesian inference: (1) Well-specified priors, (2)
well-specified likelihoods, (3) the availability of infinite computing power.
Our generalization addresses these shortcomings with three arguments and is
called the Rule of Three (RoT). We derive it axiomatically and recover existing
posteriors as special cases, including the Bayesian posterior and its
approximation by standard VI. In contrast, approximations based on alternative
ELBO-like objectives violate the axioms. Finally, we study a special case of
the RoT that we call Generalized Variational Inference (GVI). GVI posteriors
are a large and tractable family of belief distributions specified by three
arguments: A loss, a divergence and a variational family. GVI posteriors have
appealing properties, including consistency and an interpretation as
approximate ELBO. The last part of the paper explores some attractive
applications of GVI in popular machine learning models, including robustness
and more appropriate marginals. After deriving black box inference schemes for
GVI posteriors, their predictive performance is investigated on Bayesian Neural
Networks and Deep Gaussian Processes, where GVI can comprehensively improve

5,857 users published 37,183 posts. We applied topic modeling to the posts and
examined the identified topics and temporal posting trends. We further applied
regression analysis to learn the association between the attention that a

Our findings indicate that bursts of the increase of such online discussion in

frame, which allows adaptation to the latency requirements. However, this
flexibility is not sufficient to support heterogeneous latency requirements, in
which different traffic instances have different switching requirements between
Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL). This is visible in a traffic mix of enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).
In this paper we address this problem through the use of a decoupled UL/DL
access, where the UL and the DL of a device are not necessarily served by the
same base station. The latency gain over coupled access is quantified in the
form of queueing sojourn time in a Rayleigh channel, as well as an upper bound
for critical traffic.

ultra hot Jupiter WASP-18b, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope. We measure the planet's normalized day-night contrast
as >0.96 in luminosity: the disk-integrated dayside emission from the planet is
at 964+-25 ppm, corresponding to 2894+-30 K, and we place an upper limit on the
nightside emission of <32ppm or 1430K at the 3-sigma level. We also find that
the peak of the phase curve exhibits a small, but significant offset in
brightness of 4.5+-0.5 degrees eastward.
  We compare the extracted phase curve and phase resolved spectra to 3D Global
Circulation Models and find that broadly the data can be well reproduced by
some of these models. We find from this comparison several constraints on the
atmospheric properties of the planet. Firstly we find that we need efficient
drag to explain the very inefficient day-night re-circulation observed. We
demonstrate that this drag could be due to Lorentz-force drag by a magnetic
field as weak as 10 Gauss. Secondly, we show that a high metallicity is not
required to match the large day-night temperature contrast. In fact, the effect
of metallicity on the phase curve is different from cooler gas-giant
counterparts, due to the high-temperature chemistry in WASP-18b's atmosphere.
Additionally, we compare the current UHJ spectroscopic phase curves, WASP-18b
and WASP-103b, and show that these two planets provide a consistent picture
with remarkable similarities in their measured and inferred properties.
However, key differences in these properties, such as their brightness offsets
and radius anomalies, suggest that UHJ could be used to separate between
competing theories for the inflation of gas-giant planets.

physical processes using separate universe simulations with the IllustrisTNG
galaxy formation model. The response functions describe how the small-scale
power spectrum reacts to long-wavelength perturbations and they can be
efficiently measured with the separate universe technique by absorbing the
effects of the long modes into a modified cosmology. Specifically, we focus on
the total first-order matter power spectrum response to an isotropic density
fluctuation $R_1(k,z)$, which is fully determined by the logarithmic derivative
of the nonlinear matter power spectrum ${\rm dln}P_m(k,z)/{\rm dln}k$ and the
growth-only response function $G_1(k,z)$. We find that $G_1(k,z)$ is not
affected by the baryonic physical processes in the simulations at redshifts $z
< 3$ and on all scales probed ($k \lesssim 15h/{\rm Mpc}$, i.e. length scales
$\gtrsim 0.4 {\rm Mpc}/h$). In practice, this implies that the power spectrum
fully specifies the baryonic dependence of its response function. Assuming an
idealized lensing survey setup, we evaluate numerically the baryonic impact on
the squeezed-lensing bispectrum and the lensing super-sample power spectrum
covariance, which are given in terms of responses. Our results show that these
higher-order lensing statistics can display varying levels of sensitivity to
baryonic effects compared to the power spectrum, with the squeezed-bispectrum
being the least sensitive. We also show that ignoring baryonic effects on
lensing covariances slightly overestimates the error budget (and is therefore
conservative from the point of view of parameter error bars) and likely has
negligible impact on parameter biases in inference analyses.

flux variability parameters are estimated from the photometric light curves
obtained by the SDSS and the Catalina Real-Time Survey (CRTS) surveys. We find
evidence for weak correlations (\rho ~ 0.3) between the intrinsic C IV
absorption line variability and the quasar continuum variability for the final
sample of 78 BAL quasars. The correlation strengths improve (\rho ~0.5) for the
""high-SNR"" sample sources that have higher spectral signal-to-noise ratio.
Using two sub-sets of the high-SNR sample differing on the absorption trough
depth, we find that the shallow trough sub-set shows an even stronger
correlation (\rho ~ 0.6), whereas the deep trough sub-set does not show any
correlation between the absorption line variability and the continuum

the correlation between the absorption line variability and the continuum

lattice gauge models based on a dualization procedure of a previous
generalization of the Kitaev Quantum Double Models. In the case of this
previous generalization that will be used as a basis, it was defined by adding
new qudits (which were denoted as matter fields in reference to some works) to
the lattice vertices with the intention of, for instance, interpreting its
models as Kitaev Quantum Double Models coupled with Potts ones. Now, with
regard to the generalization that we investigate here, which we want to define
as the dual of this previous one, these new qudits were added to the lattice
faces. And as the coupling between gauge and matter qudits of the previous
generalization was performed by a gauge group action, we show that the dual
behaviour of these two generalizations was achieved by coupling these same
qudits in the second one through a gauge group co-action homomorphism. One of
the most striking dual aspects of these two generalizations is that, in both,
part of the quasiparticles that were inherited from the Kitaev Quantum Double
Models become confined when these action and co-action are non-trivial. But the
big news here is that, in addition to the group homomorphism (that defines this
gauge group co-action) allows us to classify all the different models of this
second generalization, this same group homomorphism also suggests that all
these models can be interpreted as two-dimensional restrictions of the $ 2
$-lattice gauge theories.

in many physical problems, such as in waves in continuous media. Functional
analysis takes us beyond finite matrices, allowing us to work with infinite
sets of continuous functions. It resolves important issues, such as whether,
why and how we can practically reduce such problems to finite matrix
approximations. It is, however, difficult to find a readable introduction that
is efficient and comprehensible for scientists and engineers. Here, I have
selected only the topics necessary for the most important results, but the
argument is mathematically complete and self-contained. The article starts from
sets and sequences of real numbers. It then develops spaces of vectors or
functions, introducing the concepts of norms and metrics that allow us to
consider how these can converge. Adding the inner product, it introduces
Hilbert spaces, and the key forms of operators that map within or between such
spaces. This leads to the concept of compact operators, which allows us to
resolve many difficulties of working with infinite sets of vectors or

operators encountered extensively in physical problems, such as those involving
waves. Finally, it introduces the eigenfunctions for major classes of
operators, and their powerful properties, and ends with singular-value
decomposition of operators. This article is written in a style that is
complementary to that of standard mathematical treatments; by relegating longer

fluid-filament interactions via the discretisation of a recently-developed,
non-local integral equation formulation to incorporate regularised Stokeslets
with half-space boundary conditions, as motivated by the importance of
confining geometries in many applications. We proceed to utilise this framework
to examine the drag on slender inextensible filaments moving near a boundary,
firstly with a relatively-simple example, evaluating the accuracy of resistive
force theories near boundaries using regularised Stokeslet segments. This
highlights that resistive force theories do not accurately quantify filament
dynamics in a range of circumstances, even with analytical corrections for the
boundary. However, there is the notable and important exception of movement in
a plane parallel to the boundary, where accuracy is maintained. In particular,
this justifies the judicious use of resistive force theories in examining the
mechanics of filaments and monoflagellate microswimmers with planar flagellar
patterns moving parallel to boundaries. We proceed to apply the numerical
framework developed here to consider how filament elastohydrodynamics can
impact drag near a boundary, analysing in detail the complex responses of a
passive cantilevered filament to an oscillatory flow. In particular, we
document the emergence of an asymmetric periodic beating in passive filaments
in particular parameter regimes, which are remarkably similar to the power and
reverse strokes exhibited by motile 9+2 cilia. Furthermore, these changes in
the morphology of the filament beating, arising from the fluid-structure
interactions, also induce a significant increase in the hydrodynamic drag of
the filament.

given tolerance around a target value. PID control systems have been widely
used in industry to control input variables in order to reach this goal.
However, this kind of Transfer Function based approach cannot be extended to
complex processes where input data might be non-numeric, high dimensional,
sparse, etc. In such cases, there is still a need for determining the subspace
of input data that produces an output within a given range. This paper presents
a non-stochastic heuristic to determine input values for a mathematical
function or trained regression model given an output range. The proposed method
creates a synthetic training data set of input combinations with a class label
that indicates whether the output is within the given target range or not.
Then, a decision tree classifier is used to determine the subspace of input
data of interest. This method is more general than a traditional controller as
the target range for the output does not have to be centered around a reference
value and it can be applied given a regression model of the output variable,
which may have categorical variables as inputs and may be high dimensional,
sparse... The proposed heuristic is validated with a proof of concept on a real
use case where the quality of a lamination factory is established to identify
the suitable subspace of production variable values.

aims to identify a high-quality cluster containing s in time roughly
proportional to the size of the cluster, regardless of the size of G. This
problem finds numerous applications on large-scale graphs. Recently, heat
kernel PageRank (HKPR), which is a measure of the proximity of nodes in graphs,
is applied to this problem and found to be more efficient compared with prior
methods. However, existing solutions for computing HKPR either are
prohibitively expensive or provide unsatisfactory error approximation on HKPR
values, rendering them impractical especially on billion-edge graphs.
  In this paper, we present TEA and TEA+, two novel local graph clustering
algorithms based on HKPR, to address the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, these algorithms provide non-trivial theoretical guarantees in
relative error of HKPR values and the time complexity. The basic idea is to
utilize deterministic graph traversal to produce a rough estimation of exact
HKPR vector, and then exploit Monte-Carlo random walks to refine the results in
an optimized and non-trivial way. In particular, TEA+ offers practical
efficiency and effectiveness due to non-trivial optimizations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TEA+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithm by more than four times on most benchmark datasets
in terms of computational time when achieving the same clustering quality, and
in particular, is an order of magnitude faster on large graphs including the
widely studied Twitter and Friendster datasets.

stabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and
rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion
mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or
cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated
angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head
impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase,
active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the
impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This
was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase,
active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse
in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments
provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The
redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle
dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared
to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively
greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness
of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.

Mech. Res. 27, 8298 (2000)] frequently used in the analysis of light evolution
through the turbulent ocean channels is the linear combination of the
temperature spectrum, the salinity spectrum and their co-spectrum, each being
described by an approximate expression developed by Hill [ J. Fluid Mech. 88,
541562 (1978)] in the first of his four suggested models. The fourth of the
Hill's models provides much more precise power spectrum than the first one
expressed via a non-linear differential equation that does not have a

fourth Hill's model valid for Prandtl/Schmidt numbers in the interval [3, 3000]
and use it for the development of a more precise oceanic power spectrum. To
illustrate the advantage of our model, we include numerical examples relating
to the spherical wave scintillation index evolving in the underwater turbulent
channels with different average temperatures, and, hence, different Prandtl
numbers for temperature and different Schmidt numbers for salinity. Since our
model is valid for a large range of Prandtl number (or/and Schmidt number), it
can be readily adjusted to oceanic waters with seasonal or extreme average
temperature and/or salinity or any other turbulent fluid with one or several
advected quantities.

  Plants Health Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Plant Phenomics based on imaging based techniques can be used to monitor the
health and the diseases of plants and crops. The use of 3D data for plant
phenomics is a recent phenomenon. However, since 3D point cloud contains more
information than plant images, in this paper, we compare the performance of
different keypoint detectors and local feature descriptors combinations for the
plant growth stage and it's growth condition classification based on 3D point
clouds of the plants. We have also implemented a modified form of 3D SIFT
descriptor, that is invariant to rotation and is computationally less intense
than most of the 3D SIFT descriptors reported in the existing literature. The
performance is evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy and the
results are presented in terms of accuracy tables. We find the ISS-SHOT and the
SIFT-SIFT combinations consistently perform better and Fisher Vector (FV) is a
better encoder than Vector of Linearly Aggregated (VLAD) for such applications.
It can serve as a better modality.

decades. In spite of advances in photogrammetry, remote sensing and computer
vision, this task remains challenging due to object and data complexity. The
development of object extraction approaches is promoted through publically
available benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks. Many aspects of
performance evaluation have already been studied. This study collects the best
practices from literature, puts the various aspects in one evaluation
framework, and demonstrates its usefulness to a case study on mapping object
outlines. The evaluation framework includes five dimensions: the robustness to
changes in resolution, input, location, parameters, and application. Examples
for investigating these dimensions are provided, as well as accuracy measures
for their qualitative analysis. The measures consist of time efficiency and a
procedure for line-based accuracy assessment regarding quantitative
completeness and spatial correctness. The delineation approach to which the
evaluation framework is applied, was previously introduced and is substantially
improved in this study.

  Neuroscience",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The hardware-software co-optimization of neural network architectures is
becoming a major stream of research especially due to the emergence of
commercial neuromorphic chips such as the IBM Truenorth and Intel Loihi.
Development of specific neural network architectures in tandem with the design
of the neuromorphic hardware considering the hardware constraints will make a
huge impact in the complete system level application. In this paper, we study
various neural network architectures and propose one that is hardware-friendly
for a neuromorphic hardware with crossbar array of synapses. Considering the
hardware constraints, we demonstrate how one may design the neuromorphic
hardware so as to maximize classification accuracy in the trained network
architecture, while concurrently, we choose a neural network architecture so as
to maximize utilization in the neuromorphic cores. We also proposed a framework
for mapping a neural network onto a neuromorphic chip named as the Mapping and
Debugging (MaD) framework. The MaD framework is designed to be generic in the
sense that it is a Python wrapper which in principle can be integrated with any
simulator tool for neuromorphic chips.
