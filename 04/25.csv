combines the robustness of parametric model with the flexibility of free-form
3D deformation. We use the deep neural networks to refine the 3D shape in a
Hierarchical Mesh Deformation (HMD) framework, utilizing the constraints from
body joints, silhouettes, and per-pixel shading information. We are able to
restore detailed human body shapes beyond skinned models. Experiments

surprisingly, but consistent with previous observations in the u' band, the UV

findings are: I. the transiting objects, circumstellar gas, and white dwarf are
all aligned along our line of sight; II. the transiting object is blocking a
larger fraction of the circumstellar gas than of the white dwarf itself.
Because most circumstellar lines are concentrated in the UV, the UV flux
appears to be less blocked compared to the optical during a transit, leading to
a shallower UV transit. This scenario is further supported by the strong
anti-correlation between optical transit depth and circumstellar line strength.
We have yet to detect any wavelength-dependent transits caused by the

lies in the equivariant context, where none of the previous work allows one to
(directly) apply such methods to actions of amenable groups on highly

nuclear C*-algebra $A$ with strict comparison, every $\Gamma$-action on $A$ has
equivariant property (SI). A more general statement involving relative property
(SI) for inclusions into ultraproducts is proved as well. As a consequence we
show that if $A$ also has finitely many rays of extremal traces, then every
$\Gamma$-action on $A$ is equivariantly Jiang-Su stable. We moreover provide
applications of the main result to the context of strongly outer actions, such

then learns a subgraph on each cluster of nodes, and finally fuses all learned

learn a subgraph structure as either a DAG or a CPDAG. In the clustering step,
we adapt the hierarchical clustering method to automatically choose a proper
number of clusters. In the fusion step, we propose a novel hybrid method that
sequentially add edges between subgraphs. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate the competitive performance of our PEF method, in terms of both

Earth system and hold the promise of being able to make robust projections of
future climate change based on physical laws. However, simulations from these
models still show many differences compared with observations. Machine learning
has been applied to solve certain prediction problems with great success, and
recently it's been proposed that this could replace the role of
physically-derived dynamical weather and climate models to give better quality
simulations. Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with
physically-derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the
errors of the latter from timestep to timestep. This maintains the physical
understanding built into the models, whilst allowing performance improvements,
and also requires much simpler algorithms and less training data. This is
tested in the context of simulating the chaotic Lorenz '96 system, and it is
shown that the approach yields models that are stable and that give both
improved skill in initialised predictions and better long-term climate
statistics. Improvements in long-term statistics are smaller than for single
time-step tendencies, however, indicating that it would be valuable to develop
methods that target improvements on longer time scales. Future strategies for
the development of this approach and possible applications to making progress
on important scientific problems are discussed.

earthquake physics. Since earthquake slip is linked to spatio-temporal
localisation of deformation, it is expected that the localised fluid pressure
around the fault plane could potentially impact the dynamic strength of the
slipping fault zone. Coseismic fluid pressure drops have been inferred from
field studies, notably in gold deposits which are thought to be formed by this
process, but reliable quantitative predictions are still lacking. Here,
experimental results are presented where local on- and off-fault fluid pressure
variations were measured in situ during dynamic rock fracture and frictional
slip under upper crustal stress conditions. During the main rupture, the
on-fault fluid pressure dropped rapidly to zero, indicating partial
vaporisation and/or degassing. Further deformation produced stick-slip events
systematically associated with near-instantaneous drops in fluid pressure,
providing direct experimental support of the concept of ``seismic suction
pump''. In situ fluid volume and wave speed measurements together with
microstructural investigations show that dilatancy is the process driving fluid
pressure drops during rupture and slip. Extrapolation of the laboratory results
indicate that dilatancy-induced fluid pressure drops might be a widespread
phenomenon in the crust, counteracting thermal pressurisation as a weakening
mechanisms in freshly fractured rock.

quasars (EVQs) that dimmed by more than 1.5 mag in the $g$ band between the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) epochs
(separated by a few years in the quasar rest frame). The quasar sample covers a
redshift range of $0.5 < z < 2.1$. Nearly half of these EVQs brightened
significantly (by more than 0.5 mag in the $g$ band) in a few years after
reaching their previous faintest state, and some EVQs showed rapid (non-blazar)
variations of greater than 1-2 mag on timescales of only months. Leveraging on
the large dynamic range in continuum variability between the earlier SDSS and
the new GMOS spectra, we explore the associated variations in the broad Mg
II,$\lambda2798$ line, whose variability properties have not been well studied
before. The broad Mg II flux varies in the same direction as the continuum
flux, albeit with a smaller amplitude, which indicates at least some portion of
Mg II is reverberating to continuum changes. However, the width (FWHM) of Mg II
does not vary accordingly as continuum changes for most objects in the sample,
in contrast to the case of the broad Balmer lines. Using the width of broad Mg
II to estimate the black hole mass therefore introduces a luminosity-dependent
bias.

require an \textit{ad hoc} range-separation \textit{parameter} $\mu$, the key

bending and electron depletion next to the surface. Both effects result in the
formation of a barrier for electron injection and extraction at the ZnO/bulk
heterojunction interface and were more pronounced in case of small ZnO
nanocrystals (high surface-area-to-volume ratio). Different transport-related
phenomena in the presence of oxygen are discussed in detail, i.e., Ohmic

high-dimensional interactions between two sets of variables, each having
potentially complex nonlinear main effects on an outcome. Construction of a
valid and powerful hypothesis test for such an interaction is challenging, due
to the difficulty in constructing an efficient and unbiased estimator for the
complex, nonlinear main effects. In this work we address this problem by
proposing a Cross-validated Ensemble of Kernels (CVEK) that learns the space of
appropriate functions for the main effects using a cross-validated ensemble
approach. With a carefully chosen library of base kernels, CVEK flexibly
estimates the form of the main-effect functions from the data, and encourages
test power by guarding against over-fitting under the alternative. The method
is motivated by a study on the interaction between metal exposures in utero and
maternal nutrition on children's neurodevelopment in rural Bangladesh. The
proposed tests identified evidence of an interaction between minerals and
vitamins intake and arsenic and manganese exposures. Results suggest that the
detrimental effects of these metals are most pronounced at low intake levels of
the nutrients, suggesting nutritional interventions in pregnant women could
mitigate the adverse impacts of in utero metal exposures on children's
neurodevelopment.

construct the polyhedral realization, we need to fix an infinite sequence

develop a quantum field theory on this spacetime. Wald and Ishibashi took a
step towards the healing of that causal issue when considering the propagation
of scalar fields on AdS. They proposed a systematic procedure to obtain a
physically consistent dynamical evolution. Their prescription relies on
determining the self-adjoint extensions of the spatial component of the
differential wave operator. Such a requirement leads to the imposition of a
specific set of boundary conditions at infinity. We employ their scheme in the
particular case of the four-dimensional AdS spacetime and compute the
expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor, which
will then bear the effects of those boundary conditions. We are not aware of
any laws of nature constraining us to prescribe the same boundary conditions to
all modes of the wave equation. Thus, we formulate a physical setup in which
one of those modes satisfy a Robin boundary condition, while all others satisfy
the Dirichlet condition. Due to our unusual settings, the resulting
contributions to the fluctuations of the expectation values will not respect
AdS invariance. As a consequence, a back-reaction procedure would yield a
non-maximally symmetric spacetime. Furthermore, we verify the violation of weak

can be carried out simply by appending the proposed trainable gate functions to
each intermediate output tensor followed by fine-tuning the overall model,
using any gradient-based training methods. So the proposed method can jointly

the S-matrix from time-ordered Green functions. Their result, the reduction
formula, is fundamental to practical calculations of scattering processes. A
known problem is that the operators that they use to create asymptotic states
create much else besides the intended particles for a scattering process. In
the infinite-time limits appropriate to scattering, the extra contributions
only disappear in matrix elements with normalizable states, rather than in the
created states themselves, i.e., the infinite-time limits of the LSZ creation
operators are weak limits. The extra particles that are created are in a
different region of space-time than the intended scattering process. To be able
to work with particle creation at non-asymptotic times, e.g., to give a
transparent and fully deductive treatment for scattering with long-lived
unstable particles, it is necessary to have operators for which the
infinite-time limits are strong limits. In this paper, I give an improved
method of constructing such operators. I use them to give an improved
systematic account of scattering theory in relativistic quantum field theories,
including a new proof of the reduction formula. I make explicit calculations to
illustrate the problems with the LSZ operators and their solution with the new
operators. Not only do these verify the existence of the extra particles
created by the LSZ operators and indicate a physical interpretation, but they
also show that the extra components are so large that their contribution to the
norm of the state is ultra-violet divergent in renormalizable theories.
Finally, I discuss the relation of this work to the work of Haag and Ruelle on
scattering theory.

the single atom scale, representing an important milestone for the development
of a silicon-based quantum computer. One especially notable platform for atomic
scale device fabrication is the so-called SiP delta-layer, consisting of an
ultra dense and sharp layer of dopants within a semiconductor host. Whilst
several alternatives exist, phosphorus dopants in silicon have drawn the most
interest, and it is on this platform that many quantum proto-devices have been
successfully demonstrated. Motivated by this, both calculations and experiments
have been dedicated to understanding the electronic structure of the SiP
delta-layer platform. In this work, we use high resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to reveal the structure of the electronic
states which exist because of the high dopant density of the SiP delta-layer.
In contrast to published theoretical work, we resolve three distinct bands, the
most occupied of which shows a large anisotropy and significant deviation from
simple parabolic behaviour. We investigate the possible origins of this fine
structure, and conclude that it is primarily a consequence of the dielectric
constant being large (ca. double that of bulk Si). Incorporating this factor
into tight binding calculations leads to a major revision of band structure;
specifically, the existence of a third band, the separation of the bands, and
the departure from purely parabolic behaviour. This new understanding of the
bandstructure has important implications for quantum proto-devices which are
built on the SiP delta-layer platform.

parameters of neural networks, such as the stochastic gradient descent.
However, these techniques tend to be computationally very expensive, and for
some tasks, where effectiveness is crucial, high computational costs are not
acceptable. Along these research lines, in this paper we propose to optimize
the parameters of neural networks by means of estimation of distribution

leading to varying $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ flux predictions from their
annihilation or decay. In this work, we study how, in the inner Galaxy, subhalo
tidal disruption from the Galactic baryonic potential impacts these signals.
Based on state-of-the art modeling of this effect from numerical simulations
and semi-analytical results, updated subhalo spatial distributions are derived
and included in the CLUMPY code. The latter is used to produce a thousand
realizations of the $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ sky. Compared to predictions based
on DM only, we conclude a decrease of the flux of the brightest subhalo by a
factor 2 to 7 for annihilating DM and no impact on decaying DM: the discovery
prospects or limits subhalos can set on DM candidates are affected by the same
factor. This study also provides probability density functions for the
distance, mass, and angular distribution of the brightest subhalo, among which
the mass may hint at its nature: it is most likely a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in
the case of strong tidal effects from the baryonic potential, whereas it is
lighter and possibly a dark halo for DM only or less pronounced tidal effects.

for the subsurface velocity model. The skeletonized representation of the
seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a
well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the
recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to
determine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the
velocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts
the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the
cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full
waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those
of the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other
skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is
required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the
autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it
provides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert
skeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation
can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic
fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and
their skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their
perturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an
autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional
neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features. In other
words, we have combined the best features of Newtonian physics and the pattern
matching capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by Newtonian
machine learning.

unsupervised generative models, featuring ease of training and latent
representation of data. The objective function of VAE does not guarantee to
achieve the latter, however, and failure to do so leads to a frequent failure
mode called posterior collapse. Even in successful cases, VAEs often result in
low-precision reconstructions and generated samples. The introduction of the
KL-divergence weight $\beta$ can help steer the model clear of posterior
collapse, but its tuning is often a trial-and-error process with no guiding
metrics. Here we test the idea of using the total VAE loss of generated samples
(generated loss) as the proxy metric for generation quality, the related
hypothesis that VAE reconstruction from the mean latent vector tends to be a
more typical example of its class than the original, and the idea of exploiting
this property by augmenting training data with generated variants (augmented
training). The results are mixed, but repeated encoding and decoding indeed
result in qualitatively and quantitatively more typical examples from both
convolutional and fully-connected MNIST VAEs, suggesting that it may be an
inherent property of the VAE framework.

as a single critical point where the gap function or, equivalently, the order

superconductors described by standard BCS models, the superconducting gap
survives near the sample boundaries at higher temperatures than
superconductivity in the bulk. Therefore, conventional superconductors have
multiple critical points associated with separate phase transitions at the
boundary and in the bulk. We show this by revising the Caroli-De
Gennes-Matricon theory of a superconductor-vacuum boundary and finding
inhomogeneous solutions of the BCS gap equation near the boundary, which
asymptotically decay in the bulk. This is demonstrated for a BCS model of
almost free fermions and for lattice fermions in a tight-binding approximation.
The analytical results are confirmed by numerical solutions of the microscopic
model. The existence of these boundary states can manifest itself as
discrepancies between the critical temperatures observed in calorimetry and
transport probes.

atmosphere and wind models for M-type AGB stars, covering a wide range of
relevant stellar parameters. We used the DARWIN code, which includes
frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics and a time-dependent description of
dust condensation and evaporation, to simulate the dynamical atmosphere. The
wind-driving mechanism is photon scattering on submicron-sized Mg$_2$SiO$_4$
grains. The grid consists of $\sim4000$ models, with luminosities from
$L_\star=890\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$ to $L_\star=40000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$ and
effective temperatures from 2200K to 3400K. For the first time different
current stellar masses are explored with M-type DARWIN models, ranging from
0.75M$_\odot$ to 3M$_\odot$. The modelling results are radial atmospheric
structures, dynamical properties such as mass-loss rates and wind velocities,
and dust properties (e.g. grain sizes, dust-to-gas ratios, and degree of
condensed Si). We find that the mass-loss rates of the models correlate
strongly with luminosity. They also correlate with the ratio $L_*/M_*$:
increasing $L_*/M_*$ by an order of magnitude increases the mass-loss rates by
about three orders of magnitude, which may naturally create a superwind regime
in evolution models. There is, however, no discernible trend of mass-loss rate
with effective temperature, in contrast to what is found for C-type AGB stars.
We also find that the mass-loss rates level off at luminosities higher than
$\sim14000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$, and consequently at pulsation periods longer
than $\sim800$ days. The final grain radii range from 0.25 micron to 0.6
micron. The amount of condensed Si is typically between 10% and 40%, with
gas-to-dust mass ratios between 500 and 4000.

suggest ongoing interaction and which exhibit red mid-infrared colors often
associated with powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In a follow-up to our
pilot study, we now present Chandra/ACIS and XMM-Newton X-ray observations for
the full sample of the brightest 15 IR-preselected mergers. All mergers reveal
at least one nuclear X-ray source, with 8 out of 15 systems exhibiting dual
nuclear X-ray sources, highly suggestive of single and dual AGNs. Combining
these X-ray results with optical line ratios and with near-IR coronal emission
line diagnostics, obtained with the near-IR spectrographs on the Large
Binocular Telescope, we confirm that 13 out of the 15 mergers host AGNs, two of
which host dual AGNs. Several of these AGNs are not detected in the optical.
All X-ray sources appear X-ray weak relative to their mid-infrared continuum,
and of the nine X-ray sources with sufficient counts for spectral analysis,
eight reveal strong evidence of high absorption with column densities of
$N_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$. These observations demonstrate that a
significant population of single and dual AGNs are missed by optical studies,
due to high absorption, adding to the growing body of evidence that the epoch
of peak black hole growth in mergers occurs in a highly obscured phase.

variable sources can be used to constrain absolute distances in the Universe

other cosmological parameters. To convert the time delay into distances, it is
well known that the gravitational potential of the main deflector and the
contribution of the matter along the line-of-sight need to be known to a
sufficient level of precision. In this paper, we discuss a new astrometric
requirement that is becoming important as time-delay cosmography improves in
precision and accuracy with larger samples, and better data and modelling
techniques. We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric
uncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble
constant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative
time delay. We note that this requirement applies equally to the image position
measurements and to the accuracy of the model in reproducing them. To
illustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing configurations and
highlight that, especially for time delays of order 10 days or shorter, the
relative astrometric requirement is of order milli-arcseconds, setting a tight
requirement on both measurements and models. With current optical infrared
technology, astrometric uncertainties may be the dominant limitation for strong
lensing cosmography in the small image-separation regime when high-precision
time-delays become accessible.

halos play a more central role than stars in tracing and growing SMBHs

better with the gas mass than dark matter mass. We show the important role of
the environment, morphology, and relic galaxies/coronae, as well as the main
departures from virialization/self-similarity via the optical/X-ray fundamental

have inconsistent anti-correlation with X-ray halos and too low feeding;
cosmological simulations find SMBH mergers as sub-dominant over most of the
cosmic time and too rare to induce a central-limit-theorem effect; the scalings
are consistent with chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of matter condensing
out of the turbulent X-ray halos that sustains a long-term self-regulated
feedback loop. The new correlations are major observational constraints for
models of SMBH feeding/feedback in galaxies, groups, and clusters (e.g., to
test cosmological hydrodynamical simulations), and enable the study of SMBHs

slope $\Gamma$ and a minimum merger time $t_{\rm min}$, and also allow the
overall BNS formation efficiency per unit stellar mass to vary. By convolving
the DTD and mass efficiency with the cosmic star formation history, and then
with the GW detector capabilities, we explore two relevant regimes. First, for
the current generation of GW detectors, which are only sensitive to the local
universe, but can lead to precise redshift determinations via the
identification of electromagnetic counterparts and host galaxies, we show that
the DTD parameters are strongly degenerate with the unknown mass efficiency and
therefore cannot be determined uniquely. Second, for third-generation detectors

mergers at cosmological distances, but with a redshift uncertainty inherent to
GW-only detections ($\delta(z)/z\approx 0.1z$), we show that the DTD and mass
efficiency can be well-constrained to better than 10\% with a year of

mapping of the BNS merger redshift distribution will be supplemented by more

spatial morphology of M31 $\gamma$-ray emission could trace a population of
unresolved sources and energetic particles originating in sources not related
to massive star formation. Alternatively, the $\gamma$-ray emission could also
be an indication of annihilation or decay of DM particles. We investigate these
two possibilities using almost 10 years of data from the Fermi LAT. An
interpretation that involves only a DM $\gamma$-ray emission is in tension with
the current limits from other searches, such as those targeting Milky Way dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. When we include a template of astrophysical emission,
tuned on $\gamma$-ray data or from observations of these galaxies in other
wavelengths, we do not find any significant evidence for a DM contribution and
we set limits for the annihilation cross section that probe the thermal cross
section for DM masses up to a few tens of GeV in the $b\bar{b}$ and
$\tau^+\tau^-$ channels. For models where the DM substructures have masses

These Low Ionization Emission Regions (LIERs) were originally attributed to a
central, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. However, the recent discovery
of spatially-extended LIER emission suggests ionization by both a central
source and an extended component that follows a stellar-like radial
distribution. For passively-evolving galaxies with old stellar populations, hot
post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are the only viable extended source of
ionizing photons. In this work, we present the first prediction of LIER-like
emission from post-AGB stars that is based on fully self-consistent stellar
evolution and photoionization models. We show that models where post-AGB stars
are the dominant source of ionizing photons reproduce the nebular emission
signatures observed in ETGs, including LIER-like emission line ratios in
standard optical diagnostic diagrams and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths of order
0.1-3 angstroms. We test the sensitivity of LIER-like emission to the details
of post-AGB models, including the mass loss efficiency and convective mixing
efficiency, and show that line strengths are relatively insensitive to post-AGB
timescale variations. Finally, we examine the UV-optical colors of the models
and the stellar populations responsible for the UV-excess observed in some
ETGs. We find that allowing as little as 3% of the HB population to be
uniformly distributed to very hot temperatures (30,000 K) produces realistic UV

anisotropies on large angular scales have uncovered a number of anomalous
features of marginal statistical significance, such as a hemispherical power
asymmetry, lack of power on large angular scales, and features in the power
spectrum. Because the primary CMB temperature has been measured at the cosmic
variance limit, determining if these anomalies are hints of new physics as
opposed to foregrounds, systematics, or simply statistical flukes, requires new
observables. In this paper, we highlight the potential contribution that future
measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and the polarized
Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (pSZ) could make in determining the physical nature
of several CMB anomalies. The kSZ and pSZ effects, temperature and polarization
anisotropies induced by scattering from free electrons in the reionized
Universe, are the dominant blackbody contribution to the CMB on small angular
scales. Using the technique of SZ tomography, measurements of kSZ and pSZ
effects can be combined with galaxy surveys to reconstruct the remote CMB
dipole and quadrupole fields, providing a 3-dimensional probe of large scale
modes inside our Hubble volume. Building on previous work, we forecast the
additional constraining power that these observables might offer for a
representative set of anomaly models. We find that the remote CMB dipole and
quadrupole contain a similar amount of information on anomaly models as the
primary CMB polarization. The information from CMB temperature, polarization,
and the remote dipole and quadrupole fields is complementary, and the full set
of observables can improve constraints on anomaly models by a factor of $\sim
2-4$ using next-generation CMB experiments and galaxy surveys. This could be
sufficient to definitively establish the physical origin of several CMB
anomalies.

  Protocol",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a process of \emph{averaging} in a distributed system with
\emph{noisy communication}. Each of the agents in the system starts with some
value and the goal of each agent is to compute the average of all the initial
values. In each round, one pair of agents is drawn uniformly at random from the
whole population, communicates with each other and each of these two agents
updates their local value based on their own value and the received message.
The communication is noisy and whenever an agent sends any value $v$, the
receiving agent receives $v+N$, where $N$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random
variable. The two quality measures of interest are (i) the total sum of squares
$TSS(t)$, which measures the sum of square distances from the average load to
the \emph{initial average} and (ii) $\bar{\phi}(t)$, measures the sum of square
distances from the average load to the \emph{running average} (average at time
$t$).
  It is known that the simple averaging protocol---in which an agent sends its
current value and sets its new value to the average of the received value and
its current value---converges eventually to a state where $\bar{\phi}(t)$ is
small.
  It has been observed that $TSS(t)$, due to the noise, eventually diverges and
previous research---mostly in control theory---has focused on showing eventual
convergence w.r.t. the running average.
  We obtain the first probabilistic bounds on the convergence time of
$\bar{\phi}(t)$ and precise bounds on the drift of $TSS(t)$ that show that
albeit $TSS(t)$ eventually diverges, for a wide and interesting range of
parameters, $TSS(t)$ stays small for a number of rounds that is polynomial in
the number of agents.

are restricted to discrete values and perform rounding.

states using LOCC protocols, with the goal to optimize the probability of
correctly identifying the state. We provide two different methods to show that
finitely many measurement outcomes in every step are sufficient for approaching
the optimal probability of discrimination. In the first method, each
measurement of an optimal LOCC protocol, applied to a $d_{\rm loc}$-dim local
system, is replaced by one with at most $2d_{\rm loc}^2$ outcomes, without
changing the probability of success. In the second method, we decompose any
LOCC protocol into a convex combination of a number of ""slim protocols"" in
which each measurement applied to a $d_{\rm loc}$-dim local system has at most
$d_{\rm loc}^2$ outcomes. To maximize any convex functions in LOCC (including
the probability of state discrimination or fidelity of state transformation),
an optimal protocol can be replaced by the best slim protocol in the convex
decomposition without using shared randomness. For either method, the bound on
the number of outcomes per measurement is independent of the global dimension,
the number of parties, the depth of the protocol, how deep the measurement is
located, and applies to LOCC protocols with infinite rounds, and the
""measurement compression"" can be done ""top-down"" -- independent of later
operations in the LOCC protocol. The second method can be generalized to
implement LOCC instruments with finitely many outcomes: if the instrument has
$n$ coarse-grained final measurement outcomes, global input dimension $D_0$ and
global output dimension $D_i$ for $i=1,...,n$ conditioned on the $i$-th
outcome, then one can obtain the instrument as a convex combination of no more

examination of the procedure reveals that the na\""ive application of these
equations exhibits spurious unphysical properties for even an infinitesimal

magnitude of the superfluid gap are relatively small, we see a significant
difference between applications for neutron matter and the Lennard-Jones and

as large as half the Fermi energy, the corrections to the gap are relatively
small. In the Lennard-Jones and P\""oschl-Teller models, the most visible
consequence of the self-consistent calculation is the change in stability range

in drastic OFDM-VLC performance degradation. The first part of this work,
experimentally confirms and models this degradation due to temperature in a

inherent to the HPLED and which is accentuated by the effect of the intrinsic

reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver for such

transmitter module. The system is modeled so that the operating points are
mathematically deduced and evaluated by simulations and by an experimental

maintenance of an average SNR in all OFDM subcarriers, the performance
improvement is confirmed in comparison with other schemes, such as with
non-predistortion, pre-distortion with fixed parameters, and simple

unperceptive to human ears that is intentionally added to the audio signal and
causes a machine learning model to make mistakes. This poses a security concern
about the safety of machine learning models since the adversarial attacks can
fool such models toward the wrong predictions. In this paper we first review
some strong adversarial attacks that may affect both audio signals and their 2D
representations and evaluate the resiliency of the most common machine learning
model, namely deep learning models and support vector machines (SVM) trained on
2D audio representations such as short time Fourier transform (STFT), discrete
wavelet transform (DWT) and cross recurrent plot (CRP) against several
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Next, we propose a novel approach based
on pre-processed DWT representation of audio signals and SVM to secure audio
systems against adversarial attacks. The proposed architecture has several
preprocessing modules for generating and enhancing spectrograms including
dimension reduction and smoothing. We extract features from small patches of
the spectrograms using speeded up robust feature (SURF) algorithm which are
further used to generate a codebook using the K-Means++ algorithm. Finally,
codewords are used to train a SVM on the codebook of the SURF-generated
vectors. All these steps yield to a novel approach for audio classification
that provides a good trade-off between accuracy and resilience. Experimental
results on three environmental sound datasets show the competitive performance
of proposed approach compared to the deep neural networks both in terms of
accuracy and robustness against strong adversarial attacks.

agree, with scatter <~0.3 dex. In agreement with previous studies, most
galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients (the centers are redder

strength has significant trends with increasing stellar mass, half-light

seen before at z>1. Furthermore, color gradients of star-forming and quiescent

the contrary, the use of hybrid functionals, which naturally take into account

graph Laplacian, which can be seen as message passing between the adjacent
neighbors through a generic random walk. In this paper, we propose PAN, a new
graph convolution framework that involves every path linking the message sender
and receiver with learnable weights depending on the path length, which
corresponds to the maximal entropy random walk. PAN generalizes the graph
Laplacian to a new transition matrix we call \emph{maximal entropy transition}
(MET) matrix derived from a path integral formalism. Most previous graph
convolutional network architectures can be adapted to our framework, and many
variations and derivatives based on the path integral idea can be developed.
Experimental results show that the path integral based graph neural networks
have great learnability and fast convergence rate, and achieve state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark tasks.

We test the robustness of sentence encoding approaches for NMT encoder-decoder

double copy of a gauge theory point charge. This is a vacuum solution in gauge
theory, but leads to a non-vacuum solution in gravity, which we show is
consistent with previously derived constraints. Furthermore, we successfully
interpret the non-trivial stress-energy tensor on the gravity side as arising
from a dilaton profile, and the Newtonian description of a point charge emerges
as expected in the appropriate limit. Thus, our results provide a non-trivial

process with predicted half-lives that surpass the age of the Universe by many
orders of magnitude. Until now, indications for $2\nu$ECEC decays have only
been seen for two isotopes, $^{78}$Kr and $^{130}$Ba, and instruments with very
low background levels are needed to detect them directly with high statistical
significance. The $2\nu$ECEC half-life provides an important input for nuclear
structure models and its measurement represents a first step in the search for
the neutrinoless double electron capture processes ($0\nu$ECEC). A detection of
the latter would have implications for the nature of the neutrino and give
access to the absolute neutrino mass. Here we report on the first direct
observation of $2\nu$ECEC in $^{124}$Xe with the XENON1T Dark Matter detector.
The significance of the signal is $4.4\sigma$ and the corresponding half-life
$T_{1/2}^{2\nu\text{ECEC}} = (1.8\pm 0.5_\text{stat}\pm 0.1_\text{sys})\times
10^{22}\;\text{y}$ is the longest ever measured directly. This study
demonstrates that the low background and large target mass of xenon-based Dark
Matter detectors make them well suited to measuring other rare processes as
well, and it highlights the broad physics reach for even larger next-generation
experiments.

Our approach uses a Krylov solver (GMRES) that is preconditioned with an
alternating method of multipliers (ADMM). We show that this ADMM-GMRES approach
overcomes well-known scalability issues of Schur complement decomposition in
problems that exhibit a high degree of coupling. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated using linear systems that arise in stochastic optimal
power flow problems and that contain up to 2 million total variables and 4,000

faster than Schur complement decomposition. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
approach is robust to the selection of the augmented Lagrangian penalty
parameter, which is a key advantage over the direct use of ADMM.

developing and training noise-robust networks. In this work, we propose a new
training regularizer that aims to minimize the probabilistic expected training
loss of a DNN subject to a generic Gaussian input. We provide an efficient and
simple approach to approximate such a regularizer for arbitrary deep networks.
This is done by leveraging the analytic expression of the output mean of a
shallow neural network; avoiding the need for the memory and computationally
expensive data augmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on LeNet and
AlexNet on various datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100

gas at the Milky Way disk-halo interface detected as absorption in the
foreground of seven closely-spaced, high-latitude halo blue horizontal branch
stars (BHBs) with heights z = 3 - 14 kpc. We detect transitions that trace
multiple ionization states (e.g. CaII, FeII, SiIV, CIV) with column densities
that remain constant with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most
likely lies within z < 3.4 kpc. The intermediate ionization state gas traced by
CIV and SiIV is strongly correlated over the full range of transverse
separations probed by our sightlines, indicating large, coherent structures
greater than 1 kpc in size. The low ionization state material traced by CaII
and FeII does not exhibit a correlation with either N$_{\rm HI}$ or transverse
separation, implying cloudlets or clumpiness on scales less than 10 pc. We find
that the observed ratio log(N_SiIV/ N_CIV), with a median value of
-0.69+/-0.04, is sensitive to the total carbon content of the ionized gas under
the assumption of either photoionization or collisional ionization. The only
self-consistent solution for photoionized gas requires that Si be depleted onto
dust by 0.35 dex relative to the solar Si/C ratio, similar to the level of Si
depletion in DLAs and in the Milky Way ISM. The allowed range of values for the
areal mass infall rate of warm, ionized gas at the disk-halo interface is
0.0003 < dM_gas / dtdA [M_sun kpc^-2 yr^-] < 0.006. Our data support a physical
scenario in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its
disk-halo interface that involve kpc-scale ionized envelopes or streams
containing pc-scale, cool clumps.

a nonlinear panel, in the absence of rotational inertia, immersed in an
inviscid potential flow. An intrinsic component of the analysis is the study of
a plate equation with a {\it delay} term---a fundamentally non-gradient
dynamics. First, we construct a compact global attractor and observe that the
attractor is smooth, with finite fractal dimension in the state space.
Secondly, by fattening the attractor, we obtain an exponential attractor,
though with finite dimension only in an extended space. Lastly, we show that a
finite set of {\em determining functionals} exists by considering the {\em

university and corporate campuses. To relieve this pressure, this paper studies
a car-pooling platform that would match riders and drivers, while guaranteeing
a ride back and exploiting spatial and temporal locality. In particular, the
paper formalizes the Commute Trip Sharing Problem (CTSP) to find a routing plan
that maximizes ride sharing for a set of commute trips. The CTSP is a
generalization of the vehicle routing problem with routes that satisfy time
window, capacity, pairing, precedence, ride duration, and driver constraints.
The paper introduces two exact algorithms for the CTPS: A route-enumeration

a high-fidelity, real-world dataset of commute trips from a mid-size city, both
algorithms optimally solve small and medium-sized problems and produce
high-quality solutions for larger problem instances. The results show that car
pooling, if widely adopted, has the potential to reduce vehicle usage by up to
57% and decrease vehicle miles traveled by up to 46% while only incurring a 22%
increase in average ride time per commuter for the trips considered.

periodically arranged subwavelength slits, with two slits per period. There are
two classes of resonances, corresponding to poles of a scattering problem. A
sequence of resonances has an imaginary part that is nonzero and on the order
of the width $\varepsilon$ of the slits; these are associated with Fabry-Perot
resonance, with field enhancement of order $1/\varepsilon$ in the slits. The
focus of this study is another class of resonances which become real valued at
normal incidence, when the Bloch wavenumber $\kappa$ is zero. These are
embedded eigenvalues of the scattering operator restricted to a period cell,
and the associated eigenfunctions extend to surface waves of the slab that lie
within the radiation continuum. When $0<|\kappa|\ll 1$, the real embedded
eigenvalues will be perturbed as complex-valued resonances, which induce the
Fano resonance phenomenon. We derive the asymptotic expansions of embedded
eigenvalues and their perturbations as resonances when the Bloch wavenumber
becomes nonzero. Based on the quantitative analysis of the diffracted field, we
prove that the Fano-type anomalies occurs for the transmission of energy
through the slab, and show that the field enhancement is of order
$1/(\kappa\varepsilon)$, which is stronger than Fabry-Perot resonance.

the nearest-neighbor problem and the center problem. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a set
of $n$ polygonal curves, each of size $m$. In the nearest-neighbor problem, the
goal is to construct a compact data structure over $\mathcal{C}$, such that,
given a query curve $Q$, one can efficiently find the curve in $\mathcal{C}$
closest to $Q$. In the center problem, the goal is to find a curve $Q$, such
that the maximum distance between $Q$ and the curves in $\mathcal{C}$ is
minimized. We use the well-known discrete Frechet distance function, both
under~$L_\infty$ and under $L_2$, to measure the distance between two curves.
  For the nearest-neighbor problem, despite discouraging previous results, we
identify two important cases for which it is possible to obtain practical
bounds, even when $m$ and $n$ are large. In these cases, either $Q$ is a line
segment or $\mathcal{C}$ consists of line segments, and the bounds on the size
of the data structure and query time are nearly linear in the size of the input
and query curve, respectively. The returned answer is either exact under
$L_\infty$, or approximated to within a factor of $1+\varepsilon$ under~$L_2$.
We also consider the variants in which the location of the input curves is only
fixed up to translation, and obtain similar bounds, under $L_\infty$.
  As for the center problem, we study the case where the center is a line
segment, i.e., we seek the line segment that represents the given set as well
as possible. We present near-linear time exact algorithms under $L_\infty$,
even when the location of the input curves is only fixed up to translation.
Under $L_2$, we present a roughly $O(n^2m^3)$-time exact algorithm.

sampled graphs that treat a person's view as a sampling method for a network.
The modularity for a sampled graph, called the generalized modularity in the

interpretation. One of the main contributions of this book chapter is to
propose using the generalized modularity matrix for network embedding and show
that the network embedding problem can be treated as a trace maximization
problem like the community detection problem. Our generalized modularity
embedding approach is very general and flexible. In particular, we show that

Compton-thin source. Combining archival data from $Suzaku$, $Chandra$, and -
most importantly - new data from $NuSTAR$, and using three distinct families of

10^{24}~\rm cm^{-2}$). Its 2-30~keV spectrum is dominated by reprocessed
emission from distant material, characterized by a strong Fe K$\alpha$ line and
a Compton hump. We found a large equivalent width of the Fe K$\alpha$ line
($\rm EW = 2.3 \pm 0.3$ keV) and a high intrinsic-to-observed flux ratio ($\sim
100$). All of these observations are typical for bona fide CTAGN. We estimate a
bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} \simeq 0.014 \pm 0.005~L_{\rm Edd.}$. The
$Chandra$ image of NGC 5347 reveals the presence of extended emission
dominating the soft X-ray spectrum ($E < 2\,\rm keV$), which coincides with the
[O III] emission detected in the $Hubble ~Space~ Telescope$ images. Comparison
to other CTAGN suggests that NGC 5347 is broadly consistent with the average
properties of this source class. We simulated $XRISM$ and $Athena$/X-IFU
spectra of the source, showing the potential of these future missions in

model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. On each horizontal layer $\{(x,i): x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$

are also vertical edges connecting two nearest neighbor vertices on distinct
layers $\langle(x, i), (x, i+1)\rangle$ for $x, i \in\mathbb{Z}$. On this graph
we consider the following anisotropic independent percolation model: horizontal
edges are open with probability $1/(2N)$, while vertical edges are open with
probability $\epsilon$ to be suitably tuned as $N$ grows to infinity. The main
result tells that if $\epsilon=\kappa N^{-2/5}$, we see a phase transition in
$\kappa$: positive and finite constants $C_1, C_2$ exist so that there is no
percolation if $\kappa < C_1$ while percolation occurs for $\kappa > C_2$. The
question is motivated by a result on the analogous layered ferromagnetic Ising
model at mean field critical temperature [J. Stat. Phys. (2015), 161, 91-123]
where the authors showed the existence of multiple Gibbs measures for a fixed
value of the vertical interaction and conjectured a change of behavior in
$\kappa$ when the vertical interaction suitably vanishes as $\kappa\gamma^b$,
where $1/\gamma$ is the range of the horizontal interaction. For the product
percolation model we have a value of $b$ that differs from what was conjectured
in that paper. The proof relies on the analysis of the scaling limit of the
critical branching random walk that dominates the growth process restricted to
each horizontal layer and a careful analysis of the true horizontal growth
process. This is inspired by works on the long range contact process [Probab.

(PILs) as efficient dispersants of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). With
these polymeric dispersants, highly stable fine dispersions of MWCNTs (inks)
can be easily prepared in aqueous media and applied for rather simple but
efficient surface modification of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). Such a
modification of SPEs remarkably increases the electroactive surface area and
accelerates the electron transfer rate due to synergistic combination of
specific features of MWCNTs such as strong adsorptive property and high
specific surface with the advantages of PILs like ion conductivity and
dispersability. We further show that the PIL/MWCNT-modified SPEs can be
beneficially utilized for direct electrochemical analysis of double stranded
DNA (dsDNA). Specifically, it is exemplified by the direct electrooxidation of
guanine and adenine bases in salmon testes dsDNA chosen as a model system. The
linear ranges for the determination of dsDNA correspond to 5-500 microg per mL
for the oxidative peak of guanine and 0.5-50 microg per mL for the oxidative
peak of adenine. This makes direct electrochemical dsDNA detection with the use
of the easy-preparable PIL/MWCNT-modified SPEs strongly competing to currently
applied spectral and fluorescent techniques. Furthermore, we show that the
developed constructs are capable of sensing a single point mutation in the
12-bases single-stranded DNA fragments. Such detection is of high clinical
significance in choosing an adequate anticancer treatment, where the
electrochemical identification of the point mutation could offer time and cost
benefits.

to which quantum information can withstand degradation by interactions with its
environment. However, calculating capacities directly is known to be
intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain
capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from
operator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent
progress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and
geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we
introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called
transferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a
classical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. We study two subclasses of
such kernels: H\""ormander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on
finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing
channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on
$d$ qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels
that randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work
by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov
kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different
non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article
is the application of this transference principle to the estimation of various
capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the
first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our
estimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence
channels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a
lack of techniques.

of the protoplanetary disc produces a net torque resulting in a variation of
the semi-major axis of the planet. For low-mass planets not able to open a gap
in the gaseous disc this regime is known as type I migration. Pioneer works
studied this mechanism in isothermal discs finding fast inward type I migration
rates that were unable to reproduce the observed properties of extrasolar
planets. In the last years, several improvements have been made in order to
extend the study of type I migration rates to non-isothermal discs. Moreover,
it was recently shown that if the planet's luminosity due to solid accretion is
taken into account, inward migration could be slowed down and even reversed. In
this work, we study the planet formation process incorporating, and comparing,
updated type I migration rates for non-isothermal discs and the role of
planet's luminosity over such rates. We find that the latter can have important
effects on planetary evolution, producing a significant outward migration for
the growing planets.

assess. The challenge only increases when organizations turn to third parties
to provide technology and business services, which typically require tight
network integration and sharing of confidential data, potentially increasing
the organization's attack surface. The security maturity of an organization
describes how well it mitigates known risks and responds to new threats. Today,
maturity is typically assessed with audits and questionnaires, which are
difficult to quantify, lack objectivity, and may not reflect current threats.
  This paper demonstrates how external measurement of an organization can be
used to assess the relative quality of security among organizations. Using a
large dataset from BitSight(www.bitsight.com), a cybersecurity ratings company,
containing 3.2 billion measurements spanning nearly 37,000 organizations
collected during calendar year 2015, we show how per-organizational ""risk
vectors"" can be constructed that may be related to an organization's overall
security posture, or maturity. Using statistical analysis, we then study the
correlation between the risk vectors and botnet infections. For example, we
find that misconfigured TLS services, publicly available unsecured protocols,
and the use of peer-to-peer file sharing correlate with organizations that have
increased rates of botnet infections. We argue that the methodology used to
identify these correlations can easily be applied to other data to provide a
growing picture of organizational security using external measurement.

addressed: (1) the sector of flavor-symmetry-breaking fields is simplified and
their potential studied explicitly, (2) a flavorful axion is introduced to
solve the strong CP problem and (3) the model is extended to include the

Prior work to apply ML on this problem implemented a Support Vector Machine

than anyone heuristic alone. The present work extends to have ML select the

shortest computing time was selected as the target class for ML. Features were
generated from the polynomial input and used to train the following ML models:
k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), decision
tree (DT) and SVM, as implemented in the Python scikit-learn package. We also
compared these with the two leading human constructed heuristics for the

outperformed the human made heuristics, some by a large margin.

  problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical extragradient schemes and their stochastic counterpart represent a
cornerstone for resolving monotone variational inequality problems. Yet, such
schemes have a per-iteration complexity of two projections onto a convex set
and require two evaluations of the map, the former of which could be relatively
expensive if $X$ is a complicated set. We consider two related avenues where
the per-iteration complexity is significantly reduced: (i) A stochastic
projected reflected gradient method requiring a single evaluation of the map
and a single projection; and (ii) A stochastic subgradient extragradient method
that requires two evaluations of the map, a single projection onto $X$, and a
significantly cheaper projection (onto a halfspace) computable in closed form.
Under a variance-reduced framework reliant on a sample-average of the map based
on an increasing batch-size, we prove almost sure (a.s.) convergence of the
iterates to a random point in the solution set for both schemes. Additionally,
both schemes display a non-asymptotic rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ where $K$
denotes the number of iterations; notably, both rates match those obtained in
deterministic regimes. To address feasibility sets given by the intersection of
a large number of convex constraints, we adapt both of the aforementioned
schemes to a random projection framework. We then show that the random
projection analogs of both schemes also display a.s. convergence under a
weak-sharpness requirement; furthermore, without imposing the weak-sharpness
requirement, both schemes are characterized by a provable rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ in terms of the gap function of the projection of the
averaged sequence onto $X$ as well as the infeasibility of this sequence.
Preliminary numerics support theoretical findings and the schemes outperform
standard extragradient schemes in terms of the per-iteration complexity.

force and abruptly comes to rest as its momentum transfers to the grains. An
empirical drag force law successfully describes the force experienced by the
projectile, and the corresponding grain-scale mechanisms have been deciphered

Accordingly, we extend studies to explore oblique impact, in which a
significant horizontal component of the drag force is present. In our
experiments, a projectile impacts a quasi-two-dimensional bed of bidisperse
photoelastic grains. We use high-speed imaging to measure high-resolution
position data of the projectile trajectory and simultaneously visualize
particle-scale force propagation in the granular medium. When the impact angle
becomes important, the spatial structure of the stress response reveals
relatively weak force chain propagation in the horizontal direction. Based on

ubiquitous in geophysical and engineering flows. Under these conditions,
turbulence may experience a counter-intuitive depletion of the turbulent
stresses, which has important implications for modelling and control. Yet,
current turbulence theories have been established mainly for statistically
two-dimensional equilibrium flows and are unable to predict the reduction in
the Reynolds stress magnitude. In the present work, we propose a multiscale
model which explains the response of non-equilibrium wall-bounded turbulence
under the imposition of three-dimensional strain. The analysis is performed via
direct numerical simulation of transient three-dimensional turbulent channels
subjected to a sudden lateral pressure gradient at friction Reynolds numbers up
to 1,000. We show that the flow regimes and scaling properties of the Reynolds
stress are consistent with a model comprising momentum-carrying eddies with
sizes and time scales proportional to their distance to the wall. We further
demonstrate that the reduction in Reynolds stress follows a spatially and
temporally self-similar evolution caused by the relative horizontal
displacement between the core of the momentum-carrying eddies and the flow
layer underneath. Inspection of the flow energetics reveals that this mechanism
is associated with lower levels of pressure-strain correlation which ultimately
inhibits the generation of Reynolds stress. Finally, we assess the ability of
the state-of-the-art wall-modelled large-eddy simulation to predict
non-equilibrium, three-dimensional flows.

(GRB) is mostly available only at energies $\gtrsim10$ keV, where the main
instruments for GRB detection are sensitive. The origin of this emission is
still very uncertain because of the apparent inconsistency with synchrotron
radiation, which is the most obvious candidate, and the resulting need for
considering less straightforward scenarios. The inclusion of data down to soft
X-rays ($\sim$ 0.5 keV), which are available only in a small fraction of GRBs,
has firmly established the common presence of a spectral break in the
low-energy part of prompt spectra, and the consistency of the overall spectral
shape with synchrotron radiation in the moderately fast-cooling regime, the
low-energy break being identified with the cooling frequency. In this work we
further extend the range of investigation down to the optical band. In
particular, we test the synchrotron interpretation by directly fitting a
theoretically derived synchrotron spectrum and making use of optical to
gamma-ray data. Secondly, we test an alternative model that considers the
presence of a black-body component at $\sim$keV energies, in addition to a
non-thermal component that is responsible for the emission at the spectral peak
(100 keV-1 MeV). We find that synchrotron radiation provides a good description
of the broadband data, while models composed of a thermal and a non-thermal
component require the introduction of a low-energy break in the non-thermal
component in order to be consistent with optical observations. Motivated by the
good quality of the synchrotron fits, we explore the physical parameter space
of the emitting region. In a basic prompt emission scenario we find quite
contrived solutions for the magnetic field strength (5 G $<B^\prime<40$ G) and
for the location of the region where the radiation is produced

identification of location effects is pursued. Indeed, methods for identifying
dispersion effects typically require first modeling location effects.
Therefore, it is imperative to understand how methods for identifying location
effects function in the presence of undetected dispersion effects. We used
simulation studies to examine the robustness of four different methods for

between the angular and radial motion of the binary also excites a series of

gold/Parylene-C/Pentacene under constant voltage stress (CVS) was investigated
to explore the electrical stability and reliability of Parylene C as a gate
dielectric in flexible electronics. A stress voltage of fixed magnitude as high
as 20 V, both negative and positive in polarity, was applied to each MIS
capacitor at room temperature for a fixed duration as long as 10 s. The CVS
effects on the capacitance-voltage curve-shift, the time-dependent leakage
current, and the time-dependent dielectric breakdown were measured and
analyzed. CVS is observed to induce charge in Parylene-C and its interfaces
with gold and Pentacene. The net induced charge is positive and negative for,
respectively, negative and positive gate bias polarity during CVS. The
magnitude of the charge accumulated following positive gate CVS is
significantly higher than that following negative gate bias CVS in the range of
4 to 25 nC cm$^{-2}$. In contrast, the leakage current during the negative gate
stress is three orders of magnitude higher than that during the positive gate
stress for the same bias stress magnitude. The charge buildup and leakage
current are due to the trapping of electrons and holes near the
Parylene-C/Pentacene interface as well as in the Parylene-C layer. Before the
application of the CVS, a dielectric breakdown occurs at an electric field of
1.62 MV cm$^{-1}$. After the application of the CVS, the breakdown voltage
decreases and the density of the trapped charges increases as the stress
voltage increases in magnitude, with the polarity of the trapped charges
opposite to that of the stress voltage. The magnitude and direction of the
capacitance-voltage curve-shift depend on the trapping and recombination of
electrons and holes in the Parylene-C layer and in the proximity of the
Parylene-C/Pentacene interface during CVS.

prover that uses a representation of beliefs in mathematical claims to
construct proofs. The inspiration for doing so comes from the practices of
human mathematicians where ""plausible reasoning"" is applied in addition to
deductive reasoning to find proofs.
  Towards this end, we introduce a representation of beliefs that assigns
probabilities to the exhaustive and mutually exclusive first-order
possibilities found in Hintikka's theory of distributive normal forms. The
representation supports Bayesian update, induces a distribution on statements
that does not enforce that logically equivalent statements are assigned the
same probability, and suggests an embedding of statements into an associated
Hilbert space.
  We then examine conjecturing as model selection and an alternating-turn game
of determining consistency. The game is amenable (in principle) to self-play
training to learn beliefs and derive a prover that is complete when logical
omniscience is attained and sound when beliefs are reasonable. The
representation has super-exponential space requirements as a function of
quantifier depth so the ideas in this paper should be taken as theoretical. We
will comment on how abstractions can be used to control the space requirements
at the cost of completeness.

Notably, a recent experiment retrieved a 3rd order nonlinear susceptibility by
comparing the nonlinear response induced by a strong laser field to a linear
response induced by the otherwise identical weak field. In parallel,
experiments have demonstrated high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids, a
highly nonlinear process that until recently had only been observed in gases.
The highly nonlinear nature of HHG has the potential to extract even higher
order nonlinear susceptibility terms, and thereby characterize the entire
response of the electronic system to strong field excitation. However, up till
now, such characterization has been elusive due to a lack of direct
correspondence between high harmonics and nonlinear susceptibilities. Here, we
demonstrate a regime where such correspondence can be clearly made, extracting
nonlinear susceptibilities (7th, 9th, and 11th) from sapphire of the same order
as the measured high harmonics. The extracted high order susceptibilities show
angular-resolved periodicities arising from variation in the band structure

states that almost surely, as $n\to \infty$, the empirical spectral

  A crucial ingredient in the proof of Tao and Vu, which uses deep ideas from

value of the random matrix $xI - N_{n}/(\sigma\sqrt{n})$ (where $x\in
\mathbb{C}$ is fixed) with failure probability that is inverse polynomial. In
this paper, using a simple and novel approach (in particular, not using tools

cloth rendering.
  Yet, these models neglect fabric mechanics: when a piece of cloth interacts
with the environment, its yarn and fiber arrangement usually changes in
response to external contact and tension forces.
  Since subtle changes of a fabric's microstructures can greatly affect its
macroscopic appearance, mechanics-driven appearance variation of fabrics has
been a phenomenon that remains to be captured.
  We introduce a mechanics-aware model that adapts the microstructures of cloth
yarns in a physics-based manner.
  Our technique works on two distinct physical scales: using physics-based
simulations of individual yarns, we capture the rearrangement of yarn-level
structures in response to external forces.
  These yarn structures are further enriched to obtain appearance-driving
fiber-level details.
  The cross-scale enrichment is made practical through a new parameter fitting
algorithm for simulation, an augmented procedural yarn model coupled with a
custom-design regression neural network.
  We train the network using a dataset generated by joint simulations at both
the yarn and the fiber levels.
  Through several examples, we demonstrate that our model is capable of
synthesizing photorealistic cloth appearance in a %dynamic and mechanically
plausible way.

to predict retweet or quote interactions between a pair of accounts? Also, how
important is time locality, and which features of interaction patterns are most
important to enable accurate prediction of specific Twitter interactions? Our
empirical study of Twitter interactions contributes initial answers to these
questions.
  We have crawled an extensive dataset of Greek-speaking Twitter accounts and
their follow, quote, retweet, reply interactions over a period of a month.
  We find we can accurately predict many interactions of Twitter users.
Interestingly, the most predictive features vary with the user profiles, and
are not the same across all users.
  For example, for a pair of users that interact with a large number of other
Twitter users, we find that certain ""higher-dimensional"" triads, i.e., triads
that involve multiple types of interactions, are very informative, whereas for
less active Twitter users, certain in-degrees and out-degrees play a major
role. Finally, we provide various other insights on Twitter user behavior.

estimation method using street scene images and 2D maps was proposed. This
method is more scalable than traditional methods that use high-resolution
optical data, LiDAR data, or RADAR data which are expensive to obtain. The
method needs to detect building rooflines and then compute building height via
the pinhole camera model. We observe that this method has limitations in
handling complex street scene images in which buildings overlap with each other
and the rooflines are difficult to locate. We propose CBHE, a building height
estimation algorithm considering both building corners and rooflines. CBHE
first obtains building corner and roofline candidates in street scene images
based on building footprints from 2D maps and the camera parameters. Then, we
use a deep neural network named BuildingNet to classify and filter corner and
roofline candidates. Based on the valid corners and rooflines from BuildingNet,
CBHE computes building height via the pinhole camera model. Experimental
results show that the proposed BuildingNet yields a higher accuracy on building
corner and roofline candidate filtering compared with the state-of-the-art open

probabilistic linear discriminative analysis (PLDA), and a support vector

the afterglow of GRB 170817A and X-ray flares in GRB afterglows, we find that
this X-ray variability seems to share similar statistical correlations with
X-ray flares in GRB afterglows. We further investigate several possible merger
product scenarios to see whether they can produce the observed X-ray
variability in GRB 170817A. The first scenario invokes a stable magnetar as the
central engine producing the later X-ray variability via differential rotation
or fall-back accretion onto the NS. The second scenario invokes a black hole as
the central engine with a fall-back accretion process. The final scenario is a
central engine with a long-lived supra-massive NS. We find that the first two
scenarios have difficulty producing the later X-ray variability, which requires
either an impractical NS magnetic field or an extraordinarily large stellar
envelope and an extremely long accretion timescale. However, the third scenario

The previous version is the conference version",,"10.1145/2382577.2382580",,"cs.DS cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge discovery from data is an inherently iterative process. That is,
what we know about the data greatly determines our expectations, and therefore,
what results we would find interesting and/or surprising. Given new knowledge
about the data, our expectations will change. Hence, in order to avoid
redundant results, knowledge discovery algorithms ideally should follow such an
iterative updating procedure.
  With this in mind, we introduce a well-founded approach for succinctly
summarizing data with the most informative itemsets; using a probabilistic
maximum entropy model, we iteratively find the itemset that provides us the
most novel information--that is, for which the frequency in the data surprises
us the most---and in turn we update our model accordingly. As we use the
Maximum Entropy principle to obtain unbiased probabilistic models, and only
include those itemsets that are most informative with regard to the current
model, the summaries we construct are guaranteed to be both descriptive and
non-redundant.
  The algorithm that we present, called MTV, can either discover the top-$k$
most informative itemsets, or we can employ either the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) or the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to
automatically identify the set of itemsets that together summarize the data
well. In other words, our method will `tell you what you need to know' about
the data. Importantly, it is a one-phase algorithm: rather than picking
itemsets from a user-provided candidate set, itemsets and their supports are
mined on-the-fly. To further its applicability, we provide an efficient method
to compute the maximum entropy distribution using Quick Inclusion-Exclusion.
  Experiments on our method, using synthetic, benchmark, and real data, show

a two-step design scheme. A controller is first designed for the ideal

estimation that is updated by an adaptive law along the gradient of Lyapunov
function. This principle does not generally work for a multi-agent system as an
adaptive law based on the gradient of (centrally constructed) Lyapunov function

determine the minimum number of units in FC layer by rigorous theoretical

training time. Second, we propose a negative-focused weights-biased softmax

W-Softmax loss not only theoretically formulates the intraclass compactness and
inter-class separability, but also can avoid overfitting by enlarging decision
margins. Moreover, the size of decision margins can be flexibly controlled by
adjusting a hyperparameter $\alpha$. Extensive experimental results on several

which can match both the marginal and the conditional distributions across
domains simultaneously. In addition, the largely ignored expression class
distribution bias is also addressed by a learnable re-weighting parameter, so
that the training and testing domains can share similar class distribution.

vector of $T$ stimuli. We propose to estimate the unknown function $f$ linking
stimuli to responses through a nonparametric sieve estimator. We give
conditions for consistency when either $n$ or $T$ or both diverge. The rate of
convergence depends upon the error covariance structure, that is allowed to
differ across subjects. With these results we derive the optimal divergence
rate of the dimension of the sieve basis with both $n$ and $T$. We provide
guidance about the optimal balance between the number of subjects and questions
in a laboratory experiment and argue that a large $n$is often better than a
large $T$. We derive conditions for asymptotic normality of functionals of the
estimator of $T$ and apply them to obtain the asymptotic distribution of the
Wald test when the number of constraints under the null is finite and when it
diverges along with other asymptotic parameters. Lastly, we investigate the
previous properties when the conditional covariance matrix is replaced by an
estimator.

pose estimation from 2D images due to many different factors like occlusion,
depth ambiguities, intertwining of people, and in general crowds. 2D
multi-person human pose estimation in the wild also suffers from the same
problems - occlusion, ambiguities, and disentanglement of people's body parts.
Being a fundamental problem with loads of applications, including but not
limited to surveillance, economical motion capture for video games and movies,
and physiotherapy, this is an interesting problem to be solved both from a
practical perspective and from an intellectual perspective as well. Although
there are cases where no pose estimation can ever predict with 100% accuracy
(cases where even humans would fail), there are several algorithms that have
brought new state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation in the wild.
We look at a few algorithms with different approaches and also formulate our
own approach to tackle a consistently bugging problem, i.e. occlusions.

methods employed to filter datasets in order to avoid analysing low-quality

the growth of existing data sources, such as GitHub, and researchers often rely
on quick and dirty techniques to curate datasets.
  Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a method capable of
filtering large quantities of software projects in a resource-efficient way.
  Method: This study follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. The
proposed method, PHANTOM, extracts five measures from Git logs. Each measure is
transformed into a time-series, which is represented as a feature vector for
clustering using the k-means algorithm.
  Results: Using the ground truth from a previous study, PHANTOM was shown to
be able to rediscover the ground truth on the training dataset, and was able to
identify ""engineered"" projects with up to 0.87 Precision and 0.94 Recall on the
validation dataset. PHANTOM downloaded and processed the metadata of 1,786,601
GitHub repositories in 21.5 days using a single personal computer, which is
over 33% faster than the previous study which used a computer cluster of 200
nodes. The possibility of applying the method outside of the open-source
community was investigated by curating 100 repositories owned by two companies.
  Conclusions: It is possible to use an unsupervised approach to identify
engineered projects. PHANTOM was shown to be competitive compared to the
existing supervised approaches while reducing the hardware requirements by two
orders of magnitude.

In this paper we quantify this process using energy fluxes, as well as show its
universality in diverse flows such as magnetohydrodynamics, quasi-static
magnetohydrodynamics, and bubbly turbulence. We show that in such flows, the
transfer from kinetic energy to elastic energy leads to a reduction in kinetic

standard apparatus, based on absolute measurements of the Casimir force, is
very difficult because the effect is small in the region of sub-micron
separations, where the Casimir force can be measured precisely. The
differential apparatus described here is immune by design to several sources of
error that blur the interpretation of Casimir experiments, like electrostatic

errors in the optical data. With the help of the proposed setup it should be
possible to establish conclusively which among the alternative theories of the

  Repeated Game with Asymmetric and Incomplete Information",,,,,"cs.GT cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LTE/LTE-Advanced networks are known to be vulnerable to denial-of-service and
loss-of-service attacks from smart jammers. In this article, the interaction
between a smart jammer and LTE network is modeled as an infinite-horizon,
zero-sum, asymmetric repeated game. The smart jammer and eNode B are modeled as
the informed and the uninformed player, respectively. The main purpose of this
article is to construct efficient suboptimal strategies for both players that
can be used to solve the above-mentioned infinite-horizon repeated game with
asymmetric and incomplete information. It has been shown in game-theoretic
literature that security strategies provide optimal solution in zero-sum games.
It is also shown that both players' security strategies in an infinite-horizon
asymmetric game depend only on the history of the informed player's actions.
However, fixed-sized sufficient statistics are needed for both players to solve
the above-mentioned game efficiently. The smart jammer uses its evolving belief
state as the fixed-sized sufficient statistics for the repeated game. Whereas,
the LTE network (uninformed player) uses worst-case regret of its security
strategy and its anti-discounted update as the fixed-sized sufficient
statistics. Although fixed-sized sufficient statistics are employed by both
players, optimal security strategy computation in {\lambda}-discounted
asymmetric games is still hard to perform because of non-convexity. Hence, the
problem is convexified in this article by devising `approximated' security
strategies for both players that are based on approximated optimal game value.
However, `approximated' strategies require full monitoring. Therefore, a
simplistic yet effective `expected' strategy is also constructed for the LTE
network that does not require full monitoring. The simulation results show that
the smart jammer plays non-revealing and misleading strategies.

total amounts of dust in these galaxies. We find that AGB stars were not able
to produce the amounts of dust observed in the galaxies in our sample. In order
to explain these dust masses, SNe would have to have maximum efficiency and not
destroy the dust which they formed. Therefore, the observed amounts of dust in

which are the distinctive signatures of quantum properties in complex systems,

material that suppresses the acoustic scattering for a given set of incident
wave vectors. The material consists of multiple scatterers, rigid diaphragms,

been chosen such that in the Born approximation a suppression of the scattering
for a broad range of frequencies is achieved and thus a broadband transparency.
Experimental results are found in excellent agreement with the theory despite
the presence of losses and the finite size of the material, features that are
not captured in the theory. This robustness as well as the generality of the

transparent materials in acoustics and other fields of wave physics.

need to expand their power supply to the wide-voltage range including the
near-threshold region. However, the read delay distribution of the SRAM cells
under the near-threshold voltage shows a more serious long-tail characteristic
than that under the nominal voltage due to the process fluctuation. Such
degradation of SRAM delay makes the SRAM-based cache a performance bottleneck
of systems as well. To avoid the unreliable data reading, circuit-level studies
use larger/more transistors in a bitcell by scarifying chip area and the static
power of cache arrays. Architectural studies propose the auxiliary error
correction or block disabling/remapping methods in fault-tolerant caches, which
worsen both the hit latency and energy efficiency due to the complex accessing
logic. This paper proposes the Timing-Speculation (TS) cache to boost the cache
frequency and improve energy efficiency under low supply voltages. In the TS
cache, the voltage differences of bitlines are continuously evaluated twice by
a sense amplifier (SA), and the access timing error can be detected much
earlier than that in prior methods. According to the measurement results from
the fabricated chips, the TS L1 cache aggressively increases its frequency to
1.62X and 1.92X compared with the conventional scheme at 0.5V and 0.6V supply
voltages, respectively.

Besides, repeated data access can be seen as redundancy in data movement.
Similarly, there can also be redundancy in the repetition of calculations. This

the 2017 Spitzer microlensing campaign. The ground-based observations yield the
detection of finite-source effects, and the microlens parallaxes are derived
from the joint analysis of ground-based observations and Spitzer observations.
We find that the lens of OGLE-2017-BLG-1254 is a $0.60 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$ star
with $D_{\rm LS} = 0.53 \pm 0.11~\text{kpc}$, where $D_{\rm LS}$ is the
distance between the lens and the source. The second event, OGLE-2017-BLG-1161,
is subject to the known satellite parallax degeneracy, and thus is either a
$0.51^{+0.12}_{-0.10} M_{\odot}$ star with $D_{\rm LS} = 0.40 \pm
0.12~\text{kpc}$ or a $0.38^{+0.13}_{-0.12} M_{\odot}$ star with $D_{\rm LS} =
0.53 \pm 0.19~\text{kpc}$. Both of the lenses are therefore isolated stars in
the Galactic bulge. By comparing the mass and distance distributions of the
eight published Spitzer finite-source events with the expectations from a
Galactic model, we find that the Spitzer sample is in agreement with the
probability of finite-source effects occurrence in single lens events.

satisfies a standard relativistic generalization of Newton's law of
gravitation, suggesting the others to be unphysical.

retrieval (SCBIR) for its appealing advantages of semantic label independence,
memory and search efficiency. However, the learned hash codes are embedded with
limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image
representation. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
hashing approach, dubbed as \emph{Discrete Semantic Transfer Hashing} (DSTH).
The key idea is to \emph{directly} augment the semantics of discrete image hash
codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end, a unified
hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities
of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further, to
guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss, we explicitly
impose the discrete constraint, bit--uncorrelation constraint and bit-balance
constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method
based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the
optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation
complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art
approaches.

pearson correlation coefficient, and so forth. Besides that, for a given degree
distribution (as power-law distribution with exponent $\gamma=3$ discussed
here), it is reasonable to ask how many network models with such a constraint
we can have. To this end, we generate an ensemble of this kind of random graphs
with $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ ($\gamma=3$), denoted as graph space
$\mathcal{N}(p,q,t)$ where probability parameters $p$ and $q$ hold on $p+q=1$,

deterministic graph models and obtain both upper bound and lower bound for
other members. Meanwhile, for arbitrary $p(\neq1)$, we prove that graph model
$N(p,q,t)$ does go through two phase transitions over time, i.e., starting by

gradually converging to initial place (non-assortative point). Among of them,

fluctuation-dissipation relation for the general linear-response differential
form and discuss the restrictions to the structure of the differential form,
which comes from the causality and the positive semi-definiteness of the noise
autocorrelation, and also the relation of those restrictions to the cutoff

measured observable, known as a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement. Here
we demonstrate an all-electrical QND measurement of a single electron spin in a
gate-defined quantum dot via an exchange-coupled ancilla qubit. The ancilla
qubit, encoded in the singlet-triplet two-electron subspace, is entangled with
the single spin and subsequently read out in a single shot projective
measurement at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than the spin relaxation.
The QND nature of the measurement protocol is evidenced by observing a
monotonic increase of the readout fidelity over one hundred repetitive
measurements against arbitrary input states. We extract information from the
measurement record using the method of optimal inference, which is tolerant to
the presence of the relaxation and dephasing. The QND measurement allows us to
observe spontaneous spin flips (quantum jumps) in an isolated system with small
disturbance. Combined with the high-fidelity control of spin qubits, these
results pave the way for various measurement-based quantum state manipulations
including quantum error correction protocols.

Specifically, we present Transferrable Prototypical Networks (TPN) for
adaptation such that the prototypes for each class in source and target domains
are close in the embedding space and the score distributions predicted by
prototypes separately on source and target data are similar. Technically, TPN
initially matches each target example to the nearest prototype in the source
domain and assigns an example a ""pseudo"" label. The prototype of each class
could then be computed on source-only, target-only and source-target data,
respectively. The optimization of TPN is end-to-end trained by jointly
minimizing the distance across the prototypes on three types of data and
KL-divergence of score distributions output by each pair of the prototypes.
Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfers across MNIST, USPS and

feature selection. Conventional solutions first simply combine multiple
pre-constructed view-specific similarity structures into a collaborative

two processes are separate and independent. The collaborative similarity
structure remains fixed during feature selection. Further, the simple
undirected view combination may adversely reduce the reliability of the
ultimate similarity structure for feature selection, as the view-specific
similarity structures generally involve noises and outlying entries. To
alleviate these problems, we propose an adaptive collaborative similarity
learning (ACSL) for multi-view feature selection. We propose to dynamically
learn the collaborative similarity structure, and further integrate it with the
ultimate feature selection into a unified framework. Moreover, a reasonable
rank constraint is devised to adaptively learn an ideal collaborative
similarity structure with proper similarity combination weights and desirable
neighbor assignment, both of which could positively facilitate the feature
selection. An effective solution guaranteed with the proved convergence is

An algorithm is introduced to build combinatorial hexahedral meshes whose
boundary facets exactly match a given quadrangulation of the topological
sphere. This algorithm is the first practical solution to the problem. It is
able to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the
previously known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained
thousands of hexahedra. These challenging quadrangulations include the
boundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success of general
hexahedral meshing algorithms.
  The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to building combinatorial
hexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical
problem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad
flips in the boundary and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary.
The tree of all sequences of flipping operations is explored, searching for a
path that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation for
which a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a
sequence transforming Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set
of pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used.
  A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is
proposed. Combined with an efficient backtracking search, it allows small
shellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all even quadrangulations with up
to 20 quadrangles. All 54,943 such quadrangulations were meshed using no more
than 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill
arbitrary domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n
quadrangles can be meshed with no more than 78 n hexahedra. This very
significantly lowers the previous upper bound of 5396 n.

Plate Photo-Multiplier Tubes (MCP-PMT) detectors. The goal is to achieve a
single-photon timing resolution of 70 ps, giving a timing precision of 15 ps
per charged particle by combining the information from around 30 detected
photons. The MCP-PMT detectors have been developed with a commercial partner
(Photek Ltd, UK), leading to the delivery of a square tube of active area 53
$\times$ 53mm$^2$ with a granularity of 8 $\times$ 128 pixels equivalent. A
large-scale demonstrator of TORCH, having a quartz plate of dimensions 660
$\times$ 1250 $\times$ 10 mm$^3$ and read out by a pair of MCP-PMTs with custom
readout electronics, has been verified in a test beam campaign at the CERN PS.
Preliminary results indicate that the required performance is close to being
achieved. The anticipated performance of a full-scale TORCH detector at the
LHCb experiment is presented.

cardinality set of pairwise disjoint edges in a given undirected graph. The
fastest algorithm for this problem, due to Micali and Vazirani, runs in time
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}m)$ and stands unbeaten since 1980. It is complemented by
faster, often linear-time, algorithms for various special graph classes.
Moreover, there are fast parameterized algorithms, e.g., time
$\mathcal{O}(km\log n)$ relative to tree-width $k$, which outperform
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}m)$ when the parameter is sufficiently small.
  We show that the Micali-Vazirani algorithm, and in fact any algorithm
following the phase framework of Hopcroft and Karp, is adaptive to beneficial
input structure. We exhibit several graph classes for which such algorithms run
in linear time $\mathcal{O}(n+m)$. More strongly, we show that they run in time
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}m)$ for graphs that are $k$ vertex deletions away from any
of several such classes, without explicitly computing an optimal or approximate
deletion set; before, most such bounds were at least $\Omega(km)$. Thus, any
phase-based matching algorithm with linear-time phases obliviously interpolates
between linear time for $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and the worst case of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}m)$ when $k=\Theta(n)$. We complement our findings by
proving that the phase framework by itself still allows $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
phases, and hence time $\Omega(\sqrt{n}m)$, even on paths, cographs, and

attention in recent years. However, simply applying the models learnt on
synthetic images may lead to high generalization error on real images due to
domain shift. To address this issue, recent progress in cross-domain
recognition has featured the Mean Teacher, which directly simulates
unsupervised domain adaptation as semi-supervised learning. The domain gap is
thus naturally bridged with consistency regularization in a teacher-student
scheme. In this work, we advance this Mean Teacher paradigm to be applicable
for cross-domain detection. Specifically, we present Mean Teacher with Object
Relations (MTOR) that novelly remolds Mean Teacher under the backbone of Faster
R-CNN by integrating the object relations into the measure of consistency cost
between teacher and student modules. Technically, MTOR firstly learns
relational graphs that capture similarities between pairs of regions for
teacher and student respectively. The whole architecture is then optimized with
three consistency regularizations: 1) region-level consistency to align the
region-level predictions between teacher and student, 2) inter-graph
consistency for matching the graph structures between teacher and student, and
3) intra-graph consistency to enhance the similarity between regions of same
class within the graph of student. Extensive experiments are conducted on the
transfers across Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, and SIM10k, and superior results
are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we

denoted dynamical privacy, relies on introducing output maps which act as
masks, rendering the internal states of an agent indiscernible by the other
agents as well as by external agents monitoring all communications. Our output
masks are local (i.e., decided independently by each agent), time-varying
functions asymptotically converging to the true states. The resulting masked
system is also time-varying, and has the original unmasked system as its limit
system. When the unmasked system has a globally exponentially stable
equilibrium point, it is shown in the paper that the masked system has the same
point as a global attractor. It is also shown that existence of equilibrium
points in the masked system is not compatible with dynamical privacy.
Application of dynamical privacy to popular examples of multiagent dynamics,
such as models of social opinions, average consensus and synchronization, is
investigated in detail.

features for each frame using colour and optical flow information. Such
features are combined following a multiplicative scheme to benefit from their
complementarity. These unified colour and motion features are later processed
to obtain the separated foreground and background representations. Then, both
independent representations are concatenated and decoded to perform foreground
segmentation. Experiments conducted on the challenging DAVIS 2016 dataset
demonstrate that our guided representations not only outperform non-guided, but
also recent and top-performing video object segmentation algorithms.

variability of the classes within the image. This letter compares the
performance of KBSC with other conventional hard/soft classification

(VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) associated with a charged scalar
quantum field in a high-dimensional cosmic string spacetime admitting the
presence of a magnetic flux running along the string's core. In addition, we
also assume that the coordinate along the string's axis is compactified to a
circle and presents an extra magnetic flux running along its center. This
compactification is implemented by imposing a quasiperiodic condition on the
field with an arbitrary phase $\beta$. The calculation of the VEV of the EMT
and field squared, are developed by using the positive-energy Wightman
function. The latter is constructed by the mode sum of the complete set of
normalized bosonic wave-functions. Due to the compactification, two distinct
contributions take place. The first one corresponds to the VEV in a cosmic
string spacetime without compactification considering the magnetic interaction.
So, this term presents a contribution due to the non-trivial topology of the
conical space, and an additional contribution due to the interaction between
the scalar field with the magnetic flux. The latter is a periodic function of
the magnetic flux with period equal to the quantum flux, $\Phi_0=2\pi/e$, and
corresponds to a Aharanov-Bhom type contribution. The second contribution is
induced by the compactification itself and depends on the magnetic flux along
the string's core. It is also an even function of the magnetic flux enclosed by
the string axis. Some asymptotic expressions for the VEVs of the
energy-momentum tensor and field squared are provided for specific limiting
cases of the physical parameter of the model.

work in three separate steps: similarity graph construction, clustering label
relaxing and label discretization with k-means. Such common practice has three
disadvantages: 1) the predefined similarity graph is often fixed and may not be
optimal for the subsequent clustering. 2) the relaxing process of cluster
labels may cause significant information loss. 3) label discretization may
deviate from the real clustering result since k-means is sensitive to the
initialization of cluster centroids. To tackle these problems, in this paper,
we propose an effective discrete optimal graph clustering (DOGC) framework. A
structured similarity graph that is theoretically optimal for clustering
performance is adaptively learned with a guidance of reasonable rank
constraint. Besides, to avoid the information loss, we explicitly enforce a
discrete transformation on the intermediate continuous label, which derives a
tractable optimization problem with discrete solution. Further, to compensate
the unreliability of the learned labels and enhance the clustering accuracy, we
design an adaptive robust module that learns prediction function for the unseen
data based on the learned discrete cluster labels. Finally, an iterative
optimization strategy guaranteed with convergence is developed to directly
solve the clustering results. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and

broadening of the low energy local density of electron states result with
increasing amplitude of the driving field. On the other hand, there are no new
resonances emerging in the spectrum. In the latter case, the spectrum is gapped
both in the absence of the impurity as well as for weak amplitudes of the
driving field, while the gap tends to fill up with impurity states with
increasing amplitude.

traffic at many levels. One of their main challenge is building high-speed and
efficient networking solutions. In such a context, kernel-bypass I/O frameworks
have become their preferred answer to the increasing bandwidth demands. Many
works have been achieved, so far, all of them claiming to have succeeded in
reaching line-rate for traffic forwarding. However, this claim does not hold
for more complex packet processing. In addition, all those solutions share
common drawbacks on either deployment flexibility or configurability and
user-friendliness.
  This is exactly what we tackle in this paper by introducing mmb, a VPP
middlebox plugin. mmb allows, through an intuitive command-line interface, to
easily build stateless and stateful classification and rewriting middleboxes.
mmb makes a careful use of instruction caching and memory prefetching, in
addition to other techniques used by other high-performance I/O frameworks. We
compare mmb performance with other performance-enhancing middlebox solutions,
such as kernel-bypass framework, kernel-level optimized approach and other
state-of-the-art solutions for enforcing middleboxes policies (firewall, NAT,
transport-level engineering). We demonstrate that mmb performs, generally,
better than existing solutions, sustaining a line-rate processing while
performing large numbers of complex policies.

only resource blocks with strong signal are ""active"" for each user, and user
$k$ needs $d_k$ active resource blocks for a successful URLLC transmission. In

can be scheduled simultaneously. We show that finding a feasible schedule for
at least $m$ URLLC users is NP-complete in the (easier) binary SNR model, hence
also in the continuous. Maximizing the reward obtained from a feasible set of
URLLC users is NP-hard and inapproximable to within ${(\log_2d)^2}/{d}$ of the
optimal, where $d\doteq \max_kd_k$. On the other hand, we prove that checking a

we formulate specifications to be proved as absence of RunTime Error properties

on Skyrme Hartree Fock BCS approach is applied to study the evolution of the
isovector dipole strength by increasing neutron number and temperature. First,
the isovector dipole strength and excitation energies are investigated for the
Ni isotopic chain at zero temperature. The evolution of the low-energy dipole
strength is studied as a function of the neutron number. In the second part,
the temperature dependence of the isovector dipole excitations is studied using
the self-consistent finite temperature QRPA, below and above the critical
temperatures. It is shown that new excited states become possible due to the
thermally occupied states above the Fermi level, and opening of the new
excitations channels. In addition, temperature leads to fragmentation of the
low-energy strength around the neutron separation energies, and between 9 and
12 MeV. We find that the cumulative sum of the strength below E$\leq12$ MeV
decreases in open-shell nuclei due to the vanishing of the pairing correlations
as temperature increases up to T=1 MeV. The analysis of the transition
densities in the low-energy region shows that the proton and neutron transition
densities display a mixed pattern: both isoscalar and isovector motion of
protons and neutrons are obtained inside nuclei, while the neutron transition
density is dominant at the surface region.

to $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}n^{O(1)}$.
  While our algorithm counts all copies of $P$, it also improves the fastest
algorithms that only detect copies of $P$. Before our work, no $2^{O(k/\log

known, and by a result of Bodlaender et al. [ICALP 2016] a $2^{o(k/\log

(ETH). Furthermore, it was only known how to detect copies of a fixed connected
bounded maximum degree pattern $P$ in $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}n^{O(1)}$ time
probabilistically. For counting problems, it was a repeatedly asked open
question whether $2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)}$ time algorithms exist that count even
special patterns such as independent sets, matchings and paths in planar
graphs. The above results resolve this question in a strong sense by giving
algorithms for counting versions of problems with running times equal to the
ETH lower bounds for their decision versions.
  Generally speaking, our algorithm counts copies of $P$ in time proportional
to its number of non-isomorphic separations of order $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})$. The
algorithm introduces a new recursive approach to construct families of balanced
cycle separators in planar graphs that have limited overlap inspired by methods
from Fomin et al. [FOCS 2016], a new `efficient' inclusion-exclusion based
argument and uses methods from Bodlaender et al. [ICALP 2016].

color differences are frequently judged between a pair of samples with

new formula, dENS has been developed for pairs of stimuli with no-separation
(NS). An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of different
color-difference magnitudes using sample pairs with NS. 1,012 printed pairs
with NS were prepared around 11 CIE recommended color centers. The pairs,
representing four color-difference magnitudes of 1, 2, 4 and 8 CIELAB units
were visually evaluated by a panel of 19 observers using the gray-scale method.
Comparison of the present data based on pairs with NS, and previously generated
data using pairs with hair-line separation, showed a clear separation effect. A
new color-difference equation for the NS viewing condition (dENS) is proposed
by modifying the CIEDE2000 formula. The separation effect can be well described
by the new formula. For a sample pair with NS, when the CIEDE2000 color
difference is less than 9.1, a larger color difference leads to a larger
lightness difference, and thus the total color difference increases. When the
CIEDE2000 color difference is greater than 9.1, the effect is opposite, i.e.
the lightness difference decreases, and thus the total color difference also
decreases. The new formula is recommended for future research to evaluate its
performance in appropriate applications.

due to the extrapolation step, BPGe converges faster than BPG algorithm.
Analyzing the convergence, we prove that any limit point of the sequence

  Identification: A Case Study on Autism Spectrum Disorder",,,,,"eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing,
research continues in an effort to identify common etiological and
pathophysiological bases. In this regard, modern machine learning and network
science pave the way for a better understanding of the neuropathology and the
development of diagnosis aid systems. The present work addresses the
classification of neurotypical and ASD subjects by combining knowledge about
both the structure and the functional activity of the brain. In particular, we
model the brain structure as a graph, and the resting-state functional MRI
(rs-fMRI) signals as values that live on the nodes of that graph. We then
borrow tools from the emerging field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to build
features related to the frequency content of these signals. In order to make
these features highly discriminative, we apply an extension of the
Fukunaga-Koontz transform. Finally, we use these new markers to train a
decision tree, an interpretable classification scheme, which results in a final
diagnosis aid model. Interestingly, the resulting decision tree outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange (ABIDE) collection. Moreover, the analysis of the predictive markers
reveals the influence of the frontal and temporal lobes in the diagnosis of the
disorder, which is in line with previous findings in the literature of
neuroscience. Our results indicate that exploiting jointly structural and
functional information of the brain can reveal important information about the
complexity of the neuropathology.

has been recently realized that control during the evolution can significantly

It provides a flexible adaptation of coverage and data rate by allocating
different Spreading Factors (SFs) and transmit powers to end-devices. We focus
on improving throughput fairness while reducing energy consumption. Whereas
most existing methods assume perfect SF orthogonality and ignore the harmful
effects of inter-SF interferences, we formulate a joint SF and power allocation
problem to maximize the minimum uplink throughput of end-devices, subject to
co-SF and inter-SF interferences, and power constraints. This results into a
mixed-integer non-linear optimization, which, for tractability, is split into
two sub-problems: firstly, the SF assignment for fixed transmit powers, and
secondly, the power allocation given the previously obtained assignment
solution. For the first sub-problem, we propose a low-complexity many-to-one
matching algorithm between SFs and end-devices. For the second one, given its
intractability, we transform it using two types of constraints approximation: a
linearized and a quadratic version. Our performance evaluation demonstrates
that the proposed joint SF allocation and power optimization enables to
drastically enhance various performance objectives such as throughput, fairness
and power consumption, and that it outperforms baseline schemes.

difficult in many inference problems in astronomy. As sample sizes resulting
from astronomical surveys continue to grow, deficiencies in the likelihood
function lead to larger biases in key parameter estimates. These deficiencies
result from the oversimplification of the physical processes that generated the
data, and from the failure to account for observational limitations.
Unfortunately, realistic models often do not yield an analytical form for the
likelihood. The estimation of a stellar initial mass function (IMF) is an
important example. The stellar IMF is the mass distribution of stars initially
formed in a given cluster of stars, a population which is not directly
observable due to stellar evolution and other disruptions and observational
limitations of the cluster. There are several difficulties with specifying a
likelihood in this setting since the physical processes and observational
challenges result in measurable masses that cannot legitimately be considered
independent draws from an IMF. This work improves inference of the IMF by using
an approximate Bayesian computation approach that both accounts for
observational and astrophysical effects and incorporates a physically-motivated
model for star cluster formation. The methodology is illustrated via a
simulation study, demonstrating that the proposed approach can recover the true
posterior in realistic situations, and applied to observations from
astrophysical simulation data.

function depending on pairs of instances among which notable examples are
bipartite ranking, metric learning, area under ROC (AUC) maximization and
minimum error entropy (MEE) principle. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we
establish the stability results of SGD for pairwise learning in the convex,
strongly convex and non-convex settings, from which generalization bounds can
be naturally derived. Secondly, we establish the trade-off between stability
and optimization error of SGD algorithms for pairwise learning. This is
achieved by lower-bounding the sum of stability and optimization error by the
minimax statistical error over a prescribed class of pairwise loss functions.
From this fundamental trade-off, we obtain lower bounds for the optimization
error of SGD algorithms and the excess expected risk over a class of pairwise
losses. In addition, we illustrate our stability results by giving some
specific examples of AUC maximization, metric learning and MEE.

combines a conventional probabilistic atlas-based segmentation with deep

  A key feature of QUIC is that almost all its packets, including most of its
headers, are fully encrypted. This prevents eavesdropping and interferences
caused by middleboxes. Thanks to this feature and its clean design, QUIC is
easier to extend than TCP. In this paper, we revisit the reliable transmission
mechanisms that are included in QUIC. More specifically, we design, implement
and evaluate Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) extensions to QUIC. These
extensions are mainly intended for high-delays and lossy communications such as
In-Flight Communications. Our design includes a generic FEC frame and our
implementation supports the XOR, Reed-Solomon and Convolutional RLC
error-correcting codes. We also conservatively avoid hindering the loss-based
congestion signal by distinguishing the packets that have been received from
the packets that have been recovered by the FEC. We evaluate its performance by
applying an experimental design covering a wide range of delay and packet loss
conditions with reproducible experiments. These confirm that our modular design
allows the protocol to adapt to the network conditions. For long data transfers
or when the loss rate and delay are small, the FEC overhead negatively impacts
the download completion time. However, with high packet loss rates and long
delays or smaller files, FEC allows drastically reducing the download
completion time by avoiding costly retransmission timeouts. These results show
that there is a need to use FEC adaptively to the network conditions.

to merge when both are in their giant phases the stars must have close masses
at their zero age main sequence, and the orbital separation must be in the
right range. After the two giants merge, the two cores spiral-in toward each
other within a common envelope. We study the energy sources of radiation in
this process that include the ejection of mass that powers radiation by both
recombination and by collision with previously ejected mass. This process
includes no jets, unlike many other types of ILOTs, hence the event will not
form a bipolar nebula. Using the stellar evolution numerical code mesa for two
binary systems with stellar masses of (15Mo, 15.75Mo) and (31Mo, 31.5Mo), we
find that the merger of the two cores releases gravitational energy that
marginally ejects the entire common envelope. This implies that in many cases
the two cores merge, i.e., a fatal common envelope evolution, leading to a
somewhat more luminous ILOT. A typical ILOT from merger of two cool giant stars
lasts for several months to several years and has a typical average luminosity
of L(ILOT)~=10^6(M_{CE}/10Mo)Lo, where M_{CE} is the ejected common envelope
mass. The merger-driven massive outflow forms dust, hence leading to a very red
ILOT, possibly even infrared luminous and undetectable in the visible.

  Then other criteria based on ratios of coefficients of variations are
proposed to detect long events such as construction test sites, or point-event
such as vehicles.
  These detection methods are evaluated first on theoretical statistical
simulations to determine the scenarios where they can deliver the best results.
Then detection performance is assessed on real data for different types of

and unbounded. Because of this, field variables may tend to infinity leading to
appearance of singularities, which plague Einstein's theory of gravity. The
purpose of this article is to study the idea of generalizing the theory of
gravity by compactification of the phase space. We investigate the procedure of
compactification of the phase space on a minisuperspace gravitational model
with two dimensional phase space. In the affine limit, the model reduces to the
flat de Sitter cosmology. The phase space is generalized to the spherical case,
and the case of loop quantum cosmology is recovered in the cylindrical phase
space limit. Analysis of the dynamics reveals that the compactness of the phase
space leads to both UV and IR effects. In particular, the phase of re-collapse
appears, preventing the universe from expanding to infinite volume.
Furthermore, the quantum version of the model is investigated and the quantum
constraint is solved. As an example, we analyze the case with the spin quantum
number $s=2$, for which we determine transition amplitude between initial and
final state of the classical trajectory. The probability of the transition is
peaked at $\Lambda=0$.

on the relative width of the transfer function) of the Halfmini DMA, at sample
flow rates q beyond 1 l/min. The charge-reduced electrosprayed ovalbumin
protein used as test aerosol has an accurately determinable Gaussian mobility
distribution, which limits the measurable R to at most 25 to 30. Non-ideal DMA
response can however be precisely probed by comparing measured peak widths with
the convolution of the protein's mobility distribution with the triangular
Knutson-Whitby distribution associated to the finite qi/Q ratio. For the
unmodified Halfmini DMA, R departs considerably from ideal at qi/Q values as
modest as 2%, revealing a problem with the aerosol inlet flow. This
imperfection is not removed by either increasing or decreasing the slit width,
nor by reorienting axially the sample flow jet as it merges with the sheath
gas. By introducing a ring with many perforations upstream of the inlet slit,
which favors a more symmetric distribution of the sample flow over the slit
perimeter, R values close to ideal are approached with qi/Q ratios as large as
6 to 12%. This improvement enables (in principle) classification of particles

signature is a broadened image with little or no substructure and a similarly
smooth exponential scattering tail in the temporal profile. The case of the
pulsar B1508+55 is special: The profile shows additional components that are
moving relative to the main pulse with time. We use low-frequency VLBI with
LOFAR to test the hypothesis that these components are actually such

a selection of results from an ongoing large-scale monitoring campaign. We can

Resonant Raman spectroscopy is a versatile tool to study the physics of

useful for the investigation of strain effect on 2D materials. Here, for the
first time, we report the resonant Raman study of strained few-layer InSe
({\gamma}-phase). Under ~ 1% of uniaxial tensile strain, one order of magnitude
enhancement of Raman intensity for longitudinal optical (LO) phonon is
observed, while other modes exhibit only modest change. Further analysis
demonstrates that it arises from the intraband electron-phonon scattering
channel for LO phonon in resonance. The large enhancement of Raman intensity
provides us a sensitive and novel method to characterize the strain effect and
a mapping of the strain distribution in a wrinkled sample is demonstrated. In
addition, we observed sizable redshifts of first-order optical phonon modes.
The shift rate exhibits phonon mode dependence, in excellent agreement with
density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations. Our study paves the
way for sensitive strain quantification in few-layer InSe and its application
in flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.

asymmetry in the sky distribution of radio sources in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey

observer's velocity to be $\sim 4$ times larger than the CMBR value, though the
direction turned out to be in agreement with that of the CMBR dipole. This
large difference in observer's speeds with respect to the reference frames of

processes that affect the chemistry of interstellar clouds. With recent data on
grain heating frequencies as an input for a modified rate-equation
astrochemical model, this study examines, which whole-grain heating temperature
regime is the most efficient at altering the chemical composition of gas and
ices. Such a question arises because low-temperature heating, albeit less
effective at inducing evaporation of adsorbed species, happens much more often
than high-temperature grain heating. The model considers a delayed
gravitational collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, followed by a quiescent cloud
core stage. It was found that the whole-grain heating regimes can be divided in
three classes, depending on their induced physico-chemical effects. Heating to
low-temperature thresholds of 27 and 30 K induce desorption of the most
volatile of species - N2 and O2 ices, and adsorbed atoms. The
medium-temperature thresholds 40, 50, and 60 K allow effective evaporation of
CO and CH4, delaying their accumulation in ices. We find that the 40 K
threshold is the most effective cosmic-ray induced whole-grain heating regime
because its induced evaporation of CO promotes major abundance changes also for
other compounds. An important role in grain cooling may be played by molecular
nitrogen as the most volatile of the abundant species in the icy mantles.
Whole-grain heating determines the sequence of accretion for different
molecules on to grain surface, which plays a key role in the synthesis of
complex organic molecules.

Here, we have discussed coherent scattering effects in photonics. Coherent
perfect absorption (CPA) generalizes the concept of perfect absorption to
systems with several excitation channels. This effect allows all-optical light
manipulation by tuning of parameters of coherent excitation. In its turn, the
virtual perfect absorption (VPA) effect generalizes the concept of CPA to
complex frequencies and Hermitian systems. In contrast to real energy
dissipation in PA and CPA, in VPA the energy is trapped in a resonator till
excitation continuous exponentially growth and gets released when it breaks.
Additionally, VPA provides a way to perfectly couple to any even lossless
high-Q resonators. Finally, employing principles of coherent excitation can
boost the performance of traditional WPT systems via coherently enhanced

experiments typically either only capture bulk properties or require invasive

lowest in energy of the three. This previously noted result is in contradiction
of the minimum energy principle, which posits that the abundances of isomers in
interstellar environments can be predicted based on their relative stabilities
- and suggests, rather, the importance of kinetic over thermodynamic effects in
explaining the role of such species.
  Here, we report results of \textit{ab initio} quantum chemical calculations

destruction of propadienone is barrierless and exothermic. That this
destruction pathway is indeed behind the non-detection of CH$_2$CCO is further
suggested by our finding that the product of this process, the radical
CH$_2$CHCO, can subsequently react barrierlessly with H to form propenal
(CH$_2$CHCHO) which has, in fact, been detected in regions where the other two
H$_2$C$_3$O isomers are observed. Thus, these results not only shed light on a

transverse-field Ising model (1DTFIM) when the $x$ and $y$ components of the
spin interaction and the four-period field are absent. When these two terms are
present, following both analytical and numerical efforts, we demonstrate that
the system undergoes a second-order quantum phase transition with increasing
transverse fields, where the critical exponents as well as the central charge
fall into the universality of 1DTFIM. Our results naturally identify the 1DTFIM
universality of 1D quantum phase transitions observed in the existed
experiments in Sr(Ba)Co$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ with transverse field applied along
either [100] or [110] direction. Upon varying the tuning parameters a critical
surface with 1DTFIM universality is determined and silhouetted to exhibit the
general presence of the universality in a much wider scope of models than
conventional understanding. Thus our results provide a broad guiding framework
to facilitate the experimental realization of 1DTFIM universality in real
materials.

superconductivity or superfluidity near the critical temperature, and usually
the expansion up to the 4th order in terms of order parameters is sufficient
for the description of the second-order phase transition. In this paper, we
discuss the GL equation for the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluidity relevant for
interior of neutron stars. We derive the GL expansion up to the 8th order in
the condensates and find that this order is necessary for the system to have
the unique ground state, unlike the ordinary cases. Starting from the $LS$
potential, which provides the dominant attraction between two neutrons at the
high density, we derive the GL equation in the path-integral formalism, where
the auxiliary field method and the Nambu-Gor'kov representation are used. We
present the detailed description for the trace calculation necessary in the
derivation of the GL equation. As numerical results, we show the phase diagram
of the neutron $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluidity on the plane spanned by the
temperature and magnetic field, and find that the 8th order terms lead to a
first-order phase transition, whose existence was predicted in the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation but has not been found thus far within the

transition will affect the interior structures inside the neutron stars.

($L_{MO} \lesssim \lambda_{\theta}$; with $\lambda_{\theta}$ the thermal
boundary layer thickness), a transitional regime ($0.5H \gtrsim L_{MO} \gtrsim
\lambda_{\theta}$; with $H$ the height of the domain), and a shear dominated
regime ($L_{MO} \gtrsim 0.5H$). In the buoyancy dominated regime the flow
dynamics are similar to that of turbulent thermal convection. The transitional
regime is characterized by rolls that are increasingly elongated with
increasing shear. The flow in the shear dominated regime consists of very
large-scale meandering rolls, similar to the ones found in conventional Couette
flow. As a consequence of these different flow regimes, for fixed $Ra$ and with
increasing shear, the heat transfer first decreases, due to the breakup of the
thermal rolls, and then increases at the beginning of the shear dominated
regime. For $L_{MO} \gtrsim 0.5H$ the Nusselt number $Nu$ effectively scales as
$Nu \sim Ra^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \ll 1/3$ while we find $\alpha \simeq 0.31$

scaling exponent is $\alpha > 1/3$, but the temperature and velocity profiles
in this regime are not logarithmic yet, thus indicating transient dynamics and
not the ultimate regime of thermal convection.

long-range entangled-plaquette state -- in which pairs of clusters of adjacent
lattice sites are correlated at any distance. The explicit scale-free structure
of correlations built in this wave function makes it fit to reproduce critical
states with long-range entanglement. The use of complex weights in the Ansatz
allows for an efficient optimization of non positive definite states in a fully
variational fashion, namely without any additional bias (arising \emph{e.g.}
from pre-imposed sign structures) beyond that imposed by the parametrization of
the state coefficients. These two features render the Ansatz particularly
appropriate for the study of quantum phase transitions in frustrated systems.
Moreover, the Ansatz can be systematically improved by increasing the long
range plaquette size, as well as by the inclusion of even larger adjacent-site
plaquettes. We validate our Ansatz in the case of the XX and Heisenberg chain,
and further apply it to the case of a simple, yet paradigmatic model of
frustration, namely the $J_1-J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. For this
model we provide clear evidence that our trial wave function faithfully
describes both the short-range physics (particularly in terms of ground state
energy) and the long-range one expressed by the Luttinger exponent, and the
central charge of the related conformal field theory, which govern the decay of
correlations and the scaling of the entanglement entropy, respectively. Finally
we successfully reproduce the incommensurate correlations developing in the
system at strong frustration, as a result of the flexible representation of

In these problems it makes more sense to locate a region of good designs, than

optimised effectively with Bayesian optimisation, where a Gaussian process is a
popular choice as a prior over the expensive function. We propose a method for
robust optimisation using Bayesian optimisation to find a region of design
space in which the expensive function's performance is relatively insensitive

realisations from a Gaussian process that is modelling the expensive function,
and evaluating the improvement for each realisation. The expectation of these
improvements can be optimised cheaply with an evolutionary algorithm to
determine the next location at which to evaluate the expensive function. We
describe an efficient process to locate the optimum expected improvement. We
show empirically that evaluating the expensive function at the location in the
candidate uncertainty region about which the model is most uncertain, or at
random, yield the best convergence in contrast to exploitative schemes. We
illustrate our method on six test functions in two, five, and ten dimensions,

characterizing the drag force acting on a CME as it propagates through

to know the CME geometry, more specific, its volume. Having derived the CME
volume and mass from remote sensing data using 3D reconstructed CME geometry,
we can calculate the CME density and compare it with in-situ proton density
measurements near Earth. From that we may draw important conclusions on a
possible mass increase as the CME interacts with the ambient solar wind in the
heliosphere. In this paper we will describe in detail the method for deriving
the CME volume using the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model (Thernisien et

EPIC is a solution to the computational problem of large interferometers. By
gridding and spatially Fourier transforming channelised electric fields from
the antennas in real-time, EPIC removes the explicit cross multiplication of
all pairs of antenna voltages to synthesize an aperture, reducing the
computational scaling from $\mathcal{O}(n_a^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_g \log_2

produces very high time resolution images in real time. The GPU-based

(TSM), for reliability based design optimization (RBDO). The proposed approach
is similar in spirit with the sequential optimization and reliability analysis
(SORA) method where the RBDO problem is decoupled into an optimization and a
reliability analysis problem. However, unlike SORA that utilizes shift-vector
to shift the design variables within a constraint (independently), in TSM we
propose to shift the threshold of the constraints. We argue that modifying a
constraint, either by shifting the design variables (SORA) or by shifting the
threshold of the constraints (TSM), influences the other constraints of the
system. Therefore, we propose to determine the thresholds for all the
constraints by solving a single optimization problem. Additionally, the
proposed TSM is equipped with an active-constraint determination scheme. To
make the method scalable, a practical algorithm for TSM that utilizes two
surrogate models is proposed. Unlike the conventional RBDO methods, the
proposed approach has the ability to handle highly non-linear probabilistic
constraints. The performance of the proposed approach is examined on six
benchmark problems selected from the literature. The proposed approach yields
excellent results outperforming other popular methods in literature. As for the
computational efficiency, the proposed approach is found to be highly
efficient, indicating it's future application to other real-life problems.

and R\'enyi entropies for singular regions. First, we show that for
$(3+1)$-dimensional free conformal field theories (CFTs), entangling regions
emanating from vertices give rise to a universal contribution $S_n^{\rm univ}=
-\frac{1}{8\pi}f_b(n) \int_{\gamma} k^2 \log^2(R/\delta)$, where $\gamma$ is
the curve formed by the intersection of the entangling surface with a unit
sphere centered at the vertex, and $k$ the trace of its extrinsic curvature.
While for circular and elliptic cones this term reproduces the general-CFT
result, it vanishes for polyhedral corners. For those, we argue that the
universal contribution, which is logarithmic, is not controlled by a local
integral, but rather it depends on details of the CFT in a complicated way. We
also study the angle dependence for the entanglement entropy of wedge
singularities in 3+1 dimensions. This is done for general CFTs in the smooth
limit, and using free and holographic CFTs at generic angles. In the latter
case, we show that the wedge contribution is not proportional to the
entanglement entropy of a corner region in the $(2+1)$-dimensional holographic
CFT. Finally, we show that the mutual information of two regions that touch at
a point is not necessarily divergent, as long as the contact is through a
sufficiently sharp corner. Similarly, we provide examples of singular
entangling regions which do not modify the structure of divergences of the

and safety assessment. Due to the difficulty in vehicle microscopic behaviour
data acquisition, traditional traffic characteristic analysis mainly focuses on
macroscopic characteristics. With the development of data acquisition
technology, it becomes much easier to obtain a large amount of microscopic
behaviour data nowadays, which lays a good foundation for analysing the traffic
characteristics from a new point of view. This paper puts forward a method for
expressing and displaying the vehicle behaviour distribution in maintenance
work zones. Using portable vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition
devices, lots of data can be obtained. Based on this data, an endpoint
detection technology is used to automatically extract the segments in behaviour
data with violent fluctuations, which are segments where vehicles take
behaviours such as acceleration or turning. Using the support vector machine
classification method, the specific types of behaviours of the segments
extracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a
total of ten types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density
analysis is used to cluster different types of behaviours of all passing
vehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how vehicles travel
through maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute
in maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a
novel traffic characteristic and can shed light to maintenance work zone
related researches such as safety assessment and design method.

first aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then
subjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous
works, the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently.
Hence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper, we
first propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature
aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly.
Specifically, our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that
can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more
discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition,
the proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing.
When the data label is available, the framework can be adapted to learn binary
codes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors. Furthermore,
we also propose a fast version of the state-of-the-art hashing method Binary
Autoencoder to be used in our proposed frameworks. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets under various settings show that the proposed methods
outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.

to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We
developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as
relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or
prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature
searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an
annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning
classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which
learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each
title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN)
which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and
abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification
of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance
classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for
training the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model.
The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were
correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For
prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The
SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 %
accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts
as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review,
this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning
knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical
decision support tools up to date.

double-slit experiment (point detection, random distribution, Born rule) can be
explained using Schroedinger's equation alone, if one takes into account that,
for any atom in a detector, there is a small but nonzero gap between its
excitation energy and the excitation energies of all other relevant atoms in
the detector (isolated-levels assumption). To illustrate the point I introduce
a toy model of a detector. The form of the model follows common practice in
quantum optics and cavity QED. Each detector atom can be resonantly excited by
the incoming particle, and then emit a detection signature (e.g. bright flash
of light) or dissipate its energy thermally. Different atoms have slightly
different resonant energies per the isolated-levels assumption, and the
projectile preferentially excites the atom with the closest energy match. The
toy model permits one easily to estimate the probability that any atom is
resonantly excited, and also that a detection signature is produced before
being overtaken by thermal dissipation. The end-to-end detection probability is
the product of these two probabilities, and is proportional to the absolute
square of the incoming wavefunction at the atom in question, i.e. the Born
rule. I consider how closely a published neutron-interference experiment
conforms to the picture developed here; I show how this paper's analysis steers
clear of creating a scenario with local hidden variables; I show how the
analysis steers clear of the irreversibility implicit in the projection
postulate; and I discuss possible experimental tests of this paper's ideas.
Hopefully, this is a significant step toward realizing the program of solving
the measurement problem within unitary quantum mechanics envisioned by
Landsman, among others.

structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like
structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a
large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as
integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence
suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced
by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic
dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of
classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to
simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between
soma and dendritic spines. Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to
deal with complex dendritic tree. Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells
of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider
four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity
of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and
modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a
variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species,
however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of

questions, and with their time evolution. The strategy is based on the
simplest, non-commutative, Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=\mathbb{C}^2$, and on the
(commuting or not) operators on it. As in ordinary Quantum Mechanics, the
dynamics is driven by a suitable operator, the Hamiltonian of the system. We
discuss a rather general situation, and analyse the resulting dynamics if the
Hamiltonian is a simple Hermitian matrix.

  Narration-Guided Reinforcement Learning","10 pages, 3 figures. Published at SPIE 2019",,,,"cs.MM cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While deep reinforcement learning techniques have led to agents that are
successfully able to learn to perform a number of tasks that had been
previously unlearnable, these techniques are still susceptible to the
longstanding problem of {\em reward sparsity}. This is especially true for
tasks such as training an agent to play StarCraft II, a real-time strategy game
where reward is only given at the end of a game which is usually very long.
While this problem can be addressed through reward shaping, such approaches
typically require a human expert with specialized knowledge. Inspired by the
vision of enabling reward shaping through the more-accessible paradigm of
natural-language narration, we investigate to what extent we can contextualize
these narrations by grounding them to the goal-specific states. We present a
mutual-embedding model using a multi-input deep-neural network that projects a
sequence of natural language commands into the same high-dimensional
representation space as corresponding goal states. We show that using this
model we can learn an embedding space with separable and distinct clusters that
accurately maps natural-language commands to corresponding game states . We
also discuss how this model can allow for the use of narrations as a robust
form of reward shaping to improve RL performance and efficiency.

  Reduced Computations through a Runtime Activation Estimation","7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted by ASP-DAC 2019",,"10.1145/3287624.3287640",,"eess.SP eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently Resistive-RAM (RRAM) crossbar has been used in the design of the
accelerator of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve the memory wall
issue. However, the intensive multiply-accumulate computations (MACs) executed
at the crossbars during the inference phase are still the bottleneck for the
further improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. In this work, we
explore several methods to reduce the computations for the RRAM-based CNN
accelerators. First, the output sparsity resulting from the widely employed
Rectified Linear Unit is exploited, and a significant portion of computations
are bypassed through an early detection of the negative output activations.
Second, an adaptive approximation is proposed to terminate the MAC early when
the sum of the partial results of the remaining computations is considered to
be within a certain range of the intermediate accumulated result and thus has
an insignificant contribution to the inference. In order to determine these
redundant computations, a novel runtime estimation on the maximum and minimum
values of each output activation is developed and used during the MAC
operation. Experimental results show that around 70% of the computations can be
reduced during the inference with a negligible accuracy loss smaller than 0.2%.
As a result, the energy efficiency and the throughput are improved by over 2.9
and 2.8 times, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art RRAM-based
accelerators.
