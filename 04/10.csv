sensitized with the dye Zinc beta-tetraaminophthalocyanine for operation in the
first telecom window. This device shows a high ON/OFF ratio of six orders of
magnitude in the red spectral region and an unprecedented 4.5 orders of
magnitude at 847 nm. By transient absorption spectroscopy, we reveal that this
unexpected infrared sensitivity is due to electron transfer from the dye to the
CdSe NCs within 5 ps. We show by time-resolved photocurrent measurements that
this enables fast rise times during near-infrared optical gating of 74 ns.
Electronic coupling and accelerated non-radiative recombination of charge
carriers at the interface between the dye and the CdSe NCs are further
corroborated by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.
Field-effect transistor measurements indicate that the increase in photocurrent
upon laser illumination is mainly due to the increase in carrier concentration
while the mobility remains unchanged. Our results illustrate that organic dyes
as ligands for NCs invoke new optoelectronic functionalities, such as fast
optical gating at sub-bandgap optical excitation energies.

'locally decodable' if every receiver can decode its demand using only a subset
of the codeword symbols transmitted by the sender instead of observing the
entire codeword. Local decodability in index coding improves the error
performance when used in wireless broadcast channels, reduces the receiver
complexity and improves privacy in index coding. The 'locality' of an index
code is the ratio of the number of codeword symbols used by each receiver to
the number message symbols demanded by the receiver. Prior work on locality in
index coding have considered only single unicast and single-uniprior problems,
and the optimal trade-off between broadcast rate and locality is known only for
a few cases. In this paper we identify the optimal broadcast rate (including
among non-linear codes) for all three receiver unicast problems when the
locality is equal to the minimum possible value, i.e., equal to one. The index
code that achieves this optimal rate is based on a clique covering technique
and is well known. The main contribution of this paper is in providing tight
converse results by relating locality to broadcast rate, and showing that this
known index coding scheme is optimal when locality is equal to one. Towards
this we derive several structural properties of the side information graphs of
three receiver unicast problems, and combine them with information theoretic
arguments to arrive at a converse.

obtain simplified networks with a low number of neurons to resolve the
problems. The system is compared with the already existent system which also

adversarial learning method that (i) facilitates the emergence of latent
structure by semantically disentangling sources of variation, and (ii)
encourages learning generalizable, continuous, and transferable latent codes
that enable flexible attribute mixing. This is achieved by introducing a novel
loss function that encourages representations to result in uniformly
distributed class posteriors for disentangled attributes. In tandem with an
algorithm for inducing generalizable properties, the resulting representations
can be utilized for a variety of tasks such as intensity-preserving
multi-attribute image translation and synthesis, without requiring labelled
test data. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed method by a set of
qualitative and quantitative experiments on popular databases such as MultiPIE,
RaFD, and BU-3DFE, where our method outperforms other, state-of-the-art methods
in tasks such as intensity-preserving multi-attribute transfer and synthesis.

complex system plays a pivotal role in understanding various phenomena in
different branches of science. Examples include the allometric scaling among
food webs in biology, the scaling relationship between fluid flow and fracture
stiffness in geophysics, and the gap-to-$T_c$ ratio, between energy gap,
$\Delta$, and critical transition temperature, $T_c$, hallmarks of
superconductivity. Kinematics, in turn, is the branch of physics that governs
the motion of bodies by imposing constraints correlating their masses, momenta,
and energy; it is an essential ingredient for the analysis of high-energy
quarkonium production, galaxy formation, as well as the $\rho_\circ+AT^2$
contribution to the normal state resistivity in a Fermi liquid (FL),
$\rho_\circ$ being a measure of disorder and $A$ the hallmark of FL. Here, we
report on the identification of a novel, universal kinematic scaling relation
between $T_c(\rho_\circ)$ and $A(\rho_\circ)$ found in a plethora of
defect-bearing conventional and non-conventional superconductors within their
FL regime. We traced back this relation to the triggering and stabilization of
an electron-electron scattering channel within a very specific, yet common,
type of amorphized regions, ubiquitous in all such superconductors. Our
theoretical treatment consisted of, first, analyzing the construct of a
distorted lattice as a mimic of the kinematic aftermath of the formation of
such amorphized regions. Then we applied standard many body techniques to
derive expressions for $T_c(\rho_\circ)$, $A(\rho_\circ)$, and their
correlations. Our results are in agreement with experiments and provide a solid
theoretical foundation for reconciling superconductivity with FL transport in
these systems.

obtaining such limits, experiments primarily assume the standard halo model
(SHM) as the distribution of dark matter in our Milky Way. Three astrophysical
parameters are required to define the SHM: the local dark matter escape
velocity, the local dark matter density and the circular velocity of the sun
around the center of the galaxy. This paper studies the effect of the
uncertainties in these three astrophysical parameters on the XENON1T exclusion
limits using the publicly available DDCalc code. We compare limits obtained
using the widely assumed escape velocity from the RAVE survey and the newly
calculated escape velocity by Monari $et$ $al.$ using Gaia data. Our study
finds that the astrophysical uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainty in
the escape velocity (independent of the best fit value) at dark matter masses
below 6 GeV and can lead to a variation of nearly 6 orders of magnitude in the
exclusion limits at 4 GeV. Above a WIMP mass of 6 GeV, the uncertainty becomes
dominated by the local dark matter density, leading to uncertainties of factors
of $\sim$10 (3) at 6 (15) GeV WIMP mass in the exclusion limits. Additionally,
this work finds that the updated best fit value for the escape velocity based
on Gaia data leads to only very minor changes to the effects of the
astrophysical uncertainties on the XENON1T exclusion limits.

requires high throughput accelerators like GPU and TPU but TEEs do not offer
security protection of such accelerators. This paper present HETEE
(Heterogeneous TEE), the first design of TEE capable of strongly protecting
heterogeneous computing with unsecure accelerators. HETEE is uniquely
constructed to work with today's servers, and does not require any changes for
existing commercial CPUs or accelerators. The key idea of our design runs
security controller as a stand-alone computing system to dynamically adjust the
boundary of between secure and insecure worlds through the PCIe switches,
rendering the control of an accelerator to the host OS when it is not needed
for secure computing, and shifting it back when it is. The controller is the
only trust unit in the system and it runs the custom OS and accelerator
runtimes, together with the encryption, authentication and remote attestation
components. The host server and other computing systems communicate with
controller through an in memory task queue that accommodates the computing
tasks offloaded to HETEE, in the form of encrypted and signed code and data.
Also, HETEE offers a generic and efficient programming model to the host CPU.
We have implemented the HETEE design on a hardware prototype system, and
evaluated it with large-scale Neural Networks inference and training tasks. Our
evaluations show that HETEE can easily support such secure computing tasks and
only incurs a 12.34% throughput overhead for inference and 9.87% overhead for
training on average.

conjecture of Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg from 1992. The key to the proof is
a new structural tool called layered partitions, and the result that every
planar graph has a vertex-partition and a layering, such that each part has a
bounded number of vertices in each layer, and the quotient graph has bounded
treewidth. This result generalises for graphs of bounded Euler genus. Moreover,
we prove that every graph in a minor-closed class has such a layered partition
if and only if the class excludes some apex graph. Building on this work and
using the graph minor structure theorem, we prove that every proper
minor-closed class of graphs has bounded queue-number.
  Layered partitions have strong connections to other topics, including the
following two examples. First, they can be interpreted in terms of strong
products. We show that every planar graph is a subgraph of the strong product
of a path with some graph of bounded treewidth. Similar statements hold for all
proper minor-closed classes. Second, we give a simple proof of the result by
DeVos et al. (2004) that graphs in a proper minor-closed class have low
treewidth colourings.

mastery of question answering. Modern question answering benchmarks are one
variant of the Turing test. Specifically, answering a set of questions as well
as a human is a minimum bar towards demonstrating human-like intelligence. This
paper makes the case that the format of one competition -- where participants
can answer in the middle of hearing a question (incremental) -- better
differentiates the skill between (human or machine) players. Additionally,
merging a sequential decision-making sub-task with question answering (QA)
provides a good setting for research in model calibration and opponent
modeling. Thus, embedded in this task are three machine learning challenges:
(1) factoid QA over thousands of Wikipedia-like answers, (2) calibration of the
QA model's confidence scores, and (3) sequential decision-making that
incorporates knowledge of the QA model, its calibration, and what the opponent
may do. We make two contributions: (1) collecting and curating a large factoid
QA dataset and an accompanying gameplay dataset, and (2) developing a model
that addresses these three machine learning challenges. In addition to offline
evaluation, we pitted our model against some of the most accomplished trivia
players in the world in a series of exhibition matches spanning several years.
Throughout this paper, we show that collaborations with the vibrant trivia
community have contributed to the quality of our dataset, spawned new research
directions, and doubled as an exciting way to engage the public with research
in machine learning and natural language processing.

and ii) multi-label image retrieval between very high resolution (VHR) images
and speech based label annotations. Notice that these multi-modal retrieval
scenarios are more challenging than the traditional uni-modal retrieval
approaches given the inherent differences in distributions between the
modalities. However, with the growing availability of multi-source remote
sensing data and the scarcity of enough semantic annotations, the task of
multi-modal retrieval has recently become extremely important. In this regard,
we propose a novel deep neural network based architecture which is considered
to learn a discriminative shared feature space for all the input modalities,
suitable for semantically coherent information retrieval. Extensive experiments
are carried out on the benchmark large-scale PAN - multi-spectral DSRSID

and complexity. After projecting process data, system identification and
optimal scheduling calculations can be performed in the low-dimensional,

the computational effort, while offering more detailed dynamic information

distorted Mn$_{3}$Pt exhibits an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
However, Mn$_{3}$Pt only enters a non-collinear magnetic phase close to the
stoichiometric composition and at suitably large thicknesses. Therefore, we
turn our attention to Mn$_{3}$Ir, the material of choice for use in exchange
bias heterostructures. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic and
electrical transport properties of epitaxially grown, face-centered-cubic
$\gamma$-Mn$_{3}$Ir thin films with (111) crystal orientation. Relaxed films of
10 nm thickness exhibit an ordinary Hall effect, with a hole-type carrier
concentration of (2.24 $\pm$ 0.08) $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-3}$. On the other
hand, TEM characterization demonstrates that ultrathin 3 nm films grow with
significant in-plane tensile strain. This may explain a small remanent moment,
observed at low temperatures, shown by XMCD spectroscopy to arise from
uncompensated Mn spins. Of the order 0.02 $\mu_{B}$ / atom, this dominates
electrical transport behavior, leading to a small AHE and negative
magnetoresistance. These results are discussed in terms of crystal
microstructure and chiral domain behavior, with spatially resolved XML(C)D-PEEM
supporting the conclusion that small antiferromagnetic domains, < 20 nm in

quality of astronomical images is usually very low with respect to other real

acquisition process. This increases the percentage of noise and makes more
difficult to use directly standard segmentation methods on the original image.
In this work we will describe how to process astronomical images in two steps:
in the first step we improve the image quality by a rescaling of light
intensity whereas in the second step we apply level-set methods to identify the
objects. Several experiments will show the effectiveness of this procedure and
the results obtained via various discretization techniques for level-set

Recent findings in machine learning allowed the derivation of a family of
powerful synaptic plasticity rules approximating backpropagation for spiking
networks. Are these rules capable of processing real-world visual sensory data?
In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Event-Driven Random
Back-Propagation (eRBP) at learning representations from event streams provided
by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). First, we show that eRBP matches
state-of-the-art performance on the DvsGesture dataset with the addition of a
simple covert attention mechanism. By remapping visual receptive fields
relatively to the center of the motion, this attention mechanism provides
translation invariance at low computational cost compared to convolutions.
Second, we successfully integrate eRBP in a real robotic setup, where a robotic
arm grasps objects according to detected visual affordances. In this setup,
visual information is actively sensed by a DVS mounted on a robotic head
performing microsaccadic eye movements. We show that our method classifies
affordances within 100ms after microsaccade onset, which is comparable to human
performance reported in behavioral study. Our results suggest that advances in
neuromorphic technology and plasticity rules enable the development of
autonomous robots operating at high speed and low energy consumption.

number of minimal covering systems. More precisely, we show that the number of
minimal covering systems with exactly $n$ elements is \[ \exp\left(
\left(\frac{4\sqrt{\tau}}{3} + o(1)\right) \frac{n^{3/2}}{(\log n)^{1/2}}

four-particle mixed-harmonic cumulants, which indicate an anti-correlation
between $v_2$ and $v_3$, and a positive correlation between $v_2$ and $v_4$.
These correlations decrease in strength towards central collisions and either
approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the
possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume
fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used
for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the
cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In
ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse
momentum dependent. These results provide new information to disentangle flow
fluctuations from the initial and final states, as well as new insights on the
influence of centrality fluctuations.

results, in particular concerning the occurrence of short term variability
between about 5 to 90 minutes. We have performed a new investigation of 21 Com
using MOST satellite and high-cadence ground-based photometry, time series
spectroscopy, and evolutionary and pulsational modeling. Our analysis confirms
that 21 Com is a classical CP2 star showing increased abundances of, in
particular, Cr and Sr. From spectroscopic analysis, we have derived Teff =
8900(200) K, log g = 3.9(2), and vsini = 63(2) km/s. Our modeling efforts
suggest that 21 Com is a main sequence (MS) star seen equator-on with a mass of
2.29(10) M(Sun) and a radius of R = 2.6(2) R(Sun). Our extensive photometric
data confirm the existence of rotational light variability with a period of
2.05219(2) d. However, no significant frequencies with a semi-amplitude
exceeding 0.2 mmag were found in the frequency range from 5 to 399 c/d. Our RV
data also do not indicate short-term variability. We calculated pulsational
models assuming different metallicities and ages, which do not predict the
occurrence of unstable modes. The star 18 Com, often employed as comparison
star for 21 Com in the past, has been identified as a periodic variable (P =
1.41645 d). While it is impossible to assess whether 21 Com has exhibited
short-term variability in the past, the new observational data and several
issues/inconsistencies identified in previous studies strongly suggest that 21
Com is neither a delta Scuti nor a roAp pulsator but a ""well-behaved"" CP2 star
exhibiting its trademark rotational variability.

multi-view image data, 3D skeletons, correspondences between 2D-3D points, or
use previously learned 3D priors during training. A lifting network accepts 2D
landmarks as inputs and generates a corresponding 3D skeleton estimate. During
training, the recovered 3D skeleton is reprojected on random camera viewpoints
to generate new ""synthetic"" 2D poses. By lifting the synthetic 2D poses back to
3D and re-projecting them in the original camera view, we can define
self-consistency loss both in 3D and in 2D. The training can thus be self
supervised by exploiting the geometric self-consistency of the
lift-reproject-lift process. We show that self-consistency alone is not
sufficient to generate realistic skeletons, however adding a 2D pose
discriminator enables the lifter to output valid 3D poses. Additionally, to
learn from 2D poses ""in the wild"", we train an unsupervised 2D domain adapter
network to allow for an expansion of 2D data. This improves results and
demonstrates the usefulness of 2D pose data for unsupervised 3D lifting.
Results on Human3.6M dataset for 3D human pose estimation demonstrate that our

complex system is a key step in gaining a network-based understanding of the
system. Because of their simplicity and low computation cost, pairwise
statistics are commonly used in a variety of fields. Those approaches, however,
typically suffer from one or more limitations such as lack of confidence
intervals requiring reliance on surrogate data, sensitivity to binning,
sparsity of the signals, or short duration of the records. In this paper we
develop a method for assessing pairwise dependencies in point processes that
overcomes these challenges. Given two point processes $X$ and $Y$ each emitting
a given number of events $m$ and $n$ in a fixed period of time $T$, we derive
exact analytical expressions for the expected value and standard deviation of
the number of pairs events $X_i,Y_j$ separated by a delay of less than $\tau$
one should expect to observe if $X$ and $Y$ were i.i.d. uniform random
variables. We prove that this statistic is normally distributed in the limit of
large $T$, which enables the definition of a Z-score characterising the
likelihood of the observed number of coincident events happening by chance. We
numerically confirm the analytical results and show that the property of
normality is robust in a wide range of experimental conditions. We then
experimentally demonstrate the predictive power of the method using a noisy
version of the common shock model. Our results show that our approach has
excellent behaviour even in scenarios with low event density and/or when the

positive. By combining these data with a model for the vibrational free energy,
we propose a revision of the W-rich end of the phase diagram with a much larger

provided by a ""fractonic circuit"" - a model of quantum circuit dynamics in one
dimension constrained to conserve both charge and dipole moment. We show how
the Hilbert space of the fractonic circuit dynamically fractures into
disconnected emergent subsectors within a particular charge and dipole symmetry
sector. A large number of the emergent subsectors, exponentially many in the
size of the system, have dimension one and exhibit strictly localized quantum
dynamics---even in the absence of spatial disorder and in the presence of
temporal noise. Exponentially large localized subspaces can be proven to exist
for any one dimensional fractonic circuit with finite spatial range, and
provide a potentially new route for the robust storage of quantum information.
Other emergent subsectors display non-trivial dynamics and may be constructed
by embedding finite sized non-trivial blocks into the localized subspace. The
shattering of a particular symmetry sector into a distribution of dynamical
subsectors with varying sizes leads to the coexistence of high and low
entanglement states, i.e. this provides a general mechanism for the production
of quantum many body scars. We discuss the detailed pattern of fracturing and
its implications. We also discuss other mechanisms for similarly shattering

binaries. For the first time the observational bias of this sample is
calculated with respect to the mass ratio of the host binaries. It is shown
that the mass ratio affects transit detection in multiple, sometimes subtle
ways, through stability and dynamics of orbits, dilution of transit depths and
the geometric transit and eclipse probabilities. Surprisingly though, it is
found that these effects largely cancel out. Consequently, the transit
detections in the Kepler mission are essentially unbiased with respect to mass
ratio, and hence likely representative of the true underlying population. It is
shown the mass ratio distribution of circumbinary hosts may be the same as
field binaries, and hence roughly uniform, but more observations are needed to
deduce any subtle differences. These results are discussed in the context of
close binary formation and evolution, of which the mass ratio is believed to be

the ones observed by LIGO, often assume they are assembled from the direct
collapse of massive pre-supernova stars. However, it is still unclear whether
the final mass and spin of the newly formed BH arises from the collapse of the
entire stellar progenitor or just a fraction of it, given that coupling of
accretion feedback released during BH formation to the surrounding infalling
star will inevitably lead to its ejection. If the BH is built up via disk
accretion, outflows from the center will result in residual gas ejection, thus
halting the stellar collapse and reducing the amount of mass and spin that can
be accreted by the newly formed BH. Here we discuss the general properties of
BHs (mass and spin) associated with the collapse of rotating, helium star
pre-supernova progenitors. When accretion feedback is included, the BH drives
powerful outflows that heat the surrounding envelope, effectively shutting down
the collapse. This gives rise to various outcomes ranging from very massive BHs
with low spins, as inferred for GW150914, to lighter and faster-spinning BHs,
as deduced for GW151226.

diffuse galaxy (UDG) Dragonfly 44, as determined from 25.3 hrs of observations
with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. The luminosity-weighted dispersion within the
half-light radius is $\sigma_{1/2}=33^{+3}_{-3}$ km/s. There is no evidence for
rotation, with $V/\sigma<0.12$ (90% confidence) along the major axis, in
apparent conflict with models where UDGs are the high-spin tail of the normal
dwarf galaxy distribution. The spatially-averaged line profile is more peaked
than a Gaussian, with Gauss-Hermite coefficient $h_4=0.13\pm 0.05$. The
mass-to-light ratio within the effective radius is $M/L=26^{+7}_{-6}$, similar
to other UDGs and higher by a factor of six than normal galaxies of the same
luminosity. This difference between UDGs and other galaxies is, however,
sensitive to the aperture that is used, and is much reduced when the $M/L$
ratios are measured within a fixed radius of 10 kpc. Dragonfly 44 has a rising
velocity dispersion profile, from $\sigma=26^{+4}_{-4}$ km/s at R=0.2 kpc to
$\sigma=41^{+8}_{-8}$ km/s at R=5.1 kpc. The profile can only be fit with a
cuspy NFW profile if the orbital distribution has strong tangential anisotropy,
with $\beta=-0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. An alternative explanation is that the dark
matter profile has a core: a Di Cintio et al. (2014) density profile with a
mass-dependent core provides a very good fit to the kinematics for a halo mass
of $\log (M_{200}/{\rm M}_{\odot})=11.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}$ and
$\beta=-0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$, i.e., isotropic orbits. This model predicts a
slight positive kurtosis, in qualitative agreement with the measured $h_4$
parameter. UDGs such as Dragonfly 44 are dark matter dominated even in their
centers, and can constrain the properties of dark matter in a regime where
baryons usually dominate the kinematics: small spatial scales in massive halos.

true for the solar system beyond the orbit of Mars. Spectroscopy of white
dwarfs accreting planetary debris provides the most accurate insight into the
bulk composition of exo-planets. Ground-based spectroscopic surveys of ~260,
000 white dwarfs detected with Gaia will identify >1000 evolved planetary
systems, and high-throughput high-resolution space-based ultraviolet
spectroscopy is essential to measure in detail their abundances. So far,
evidence for two planetesimals orbiting closely around white dwarfs has been
obtained, and their study provides important constraints on the composition and
internal structure of these bodies. Major photometric and spectroscopic efforts
will be necessary to assemble a sample of such close-in planetesimals that is
sufficiently large to establish their properties as a population, and to deduce
the architectures of the outer planetary systems from where they originated.
Mid-infrared spectroscopy of the dusty disks will provide detailed
mineralogical information of the debris, which, in combination with the
elemental abundances measured from the white dwarf spectroscopy, will enable
detailed physical modelling of the chemical, thermodynamic, and physical
history of the accreted material. Flexible multi-epoch infrared observations
are essential to determine the physical nature, and origin of the variability
observed in many of the dusty disks. Finally, the direct detection of the outer
reservoirs feeding material to the white dwarfs will require sensitive mid- and

suggesting that those features are more common than previously thought. The
origins of those rings remain unclear. In particular, it is not known if the
same generic process can explain the presence of material around Chariklo,
Chiron, Haumea, or if each object has a very different history. Nonetheless, a
specific aspect of small bodies is that they may possess a non-axisymmetric
shape (topographic features and or elongation) that are essentially absent in
giant planets. This creates strong resonances between the spin rate of the
object and the mean motion of ring particles. In particular, Lindblad-type
resonances tend to clear the region around the corotation (or synchronous)
orbit, where the particles orbital period matches that of the body. Whatever
the origin of the ring is, modest topographic features or elongations of
Chariklo and Haumea explain why their rings should be found beyond the
outermost 1/2 resonance, where the particles complete one revolution while the
body completes two rotations. Comparison of the resonant locations relative to
the Roche limit of the body shows that fast rotators are favored for being
surrounded by rings. We discuss in more details the phase portraits of the 1/2

difference between the two boundaries for varying values of the Prandtl number
$Pr$, the ratio of viscosity to density diffusivity, and fixed moderate
Reynolds number, $Re=400$. In the two asymptotic limits $Pr \to 0$ and $Pr \to
\infty$, it is found that such solutions exist at arbitrarily high bulk
stratification but for different physical reasons. In the $Pr \to 0$ limit,
density variations away from a constant stable density gradient become
vanishingly small as diffusion of density dominates over advection, allowing
equilibria to exist for bulk Richardson number $Ri_b \lesssim
O(Re^{-2}Pr^{-1})$. Alternatively, at high Prandtl numbers, density becomes
homogenised in the interior by the dominant advection which creates strongly
stable stratified boundary layers that recede into the wall as $Pr\to\infty$.
In this scenario, the density stratification and the flow essentially decouple,
thereby mitigating the effect of increasing $Ri_b$. An asymptotic analysis is
presented in the passive scalar regime $Ri_b \lesssim O(Re^{-2})$, which
reveals $O(Pr^{-1/3})$-thick stratified boundary layers with
$O(Pr^{-2/9})$-wide eruptions, giving rise to density fingers of $O(Pr^{-1/9})$
length and $O(Pr^{-4/9})$ width that invade an otherwise homogeneous interior.
Finally, increasing $Re$ to $10^5$ in this regime reveals that interior stably
stratified density layers can form away from the boundaries, separating

State-of-the-art methods have been designed to solve separately these problems.
This paper presents a unified framework that is able to solve any pose problem
by alternating optimization techniques between two set of parameters, rotation
and translation. In order to make this possible, it is necessary to define an
objective function that captures the problem at hand. Since the objective
function will depend on the rotation and translation it is not possible to
solve it as a simple minimization problem. Hence the use of Alternating
Minimization methods, in which the function will be alternatively minimized
with respect to the rotation and the translation. We show how to use our

the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time. In
this work, we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of
$0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of
intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based
algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n\text{poly}(n,m))$ that
finds a solution in $E^n$ to any $n$-variable linear program with $m$
constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from
$\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial.
  Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a
randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT. While our

our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that
incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to
measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time
varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself
computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the
minimax theorem). Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic

possible thanks to a novel loss function to account for positional shifts of

form of self-supervised learning, and it takes advantage of unlabeled data.

whether or not to stop a trial for futility or to modify planned sample size.
These ignore the information in short-term endpoints and baseline covariates,
and thereby do not make fully efficient use of the information in the data. We
therefore propose an interim decision procedure based on the conditional power
approach which exploits the information contained in baseline covariates and
short-term outcomes. We will realise this by considering the estimation of the
treatment effect at the interim analysis as a missing data problem. This
problem is addressed by employing specific prediction models for the long-term
endpoint which enable the incorporation of baseline covariates and multiple
short-term endpoints. We show that the proposed procedure leads to an
efficiency gain and a reduced sample size, without compromising the Type I
error rate of the procedure, even when the adopted prediction models are
misspecified. In particular, implementing our proposal in the conditional power
approach allows earlier decisions relative to standard approaches, whilst
controlling the probability of an incorrect decision. This time gain results in
a lower expected number of recruited patients in case of stopping for futility,
such that fewer patients receive the futile regimen. We explain how these
methods can be used in adaptive designs with unblinded sample size reassessment
based on the inverse normal $p$-value combination method to control type I
error. We support the proposal by Monte Carlo simulations based on data from a

transition probability, is a fundamental input in the calculation of
$(n,\gamma)$ cross sections used to simulate the nucleosynthesis of elements
heavier than Fe. Since 2004, an enhanced probability of $\gamma$-decay with
$\gamma$-ray energies below $\approx2 - 4$ MeV has been measured in reaction
data for numerous nuclei. This has been observed as an increase in the
$\gamma$-ray strength with decreasing $\gamma$-ray energy, often referred to as
the low-energy enhancement or \textit{upbend} in the $\gamma$-ray strength.
Nevertheless, the available data confirming this enhancement corresponded
solely to charged-particle included reactions and no low-energy enhancement had
yet been confirmed from neutron-induced reaction measurements. In this work, we
present the first evidence of low-energy $\gamma$-ray strength enhancement from
neutron-capture reaction data. Gamma-ray spectra following thermal neutron
capture on $^{58,60}$Ni have been used to determine the strength for primary
and secondary $\gamma$-rays in $^{59,61}$Ni, showing an enhancement for
$\gamma$-ray energies below $\approx 3$ MeV and $\approx 2$ MeV for
$^{59,61}$Ni, respectively. For the first time, this enhancement is observed
down to $\gamma$-ray energies of $\approx0.2$ MeV. Further, available
spin-parity assignments have been used to obtain the multipolarity and
electromagnetic character of these transitions, showing that this low-energy
enhancement is dominated by $M1$ and $E2$ strength, with $E1$ strength also
exceeding Standard Lorentzian Model predictions. Finally, large-basis
shell-model calculations have been performed, also predicting a strong $M1$
enhancement at low $\gamma$-ray energies.

highly dependent on the molecular surface density and results in opposite
trends. In the case of a high density monolayer the conformational changes are
hindered by the proximity of the neighboring peptides, hence forming an
insulating layer in response to copper-complexation. Whereas the slightly lower
density monolayers allow for the conformational change to a looped peptide
wrapping the Cu-ion, which results in a more conductive monolayer. Copper-ion
complexation to the high- and low-density monolayers systematically induces an
increase of the work functions. Copper-ion complexation to the low-density
monolayer induces an increase of electron transport efficiency, while the
copper-ion complexation to the high-density monolayer results in a slight
decrease of electron transport. Both of the observed trends are in agreement
with first-principle calculations. Complexed copper to low density
GGH-monolayer induces a new gap state slightly above the Au Fermi energy that
is absent in the high density monolayer.

which the fall-back mechanism played a role. We measure a carbon abundance of
A(C)=6.2 that places J0023+0307 on the low band in the A(C)-[Fe/H] diagram,
suggesting no contamination from a binary companion. This star is also unique
having a lithium abundance (A(Li)=2.02+-0.08) close to the level of the Lithium

extremely iron-poor stars. The upper envelope of the lithium abundances in
unevolved stars spanning more than three orders of magnitude in metallicity

described, capable of recognizing patterns of remote exfiltration occurring

and egress bytes over time, is used to train an ensemble of one-class learners.
The detection ensemble is modular, with individual classifiers trained on
different traffic features thought to characterize malicious data transfers. We
select features that model the egress to ingress byte balance over time,
periodicity, short time-scale irregularity, and density of the traffic. The
features are most efficiently modeled in the frequency domain, which has the
added benefit that variable duration flows are transformed to a fixed-size
feature vector, and by sampling the frequency space appropriately,
long-duration flows can be tested. When trained on days- or weeks-worth of
traffic from individual hosts, our ensemble achieves a low false positive rate
(<2%) on a range of different system types. Simulated exfiltration samples with
a variety of different timing and data characteristics were generated and used
to test ensemble performance on different kinds of systems: when trained on a
client workstation's external traffic, the ensemble was generally successful at
detecting exfiltration that is not simultaneously ingress-heavy,
connection-sparse, and of short duration---a combination that is not optimal
for attackers seeking to transfer large amounts of data. Remote exfiltration is
more difficult to detect from egress-heavy systems, like web servers, with
normal traffic exhibiting timing characteristics similar to a wide range of
exfiltration types.

power is measured with simple linear models. Our findings suggest that
decoder-level features are more feasible and informative than attention-level

Namely, we consider problems where the flow connects two such artificial

for some (large) boundary data all unsteady solutions blow up in finite time,
for other data (including small or trivial) the unsteady flows either converge
asymptotically to one of two steady solutions, or blow up in finite time,
depending on the initial state. We then document the very same behavior of the
numerical solutions for planar flow in a diverging channel. Finally, we provide
an illustrative example of two steady numerical solutions to the flow in a
three-dimensional bifurcating tube, where the inflow velocity is prescribed at
the inlet, while the two outlets are treated by the do-nothing boundary
condition.

in-domain data. The cynical approach converges much quicker, covering nearly
all of the in-domain vocabulary with 84% less data than the other methods.

training data for training better systems. Our results confirm that class-based
selection using Brown clusters is a viable alternative to POS-based class-based

frequency of the QPO and brightness of the sources increase, their fractional
variability decreases. We propose a simple interpretation using the
spherizarion radius, viscosity time and $\alpha$-parameter as basic properties
of these systems. The main physical driver of the observed variability is the
mass accretion rate which varies >3 between different observations of the same
source. As the accretion rate decreases the spherization radius reduces and the
FTN plus the QPO move toward higher frequencies resulting in a decrease of the
fractional rms variability. We also propose that in all ULXs when the accretion
rate is low enough (but still super-Eddington) the QPO and FTN disappear.
Assuming that the maximum X-ray luminosity depends only on the black hole (BH)
mass and not on the accretion rate (not considering the effects of either the
inclination of the super-Eddington disc nor geometrical beaming of radiation)
we estimate that all the ULXs have about similar BH masses, with the exception

  and Linear Time Chordal Graph Generation",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that any chordal graph on $n$ vertices can be represented as the
intersection of $n$ subtrees in a tree on $n$ nodes. This fact is recently used
in [2] to generate random chordal graphs on $n$ vertices by generating $n$
subtrees of a tree on $n$ nodes. It follows that the space (and thus time)
complexity of such an algorithm is at least the sum of the sizes of the
generated subtrees assuming that a tree is given by a set of nodes. In [2],
this complexity was mistakenly claimed to be linear in the number $m$ of edges
of the generated chordal graph. This error is corrected in [3] where the space
complexity is shown to be $\Omega(m n^{1/4})$. The exact complexity of the
algorithm is left as an open question.
  In this paper, we show that the sum of the sizes of $n$ subtrees in a tree on
$n$ nodes is $\Theta(m\sqrt{n})$. We also show that we can confine ourselves to
contraction-minimal subtree intersection representations since they are
sufficient to generate every chordal graph. Furthermore, the sum of the sizes
of the subtrees in such a representation is at most $2m+n$. We use this result
to derive the first linear time random chordal graph generator. Based on
contraction-minimal representations, we also derive structural properties of
chordal graphs related to their connectivity. In addition to these theoretical
results, we conduct experiments to study the quality of the chordal graphs
generated by our algorithm and compare them to those in the literature. Our
experimental study indicates that the generated graphs do not have a restricted
structure and the sizes of maximal cliques are distributed fairly over the
range. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple to implement and produces graphs
with 10000 vertices and $4 . 10^7$ edges in less than one second on a laptop
computer.

behaviour arises generically from the reduced microscopic dynamics of a

derive stochastic equations of motion from a microscopic Hamiltonian. In this
method stochastic terms are not identified heuristically, but instead arise
from an exact mapping only available in the path-integral formalism. The
interpretability of the individual stochastic trajectories arising from the
mapping is also discussed. As a consequence of these results, we are also able
to show that the proper classical limit of stochastic quantum dynamics
corresponds non-trivially to a generalised Langevin equation derived with the
classical influence functional. This provides a further unifying link between
open quantum systems and their classical equivalent, highlighting the utility
of influence functionals and their potential as a tool in both fundamental and

measurements along a curve transverse to the instantaneous scalar contours, are
available. Such measurements enable solving a system of partial differential
equations for the velocity components by the method of characteristics. If the
value of the scalar diffusivity is known, then knowledge of just one velocity
component along a transverse initial curve is sufficient. These conclusions
extend to the shallow-water equations and to flows with spatially dependent
diffusivity. We illustrate our results on velocity reconstruction from tracer
fields for planar Navier- Stokes flows and for a barotropic ocean circulation
model. We also discuss the use of the proposed velocity reconstruction in
oceanographic applications to extend localised velocity measurements to larger

a very low volume fraction of the shell while in the core the two components

biometrics modalities. Most of the existing gait recognition methods take
silhouettes or articulated body models as the gait features. These methods
suffer from degraded recognition performance when handling confounding
variables, such as clothing, carrying and view angle. To remedy this issue, we
propose a novel AutoEncoder framework to explicitly disentangle pose and
appearance features from RGB imagery and the LSTM-based integration of pose
features over time produces the gait feature. In addition, we collect a
Frontal-View Gait (FVG) dataset to focus on gait recognition from frontal-view
walking, which is a challenging problem since it contains minimal gait cues
compared to other views. FVG also includes other important variations, e.g.,
walking speed, carrying, and clothing. With extensive experiments on CASIA-B,
USF and FVG datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance to the state
of the arts quantitatively, the ability of feature disentanglement
qualitatively, and promising computational efficiency.

the Teukolsky system of spin $\pm2$ and spin $\pm1$ satisfied by
gauge-invariant null-decomposed curvature components, obtained in earlier

to overcome ambiguities involved in the learning process. This critically
prevents us from learning high fidelity face models which are needed to
represent face images in high level of details. To address this problem, this
paper presents a novel approach to learn additional proxies as means to
side-step strong regularizations, as well as, leverages to promote detailed

and local-based models. By improving the nonlinear 3D morphable model in both
learning objective and network architecture, we present a model which is
superior in capturing higher level of details than the linear or its precedent
nonlinear counterparts. As a result, our model achieves state-of-the-art

new Space VLBI mission concept. An initial design study of the concept has been
presented as the Event Horizon Imager (EHI). The EHI may be suitable for
imaging Sgr A* at high frequencies (up to ~690 GHz), which has significant
advantages over performing ground-based VLBI at 230 GHz. The concept EHI design
consists of two or three satellites in polar or equatorial circular
Medium-Earth Orbits with slightly different radii. Due to the relative drift of
the satellites along the individual orbits, this setup will result in a dense
spiral-shaped uv-coverage with long baselines (up to ~60 Glambda), allowing for
extremely high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging of radio sources. We
simulate EHI observations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models
of Sgr A* and calculate the expected noise based on preliminary system
parameters. On long baselines, where the signal-to-noise ratio may be low,
fringes could be detected if the system is sufficiently phase stable and the
satellite orbits can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. Averaging
visibilities accumulated over multiple epochs of observations could then help
improving the image quality. With three satellites, closure phases could be
used for imaging. Our simulations show that the EHI could be capable of imaging
the black hole shadow of Sgr A* with a resolution of 4 uas (about 8% of the
shadow diameter) within several months of observing time. The EHI concept could
thus be used to measure black hole shadows much more precisely than with
ground-based VLBI, allowing for stronger tests of general relativity and
accretion models.

quantitatively similar results to a resolved gas dynamics code, while running
approximately two orders of magnitude (in time) faster. Our multiscale model is
founded upon a new compressible-incompressible decomposition of the velocity
field $u=v+w$. The incompressible component $w$ of the velocity is also
irrotational and is solved using a new asymptotic model of the Birkhoff-Rott
singular integral formulation of the incompressible Euler equations, which
reduces the problem to one spatial dimension. This asymptotic model, called the
higher-order $z$-model, is derived using small nonlocality as the asymptotic
parameter, allows for interface turn-over and roll-up, and yields a significant
simplification for the equation describing the evolution of the amplitude of
vorticity. This incompressible component $w$ of the velocity controls the small
scale structures of the interface and can be solved efficiently on fine grids.
Meanwhile, the compressible component of the velocity $v$ remains continuous
near contact discontinuities and can be computed on relatively coarse grids,
while receiving subgrid scale information from $w$. We first validate the
incompressible higher-order $z$-model by comparison with classical RTI
experiments as well as full point vortex simulations. We then consider both the
RTI and the RMI problems for our multiscale model of compressible flow with

lattice. One band is narrow in energy and includes local Coulomb correlations
between its quasi-particles. Pairing occurs in this band due to nearest
neighbor attractive interactions. Extended s-wave, as well as d-wave symmetries
of the superconducting order parameter are considered. The correlated electrons
hybridize with those in another, wide conduction band through a k-dependent
mixing, with even or odd parity depending on the nature of the orbitals. The
many-body problem is treated within a slave-boson approach that has proved
adequate to deal with the strong electronic correlations that are assumed here.
Since applied pressure changes mostly the ratio between hybridization and
bandwidths, we can use this ratio as a control parameter to obtain the phase
diagrams of the model. We find that for a wide range of parameters, the
critical temperature increases as a function of hybridization (pressure), with
a region of first-order transitions. When frustration is introduced it gives
rise to a stable superconducting phase. We find that superconductivity can be
suppressed for specific values of band-filling due to the Coulomb repulsion. We
show how pressure, composition and strength of correlations affect the
superconductivity for different symmetries of the order parameter and the
hybridization.

indoor localization. The former work utilizes WiFi devices to recognize human
daily activities such as smoking, walking, and dancing. The latter one, indoor
localization, can be used for indoor navigation, location-based services, and
through-wall surveillance. The key rationale behind this type of work is that
people behaviors can influence the WiFi signal propagation and introduce
specific patterns into WiFi signals, called WiFi fingerprints, which can be
further explored to identify human activities and locations. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning framework for joint activity recognition and
indoor localization task using WiFi Channel State Information~(CSI)
fingerprints. More precisely, we develop a system running standard IEEE 802.11n

Gaussian distributions in the color-color diagrams. We found from the candidate
BHBs in the range of 18.5<g<23.5 mag that the radial density distribution over
a Galactocentric radius of r=36-360 kpc can be approximated as a single
power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=3.74^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ or a broken
power-law profile with an index of $\alpha_{\rm in}=2.92^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at

suggests that the MW stellar halo may consist of the two overlapping

shallow profile probed by BHBs here, which is made by accretion of small

recognition. However, matching faces with big age gaps remains a challenging
problem, primarily due to the significant discrepancy of face appearances
caused by aging. To reduce such a discrepancy, in this paper we propose a novel
algorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both
identity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature
into two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and
age-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component includes
information that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we
propose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a
Canonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find the maximum correlation
between the paired features generated by a backbone network, while the backbone
network and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing
the correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age
and identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the
identity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are respectively
supervised by ID and age preserving signals to ensure that they both contain
the correct information. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular
public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, and CACD-VS) to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

degradation. This paper proposes a novel occlusion-robust and alignment-free
model for occluded person ReID and extends its application to realistic and
crowded scenarios. The proposed model first leverages the full convolution
network (FCN) and pyramid pooling to extract spatial pyramid features. Then an
alignment-free matching approach, namely Foreground-aware Pyramid
Reconstruction (FPR), is developed to accurately compute matching scores
between occluded persons, despite their different scales and sizes. FPR uses
the error from robust reconstruction over spatial pyramid features to measure
similarities between two persons. More importantly, we design an
occlusion-sensitive foreground probability generator that focuses more on clean
human body parts to refine the similarity computation with less contamination
from occlusion. The FPR is easily embedded into any end-to-end person ReID
models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is clearly demonstrated by the
experimental results (Rank-1 accuracy) on three occluded person datasets:
Partial REID (78.30\%), Partial iLIDS (68.08\%) and Occluded REID (81.00\%);

the reconstruction limitations, many registration algorithms under perform in
the presence of the rapid intensity changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
motion correction method that reconstructs the motion free image series from
the undersampled cardiac perfusion MR data. The motion correction method uses
the novel robust principal component analysis based reconstruction along with
the periodic decomposition to separate the respiratory motion component that
can be registered, from the contrast intensity variations. It is tested on

is qualitatively assessed and compared with the existing motion correction

energetic GRB, and energy partition between the jet and wind may be
quasi-universal. Although the $P_0-E_{\rm jet}$ relation is driven by a few
sub-energetic GRBs in our sample, our Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows
that sample selection biases from instrumental flux limits and contaminations

paper proposes a dynamic saliency estimation approach for aerial videos via
spatiotemporal knowledge distillation. In this approach, five components are
involved, including two teachers, two students and the desired spatiotemporal
model. The knowledge of spatial and temporal saliency is first separately
transferred from the two complex and redundant teachers to their simple and
compact students, and the input scenes are also degraded from high-resolution
to low-resolution to remove the probable data redundancy so as to greatly speed
up the feature extraction process. After that, the desired spatiotemporal model
is further trained by distilling and encoding the spatial and temporal saliency
knowledge of two students into a unified network. In this manner, the
inter-model redundancy can be further removed for the effective estimation of
dynamic saliency on aerial videos. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art models in estimating visual saliency
on aerial videos, while its speed reaches up to 28,738 FPS on the GPU platform.

magnetic properties are linked directly to the structure of hard-to-access

when exposed to air, making a deeper probing, non-destructive, in-situ
measurement ideal for this system. We have thus applied hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (HXPS) and standing-wave (SW) HXPS in the few keV
energy range to probe the structure of an epitaxially-grown MgO/Fe
superlattice. The superlattice consists of 9 repeats of MgO grown on Fe by
magnetron sputtering on an MgO (001) substrate, with a protective Al2O3 capping
layer. We determine through SW-HXPS that 8 of the 9 repeats are similar and
ordered, with a period of 33 $\pm$ 4 angstrom, with minor presence of FeO at
the interfaces and a significantly distorted top bilayer with ca. 3 times the
oxidation of the lower layers at the top MgO/Fe interface. There is evidence of
asymmetrical oxidation on the top and bottom of the Fe layers. We find
agreement with dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and
x-ray reflectivity measurements. Through the STEM measurements we confirm an
overall epitaxial stack with dislocations and warping at the interfaces of ca.
5 angstrom. We also note a distinct difference in the top bilayer, especially
MgO, with possible Fe inclusions. We thus demonstrate that SW-HXPS can be used

evaluation of a multipartite state is in general a very challenging task owing
to the exponential increase of the Hilbert space with respect to the number of
system components. In this work, we propose a systematic method using very few
local measurements to detect multipartite entanglement structures based on the
graph state --- one of the most important classes of quantum states for quantum
information processing. Thanks to the close connection between the Schmidt
coefficient and quantum entropy in graph states, we develop a family of
efficient witness operators to detect the entanglement between subsystems under
any partitions and hence the entanglement intactness. We show that the number
of local measurements equals to the chromatic number of the underlying graph,
which is a constant number, independent of the number of qubits. In reality,
the optimization problem involved in the witnesses can be challenging with
large system size. For several widely-used graph states, such as 1-D and 2-D
cluster states and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, by taking advantage
of the area law of entanglement entropy, we derive analytical solutions for the
witnesses, which only employ two local measurements. Our method offers a

original four constant parameters in the traditional equations are
time-dependent. In the first place, we assumed that the human population
(borrowed from the T-Function) plays the role as the prey while all lethal
factors that jeopardize the existence of the human race as the predator.
Although we could still calculate the time-dependent lethal function, the idea
of treating the lethal factors as the prey was too general to recognize the
meaning of them. Hence, in the second part of the modified Lotka-Volterra
Equations, we exchanged the roles between the prey and the predator. This time,
we treated the prey as the natural resources while the predator as the human
population (still borrowed from the T-Function). After carefully choosing
appropriate parameters to match the maximum carrying capacity with the
saturated number of the human population predicted by the T-Function, we
successfully calculated the natural resources as a function of time. Contrary
to our intuition, the carrying capacity is constant over time rather than a
time-varying function, with the constant value of 10.2 billion people.

that predict the class label of a node and the class label of a graph
respectively. A node of a graph usually represents a real-world entity, e.g., a
user in a social network, or a protein in a protein-protein interaction
network. In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful
setting, in which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a
hierarchical graph perspective which arises in many domains such as social
network, biological network and document collection. For example, in a social
network, a group of people with shared interests forms a user group, whereas a
number of user groups are interconnected via interactions or common members. We
study the node classification problem in the hierarchical graph where a `node'
is a graph instance, e.g., a user group in the above example. As labels are
usually limited in real-world data, we design two novel semi-supervised
solutions named \underline{SE}mi-supervised gr\underline{A}ph
c\underline{L}assification via \underline{C}autious/\underline{A}ctive
\underline{I}teration (or SEAL-C/AI in short). SEAL-C/AI adopt an iterative
framework that takes turns to build or update two classifiers, one working at
the graph instance level and the other at the hierarchical graph level. To
simplify the representation of the hierarchical graph, we propose a novel
supervised, self-attentive graph embedding method called SAGE, which embeds
graph instances of arbitrary size into fixed-length vectors. Through
experiments on synthetic data and Tencent QQ group data, we demonstrate that
SEAL-C/AI not only outperform competing methods by a significant margin in
terms of accuracy/Macro-F1, but also generate meaningful interpretations of the
learned representations.

Crucially, the total cross-section in our Single Parton Scattering model

  Information","Accepted for IEEE TIP",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the promising progress made in recent years, person re-identification
remains a challenging task due to complex variations in human appearances from
different camera views. This paper presents a logistic discriminant metric
learning method for this challenging problem. Different with most existing
metric learning algorithms, it exploits both original data and auxiliary data
during training, which is motivated by the new machine learning paradigm -
Learning Using Privileged Information. Such privileged information is a kind of
auxiliary knowledge which is only available during training. Our goal is to
learn an optimal distance function by constructing a locally adaptive decision
rule with the help of privileged information. We jointly learn two distance
metrics by minimizing the empirical loss penalizing the difference between the
distance in the original space and that in the privileged space. In our
setting, the distance in the privileged space functions as a local decision
threshold, which guides the decision making in the original space like a
teacher. The metric learned from the original space is used to compute the
distance between a probe image and a gallery image during testing. In addition,
we extend the proposed approach to a multi-view setting which is able to
explore the complementation of multiple feature representations. In the
multi-view setting, multiple metrics corresponding to different original
features are jointly learned, guided by the same privileged information.
Besides, an effective iterative optimization scheme is introduced to
simultaneously optimize the metrics and the assigned metric weights. Experiment
results on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
is superior to global decision threshold based methods and outperforms most
state-of-the-art results.

detect and block attacks by monitoring the known behaviors such as frequent
name changes, recurring access to cryptographic libraries and exchange keys
with remote servers. Unfortunately, intelligent ransomware can easily bypass
these techniques. Another prevention technique is to recover from the backup
copy when a file is infected with ransomware. However, the data backup
technique requires extra storage space and can be removed with ransomware. In
this paper, we propose to implement an access control mechanism on a disk
drive, called a KEY-SSD disk drive. KEY-SSD is the data store and the last
barrier to data protection. Unauthorized applications will not be able to read
file data even if they bypass the file system defense, thus denying the block
request without knowing the disk's registered block key and completely
eliminating the possibility of the file becoming hostage to ransomware. We have
prototyped KEY-SSD and validated the usefulness of KEY-SSD by demonstrating 1)
selective block access control, 2) unauthorized data access blocking and 3)
negligible performance overhead. Our comprehensive evaluation of KEY-SSD for
various workloads show the KEY-SSD performance is hardly degraded due to OS
lightweight key transmission and access control drive optimization. We also
confirmed that KEY-SSD successfully protects the files in the actual ransomware

typical granular materials in which the deviatoric stress remains nearly
constant with increasing strain after reaching a peak value. Interestingly,
long fibers exhibit a hardening behavior, where the stress increases rapidly
with increasing strain at large strains and the packing density continuously
increases. Phase diagrams for classifying the bulk mechanical response as
yielding, hardening, or a transition regime are generated as a function of the
fiber aspect ratio, fiber-fiber friction coefficient, and confining pressure.
Large fiber aspect ratio, large fiber-fiber friction coefficient, and large
confining pressure promote hardening behavior. The hardening packings can
support much larger loads than the yielding packings contributing to the
stability and consolidation of the granular structure, but larger internal
axial forces occur within fibers.

demonstrate this in the context of stabilization of a laboratory-scale inverted
pendulum around its equilibrium point over a digital communication channel with
bounded unknown delay. Our event-triggering control strategy encodes timing
information by transmitting in a state-dependent fashion and can achieve
stabilization using a data payload transmission rate lower than what the
data-rate theorem prescribes for classical periodic control policies that do
not exploit timing information. Through experimental results, we show that as
the delay in the communication channel increases, a higher data payload
transmission rate is required to fulfill the proposed event-triggering policy
requirements. This confirms the theoretical intuition that a larger delay
brings a larger uncertainty about the value of the state at the controller, as
less timing information is carried in the communication. In addition, our
results also provide a novel encoding-decoding scheme to achieve input-to-state
practically stability (ISpS) for nonlinear continuous-time systems under

of the uterus recorded by electrohysterography (EHG), from abdominal electrodes
(a grid of 4x4 electrodes) during pregnancy and labor. We evaluate the
potential use of the synchronization between EHG signals in characterizing
electrical activity of the uterus during pregnancy and labor. The complete
processing pipeline consists of i) estimating the correlation between the
different EHG signals, ii) quantifying the connectivity matrices using graph
theory-based analysis and iii) testing the clinical impact of network measures
in pregnancy monitoring and labor detection. We first compared several
connectivity methods to compute the adjacency matrix represented as a graph of
a set of nodes (electrodes) connected by edges (connectivity values). We then
evaluated the performance of different graph measures in the classification of
pregnancy and labor contractions (number of women=35). A comparison with the
already existing parameters used in the state of the art of labor detection and
preterm labor prediction was also performed. Results show higher performance of
connectivity methods when combined with network measures. Denser graphs were
observed during labor than during pregnancy. The network-based metrics showed
the highest classification rate when compared to already existing features.
This network-based approach can be used not only to characterize the
propagation of the uterine contractions, but also may have high clinical impact
in labor detection and likely in the prediction of premature labor.

at 100 times lower temperatures. This challenge has not been addressed up to
now, due to the demanding experimental requirement on fast and sensitive
thermometry on a mesoscopic absorber. Here we observe equilibrium fluctuations
of temperature in a canonical system of about 10^8 electrons exchanging energy
with phonon bath at a fixed temperature. Moreover, temperature fluctuations
under nonequilibrium conditions present a nontrivial dependence on the chemical
potential bias of a hot electron source. These fundamental fluctuations of T
set the ultimate lower bound of the energy resolution of a calorimeter.

over time. We aimed at both identifying night-sleep duration (NSD) trajectories
among preschoolers and studying associated factors. Methods. NSD were collected
within the French birth-cohort study EDEN at ages 2, 3 and 5-6 years through
parental questionnaires, and were used to model NSD trajectories among 1205
children. Familial socioeconomic factors, maternal sociodemographic, health and
lifestyle characteristics as well as child health, lifestyle, and sleep
characteristics at birth and/or at age 2 years were investigated in association
with NSD using multinomial logistic regressions. Results. Five distinct NSD
trajectories were identified: short (SS, <10h, 4.9%), medium-low (MLS, <11h,
47.8%), medium-high (MHS, $\approx$11h30, 37.2%), long (LS, $\ge$11h30, 4.5%)
and changing (CS, i.e. $\ge$11h30 then <11h, 5.6%) NSD trajectories.
Multivariable analyses showed in particular that, compared to the MHS
trajectory, factors associated with increased risk for belonging to SS
trajectory were male gender, first child, maternal age and working status,
night-waking, parental presence when falling asleep, television-viewing
duration and both the `Processed and fast foods' and the `Baby food' dietary
patterns at age 2 years. Factors positively associated with the CS trajectory
were maternal smoking, bottle-feeding at night and the `Processed and fast
foods' dietary pattern at age 2 years whereas child's activity and emotionality
scores at age 1 year were negatively associated. Conclusion. We identified
distinct NSD trajectories among preschoolers and associated early life factors.
Some of them may reflect less healthy lifestyle, providing cues for early
multi-behavioral prevention interventions

image-level class labels as supervision. Our approach generates pseudo instance
segmentation labels of training images, which are used to train a fully
supervised model. For generating the pseudo labels, we first identify confident
seed areas of object classes from attention maps of an image classification
model, and propagate them to discover the entire instance areas with accurate
boundaries. To this end, we propose IRNet, which estimates rough areas of
individual instances and detects boundaries between different object classes.
It thus enables to assign instance labels to the seeds and to propagate them
within the boundaries so that the entire areas of instances can be estimated
accurately. Furthermore, IRNet is trained with inter-pixel relations on the
attention maps, thus no extra supervision is required. Our method with IRNet
achieves an outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing
not only previous state-of-the-art trained with the same level of supervision,
but also some of previous models relying on stronger supervision.

rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised

FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several
relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in
FSL is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior
knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from
three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the
supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the
size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge
to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With
this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category.
Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques,

The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the
atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these
components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the
image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by
a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the
two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do
not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement
stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed

by that stage. We have evaluated our method against the state of the art

However, their representation has been weakened because of the adoption of

which can be considered as the `centre' of a complex network. In fact, this
problem corresponds to finding the median of a complex network. The median is a
non-parametric and robust estimator of the location parameter of a probability
distribution. In this work, we present the most natural generalisation of the
concept of median to the realm of complex networks, discussing its advantages
for defining the centre of the system and percentiles around that centre. To
this aim, we introduce a new statistical data depth and we apply it to networks
embedded in a geometric space induced by different metrics. The application of
our framework to empirical networks allows us to identify median nodes which

spin-orbit split-off band near the valence band maximum exhibits a strong
topologically non-trivial behavior characterized by the $\mathcal{Z}_2$

non-zero spin-orbit coupling, in contrast to the conventional topological phase
transition mechanism. \textit{Ab initio}-based tight-binding calculations
resolve topological surface states in the occupied electronic structure of InSb

Associations between 25OHD and sleep trajectories were assessed by multinomial

The trajectories short sleep (<10h30/night), medium-low sleep

respectively. On adjusted analysis, for each 1-ng/ml decrease in 25OHD level,
the odds of belonging to the short sleep versus medium-high sleep trajectory
was increased (odds ratio =1.12, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.25]). We found
no other significant association between 25OHD level and other

increased probability of being a persistent short sleeper in preschool years.

subject of intensive experimental investigation and modeling, as it provides
important insights into the molecular origin of the empirical rate and state
laws, which have been highly successful in describing friction from nano to
geophysical scales. Using previously developed theoretical approaches requires
time-consuming simulations that are impractical for many realistic tribological
systems. To solve this problem and set a framework for understanding
microscopic mechanisms of friction at interfaces including multiple microscopic
contacts, we developed an analytical approach for description of friction
mediated by dynamical formation and rupture of microscopic interfacial
contacts, which allows to calculate frictional properties on the time and
length scales that are relevant to tribological experimental conditions. The
model accounts for the presence of various types of contacts at the frictional
interface and predicts novel dependencies of friction on sliding velocity,
temperature, and normal load, which are amenable to experimental observations.
Our model predicts the velocity-temperature scaling, which relies on the
interplay between the effects of shear and temperature on the rupture of
interfacial contacts. The proposed scaling can be used to extrapolate the
simulation results to a range of very low sliding velocities used in nanoscale
friction experiments, which is still unreachable by simulations. For interfaces
including two types of interfacial contacts with distinct properties, our model
predicts novel double-peaked dependencies of friction on temperature and
velocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for the interpretation of the
experimental data on friction at interfaces including microscopic contacts and
opens new pathways for the rational control of the frictional response.

equations of state which should be consistent with QCD calculations in the low
and high density limits, nuclear laboratory experiments, and the neutron star
observations. These constraints, together with the causality condition of the
sound velocity, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in
which hadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter (modulo small
1st order phase transitions). For hadronic matter (at baryon density nB > ~2n0
with n0 ~ 0.16 fm^(-3) being the nuclear saturation density) we use equations
of state by Togashi et al. based on microscopic variational many-body
calculations, and for quark matter (nB > ~5n0) we construct equations of state
using a schematic quark model (with strangeness) whose interactions are
motivated by the hadron phenomenology. The region between hadronic and quark
matters (~2n0 < nB < ~5n0), which is most difficult to calculate, is treated by
highly constrained interpolation between nuclear and quark matter equations of
state. The resultant unified equation of state at zero temperature and
beta-equilibrium, which we call Quark-Hadron-Crossover (QHC18 and QHC19), is
consistent with the measured properties of neutron stars and in addition gives
us microscopic insights into the properties of dense QCD matter. In particular
to ~10n0 the gluons can remain as non-perturbative as in vacuum and the
strangeness can be as abundant as up- and down-quarks at the core of two-solar
mass neutron stars. Within our modeling the maximum mass is found less than
~2.35 times solar mass and the baryon density at the core ranges in ~5-8n0.

very effective in visualizing and analyzing big and heterogeneous data. Indeed,
topology provides computable and coarse summaries of data independently from
specific coordinate systems and does so robustly to noise. Moreover, the
geometric content of a discrete gradient vector field is very useful for
visualization purposes. The specific case of multivariate data still demands
for further investigations, on the one hand, for computational reasons, it is
important to reduce the necessary amount of data to be processed. On the other
hand, for analysis reasons, the multivariate case requires the detection and
interpretation of the possible interdepedance among data components. To this
end, in this paper we introduce and study a notion of perfectness for discrete
gradient vector fields with respect to multi-parameter persistent homology,
called relative-perfectness. As a natural generalization of usual perfectness
in Morse theory for homology, relative-perfectness entails having the least
number of critical cells relevant for multi-parameter persistence. As a first
contribution, we support our definition of relative-perfectness by generalizing
Morse inequalities to the filtration structure where homology groups involved
are relative with respect to subsequent sublevel sets. In order to allow for an
interpretation of critical cells in $2$-parameter persistence, our second
contribution consists of two inequalities bounding Betti tables of persistence
modules from above and below, via the number of critical cells. Our last result
is the proof that existing algorithms based on local homotopy expansions allow
for efficient computability over simplicial complexes up to dimension $2$.

aspect of choir singing. Performance evaluation as well as auditory analysis of
singing, whether individually or in a choir, often depend on extracting f0
contours for the singing voice. However, due to the large number of singers,
singing at a similar frequency range, extracting the exact individual pitch
contours from choir recordings is a challenging task. In this paper, we address
this task and develop a methodology for modeling pitch contours of SATB choir
recordings. A typical SATB choir consists of four parts, each covering a
distinct range of pitches and often with multiple singers each. We first
evaluate some state-of-the-art multi-f0 estimation systems for the particular
case of choirs with a single singer per part, and observe that the pitch of
individual singers can be estimated to a relatively high degree of accuracy. We
observe, however, that the scenario of multiple singers for each choir part
(i.e. unison singing) is far more challenging. In this work we propose a
methodology based on combining a multi-f0 estimation methodology based on deep
learning followed by a set of traditional DSP techniques to model f0 and its
dispersion instead of a single f0 trajectory for each choir part. We present
and discuss our observations and test our framework with different singer
configurations.

butterfly. For fillings at which the system is a band insulator one observes a
quantized integer-valued Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ corresponding to a
topological invariant, the first Chern number $\mathcal{C}_1$. This is robust
against many-body interactions as long as no changes in the gap structure
occur. Strictly speaking, this stability holds only at zero temperatures $T$
while for $T>0$ correlation effects have to be taken into account. In this
work, we address this question by presenting a dynamical mean field theory
(DMFT) study of the Hubbard model in a uniform magnetic field. The inclusion of
local correlations at finite temperature leads to (i) a shrinking of the
integer plateaus of $\sigma_{xy}$ as a function of the chemical potential and
(ii) eventually to a deviation from these integer values. We demonstrate that
these effects can be related to a correlation-driven narrowing and filling of
the band gap, respectively.

that of the effects of rapid rotation. For massive stars, rapid rotation
combines with their strong radiation-driven wind. The aim of this paper is to
investigate two questions that are prerequisite to the study of the evolution
of massive rapidly rotating stars: (i) What is the critical angular velocity of
a star when radiative acceleration is significant in its atmosphere? (ii) How
do mass and angular momentum loss depend on the rotation rate? To investigate
fast rotation, which makes stars oblate, we used the 2D ESTER models and a
simplified approach, the $\omega$-model, which gives the latitudinal dependence
of the radiative flux in a centrifugally flattened radiative envelope. We find
that radiative acceleration only mildly influences the critical angular
velocity, at least for stars with masses lower than 40 Msun. We explain this
mild reduction of the critical angular velocity compared to the classical
Keplerian angular velocity by the combined effects of gravity darkening and a
reduced equatorial opacity that is due to the centrifugal acceleration. To
answer the second question, we first devised a model of the local surface mass
flux, which we calibrated with previously developed 1D models. The
discontinuity (the so-called bi-stability jump) included in the $\dot{M}-T_{\rm
eff}$ relation of 1D models means that the mass flux of a fast-rotating star is
controlled by either a single wind or a two-wind regime. Mass and angular
momentum losses are strong around the equator if the star is in the two-wind
regime. We also show that the difficulty of selecting massive stars that are
viewed pole-on makes detecting the discontinuity in the relation between mass
loss and effective temperature also quite challenging.

current system, the proposed system has a 6-DOF, and it provides enough

high enough payload to add the 2-link manipulator is constructed. Its
parameters are identified to be used in the simulation and controller design. A
CAD model is developed to calculate the mass and moments of inertia in an
accurate way. Direct relationships between Pulse Width Modulation and each of
the angular speeds, thrust forces, and drag moments of the rotors are
identified. A Direction Cosine Matrix complementary filter is used to estimate
the attitude of the quadrotor using the IMU measurements. Attitude
stabilization controller is designed based on feedback linearization technique
to test the identified parameters and the attitude estimation. The results of
the experiments show satisfactory accuracy of the identified structure
parameters, the identified rotor assembly parameters, and the attitude
estimation algorithm. A controller for the proposed system is designed based on
three control techniques: feedback linearization based PID control, direct
fuzzy logic control, and fuzzy model reference learning control. These
controllers are tested to provide system stability and trajectory tracking
under the effect of picking and placing a payload and the effect of changing

double perovskites have been explored based on density functional theory (DFT).
The calculated structural parameters fairly agree with the experimental data to
confirm their stability. The mechanical stability of these two compounds was
clearly observed by the Born stability criteria. To rationalize the mechanical
behavior, we investigate elastic constants, bulk, shear and Young's modulus,
Pugh's ratio, Poisson's ratio and elastic anisotropy index. The ductility index
confirms that both materials are ductile in nature. The electronic band
structure of CPTO and CPVO reveals the direct band gap semiconducting in nature
and metallic characteristics, respectively. The calculated partial density of
states indicates the strong hybridization between Pd 4d and O 2p orbital
electrons for CPTO and Pd 4d and V 3d O 2p for CPVO. The study of electronic
charge density map confirms the coexistence of covalent, ionic and metallic
bonding for both compounds. Fermi surface calculation of CPVO ensures both
electron and hole like surfaces indicating the multiple band nature. In the
midst of optical properties, photoconductivity and absorption coefficient of
both compounds reveal well qualitative compliance with consequences of band
structure computations. Among the thermodynamic properties, the Debye
temperature has been calculated to correlate its topical features including
thermoelectric behavior. The studied thermoelectric transport properties of
CPTO yielded the Seebeck coefficient (186 microVK-1), power factor (11.9
microWcm-1K-2) and figure of merit (ZT) value of about 0.8 at 800 K indicate
that this material could be a promising candidate for thermoelectric device
application.

adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between distributions of

the loss of rich information contained in the whole network pipeline. Inspired
by the assumption that, the small network can not perfectly mimic a large one

involving effective intermediate supervision, under the adversarial training
framework to learn the student network. To achieve powerful but highly compact
intermediate information representation, the squeezed knowledge is realized by
task-driven attention mechanism. Then, the transferred knowledge from teacher

proposed method integrates merits from both process-oriented and

the famous ensemble Kalman filter, the assumption of a linear-Gaussian state
space model is introduced in order to overcome this issue, and the prior
ensemble is updated with a linear shift closely related to the traditional
Kalman filter equations. In the current article, we consider how the ideas
underlying the ensemble Kalman filter can be applied when the components of the

Gaussian approximations of the forecast and filtering distributions, we instead
use first order Markov chains. To update the prior ensemble, we simulate
samples from a distribution constructed such that the expected number of equal

the performance of our approach in a simulation example inspired by the
movement of oil and water in a petroleum reservoir, where also a more na\""{i}ve

important. In this paper we compute the growth rate of this instability for two
types of the electron distribution: a) for the power-law distribution and b)
for the kappa distribution, in the both cases with the loss-cone type
anisotropy. We found that the growth rate of the upper-hybrid waves for the
power-law momentum distribution strongly depends on the pitch-angle boundary.
The maximum growth rate was found for the pitch-angle $\theta_\mathrm{c}
\approx$ 50$^\circ$. For small angles the growth rate profile is very flat and
for high pitch-angles the wave absorption occurs. Furthermore, analyzing the
growth rate of the upper hybrid waves for the kappa momentum distribution we
found that a decrease of the characteristic momentum $p_\kappa$ shifts the
maximum of the growth rate to lower values of the ratio of the electron-plasma
and electron-cyclotron frequencies, and the frequency widths of the growth rate
peaks are very broad. But, if we consider the kappa distribution which is
isotropic up to some large momentum $p_m$ and anisotropic with loss-cone above
this momentum then distinct peaks of the growth rate appear and thus distinct
zebra stripes can be generated. It means that the restriction for small momenta
for the anisotropic part of distributions is of principal importance for the
zebra stripes generation. Finally, for the 1 August 2010 zebra stripes, the
growth rates in dependence on radio frequency were computed. It was shown that
in this case the growth rate peaks are more distinct than in usually presented
dependencies of growth rates on the ratio of the plasma and cyclotron

two reversal modes with well-differentiated coercivities with probabilities
that depend on the tube length and radius. This variety in the reversal modes
is found to be linked to the metastability of the $H$ states during the
reversal that induce different paths followed along the energy landscape as the
field is changed. We further demonstrate that reversal by either of the two
modes can be induced by tailoring the nanotube initial state so that vortices
with equal or contrary chirality are formed at the ends, thus achieving low or
high coercive fields at will without changing $\gamma$. Finally, the results of
additional micromagnetic simulations performed on tubes with similar aspect
ratio show that dual switching modes and its tailoring can also be observed in
tubes with more microscopic dimensions.

plasma-assisted active nitrogen-radical source are promising candidates of
next-generation semiconductors for light-emitting diodes and solar cells. This
nitride compound has previously only been synthesized in a bulk form by
ultrahigh-pressure synthesis at 5 GPa. Three key factors have been found to
enable heteroepitaxial film growth: (i) precise tuning of the individual flux
rates of Ca and Zn, (ii) the use of GaN template layers on sapphire c-plane as
substrates, and (iii) the application of MBE with an active N-radical source.
Because other attempts at physical vapor deposition and thermal annealing
processes have not produced CaZn2N2 films of any phase, this rf-plasma-assisted
MBE technique represents a promising way to stabilize CaZn2N2 epitaxial films.
The estimated optical band gap is ~1.9 eV, which is consistent with the value
obtained from bulk samples. By unintentional carrier doping, n- and p-type
electronic conductions are attained with low carrier densities of the order of
1013 /cm3. These features represent clear advantages when compared with
Zn-based oxide semiconductors, which usually have much higher carrier densities
irrespective of their intentionally undoped state. The carrier mobilities at
room temperature are 4.3 cm2/(Vs) for electrons and 0.3 cm2/(Vs) for hole
carriers, which indicates that transport properties are limited by grain
boundary scattering, mainly because of the low-temperature growth at 250
{\deg}C, which realizes a high nitrogen chemical potential.

the external reaction of bots to commands. The results of our simulations show

During the M5.8 class flare, many vortex-like structures occurred in the
upstream and downstream regimes of the associated jet. While the jet was
ejected upwards to the corona, some dark material at its base flowed through a
bright structure with a velocity of 110 km/s. The boundary between the material
and the structure changed from smooth to uneven. Later, the jet material at the
higher atmosphere started to fall down with velocities of over 200 km/s, and
the left boundary of the jet developed into a sawtooth pattern. The vortex-like
structures were formed, and the growth rates of two structures were presented.
During the M5.5 class flare, we also observed many vortex-like structures in
the downstream regime of the jet. At the late stage of the jet, some material
at the south boundary of the jet fell back to the solar surface, and
vortex-like structures at the boundary grew from ripple-like minim into
vortices with diameters of 3.4-5.4 Mm. The growth rates of the vortex-like

formulate the state, action, and the reward such as to let the critic model

the mass-accretion rate of CO WD is higher than a critical rate (about 2 *

studies usually supposed that the off-centre carbon flame would reach the
centre, resulting in the formation of an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD that will
collapse into a neutron star. However, the process of off-centre carbon burning
is not well studied. This may result in some uncertainties on the final fates
of CO WDs. By employing MESA, we simulated the long-term evolution of
off-centre carbon burning in He-accreting CO WDs. We found that the inwardly

ONe cores owing to the high temperature of the burning front. We suggest that
the final fates of the CO WDs may be OSi WDs under the conditions of off-centre
carbon burning, or explode as iron-core-collapse SNe if the mass-accretion
continues. We also found that the mass-fractions of silicon in the OSi cores

the model predictions on the gross behaviour of measurable air shower
parameters in the energy (0.1-100 TeV) and altitude ranges most appropriate for
detection by ground-based gamma-ray observatories. We go on to investigate the
particle distributions just after the first interaction point, to examine how
differences in the micro-physics of the models may compound into differences in
the gross air shower behaviour. Differences between the models above 1 TeV are
typically less than 10%. However, we find the largest variation in particle
densities at ground at the lowest energy tested (100 GeV), resulting from
striking differences in the early stages of shower development.

weak interlayer bonding with van der Waals forces for a range of thickness from
nano to macroscale. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of the effect of
layer thickness on the compression behavior of graphitic materials such as
graphene which are fully embedded in polymer matrices. Raman Spectroscopy was
employed to identify experimentally the critical strain to failure of the
graphitic specimens. The most striking finding is that, contrary to what would
be expected from Eulerian mechanics, the critical compressive strain to failure
decreases with increase of flake thickness. This is due to the layered
structure of the material and in particular the weak cohesive forces that hold
the layers together. The plate phenomenology breaks down for the case of
multi-layer graphene, which can be approached as discrete single layers weakly
bonded to each other. This behavior is modelled here by considering the
interlayer bonding (van der Waals forces) as springs in series, and very good
agreement was found between theory and experiment. Finally, it will be shown
that in the post failure regime multi-layer graphenes exhibit negative
stiffness and thus behave as mechanical metamaterials.

Its high-energy gamma-ray emission has been detected with the Fermi-LAT

  Observations of PKS 1830-211 were taken with the H.E.S.S. array of Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes in August 2014, following a flare alert by the
Fermi- LAT collaboration. The H.E.S.S observations were aimed at detecting a
gamma-ray flare delayed by 20-27 days from the alert flare, as expected from
observations at other wavelengths.
  More than twelve hours of good quality data were taken with an analysis
threshold of $\sim67$ GeV. The significance of a potential signal is computed
as a function of the date as well as the average significance over the whole
period. Data are compared to simultaneous observations by Fermi-LAT.
  No photon excess or significant signal is detected. An upper limit on PKS

reaction data below the Coulomb barrier have still raised questions about the
alpha-particle optical model potential (OMP) within various mass ranges, i.e.
for 64Zn, 108Cd, 113,115In, 121,123Sb, and 191,193Ir target nuclei. Purpose:
The accuracy as well as eventual uncertainties and/or systematic errors of
using a previous optical potential are much better considered by analysis of
such accurate data. Method: Statistical model (SM) calculations of the
(alpha,x) reaction cross sections have been carried out using model parameters
which were previously obtained by analyzing independent data, particularly
gamma-ray strength functions, and taking into account their uncertainties and
questions of extrapolation for nuclei without similar data. Results: Consistent
description of the recent alpha-induced reaction data is provided by the
above-mentioned optical potential with no empirical rescaling factors of either
its own parameters or the gamma and/or nucleon widths. Effects of still
uncertain SM parameters on calculated alpha-induced reaction cross sections and
conclusions on the alpha-OMP can be now discussed due to unprecedented
precision of the new data. Conclusions: The alpha-particle optical potential
has been confirmed at incident energies below the Coulomb barrier using
statistical-model parameters validated through a former analysis of independent
data.

has a net flux (i.e. the distribution of the fast ions is anisotropic in
velocity space) the electron distribution function is significantly perturbed
from Maxwellian by collisions with the fast ions, even if the fast ion density
is orders of magnitude smaller than the electron density. The Fokker-Planck
model is used to derive classical electron transport equations (a generalized
Ohm's law and a heat flow equation) that include the effects of the
electron-fast ion collisions. It is found that these collisions result in a
current term in the transport equations which can be significant even when

practical recognition system must classify among majority and minority classes,
generalize from a few known instances, and acknowledge novelty upon a never
seen instance. We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition (OLTR) as learning from
such naturally distributed data and optimizing the classification accuracy over
a balanced test set which include head, tail, and open classes. OLTR must
handle imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, and open-set recognition
in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing classification approaches focus
only on one aspect and deliver poorly over the entire class spectrum. The key
challenges are how to share visual knowledge between head and tail classes and
how to reduce confusion between tail and open classes. We develop an integrated
OLTR algorithm that maps an image to a feature space such that visual concepts
can easily relate to each other based on a learned metric that respects the
closed-world classification while acknowledging the novelty of the open world.
Our so-called dynamic meta-embedding combines a direct image feature and an

  MULTIMEDIA NETWORKS (IEEE WOWMOM 2019)",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Visible Light Ad Hoc Networks (LANETs) is being perceived as an emerging
technology to complement Radio Frequency (RF) based ad hoc networks to reduce
congestion in the overloaded RF spectrum. LANET is intended to support
scenarios requiring dense deployment and high data rates. In Visible Light
Communication (VLC), most of the attention has been centered around physical
layer with emphasis on point-to-point communication. In this work, we focus on
designing a routing protocol specifically to overcome the unique challenges
like blockage and deafness that render routes in LANETs highly unstable.
Therefore, we propose a cross-layer optimized routing protocol (VL-ROUTE) that
interacts closely with the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to maximize the
throughput of the network by taking into account the reliability of routes.
  To accomplish this in a distributed manner, we carefully formulate a Route
Reliability Score (RRS) that can be computed by each node in the network using
just the information gathered from its immediate neighbors. Each node computes
an RRS for every known sink in the network. RRS of a given node can be
considered as an estimate of the probability of reaching a given sink via that
node. The RSS value is then integrated to the utility based three-way handshake
process used by the MAC protocol (VL-MAC) to mitigate the effects of deafness,
blockage, hidden node, and maximize the probability of establishing full-duplex
links. All these factors contribute towards maximizing the network throughput.
Extensive simulation of VL-ROUTE shows 124% improvement in network throughput
over a network that uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance
(CSMA/CA) along with shortest path routing. Additionally, VL-ROUTE also showed
up to 21% improvement in throughput over the network that uses VL-MAC along
with a geographic routing.

stellar populations. In previous papers of this series we have introduced a
pseudo two-color diagram, ""chromosome map"" (ChM), that maximises the separation
between the multiple populations. We have identified two main classes of GCs:
Type I (~83% of the objects) and Type II, both hosting two main groups of
stars, referred to in this series as first (1G) and second generation (2G).
Type II clusters exhibit two or more parallel sequences of 1G and 2G stars in
their ChMs. We exploit elemental abundances from literature to assign the
chemical composition to the distinct populations as identified on the ChMs of
29 GCs. We find that stars in different regions of the ChM have different
composition: 1G stars share the same light-element content as field stars,
while 2G stars are enhanced in N, Na and depleted in O. Stars enhanced in Al
and depleted in Mg populate the extreme regions of the ChM. We investigate the
color spread among 1G stars observed in many GCs, and find no evidence for
variations in light elements, whereas either a 0.1 dex Fe spread or a variation
in He remain to be verified. In the attempt of analysing the global properties
of the multiple populations, we have constructed a universal ChM, which
highlights that, though variegate, the phenomenon has some common pattern. The
universal ChM reveals a tight connection with Na, for which we have provided an
empirical relation. The additional ChM sequences typical of Type II GCs are
enhanced in metallicity and, often, in s elements. Omega Cen can be classified
as an extreme Type II GC, with a ChM displaying three main streams, each with
its own variations in chemical abundances. One of the most noticeable
differences is between the lower and upper streams, with the latter (associated
with higher He) having higher Fe and lower Li. We publicly release ChMs.

examples. These are examples that have undergone small, carefully crafted
perturbations, and which can easily fool a DNN into making misclassifications
at test time. Thus far, the field of adversarial research has mainly focused on
image models, under either a white-box setting, where an adversary has full
access to model parameters, or a black-box setting where an adversary can only
query the target model for probabilities or labels. Whilst several white-box
attacks have been proposed for video models, black-box video attacks are still
unexplored. To close this gap, we propose the first black-box video attack
framework, called V-BAD. V-BAD utilizes tentative perturbations transferred
from image models, and partition-based rectifications found by the NES on
partitions (patches) of tentative perturbations, to obtain good adversarial
gradient estimates with fewer queries to the target model. V-BAD is equivalent
to estimating the projection of an adversarial gradient on a selected subspace.
Using three benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that V-BAD can craft both
untargeted and targeted attacks to fool two state-of-the-art deep video
recognition models. For the targeted attack, it achieves $>$93\% success rate
using only an average of $3.4 \sim 8.4 \times 10^4$ queries, a similar number
of queries to state-of-the-art black-box image attacks. This is despite the
fact that videos often have two orders of magnitude higher dimensionality than
static images. We believe that V-BAD is a promising new tool to evaluate and
improve the robustness of video recognition models to black-box adversarial
attacks.

image based registration, assist brain shift compensation, and provides
interventional decision support, the task of segmenting grey and white matter
in cranial ultrasound is very challenging and has not been addressed yet. We
train a multi-scale fully convolutional neural network simultaneously for two
classes in order to segment real clinical 3D ultrasound data. Parallel pathways
working at different levels of resolution account for high frequency speckle
noise and global 3D image features. To ensure reproducibility, the publicly
available RESECT dataset is utilized for training and cross-validation. Due to
the absence of a ground truth, we train with weakly annotated label. We
implement label transfer from MRI to US, which is prone to a residual but
inevitable registration error. To further improve results, we perform transfer
learning using synthetic US data. The resulting method leads to excellent Dice
scores of 0.7080, 0.8402 and 0.9315 for grey matter, white matter and
background. Our proposed methodology sets an unparalleled standard for white
and grey matter segmentation in 3D intracranial ultrasound.

the bulk of a type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) by use of the variational wave
function method. We consider a type-II WSM model with two Weyl nodes located on
the $k_z$-axis, and the tilting of the Weyl cones are along the $k_x$
direction. Due to co-existing electron and hole pockets, the density of states
at the Fermi energy becomes finite, leading to a significant enhancement of
Kondo effect. Consequently, the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons
always form a bound state, this behavior is distinct from that in the type-I
WSMs, where the bound state is only formed when the hybridization exceeds a
critical value. Meanwhile, the spin-orbit coupling and unique geometry of the
Fermi surface lead to strongly anisotropic Kondo screening cloud in coordinate
space. The tilting terms break the rotational symmetry of the type-II WSM about
the $k_z$-axis, but the system remains invariant under a combined
transformation $\mathcal{T}R^{y}(\pi)$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the
time-reversal operation and $R^{y}(\pi)$ is the rotation about the $y$-axis by
$\pi$. Largely modified diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin-spin
correlation function on three principal planes reflect this change in band
symmetry. Most saliently, the tilting terms trigger the emergence of non-zero
off-diagonal components of spin-spin correlation function on the $x$-$z$
principal plane.

readily-generalisable computational methods to systematically survey three key
wetting properties: contact angle hysteresis, critical pressure, and minimum
energy wetting barrier. For each, we uncover multiple competing mechanisms,
leading to the development of new quantitative models, and correction of
inaccurate assumptions in prevailing models. Secondly, we combine these
analyses simultaneously, demonstrating the power of this strategy by optimizing
structures that are well-suited to overcome challenges faced by two emerging
applications: membrane distillation and digital microfluidics. As the wetting
properties are antagonistically coupled, this multifaceted approach is
essential for optimal design. When large surveys are impractical, we show that
genetic algorithms enable efficient optimisation, offering speedups of up to
10,000x.

our method is to retrain the multi-kernel classifier by utilizing the available
labeled samples from source domain, and adding minimum number of the most
informative samples with active queries in the target domain. The proposed
method adaptively combines multiple kernels, forming a DA classifier that
minimizes the bias between the source and target domains. Further equipped with
the nested actively updating process, it sequentially expands the training set
and gradually converges to a satisfying level of classification performance. We
study this active adaptation framework with the Margin Sampling (MS) strategy

global acoustical distributions of audio or the temporal evolution of
short-term audio features, without analysis down to the level of sound events.
To identify distinct sound events for each scene, we formulate ASC in a
multi-instance learning (MIL) framework, where each audio recording is mapped
into a bag-of-instances representation. Here, instances can be seen as
high-level representations for sound events inside a scene. We also propose a
MIL neural networks model, which implicitly identifies distinct instances
(i.e., sound events). Furthermore, we propose two specially designed modules
that model the multi-temporal scale and multi-modal natures of the sound events
respectively. The experiments were conducted on the official development set of
the DCASE2018 Task1 Subtask B, and our best-performing model improves over the
official baseline by 9.4% (68.3% vs 58.9%) in terms of classification accuracy.
This study indicates that recognizing acoustic scenes by identifying distinct
sound events is effective and paves the way for future studies that combine
this strategy with previous ones.

related to that of anisotropic mass and angular momentum loss. In this paper,
we aim to clarify the rotational evolution of rapidly rotating early-type stars
along the main sequence (MS). We have used the 2D ESTER code to compute and
evolve isolated rapidly rotating early-type stellar models along the MS, with
and without anisotropic mass loss. We show that stars with $Z=0.02$ and masses
between $5$ and $7~M_\odot$ reach criticality during the main sequence provided
their initial angular velocity is larger than 50% of the Keplerian one. More
massive stars are subject to radiation-driven winds and to an associated loss
of mass and angular momentum. We find that this angular momentum extraction
from the outer layers can prevent massive stars from reaching critical rotation
and greatly reduce the degree of criticality at the end of the MS. Our model
includes the so-called bi-stability jump of the $\dot{M}-T_{\rm eff}$ relation
of 1D-models. This discontinuity now shows up in the latitude variations of the
mass-flux surface density, endowing rotating massive stars with either a
single-wind regime (no discontinuity) or a two-wind regime (a discontinuity).
In the two-winds-regime, mass loss and angular momentum loss are strongly
increased at low latitudes inducing a faster slow-down of the rotation.
However, predicting the rotational fate of a massive star is difficult, mainly
because of the non-linearity of the phenomena involved and their strong
dependence on uncertain prescriptions. Moreover, the very existence of the
bi-stability jump in mass-loss rate remains to be substantiated by
observations.

computational tasks from cloud structures to multiple devices close to the end

  Our model is a variant of the classical Page Migration Problem. More
formally, we consider a mobile server holding a data page. The server can move
in the Euclidean space (of arbitrary dimension). In every round, requests for
data items from the page pop up at arbitrary points in the space. The requests
are served, each at a cost of the distance from the requesting point and the
server, and the mobile server may move, at a cost $D$ times the distance
traveled for some constant $D$. We assume a maximum distance $m$ the server is
allowed to move per round.
  We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio independent
of the length of the input sequence in this setting. Hence we augment the
maximum movement distance of the online algorithms to $(1+\delta)$ times the
maximum distance of the offline solution. We provide a deterministic algorithm
which is simple to describe and works for multiple variants of our problem. The
algorithm achieves almost tight competitive ratios independent of the length of

augmentation in a variant where the distance between two consecutive requests

their collective decision-making have inspired this algorithm; it has no
algorithmic connection with the honey bee algorithm or the artificial bee
colony algorithm. It is worth mentioning that FDO is considered a particle
swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm that updates the search agent position
by adding velocity (pace). However, FDO calculates velocity differently; it
uses the problem fitness function value to produce weights, and these weights
guide the search agents during both the exploration and exploitation phases.
Throughout the paper, the FDO algorithm is presented, and the motivation behind
the idea is explained. Moreover, FDO is tested on a group of 19 classical
benchmark test functions, and the results are compared with three well-known
algorithms: PSO, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the dragonfly algorithm (DA),
additionally, FDO is tested on IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation
Benchmark Test Functions (CEC-C06, 2019 Competition) [1]. The results are
compared with three modern algorithms: (DA), the whale optimization algorithm
(WOA), and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The FDO results show better
performance in most cases and comparative results in other cases. Furthermore,
the results are statistically tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to show
the significance of the results. Likewise, FDO stability in both the
exploration and exploitation phases is verified and performance-proofed using
different standard measurements. Finally, FDO is applied to real-world
applications as evidence of its feasibility.

fractal media, with localized sources at their boundaries. The particles
released at a source, which is maintained at a constant density, execute
unbiased random walks over a lattice; it represents solute infiltration by
diffusion into a medium in contact with a reservoir. A scaling approach shows
that the infiltrated length, area, or volume evolves in time as the number of
distinct sites visited by a single random walker in the same medium. This is
consistent with simulations of the lattice model and exact and numerical
solutions of the corresponding diffusion equation. In a Sierpinski carpet, the
infiltrated area is expected to evolve as t^{D_F/D_W} (Alexander-Orbach
relation), where D_F is the fractal dimension of the medium and D_W is the
random walk dimension; the numerical integration of the diffusion equation
supports this relation and improves results of lattice random walk simulations.
In a Menger sponge in which D_F>D_W (a fractal with a dimension close to 3), a
linear time increase of the infiltrated volume is predicted and confirmed
numerically. Thus, no evidence of fractality can be observed in infiltrated
volumes or masses in media where random walks are not recurrent, although the
tracer diffusion is anomalous. We compare our results with a fluid infiltration
model in which the pressure head is constant at the source and the front
displacement is driven by the local gradient of that head. Exact or numerical
solutions in two and three dimensions and in a carpet show that this type of
fluid infiltration is in the same universality class of RWI, with an
equivalence between the head and the particle concentration. These results set
a relation between different infiltration processes with localized sources and
the recurrence properties of random walks in the same media.

of mitigating bias in occupation classification, we propose a method for
discouraging correlation between the predicted probability of an individual's

societal biases that are encoded in word embeddings, eliminating the need for
access to protected attributes. Crucially, it only requires access to

at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV using events containing two oppositely
charged leptons. The analysed data were recorded with the CMS detector in 2016

double-differential $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ cross section is measured as a
function of the kinematic properties of the top quark and of the

triple-differential measurement is performed as a function of the invariant
mass and rapidity of the $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ system and the multiplicity
of additional jets at particle level. The data are compared to predictions of
Monte Carlo event generators that complement next-to-leading-order (NLO)
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations with parton showers. Together with a
fixed-order NLO QCD calculation, the triple-differential measurement is used to
extract values of the strong coupling strength $\alpha_S$ and the top quark
pole mass ($m_\mathrm{T}^\text{pole}$) using several sets of parton

$\alpha_S$, and $m_\mathrm{T}^\text{pole}$ is performed at NLO, demonstrating
that the new data have significant impact on the gluon PDF, and at the same

this pertinent problem, a three-step approach is proposed for attaining 3D

it could be characterized by distribution statistics rather than temporal

behavior with no more than one u.c. intermixing at the interface but at least 3
u.c. of Sr segregation near the surface which is (La/Sr)O terminated. The
conductivity vs film thickness shows the existence of nonmetallic layers with
thickness ~ 6.5 +/- 0.9 u.c., which is independent of film thickness but mainly
relates to the deviation of Sr concentration near the surface region. Below 20
u.c., the surface of the films appears mixed (La/Sr)O with MnO2 termination.
Decreasing film thickness to less than 10 u.c. leads to the enhanced deviation
of chemical composition in the films and eventually drives the film insulating.

metal-nonmetal transition in thin films based on the variation of film

requires that the state of a system be described by a probability distribution.
A natural question, thereby, arises as to whether a prior knowledge about the
state of the system affects the second law. This question has now been nurtured
over a century and its inception was done by C. Maxwell through his famous
thought experiment wherein comes the idea of Maxwell's demon. The next
important step in this direction was provided by L. Szilard who demonstrated a
theoretical model for an information engine incorporating Maxwell's demon. The
final step that lead to the inter-linkage between information theory and
thermodynamics was through Landauer's principle of information erasure that
established the fact that information is physical. Here we will present an
overview of these three major works that laid the foundations of information
thermodynamics.

images, where instances may correspond to individual cells, organisms or plant
parts. Unlike instance segmentation for user photographs or road scenes, in
biological data object instances may be particularly densely packed, the
appearance variation may be particularly low, the processing power may be
restricted, while, on the other hand, the variability of sizes of individual
instances may be limited. The proposed approach successfully addresses these
peculiarities.
  Our approach describes each object instance using an expectation of a limited
number of sine waves with frequencies and phases adjusted to particular object
sizes and densities. At train time, a fully-convolutional network is learned to
predict the object embeddings at each pixel using a simple pixelwise regression
loss, while at test time the instances are recovered using clustering in the
embedding space. In the experiments, we show that our approach outperforms
previous embedding-based instance segmentation approaches on a number of
biological datasets, achieving state-of-the-art on a popular CVPPP benchmark.
This excellent performance is combined with computational efficiency that is
needed for deployment to domain specialists.

Interfaces usually rely on the whole image to estimate the spectral parameters

straightforward, and it permits the synthesis of understandable speech, it has
several disadvantages as well. Besides the inability to capture the relations
between close regions (i.e. pixels) of the image, this pixel-by-pixel
representation of the image is also quite uneconomical. It is easy to see that
a significant part of the image is irrelevant for the spectral parameter
estimation task as the information stored by the neighbouring pixels is
redundant, and the neural network is quite large due to the large number of
input features. To resolve these issues, in this study we train an autoencoder
neural network on the ultrasound image; the estimation of the spectral speech
parameters is done by a second DNN, using the activations of the bottleneck
layer of the autoencoder network as features. In our experiments, the proposed
method proved to be more efficient than the standard approach: the measured
normalized mean squared error scores were lower, while the correlation values
were higher in each case. Based on the result of a listening test, the
synthesized utterances also sounded more natural to native speakers. A further
advantage of our proposed approach is that, due to the (relatively) small size
of the bottleneck layer, we can utilize several consecutive ultrasound images
during estimation without a significant increase in the network size, while
significantly increasing the accuracy of parameter estimation.

for the relativity of the proton scale. The proton to electron and proton to

the usual law of scale ratio composition, $\rho_ {pe}=\rho_ {p\mu} \times \rho_

direct and representative democracy. One of its main features is that voters
can delegate their votes in a transitive manner such that: A delegates to B and
B delegates to C leads to A indirectly delegates to C. These delegations can be
effectively empowered by implementing liquid democracy in a social network, so
that voters can delegate their votes to any of their neighbors in the network.
However, it is uncertain that such a delegation process will lead to a stable
state where all voters are satisfied with the people representing them. We
study the stability (w.r.t. voters preferences) of the delegation process in
liquid democracy and model it as a game in which the players are the voters and
the strategies are their possible delegations. We answer several questions on
the equilibria of this process in any social network or in social networks that
correspond to restricted types of graphs.
  We show that a Nash-equilibrium may not exist, and that it is even
NP-complete to decide whether one exists or not. This holds even if the social
network is a complete graph or a bounded degree graph. We further show that
this existence problem is W[1]-hard w.r.t. the treewidth of the social network.
Besides these hardness results, we demonstrate that an equilibrium always
exists whatever the preferences of the voters iff the social network is a tree.
We design a dynamic programming procedure to determine some desirable
equilibria (e.g., minimizing the dissatisfaction of the voters) in polynomial
time for tree social networks. Lastly, we study the convergence of delegation
dynamics. Unfortunately, when an equilibrium exists, we show that a best
response dynamics may not converge, even if the social network is a path or a
complete graph.

sequence-to-sequence framework. However, unlike sequence transduction problems

data. We describe two approaches for generating large parallel datasets for GEC
using publicly available Wikipedia data. The first method extracts
source-target pairs from Wikipedia edit histories with minimal filtration
heuristics, while the second method introduces noise into Wikipedia sentences
via round-trip translation through bridge languages. Both strategies yield
similar sized parallel corpora containing around 4B tokens. We employ an
iterative decoding strategy that is tailored to the loosely supervised nature
of our constructed corpora. We demonstrate that neural GEC models trained using
either type of corpora give similar performance. Fine-tuning these models on
the Lang-8 corpus and ensembling allows us to surpass the state of the art on
both the CoNLL-2014 benchmark and the JFLEG task. We provide systematic
analysis that compares the two approaches to data generation and highlights the

administration that collects data to determine the frequencies of areas size
occupied by ant nests. The purpose of this work is to build a relationship of
similarities among different geographical regions using the frequency data of
nests size occurrence by applying Information Bottleneck (IB) method and
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). IB allows simultaneous clustering of each
region with the ant nest size distribution, while PCA is used to reduce the

absent without the need of a central node or fusion center (FC). We first start
from the continuous-time signal sensed by the nodes and obtain an equivalent
discrete-time hypothesis testing problem. Secondly, we propose a fully
distributed scheme, based on the well-known generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)
test, which is suitable for a WSN, where resources such as energy and
communication bandwidth are typically scarce. In third place, we consider the
asymptotic performance of the proposed GLR test. The derived results provide an
excellent matching with the scenario in which only a finite amount of
measurements are available at each sensor node. We finally show that the
proposed distributed algorithm performs as well as the global GLR test in the
considered scenarios, requiring only a small number of communication exchanges
between nodes and a limited knowledge about the network structure and its
connectivity.

transportation. With the recent technological improvement of automated
vehicles, it is expected that automated demand responsive transit and automated
demand responsive feeder transit potentially will be options to improve
mobility in rural areas. One of the main concerns for the optimal automated
demand responsive feeder transit operation is variation of passenger demand.
Obviously, changes in passenger demand should alter the optimal operation and
will result in different passenger travel times and vehicle operation costs.
This paper uses the optimal feeder bus routing algorithm previously developed
by the authors. With it, the effects of the various passenger demands with
fixed fleet size will be evaluated for the optimal automated demand responsive
feeder bus operation based on the example network. The results show that when
demand goes up, the maximum average used capacity of vehicles goes up as
expected. Moreover, when demand goes up, transit service becomes more
circuitous and makes the passenger costs/person and total costs/person
increase, and the service becomes less efficient, although operating
costs/passenger decreases.

lanes can bring obvious advantages in a transportation network, overall
performance of these lanes, especially in urban areas and in micro level sight,
is not clear. This study aims to examine the efficiency of dedicated lanes for
AVs in roundabout with an unbalanced traffic flow pattern. Four factors of
travel time, delay time, speed of vehicles, and queue of vehicles have been
selected as variables of traffic performance at the roundabout. Two microscopic
traffic simulation software, AIMSUN and SIDRA Intersection, were used to
examine the impact of the AV dedicated lanes at the roundabout. This study
shows that the effects of an imbalanced traffic pattern in a roundabout are
higher when the penetration rate of AVs is lower and also dedicated lanes in
roundabout's leg may improve traffic performance indicators when the
penetration rate of AVs is higher, but this improvement is not significant.

proposed mechanism uses network coding mechanism in which several contents of

only within the same group. The interested peers are also divided into several
groups with each group have the responsibility to spread one set of contents of
some message. The coding system is designed to assure the property that any

smart network coding scheme is defined which assures the preferred property,
then peers are connected in the same group to send the corresponding message,

decoding operation. Moreover, the proposed system can be readily expanded to
support topology change to get better system performance further in terms of

  sections, added link to code in supplementary",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional recognition methods typically require large,
artificially-balanced training classes, while few-shot learning methods are
tested on artificially small ones. In contrast to both extremes, real world
recognition problems exhibit heavy-tailed class distributions, with cluttered
scenes and a mix of coarse and fine-grained class distinctions. We show that
prior methods designed for few-shot learning do not work out of the box in
these challenging conditions, based on a new ""meta-iNat"" benchmark. We
introduce three parameter-free improvements: (a) better training procedures
based on adapting cross-validation to meta-learning, (b) novel architectures
that localize objects using limited bounding box annotations before
classification, and (c) simple parameter-free expansions of the feature space
based on bilinear pooling. Together, these improvements double the accuracy of
state-of-the-art models on meta-iNat while generalizing to prior benchmarks,
complex neural architectures, and settings with substantial domain shift.

people's daily lives. Thus, there has been more and more effort to develop
interfaces, such as dynamic gestures, that provide an intuitive way of
interaction. Currently, the most common trend is to use multimodal data, as
depth and skeleton information, to enable dynamic gesture recognition. However,
using only color information would be more interesting, since RGB cameras are
usually available in almost every public place, and could be used for gesture
recognition without the need of installing other equipment. The main problem
with such approach is the difficulty of representing spatio-temporal
information using just color. With this in mind, we propose a technique capable
of condensing a dynamic gesture, shown in a video, in just one RGB image. We
call this technique star RGB. This image is then passed to a classifier formed
by two Resnet CNNs, a soft-attention ensemble, and a fully connected layer,
which indicates the class of the gesture present in the input video.
Experiments were carried out using both Montalbano and GRIT datasets. For
Montalbano dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 94.58%. Such
result reaches the state-of-the-art when considering this dataset and only
color information. Regarding the GRIT dataset, our proposal achieves more than
98% of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, outperforming the reference
approach by more than 6%.

with the advent of a parameterization of the partonic structure of the nucleon
in terms of the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). Encoding the
correlations between the elementary constituents of the nucleon, GPDs allow a
3-dimensional imaging of the nucleon from the dynamical link between the
transverse position and the longitudinal momentum of partons. Double Deeply
Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) corresponds to the scattering from the
nucleon of a virtual photon that finally generates a lepton pair, where the
final leptons can be either an electron or a muon pair. The virtuality of the
final photon allows to investigate in a decorrelated way the initial and
transferred momentum dependences of the GPDs. This unique feature of DDVCS is
of relevance, among others, for the determination of the transverse parton
densities and the distribution of nuclear forces. This proceeding discusses
preliminary model-predicted DDVCS experimental projections at JLab12 and
indicates the impact of potential DDVCS experiments.

  Information",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supplier selection problem has gained extensive attention in the prior
studies. However, research based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making
(F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers in logistic 4 is still in its
infancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient supplier
selection problem in logistic 4 primarily because of the large amount of data
concerning some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process
while making decisions. Besides, some qualitative attributes prevalent in
logistic 4 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental decision relevant
information, and are substantially different than those considered in
traditional suppler selection problems. This study develops a Decision Support
System (DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such
imprecise heterogeneous data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient
suppliers in the logistic 4 environment. The proposed framework induces a
triangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using
probability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal
data presented graphically are computed by extracting granular information that
are imprecise in nature. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to map the
qualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method is adopted to
generate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are
used as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine
optimal order allocation for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity
analysis assesses how the Suppliers Cost versus Resilience Index (SCRI) changes
when differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience
attributes.

bridging several disciplines that analyze natural phenomena and man-made
systems. Integrated information has been introduced as a metric to quantify the
amount of information generated by a system beyond the information generated by
its elements. Yet, this intriguing notion comes with the price of being
prohibitively expensive to calculate, since the calculations require an
exponential number of sub-divisions of a system. Here we introduce a novel
framework to connect algorithmic randomness and integrated information and a
numerical method for estimating integrated information using a perturbation
test rooted in algorithmic information dynamics. This method quantifies the
change in program size of a system when subjected to a perturbation. The
intuition behind is that if an object is random then random perturbations have
little to no effect to what happens when a shorter program but when an object
has the ability to move in both directions (towards or away from randomness) it
will be shown to be better integrated as a measure of sophistication telling
apart randomness and simplicity from structure. We show that an object with a
high integrated information value is also more compressible, and is, therefore,
more sensitive to perturbations. We find that such a perturbation test
quantifying compression sensitivity provides a system with a means to extract
explanations--causal accounts--of its own behaviour. Our technique can reduce
the number of calculations to arrive at some bounds or estimations, as the
algorithmic perturbation test guides an efficient search for estimating
integrated information. Our work sets the stage for a systematic exploration of
connections between algorithmic complexity and integrated information at the
level of both theory and practice.

mechanisms (Nearest neighbor hopping and Motts variable range hopping) is
observed using a combined study of conductivity, dielectric relaxation and
impedance spectra in PZM. This investigation point towards a transition from
nearest neighbor hoping to Motts variable range hopping mechanism due to
lowering activation energy around 580 K. The charge carriers hopping between
the localized acceptor states at the grain boundaries (GBs), which dominants
conduction mechanism below 580 K. The ac conductivity, dielectric relaxation,
Nyquist plot, and electric modulus highlight the blended effect of grains (Gs)

and modulus formalism are analyzed on the basis of empirical Cole-Cole model.
The conduction mechanism is found to be highly correlated with the relaxation
mechanism and impedance spectroscopy.

testing technique recently. It shows its ability to reduce the number of test
cases that have to be considered for software-under-test by taking the
combinations of parameters as an interaction of input. This combination could
be considered as input-configuration of different software families. Pairwise
combinatorial test suite takes the interaction of two input parameters into
consideration instead of many parameter interactions. Evidence showed that this
test suite could detect most of the faults in the software-under-test as

generate pairwise combinatorial test suites. Also, Dragon Fly (DF), a new swarm
intelligent optimization algorithm, is assessed. The design and adaptation of
the algorithm are addresses in the paper in detail. The algorithm is evaluated
extensively through different experiments and benchmarks. The evaluation shows
the efficiency of the proposed technique for test suite generation and the

Thus, we present a case study that is related to dynamic simulation of an
automatic inventory management system. We provide two types of agents, the
clients, and the seller agents. Through a system of communication, the agents
exchange messages to fulfill their inventory needs. The client agents trade
products in quantities according to their needs and rely on seller agents if
other clients in the retailer chain cannot provide the needed items.
Additionally, it is expected that the trading between a client and the sellers
is done through a reverted type of auction. This case study MAS uses BDI and
FIPA-ACL in its implementation resulting in a clear simulation of the system.
We expect to provide a comparison between two distinct situations. One with
only external transactions with providers, and a situation where both internal
