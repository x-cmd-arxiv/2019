problem of estimating a Monge matrix subject to additive random noise. More
specifically, we establish the minimax rates of estimation of Monge and

efficient estimators and establish their rates of convergence. Our theoretical

scalability with a growing amount of data to learn from. In order to tackle
these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Generative Memory (DGM) - a synaptic
plasticity driven framework for continual learning. DGM relies on conditional
generative adversarial networks with learnable connection plasticity realized
with neural masking. Specifically, we evaluate two variants of neural masking:
applied to (i) layer activations and (ii) to connection weights directly.
Furthermore, we propose a dynamic network expansion mechanism that ensures
sufficient model capacity to accommodate for continually incoming tasks. The

The *partition function* is the normalization factor $Z(\beta)=\sum_{\omega

  Two important parameters are the log partition ratio $q = \log

integer-valued distributions (ignoring some second-order terms and parameters).
We show this is optimal up to logarithmic factors. We illustrate with improved

  We develop a key subroutine for global estimation of the partition function.
Specifically, we produce a data structure to estimate $Z(\beta)$ for \emph{all}

model calculates the carbon flux, accounting for the thermodynamic effect of
mantle carbon: reduction of the solidus temperature and a deeper onset of
melting. We analyse models forced by idealised, periodic sea level and conclude
that fluctuations in melting rate are the prime control on magma and carbon
flux. We also discuss a model forced by a reconstruction of eustatic sea level
over the past 800 kyr. It indicates that peak-to-trough variations of magma and
carbon flux are up to about 20% and 10% of the mean flux, respectively. Peaks
in mid-ocean ridge emissions lag peaks in sea-level forcing by less than about

though the CCL depth and through the thin Nafion film, separating the pore from
Pt/C species. Analytical solution to model equations reveals the limiting
current density $j_N^{\rm lim}$ due to oxygen transport through the Nafion
film. Further, $j_N^{\rm lim}$ linearly depends of the CCL thickness, i.e., the
thinner the CCL, the lower $j_N^{\rm lim}$. This result may explain unexpected
lowering of low--Pt loaded catalyst layers performance, which has been widely
discussing in literature.

the laser fluence on their composition, structure, and magnetic properties.
Continuum's Surelite pulsed 266nm Nd:YAG laser was employed, and the laser
fluence varied systemically between 1 and 5.7 [J/cm2]. Deviations from the
stoichiometric transfer between the BaM targets and deposited thin films
occurred as the laser fluence changed. The Fe to Ba ratio in the films
increased with the laser fluence. The films deposited at the laser fluences
below 4 J/cm2 showed undesirable 3-dimensional islands on the surface.
Moreover, insufficient laser energy resulted in the deposition of some
secondary phases, for example, barium monoferrite (BaFe2O4) and Magnetite
(Fe3O4). On the other hand, laser fluences above 5 J/cm2 promoted resputtering
and degraded the film quality, structure, and magnetic properties. BaM films
deposited at 4.8 J/cm2 - the optimal laser fluence - showed excellent c-axis
orientation perpendicular to the film plane with the anisotropy field of 16 kOe

strong influence of the laser parameters on the PLD-grown hexaferrite films and

theory, nonlinear control, and safety-critical systems to enable cooperative
locomotion of robotic guide dogs and visually impaired people. We address
high-dimensional and complex hybrid dynamical models that represent
collaborative locomotion. At the high level of the control scheme, local and
nonlinear baseline controllers, based on the virtual constraints approach, are
designed to induce exponentially stable dynamic gaits. The baseline controller
for the leash is assumed to be a nonlinear controller that keeps the human in a
safe distance from the dog while following it. At the lower level, a real-time
quadratic programming (QP) is solved for modifying the baseline controllers of
the robot as well as the leash to avoid obstacles. In particular, the QP
framework is set up based on control barrier functions (CBFs) to compute
optimal control inputs that guarantee safety while being close to the baseline
controllers. The stability of the complex periodic gaits is investigated
through the Poincare return map. To demonstrate the power of the analytical
foundation, the control algorithms are transferred into an extensive numerical
simulation of a complex model that represents cooperative locomotion of a
quadrupedal robot, referred to as Vision 60, and a human model. The complex
model has 16 continuous-time domains with 60 state variables and 20 control

GRB190114C originates in a binary system composed of a massive carbon-oxygen
core (CO$_{core}$), and a binary neutron star (NS) companion. As the
CO$_{core}$ undergoes a supernova explosion with the creation of a new neutron
star ($\nu$NS), hypercritical accretion occurs onto the companion binary
neutron star until it exceeds the critical mass for gravitational collapse. The
formation of a black hole (BH) captures $10^{57}$ baryons by enclosing them
within its horizon, and thus a cavity of approximately $10^{11}$ cm is formed
around it with initial density $10^{-7}$ g/cm$^3$. A further depletion of
baryons in the cavity originates from the expansion of the
electron-positron-photon ($e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$) plasma formed at the collapse,
reaching a density of $10^{-14}$ g/cm$^3$ by the end of the interaction. It is
demonstrated here using an analytical model complemented by a hydrodynamical
numerical simulation that part of the $e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$ plasma is reflected
off the walls of the cavity. The consequent outflow and its observed properties
are shown to coincide with the featureless emission occurring in a time
interval of duration $t_{rf}$, measured in the rest frame of the source,
between $11$ and $20$ s of the GBM observation. Moreover, similar features of
the GRB light curve were previously observed in GRB 090926A and GRB 130427A,
all belonging to the BdHN I class. This interpretation supports the general
conceptual framework presented in Ruffini et al. (2019) and guarantees that a
low baryon density is reached in the cavity, a necessary condition for the
operation of the ""inner engine"" of the GRB presented in an accompanying article
(Ruffini & Moradi 2019).

scalability, i.e. training one method to detect all objects rather than
training one detector per object. Other challenges, such as occlusions,
changing light conditions and changes in object appearance, as well precisely
defined benchmarks are either not present or are scattered among different

features in these extensions is the incorporation of proper prior information.
In this paper, we propose a new extension of HMM, termed diversified Hidden

state-transition probabilities and thus facilitates more dynamic sequential
labellings. Specifically, the diversity is modeled by a continuous
determinantal point process prior, which we apply to both unsupervised and

Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets for unsupervised PoS tagging and

formulated in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000, LP00) to HI gas and concludes that
$""${\it a significant reassessment of many observational and theoretical
studies of turbulence in HI}$""$. This implies that dozens of papers that used
LP00 theory to explore interstellar turbulence as well as the ongoing research
based on LP00 theory are in error. This situation motivates the urgency of our
public response. In our Comment we explain why we believe the criticism in CX19
is based on the incorrect understanding of the LP00 theory. In particular, we
illustrate that the correlation between PPV slices and dust emissions in CX19
does not properly reveal the relative importance of velocity and density
fluctuations in velocity channel maps. While CX19 provides an explanation of
the change of the spectral index with respect to the thickness of PPV slice
based on the two-phase nature of H1 gas, we failed to see any observational
support for this idea. On the contrary, we show that the observations both in
two-phase HI and one phase CO show similar results. Moreover, the observed
change is in good agreement with LP00 predictions and spectral indexes of
velocity and density spectra that are obtained following LP00 procedures are in
good agreement with the numerically confirmed expectations of compressible MHD
turbulence theory. In short, we could not find any justification of the
criticism of LP00 theory that is provided in CX19. On the contrary, our
analysis testifies that both available observational and numerical data agree
well with the predictions of LP00 theory.

that they can be detected by a k-support norm. To deal with concurrent, two
types of changes, we employ two regularization terms, one for detecting moving
objects and the other for accounting for illumination changes, in the tensor

obtained as a function of light-quark mass, corresponding to four pion masses
between 200 and 400 MeV. Below the first inelastic threshold, the P-wave
scattering amplitude is dominated by a single pole singularity that evolves
from being a stable bound-state at the highest quark mass into a narrow
resonance that broadens as the pion and kaon masses are reduced. As in
experiment, the S-wave amplitude does not exhibit an obviously resonant
behavior, but instead shows a slow rise from threshold, which is not
inconsistent with the presence of a $\kappa$/$K_0^\star(700)$-like resonance at
the considered quark masses. As has been found in analyses of experimental
scattering data, simple analytic continuations into the complex energy plane of
precisely-determined lattice QCD amplitudes on the real energy axis are not
sufficient to model-independently determine the existence and properties of
this state. The spectra and amplitudes we present will serve as an input for

relations between the chaotic dynamics of an observable and the dynamics of

metal coupled to a dissipative, e.g. phononic, bath. The chaotic dynamics is
characterised by Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$, the rates of growth of
out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), quantities of the form $\langle[\hat
A(t),\hat B(0)]^{2}\rangle\propto\exp(2\lambda t)$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$
are the operators of, e.g., the total current of electrons in a metallic
quantum dot. We demonstrate that the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ matches the
rate of decay of information stored in the observable $\langle \hat
A(t)\rangle$ after applying a small perturbation with a small classical
uncertainty. This relation suggests a way to measure Lyapunov exponents in
experiment. We compute both the Lyapunov exponent and the rate of decay of
information microscopically in a disordered metal in the presence of a bosonic
bath, which may, in particular, represent interactions in the system. For a
sufficiently short range of the correlations in the bath, the exponent has the
form $\lambda=\lambda_{0}-1/\tau$, where $\lambda_{0}$ is the
(temperature-independent) Lyapunov exponent in the absence of the bath and
$1/\tau$ is the inelastic scattering rate. Our results demonstrate also the
existence of a transition between chaotic and non-chaotic behaviour at

for several 2009dc-like SNe. Previous well-studied 2009dc-like SNe have
generally suffered from large and uncertain amounts of host-galaxy extinction,
which is negligible for ASASSN-15pz. Based on the color of ASASSN-15pz, we
estimate a host extinction for SN 2009dc of E(B-V)_host=0.12 mag and confirm
its high luminosity (M_B, peak[2009dc] \approx -20.3 mag). The 2009dc-like SN
population, which represents ~1% of SNe Ia, exhibits a range of peak
luminosities, and do not fit onto the tight width-luminosity relation. Their
optical light curves also show significant diversity of late-time (>~ 50 days)
decline rates. The nebular-phase spectra provide powerful diagnostics to
identify the 2009dc-like events as a distinct class of SNe Ia. We suggest
referring to these sources using the phenomenology-based ""2009dc-like SN
Ia-pec"" instead of ""Super-Chandrasekhar SN Ia,"" which is based on an uncertain
theoretical interpretation.

their tiny size and mass relative to Sun-like host stars. However, recent
instrumental advancements are making the detection of Earth-like exoplanets
technologically feasible. For example, Kepler and TESS photometric precision
means we can identify Earth-sized candidates (and PLATO in the future will add
many long-period candidates to the list), while spectrographs such as ESPRESSO
and EXPRES (with an aimed radial velocity precision [RV] near 10 cm/s) mean we
will soon reach the instrumental precision required to confirm Earth-mass
planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars. However, many astrophysical
phenomena on the surfaces of these host stars can imprint signatures on the
stellar absorption lines used to detect the Doppler wobble induced by planetary
companions. The result is stellar-induced spurious RV shifts that can mask or
mimic planet signals. This review provides a brief overview of how stellar
surface magnetoconvection and oscillations can impact low-mass planet
confirmation and the best-tested strategies to overcome this astrophysical
noise. These noise reduction strategies originate from a combination of
empirical motivation and a theoretical understanding of the underlying physics.
The most recent predications indicate that stellar oscillations for Sun-like
stars may be averaged out with tailored exposure times, while granulation may
need to be disentangled by inspecting its imprint on the stellar line profile
shapes. Overall, the literature suggests that Earth-analog detection should be
possible, with the correct observing strategy and sufficient data collection.

(TTT), in which an ellipsoidal dark-matter protohalo, which comes to host the
galaxy, is torqued up by the tidal gravitational field around it. We discuss a
complementary picture, using the relatively familiar velocity field, instead of
the tidal field, whose intuitive connection to the surrounding, possibly
faraway matter arrangement is more obscure. In this 'spin from primordial inner
motions' (SPIM) concept, implicit in TTT derivations but not previously
emphasized, the angular momentum from the gravity-sourced velocity field inside
a protohalo largely cancels out, but has some excess from the aspherical
outskirts. At first, the net spin scales according to linear theory, a sort of
comoving conservation of familiar angular momentum. Then, at collapse, it is
conserved in physical coordinates. Small haloes are then typically subject to
secondary exchanges of angular momentum. The TTT is useful for analytic
estimates. But a literal interpretation of the TTT is inaccurate in detail,
without some implicit concepts about smoothing of the velocity and tidal
fields. This could lead to misconceptions, for those first learning about how
galaxies come to spin. Protohaloes are not perfectly ellipsoidal and do not
uniformly torque up, as in a naive interpretation of the TTT; their inner
velocity fields retain substantial dispersion. Furthermore, quantitatively,
given initial conditions and protohalo boundaries, SPIM is more direct and
accurate than the TTT to predict halo spins. We also discuss how SPIM applies
to rotating filaments, and the relation between halo mass and spin, in which
the total spin of a halo can be thought of as a sum of random contributions.

determines the radiation pattern from the accretion disc, which directly
imprints on the geometry of the radiation-driven outflows. We show that for low

outflows; while for high BH spins, the radiation pattern is more isotropic,
leading to quasi-spherical/oblate outflows. Reversing the argument, we can
potentially deduce the spin of the central BH from the observed morphology of
galactic outflows. In principle, this may provide a novel way of constraining
the central BH spin from galaxy-scale observations. Indeed, the BH spin can
have significant macroscopic effects on galactic scales, ultimately shaping the
large-scale feedback and the resulting obscuration.

previously acquired knowledge, e.g., the rich discriminative features learned
from ImageNet, to improve the model's transfer ability. For this purpose, we
design an approach named Semantic-Aware Knowledge prEservation (SAKE), which
fine-tunes the pre-trained model in an economical way and leverages semantic
information, e.g., inter-class relationship, to achieve the goal of knowledge
preservation. Zero-shot experiments on two extended SBIR datasets, TU-Berlin

the context of promise constraint satisfaction problems, Brakensiek and
Guruswami conjectured that this hardness result extends to promise graph
homomorphism as follows: fix any non-bipartite graph $H$ and another graph $G$
with a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, it is NP-hard to find a homomorphism to
$G$ from a given $H$-colourable graph. Arguably, the two most important special
cases of this conjecture are when $H$ is fixed to be the complete graph on 3

graph on 3 vertices (and $H$ is any 3-colourable graph). The former case is
equivalent to the notoriously difficult approximate graph colouring problem. In
this paper, we confirm the Brakensiek-Guruswami conjecture for the latter case.

with local measurement. In particular, we establish a novel $\ell_2$ norm
connection between quantum property testing problems and the corresponding
distribution testing problems. This connection opens up the potential to derive
efficient testing algorithms using techniques developed for classical property
testing. As the first demonstration of these possibilities, we designed two
streaming algorithms: one for quantum state tomography, the other for quantum
closeness testing. By using the idea of our tomography algorithm, we obtain a
streaming algorithm which provide good estimations for each $k$-qubit reduced
density matrice of $m$-qubit state using only $\log m$ copies for constant $k$.
This is tight and exponential speedup compare with optimal tomography for each
$k$-qubit reduced density matrice.
  To the best of our knowledge, no streaming algorithm has yet been used for
quantum property testing. So, to illustrate their usefulness, we achieve the
following: independence testing for quantum states; identity and independence
testing for quantum state collections; and conditional independence for
classical-quantum-quantum states. Additionally, with a dimension splitting
technique, we derive matching lower bound up to log factor for independence
testing with joint measurement.

analyze a convex programming relaxation of the problem and design a constant

broadband photometry together with the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. The mass was then
determined using a mass-radius relation that we derived from eclipsing binaries
known in the literature. We compared this method with three other methods: (1)
We calculated the mass from the radius and the surface gravity log g, which was
obtained from the same spectral analysis as $T_{\rm eff}$. (2) We used a widely
used infrared mass-magnitude relation. (3) We used a Bayesian approach to infer
stellar parameters from the comparison of the absolute magnitudes and colors of
our targets with evolutionary models. Between spectral types M0V and M7V our
radii cover the range $0.1\,R_{\normalsize\odot}<R<0.6\,R_{\normalsize\odot}$

transmit danger information through a physical barrier to nestmates located in
a safe arena when danger is simulated by using insect repellent. As ants in the

contaminated with a chemical, they retreat from the barrier in average. Visual
clues and pure mutual antennation seem to play a minor role as mechanisms of
danger information transmission through the obstacle. A detailed quantification
of the ant behavior reveals that examination of the legs of ants in the danger

categories because a large number of mask annotations is required. We introduce
ShapeMask, which learns the intermediate concept of object shape to address the
problem of generalization in instance segmentation to novel categories.
ShapeMask starts with a bounding box detection and gradually refines it by
first estimating the shape of the detected object through a collection of shape
priors. Next, ShapeMask refines the coarse shape into an instance level mask by
learning instance embeddings. The shape priors provide a strong cue for
object-like prediction, and the instance embeddings model the instance specific
appearance information. ShapeMask significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 6.4 and 3.8 AP when learning across categories, and obtains
competitive performance in the fully supervised setting. It is also robust to
inaccurate detections, decreased model capacity, and small training data.
Moreover, it runs efficiently with 150ms inference time and trains within 11
hours on TPUs. With a larger backbone model, ShapeMask increases the gap with
state-of-the-art to 9.4 and 6.2 AP across categories. Code will be released.

peak around A7, which is similar to previous works. With the Gaia distances, we
calculated the vertical height Z from the Galactic plane for each Am star. The

many orders of magnitude in distance, accelerate to relativistic velocities,
and collimate into tight opening angles. Of these, perhaps the least understood
is jet collimation due to the interaction with the ambient medium. In order to
investigate this interaction, we carried out axisymmetric general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets produced by a large accretion disc,
spanning over 5 orders of magnitude in time and distance, at an unprecedented
resolution. Supported by such a disc, the jet attains a parabolic shape,
similar to the M87 galaxy jet, and the product of the Lorentz factor and the
jet half-opening angle, $\gamma\theta\ll 1$, similar to values found from very
long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) jets; this suggests extended discs in AGN. We find that the interaction
between the jet and the ambient medium leads to the development of pinch
instabilities, which produce significant radial and lateral variability across
the jet by converting magnetic and kinetic energy into heat. Thus pinched
regions in the jet can be detectable as radiating hotspots and may provide an
ideal site for particle acceleration. Pinching also causes gas from the ambient
medium to become squeezed between magnetic field lines in the jet, leading to
enhanced mass-loading of the jet and potentially contributing to the
spine-sheath structure observed in AGN outflows.

transparency in predictions. In this work we perform experiments to explore
this question using two EMR corpora and four different predictive tasks, that:
(i) inclusion of attention mechanisms is critical for neural encoder modules

large and dynamic, it is unrealistic to assume that an input representation
contains the full information of a graph being studied. Hence, it is desirable
to use algorithms that, even when only a (large) subgraph is available, output
solutions that are close to the solutions output when the whole graph is
available. We formalize this idea by introducing the notion of average
sensitivity of graph algorithms, which is the average earth mover's distance
between the output distributions of an algorithm on a graph and its subgraph
obtained by removing an edge, where the average is over the edges removed and
the distance between two outputs is the Hamming distance.
  In this work, we initiate a systematic study of average sensitivity. After
deriving basic properties of average sensitivity such as composition, we
provide efficient approximation algorithms with low average sensitivities for
concrete graph problems, including the minimum spanning forest problem, the
global minimum cut problem, the minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem, and the maximum
matching problem. In addition, we prove that the average sensitivity of our
global minimum cut algorithm is almost optimal, by showing a nearly matching
lower bound. We also show that every algorithm for the 2-coloring problem has
average sensitivity linear in the number of vertices. One of the main ideas
involved in designing our algorithms with low average sensitivity is the
following fact; if the presence of a vertex or an edge in the solution output
by an algorithm can be decided locally, then the algorithm has a low average
sensitivity, allowing us to reuse the analyses of known sublinear-time
algorithms and local computation algorithms (LCAs). Using this connection, we
show that every LCA for 2-coloring has linear query complexity, thereby
answering an open question.

surfaces with arbitrary smoothness, prescribed $C^0$ continuous creases and
boundaries. The utility of the manifold-based surface construction techniques
in isogeometric analysis was demonstrated in Majeed and Cirak (CMAME, 2017).
The respective basis functions are derived by combining differential-geometric
manifold techniques with conformal parametrisations and the partition of unity
method. The connectivity of a given unstructured quadrilateral control mesh in
$\mathbb R^3$ is used to define a set of overlapping charts. Each vertex with
its attached elements is assigned a corresponding conformally parametrised
planar chart domain in $\mathbb R^2$, so that a quadrilateral element is
present on four different charts. On the collection of unconnected chart
domains, the partition of unity method is used for approximation. The
transition functions required for navigating between the chart domains are
composed out of conformal maps. The necessary smooth partition of unity, or
blending, functions for the charts are assembled from tensor-product B-spline
pieces and require in contrast to earlier constructions no normalisation.
Creases are introduced across user tagged edges of the control mesh. Planar
chart domains that include creased edges or are adjacent to the domain boundary
require special local polynomial approximants. Three different types of chart
domain geometries are necessary to consider boundaries and arbitrary number and
arrangement of creases. The new chart domain geometries are chosen so that it
becomes trivial to establish local polynomial approximants that are always
$C^0$ continuous across tagged edges. The derived non-rational manifold-based
basis functions are particularly well suited for isogeometric analysis of
Kirchhoff-Love thin shells with kinks.

that all machine learning is in fact supervised to some degree, and that the

and dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis,
variational autoencoders, and deep belief networks are each internally
supervised by the data itself to learn their respective representations of its
features. Furthermore, these algorithms are not capable of external inference
until their respective outputs (clusters, principal components, or
representation codes) have been identified and externally labeled in effect. As
such, they do not suffice as examples of unsupervised learning. We propose that
the categorization `supervised vs unsupervised learning' be dispensed with, and
instead, learning algorithms be categorized as either
$internally~or~externally~supervised$ (or both). We believe this change in

as deterministic finite automata. Furthermore, we cover a wide class of attacks
that can nondeterministically add, remove, or rewrite a sensing and/or
actuation word to any word from predefined regular languages, and show how such
attacks can be modeled by nondeterministic FSTs; we also present how the use of
FSTs facilitates modeling realistic (and very complex) attacks, as well as
provides the foundation for design of attack-resilient supervisory controllers.
Specifically, we first consider the supervisory control problem for
deterministic plants with attacks (i) only on their sensors, (ii) only on their
actuators, and (iii) both on their sensors and actuators. For each case, we
develop new conditions for controllability in the presence of attacks, as well

all safe control words that can keep the plant work desirably even in the

actuation attacks. Then, we extend the controllability theorems and the
supervisor synthesizing algorithms to nondeterministic plants that satisfy a
nonblocking condition. Finally, we illustrate applicability of our methodology

both distinctive signatures of the environments and tasks and effective
building blocks for composing the policies. Experiments on GridWorld and Thor,
of which the agent takes as input an egocentric view, show that our approach
gives rise to high success rates on all the (ENV, TASK) pairs after learning

broadband Purcell factors, and such systems have been recently suggested as
possible candidates for on-demand single photon sources, with fast operation
speeds. However, a true single photon source has strict requirements of high
efficiency (brightness) and quantum indistinguishability of the emitted
photons, which can be quantified through two-photon interference experiments.
To help address this problem, we employ and extend a recently developed
quantized quasinormal mode approach, which rigorously quantizes arbitrarily
lossy open system modes, to compute the key parameters that accurately quantify
the figures of merit for plasmon-based single photon sources. We also present a
quantized input-output theory to quantify the radiative and nonradiative
quantum efficiencies. We exemplify the theory using a nanoplasmonic dimer
resonator made up of two gold nanorods, which yields large Purcell factors and
good radiative output beta factors. Considering an optically pulsed excitation
scheme, we explore the key roles of pulse duration and pure dephasing on the
single photon properties, and show that ultrashort pulses (sub-ps) are
generally required for such structures, even for low temperature operation. We
also quantify the role of the nonradiative beta factor both for single photon
and two-photon emission processes. Our general approach can be applied to a
wide variety of plasmon systems, including metal-dielectrics, and
cavity-waveguide systems, without recourse to phenomenological quantization
schemes.

mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model;

effective solution by seamlessly integrating the lightweight and unforgeable

exploits the inherent signal-level device-specific radio-frequency

be connected to the Internet through wireless technologies. In general, IoT
devices would have various constraints due to limited processing capability,
memory, energy source, and so on, and it is desirable to employ efficient
wireless transmission schemes, especially for uplink transmissions. For
example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with index
modulation (IM) or OFDM-IM can be considered for IoT devices due to its energy
efficiency. In this paper, we study a different IM scheme for a single-carrier
(SC) system, which is referred to as SCIM. While SCIM is similar to OFDM-IM in
terms of energy efficiency, SCIM may be better suited for IoT uplink because it
has a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and does not require inverse fast
Fourier transform (FFT) at devices compared to OFDM-IM. We also consider
precoding for SCIM and generalize it to multiple access channel so that
multiple IoT devices can share the same radio resource block. To detect
precoded SCIM signals, low-complexity detectors are derived. For a better
performance, based on variational inference that is widely used in machine
learning, we consider a detector that provides an approximate solution to an
optimal detection.

presented that is designed to support distributed beamforming at 1.88 GHz and
high-accuracy ranging using a sparse, two-tone waveform operating near 9.5 and
10.5 GHz. The two-tone waveform is supported by a slotted patch antenna
surrounded by a larger patch antenna supporting the 1.88 GHz array signal. The
antennas are concentrically designed to ensure that the phase centers of the

a key role on social media, where impact is usually defined as the reach of a
user's content as captured by metrics such as the number of views, likes,
retweets, or shares. In this paper, we study entire careers of Twitter users to
understand properties of impact. We show that user impact tends to have certain
characteristics: First, impact is clustered in time, such that the most
impactful tweets of a user appear close to each other. Second, users commonly
have 'hot streaks' of impact, i.e., extended periods of high-impact tweets.
Third, impact tends to gradually build up before, and fall off after, a user's
most impactful tweet. We attempt to explain these characteristics using various
properties measured on social media, including the user's network, content,
activity, and experience, and find that changes in impact are associated with
significant changes in these properties. Our findings open interesting avenues

ship wake detection is essential for extracting information on the wake
generating vessels. One possibility is to assume a linear model for wakes, in
which case detection approaches are based on transforms such as Radon and
Hough. These express the bright (dark) lines as peak (trough) points in the
transform domain. In this paper, ship wake detection is posed as an inverse
problem, which the associated cost function including a sparsity enforcing
penalty, i.e. the generalized minimax concave (GMC) function. Despite being a
non-convex regularizer, the GMC penalty enforces the overall cost function to
be convex. The proposed solution is based on a Bayesian formulation, whereby
the point estimates are recovered using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.
To quantify the performance of the proposed method, various types of SAR images
are used, corresponding to TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1, and ALOS2. The
performance of various priors in solving the proposed inverse problem is first
studied by investigating the GMC along with the L1, Lp, nuclear and total

subsequently study the merits of the corresponding method in comparison to two

comprises a broad family of statistical estimation problems, including group
synchronization on graphs, community detection, and low-rank matrix estimation.
  A large body of theoretical work has established sharp thresholds for weak
and exact recovery, and sharp characterizations of the optimal reconstruction
accuracy in such models, focusing however on the special case of
Erd\""os--R\'enyi-type random graphs. The single most important finding of this
line of work is the ubiquity of an information-computation gap. Namely, for
many models of interest, a large gap is found between the optimal accuracy
achievable by any statistical method, and the optimal accuracy achieved by
known polynomial-time algorithms. Moreover, this gap is generally believed to
be robust to small amounts of additional side information revealed about the
$\theta_i$'s.
  How does the structure of the graph $G$ affect this picture? Is the
information-computation gap a general phenomenon or does it only apply to
specific families of graphs?
  We prove that the picture is dramatically different for graph sequences
converging to amenable graphs (including, for instance, $d$-dimensional grids).
We consider a model in which an arbitrarily small fraction of the vertex labels
is revealed, and show that a linear-time local algorithm can achieve
reconstruction accuracy that is arbitrarily close to the information-theoretic
optimum. We contrast this to the case of random graphs. Indeed, focusing on
group synchronization on random regular graphs, we prove that the

study the vertical phase-mixing signatures in arches (including the classical
``moving groups'') of the $V_{R}-V_{\phi}$ phase space near the Solar circle.
Interestingly, the phase space snail shell exists only in the arches with
$|V_{\phi} - V_{\rm LSR}| \lesssim 30$ km/s, i.e., stars on dynamically
``colder'' orbits. The snail shell becomes much weaker and eventually
disappears for increasingly larger radial action ($J_{R}$), quantifying the
``hotness'' of orbits. Thus one should pay closer attention to the colder
orbits in future phase mixing studies. We also confirm that the Hercules stream
has two branches (at fast and slow $V_{\phi}$), which may not be explained by a
single mechanism, since only the fast branch shows the prominent snail shell
feature. The hotter orbits may have phase-wrapped away already due to the much
larger dynamical range in radial variation to facilitate faster phase mixing.
To explain the lack of a well-defined snail shell in the hotter orbits, the
disk should have been perturbed at least $500$ Myr ago. Our results offer more
support to the recent satellite-disk encounter scenario than the internal bar
buckling perturbation scenario as the origin of the phase space mixing. Origin
of the more prominent snail shell in the $V_{\phi}$ color-coded phase space is

observed by various telescopes has provided us with a suite of light curves and
spectra in soft and hard X-rays, with no emission yet detected above around 1
MeV. Attenuation of such high-energy photons by magnetic pair creation and
photon splitting is expected to be active in the magnetospheres of magnetars,
possibly accounting for the paucity of gamma-rays in their signals. This paper
explores polarization-dependent opacities for these two QED processes in static
vacuum dipole magnetospheres of highly-magnetized neutron stars, calculating
attenuation lengths and determining escape energies, which are the maximum
photon energies for transparency out to infinity. The numerical trajectory
integral analysis in flat and curved spacetimes provides upper bounds of a few
MeV or less to the visible energies for magnetars for locales proximate to the
stellar surface. Photon splitting opacity alone puts constraints on the
possible emission locales in their magnetospheres: regions within field loops
of maximum altitudes 2-4 stellar radii are not commensurate with maximum
detected energies of around 250 keV. These constraints apply not only to
magnetar flares but also to their quiescent hard X-ray tail emission. An
exploration of photon splitting attenuation in the context of a resonant

opportunities in thermal transport control but remain largely unexplored due to
the small wavelength of thermal phonons, typically below a few nanometers. This
small length scale indicates that, instead of artificial phononic crystals, a
more promising direction is to examine the coherent phonon effects in natural
materials with hierarchical superstructures matching the thermal phonon
wavelength. In this work, we use first-principles simulations to characterize
the previously unstudied thermal properties of D-graphene and T-graphene,
two-dimensional carbon allotropes based upon the traditional graphene structure
but containing a secondary, in-plane periodicity. We find that despite very
similar atomic structure and bonding strength, D-graphene and T-graphene
possess significantly different thermal properties than that of pristine
graphene. At room temperature, the calculated thermal conductivity of
D-graphene and T-graphene is 600 Wm-1K-1 and 800 Wm-1K-1 compared to over 3000
Wm-1K-1 for graphene. We attribute these distinct properties to the presence of
naturally occurring, low frequency optical phonon modes that display
characteristics of phonon coherence and arise from a folding of the acoustic
modes and the associated frequency gap opening, a phenomenon also found in
superlattices where an out of plane periodicity is introduced. Furthermore, we
observe significantly enhanced Umklapp scatterings in D- and T-graphene that
largely suppress the hydrodynamic phonon transport in pristine graphene. Our
study presents D-graphene and T-graphene as ideal model systems to explore the
coherent phonon effects in 2D and demonstrates the potential of using coherent
phonon effects to significantly modify thermal transport of 2D materials
without making drastic changes to their fundamental compositions.

have become part of the mainstream discussion in cosmology and astrophysics. At
the classical level, the models are represented by the dynamics of a (real or
complex) scalar field endowed with a potential that contains its
self-interactions, and for this reason are generically known as scalar field
dark matter models. Here, we revisit the properties of such a model with a cosh
potential and compare it with other known examples in the literature. Within
the cosmological context, the self-interaction in the potential induces a
radiation-like behavior at early times of the scalar field density, which is
followed by a proper matter-like behavior at the onset of rapid field
oscillations around the minimum of the potential. The solutions are found by
numerical means, and from them we obtain information about the cosmological
observables up to the level of linear density perturbations. We also study the
general properties of self-gravitating objects in the non-relativistic limit
and determine the role in them of the self-interaction obtained from the cosh
potential. An overall conclusion is that, for the range of values in its
parameters allowed by different constraints, a cosh potential behaves almost
indistinguishable from the simpler quadratic one, which also means that the two
models suffer the same tight constraints from cosmological and astrophysical
observations.

Parametrizations are used to represent diabatic processes such as radiative

variability. Unlike traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) can readily
exploit recent observational datasets and global cloud-system resolving model
(CRM) simulations to learn subgrid variability. This article describes an NN
parametrization trained by coarse-graining a near-global CRM simulation with a
4~km horizontal grid spacing. The NN predicts the residual heating and
moistening averaged over (160 km)^2 grid boxes as a function of the
coarse-resolution fields within the same atmospheric column. This NN is coupled
to the dynamical core of a GCM with the same 160 km resolution. A recent study
described how to train such an NN to be numerically stable when coupled to
specified time-evolving advective forcings in a single column model, but
feedbacks between NN and GCM components cause spatially-extended simulations to
crash within a few days. Analyzing the linearized response of such an NN
reveals that it learns to exploit a strong synchrony between precipitation and
the atmospheric state above 10 km. Removing these variables from the NN's
inputs stabilizes the coupled simulations, which predict the future state more
accurately than a coarse-resolution simulation without any parametrizations of
sub-grid-scale variability, although the mean state slowly drifts.

  Estimates and Data Analysis",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several data analysis techniques employ similarity relationships between data
points to uncover the intrinsic dimension and geometric structure of the
underlying data-generating mechanism. In this paper we work under the model
assumption that the data is made of random perturbations of feature vectors
lying on a low-dimensional manifold. We study two questions: how to define the
similarity relationship over noisy data points, and what is the resulting
impact of the choice of similarity in the extraction of global geometric
information from the underlying manifold. We provide concrete mathematical
evidence that using a local regularization of the noisy data to define the
similarity improves the approximation of the hidden Euclidean distance between
unperturbed points. Furthermore, graph-based objects constructed with the
locally regularized similarity function satisfy better error bounds in their
recovery of global geometric ones. Our theory is supported by numerical
experiments that demonstrate that the gain in geometric understanding
facilitated by local regularization translates into a gain in classification
accuracy in simulated and real data.

can bring benefits in many real-life applications. In recent decade, a new
research field called utility-oriented mining has already attracted great
attention. Previous studies have, however, the limitation that they rarely
consider the inherent correlation of items among patterns. Consider the
purchase behaviors of consumer, a high-utility group of products (w.r.t.
multi-products) may contain several very high-utility products with some
low-utility products. However, it is considered as a valuable pattern even if
this behavior/pattern may be not highly correlated, or even happen by chance.
In this paper, in light of these challenges, we propose an efficient utility
mining approach namely non-redundant Correlated high-Utility Pattern Miner
(CoUPM) by taking positive correlation and profitable value into account. The
derived patterns with high utility and strong positive correlation can lead to
more insightful availability than those patterns only have high profitable
values. The utility-list structure is revised and applied to store necessary
information of both correlation and utility. Several pruning strategies are
further developed to improve the efficiency for discovering the desired
patterns. Experimental results show that the non-redundant correlated
high-utility patterns have more effectiveness than some other kinds of
interesting patterns. Moreover, efficiency of the proposed CoUPM algorithm
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm.

them. In this review we discuss the mass feeding mechanisms that lead to this
growth in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), focusing on constraints derived from
observations of their environment, from extragalactic down to galactic and
nuclear scales. At high AGN luminosities, galaxy mergers and interactions play
an important role in AGN triggering and feeding. However, gas chaotic cold
accretion (CCA) in galaxy clusters can trigger radiatively inefficient AGNs in
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). At lower luminosities, minor mergers feed
AGN in early-type, gas-starving galaxies, while secular processes dominate in
later-type, gas-rich galaxies. While bars do not appear to directly feed AGNs,
AGN flickering leads to the dissociation of small and large scales, hence
affecting the interpretation of cause and effect. At ~ 100 pc scales, recent
observations have revealed compact disks and inflows along nuclear gaseous
spirals and bars, while CCA continues to feed BCGs at these scales. Estimated
mass inflow rates - of 0.01 to a few Msun/yr - are in many cases thousand times
higher than the mass accretion rate to the supermassive black hole. As a
result, 10^6 - 10^9 Msun gas reservoirs can be built on 10^{7-8} yr, that in
turn may lead to the formation of new stars and/or be ejected via the onset of
AGN feedback.

in highly-branched media requires the use of numerical solutions, as problems
can quickly become intractable due to the number of pathways available. This
becomes even more challenging in dynamic scenarios where the generation of
pathways can quickly become a combinatorial problem. In this work, we develop a
new constriction percolation paradigm, using cellular automata to predict the
transport of oxygen through a stochastically cracked Zr oxide layer within a
coupled diffusion-reaction framework. We simulate such branching trees by
generating a series porosity-controlled media. Additionally, we develop an
analytical criterion based on compressive yielding for bridging the transition
state in corrosion regime, where the percolation threshold has been achieved.
Our model extends Dijkstras shortest path method to constriction pathways and
predicts the arrival rate of oxygen ions at the oxide interface. This is a
critical parameter to predict oxide growth in the so-called post-transition
regime, when bulk diffusion is no longer the rate-limiting phenomenon.

integrators preserve the Poincar\'e invariants of Hamiltonian dynamics. The
$N$-body Hamiltonian has another, perhaps overlooked, symmetry: it is smooth,
or, in other words, it has infinite differentiability class order (DCO) for
particle separations greater than $0$. Popular symplectic integrators, such as
hybrid methods or block adaptive stepping methods do not come from smooth
Hamiltonians and it is perhaps unclear whether they should. We investigate the
importance of this symmetry by considering hybrid integrators, whose DCO can be
tuned easily. Hybrid methods are smooth, except at a finite number of phase
space points. We study chaotic planetary orbits in a test considered by Wisdom.
We find that increasing smoothness, at negligible extra computational cost in
particular tests, improves the Jacobi constant error of the orbits by about $5$
orders of magnitude in long-term simulations. The results from this work
suggest that smoothness of the $N$-body Hamiltonian is a property worth

canceled out by anti-symmetry of the kernel, while the signal distortion under

to the drastic variation of object scales. The prevalence of deep learning has
largely boosted the object counting accuracy on several benchmark datasets.
However, does the global counts really count? Armed with this question we dive
into the predicted density map whose summation over the whole regions reports
the global counts for more in-depth analysis. We observe that the object
density map generated by most existing methods usually lacks of local
consistency, i.e., counting errors in local regions exist unexpectedly even
though the global count seems to well match with the ground-truth. Towards this
problem, in this paper we propose a constrained multi-stage Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) to jointly pursue locally consistent density map from
two aspects. Different from most existing methods that mainly rely on the
multi-column architectures of plain CNNs, we exploit a stacking formulation of
plain CNNs. Benefited from the internal multi-stage learning process, the
feature map could be repeatedly refined, allowing the density map to approach
the ground-truth density distribution. For further refinement of the density
map, we also propose a grid loss function. With finer local-region-based
supervisions, the underlying model is constrained to generate locally
consistent density values to minimize the training errors considering both the
global and local counts accuracy. Experiments on two widely-tested object
counting benchmarks with overall significant results compared with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

the blur kernels are unknown. We draw the observation that kernel mismatch
could bring regular artifacts (either over-sharpening or over-smoothing), which
can be applied to correct inaccurate blur kernels. Thus we introduce an
iterative correction scheme -- IKC that achieves better results than direct
kernel estimation. We further propose an effective SR network architecture
using spatial feature transform (SFT) layers to handle multiple blur kernels,
named SFTMD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images show that
the proposed IKC method with SFTMD can provide visually favorable SR results

the task of monocular depth estimation. A fundamental yet unanswered question
is: how CNNs can infer depth from a single image. Toward answering this
question, we consider visualization of inference of a CNN by identifying
relevant pixels of an input image to depth estimation. We formulate it as an
optimization problem of identifying the smallest number of image pixels from
which the CNN can estimate a depth map with the minimum difference from the
estimate from the entire image. To cope with a difficulty with optimization
through a deep CNN, we propose to use another network to predict those relevant

effectiveness of this approach, and then apply it to different depth estimation
networks on indoor and outdoor scene datasets. The results provide several
findings that help exploration of the above question.

associated with a Fano like resonance is proposed. The proposed designed of the
metamaterial absorber consists of photoresist disk arrays on a silicon
substrate followed by the deposition of a tri layer of Au, ZnS and Au on the
top of the structure. Due to the tri layer, there is a formation of a cavity
between the substrate and gold layer on the top of photoresist disk and a
waveguide in the ZnS layer in between the gold layers on the substrate and the
ZnS layer itself. The Fano like resonance arises due to the interference of the
cavity mode and the guided-mode resonance as well as the Woods anomaly. The
cavity mode resonance works as continuum mode whereas the guided mode resonance
and Woods anomaly work as discrete modes. The spectral position of the
resonance can be tuned by just controlling the thickness of the tri layer
instead of the structural size and shape modification of the micro and
nano-structures as usually done in conventional metamaterial absorbers. This
design can be easily scaled for fabrication over large areas as it separates
the structuring and deposition processes and makes them sequential thereby
avoiding expensive and complex lift off or etching processes which are usually
required for conventional metamaterial processing.

program transformations. This iterative approach hides optimization
opportunities behind intermediate transformation steps. For instance,
vectorization can only be applied to the innermost loop in a nest: one must
first perform a loop interchange before even considering vectorization of an
outer loop. In contrast, we propose an implementation framework representing
programs as sets of possible implementation decisions. Specifying one decision
can have an impact on others in a bidirectional manner: specifying that a loop
must be vectorized prevents other loops from being nested inside it;
conversely, specifying a loop as an outer loop will prevent it from being
vectorized. These optimization decisions commute, obviating the pass ordering
problem. We present a constraint programming system to formally define,
represent and explore such implementation spaces. We also propose an
exploration strategy combining tree search and branch-and-bound; the strength
and novelty of this strategy reside in an analytical model of the lower bound
on the execution time of a set of possible implementations. We showcase our

that the standard dropout is ineffective or even detrimental to the training of

stochasticity of dropout and its following Batch Normalization (BN), and
propose to reduce the conflict by placing dropout operations right before the
convolutional operation instead of BN, or totally address this issue by
replacing BN with Group Normalization (GN). We further introduce a structurally
more suited dropout variant Drop-Conv2d, which provides more efficient and
effective regularization for deep CNNs. These dropout variants can be readily
integrated into the building blocks of CNNs and implemented in existing deep
learning platforms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
CIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet are conducted to compare the existing building blocks
and the proposed ones with dropout training. Results show that our building
blocks improve over state-of-the-art CNNs significantly, which is mainly due to
the better regularization and implicit model ensemble effect.

obtained damped variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm d}$) and amplitude
($\sigma_{\rm d}$) using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We also
estimated the traditional variability amplitudes ($F_{\rm var}$), which provide
a model-independent measure and therefore are used to test the DRW results. We
found that AGN variability characteristics are generally correlated with
$(M_{\bullet},\dot{\mathscr{M}},L_{5100})$. These correlations are smooth from
sub-Eddington to super-Eddington accretion AGNs, probably implying that the AGN
variability may be caused by the same physical mechanism.

  Data-to-Text Generation","9 main pages, 10 appendix pages",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data-to-text generation can be conceptually divided into two parts: ordering
and structuring the information (planning), and generating fluent language
describing the information (realization). Modern neural generation systems
conflate these two steps into a single end-to-end differentiable system. We
propose to split the generation process into a symbolic text-planning stage
that is faithful to the input, followed by a neural generation stage that
focuses only on realization. For training a plan-to-text generator, we present
a method for matching reference texts to their corresponding text plans. For
inference time, we describe a method for selecting high-quality text plans for
new inputs. We implement and evaluate our approach on the WebNLG benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that decoupling text planning from neural realization
indeed improves the system's reliability and adequacy while maintaining fluent
output. We observe improvements both in BLEU scores and in manual evaluations.
Another benefit of our approach is the ability to output diverse realizations
of the same input, paving the way to explicit control over the generated text
structure.

lies in predicting the total count based on any observed partial counts, along
with a robust quantification of uncertainty. In this article we discuss
previous approaches to modelling delayed reporting and present a multivariate
hierarchical framework where the count generating process and delay mechanism
are modelled simultaneously. Unlike other approaches, the framework can also be
easily adapted to allow for the presence of under-reporting in the final
observed count. To compare our approach with existing frameworks, one of which
we extend to potentially improve predictive performance, we present a case

within-sample and out-of-sample posterior predictive model checking and
arguments of interpretability, adaptability, and computational efficiency, we
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each modelling framework.

being a theoretical concept with an infinite number of antennas to a practical
technology. The key concepts are adopted in 5G and base stations (BSs) with
$M=64$ full-digital transceivers have been commercially deployed in sub-6\,GHz
bands. The fast progress was enabled by many solid research contributions of
which the vast majority assume spatially uncorrelated channels and signal
processing schemes developed for single-cell operation. These assumptions make
the performance analysis and optimization of Massive MIMO tractable but have
three major caveats: 1) practical channels are spatially correlated; 2) large
performance gains can be obtained by multicell processing, without BS
cooperation; 3) the interference caused by pilot contamination creates a finite
capacity limit, as $M\to\infty$. There is a thin line of papers that avoided
these caveats, but the results are easily missed. Hence, this tutorial article
explains the importance of considering spatial channel correlation and using
signal processing schemes designed for multicell networks. We present recent
results on the fundamental limits of Massive MIMO, which are not determined by
pilot contamination but the ability to acquire channel statistics. These
results will guide the journey towards the next level of Massive MIMO, which we

time-domain generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, we extend a
previous GAN-based speech enhancement system to deal with mixtures of four
types of aggressive distortions. Firstly, we propose the addition of an
adversarial acoustic regression loss that promotes a richer feature extraction
at the discriminator. Secondly, we also make use of a two-step adversarial
training schedule, acting as a warm up-and-fine-tune sequence. Both objective
and subjective evaluations show that these two additions bring improved speech
reconstructions that better match the original speaker identity and
naturalness.

is at the core of many applications in robotics and computer vision. Current
state-of-the-art formulate this problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, in
which a historical of 3D skeletons feeds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that
predicts future movements, typically in the order of 1 to 2 seconds. However,
one aspect that has been obviated so far, is the fact that human motion is
inherently driven by interactions with objects and/or other humans in the
environment. In this paper, we explore this scenario using a novel
context-aware motion prediction architecture. We use a semantic-graph model
where the nodes parameterize the human and objects in the scene and the edges
their mutual interactions. These interactions are iteratively learned through a
graph attention layer, fed with the past observations, which now include both
object and human body motions. Once this semantic graph is learned, we inject
it to a standard RNN to predict future movements of the human/s and object/s.
We consider two variants of our architecture, either freezing the contextual
interactions in the future of updating them. A thorough evaluation in the
""Whole-Body Human Motion Database"" shows that in both cases, our context-aware
networks clearly outperform baselines in which the context information is not
considered.

visual extinction increases, since certain chemical timescales are comparable
to the cloud lifetime. Dust temperature is also a key factor, since it
significantly influences gas temperature and mobility on dust grains,
determining the chemistry occurring on grain surfaces. We present a study of
the dust temperature impact and time effects on the chemistry of different
PDRs, using an updated version of the Meijerink PDR code and combining it with
the time-dependent code Nahoon. We find the largest temperature effects in the
inner regions of high $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs, where high dust temperatures
favour the formation of simple oxygen-bearing molecules (especially that of
O$_2$), while the formation of complex organic molecules is much more efficient
at low dust temperatures. We also find that time-dependent effects strongly
depend on the PDR type, since long timescales promote the destruction of
oxygen-bearing molecules in the inner parts of low $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs,
while favouring their formation and that of carbon-bearing molecules in high
$G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs. From the chemical evolution, we also conclude that, in
dense PDRs, CO$_2$ is a late-forming ice compared to water ice, and confirm a
layered ice structure on dust grains, with H$_2$O in lower layers than CO$_2$.
Regarding steady state, the PDR edge reaches chemical equilibrium at early
times ($\lesssim$10$^5$ yr). This time is even shorter ($<$10$^4$ yr) for high
$G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs. By contrast, inner regions reach equilibrium much
later, especially low $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs, where steady state is reached at
$\sim$10$^6$-10$^7$ yr.

standardization within mini-batches. Decorrelated Batch Normalization (DBN)
further boosts the above effectiveness by whitening. However, DBN relies
heavily on either a large batch size, or eigen-decomposition that suffers from

employs Newton's iterations for much more efficient whitening, while
simultaneously avoiding the eigen-decomposition. Furthermore, we develop a
comprehensive study to show IterNorm has better trade-off between optimization
and generalization, with theoretical and experimental support. To this end, we
exclusively introduce Stochastic Normalization Disturbance (SND), which
measures the inherent stochastic uncertainty of samples when applied to
normalization operations. With the support of SND, we provide natural
explanations to several phenomena from the perspective of optimization, e.g.,
why group-wise whitening of DBN generally outperforms full-whitening and why
the accuracy of BN degenerates with reduced batch sizes. We demonstrate the
consistently improved performance of IterNorm with extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over BN and DBN.

sensation of flow in listeners and the desire to synchronize body movements
with the music. Whether microtiming deviations (MTDs), i.e. small timing
deviations below the bar or phrase level, enhance the feeling of swing is
highly debated in the current literature. Studies on other groove related
genres did not find evidence for a positive impact of MTDs. The present study
addresses jazz music and swing in particular, as there is some evidence that
microtiming patterns are genre-specific. We recorded twelve piano jazz
standards played by a professional pianist and manipulated the natural MTDs of
the recordings in systematic ways by quantizing, expanding and inverting them.
MTDs were defined with respect to a grid determined by the average swing ratio.
The original and manipulated versions were presented in an online survey and
evaluated by 160 listeners with various musical skill levels and backgrounds.
Across pieces the quantized versions (without MTDs) were rated slightly higher
and versions with expanded MTDs were rated lower with regard to swing than the
original recordings. Unexpectedly, inversion had no impact on swing ratings
except for two pieces. Our results suggest that naturally fluctuating MTDs are
not an essential factor for the feeling of swing.

  Approach","36 pages",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Providing real time information about the arrival time of the transit buses
has become inevitable in urban areas to make the system more user-friendly and
advantageous over various other transportation modes. However, accurate
prediction of arrival time of buses is still a challenging problem in
dynamically varying traffic conditions especially under heterogeneous traffic
condition without lane discipline. One broad approach researchers have adopted
over the years is to segment the entire bus route into segments and work with
these segment travel times as the data input (from GPS traces) for prediction.
This paper adopts this approach and proposes predictive modelling approaches
which fully exploit the temporal correlations in the bus GPS data.
Specifically, we propose two approaches: (a) classical time-series approach
employing a seasonal AR model (b)unconventional linear, non-stationary AR
approach. The second approach is a novel technique and exploits the notion of
partial correlation for learning from data. A detailed analysis of the marginal
distributions of the data from Indian conditions (used here), revealed a
predominantly log-normal behavior. This aspect was incorporated into the above
proposed predictive models and statistically optimal prediction schemes in the
lognormal sense are utilized for all predictions. Both the above temporal
predictive modeling approaches predict ahead in time at each segment
independently. For real-time bus travel time prediction, one however needs to
predict across multiple segments ahead in space. Towards a complete solution,
the study also proposes an intelligent procedure to perform (real-time)
multi-section ahead travel-time predictions based on either of the above
proposed temporal models. Results showed a clear improvement in prediction
accuracy using the proposed methods,

finding geodesics and study of generative models. In the case of geodesics, we
search for the curves with the shortest length, while in the case of generative
models we typically apply linear interpolation in the latent space. However,
this interpolation uses implicitly the fact that Gaussian is unimodal. Thus the
problem of interpolating in the case when the latent density is non-Gaussian is
an open problem.
  In this paper, we present a general and unified approach to interpolation,
which simultaneously allows us to search for geodesics and interpolating curves
in latent space in the case of arbitrary density. Our results have a strong
theoretical background based on the introduced quality measure of an
interpolating curve. In particular, we show that maximising the quality measure
of the curve can be equivalently understood as a search of geodesic for a
certain redefinition of the Riemannian metric on the space.
  We provide examples in three important cases. First, we show that our
approach can be easily applied to finding geodesics on manifolds. Next, we
focus our attention in finding interpolations in pre-trained generative models.
We show that our model effectively works in the case of arbitrary density.
Moreover, we can interpolate in the subset of the space consisting of data
possessing a given feature. The last case is focused on finding interpolation
in the space of chemical compounds.

distillation for G2P conversion, which can (1) boost the accuracy by distilling
the knowledge from additional unlabeled data, and (2) reduce the model size but
maintain the high accuracy, both of which are very practical and helpful in the
online production system. We use token-level knowledge distillation, which
results in better accuracy than the sequence-level counterpart. What is more,
we adopt the Transformer instead of RNN or CNN based models to further boost
the accuracy of G2P conversion. Experiments on the publicly available CMUDict

between amateur sketch and photo, and (ii) the necessity for moving towards
large-scale retrieval. We first contribute to the community a novel ZS-SBIR
dataset, QuickDraw-Extended, that consists of 330,000 sketches and 204,000

are purposefully sourced to maximize the domain gap, instead of ones included
in existing datasets that can often be semi-photorealistic. We then formulate a
ZS-SBIR framework to jointly model sketches and photos into a common embedding

specifically engineered to alleviate the domain gap. External semantic
knowledge is further embedded to aid semantic transfer. We show that, rather
surprisingly, retrieval performance significantly outperforms that of

minimizing a function of expected cost with a matrix argument. To this problem,
one of the most widely applied solution paradigms is the sample average
approximation (SAA), which uses the average cost over sampled scenarios as a
surrogate to approximate the expected cost. Traditional SAA theories require
the sample size to grow rapidly when the problem dimensionality increases.
Indeed, for a problem of optimizing over a $p$-by-$p$ matrix, the sample
complexity of the SAA is given by $\tilde O(1)\cdot
\frac{p^2}{\epsilon^2}\cdot{polylog}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-suboptimality gap, for some poly-logarithmic function
${polylog}(\,\cdot\,)$ and some quantity $\tilde O(1)$ independent of
dimensionality $p$ and sample size $n$. In contrast, this paper considers a
regularized SAA (RSAA) with a low-rankness-inducing penalty. We demonstrate
that the sample complexity of RSAA is $\tilde O(1)\cdot
\frac{p}{\epsilon^3}\cdot {polylog}(p,\,\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is almost
linear in $p$ and thus indicates a substantially lower dependence on
dimensionality. Therefore, RSAA can be more advantageous than SAA especially
for larger scale and higher dimensional problems. Due to the close
correspondence between stochastic programming and statistical learning, our
results also indicate that high-dimensional low-rank matrix recovery is
possible generally beyond a linear model, even if the common assumption of
restricted strong convexity is completely absent.

standard operation in any modern graph-mining toolkit. $k$-core decomposition
is a simple and efficient method that allows to analyze a graph beyond its mere
degree distribution. More specifically, it is used to identify areas in the
graph of increasing centrality and connectedness, and it allows to reveal the
structural organization of the graph.
  Despite the fact that $k$-core analysis relies on vertex degrees, $k$-cores
do not satisfy a certain, rather natural, density property. Simply put, the
most central $k$-core is not necessarily the densest subgraph. This
inconsistency between $k$-cores and graph density provides the basis of our
study.
  We start by defining what it means for a subgraph to be locally-dense, and we
show that our definition entails a nested chain decomposition of the graph,
similar to the one given by $k$-cores, but in this case the components are
arranged in order of increasing density. We show that such a locally-dense
decomposition for a graph $G=(V,E)$ can be computed in polynomial time. The
running time of the exact decomposition algorithm is $O(|V|^2|E|)$ but is
significantly faster in practice. In addition, we develop a linear-time
algorithm that provides a factor-2 approximation to the optimal locally-dense
decomposition. Furthermore, we show that the $k$-core decomposition is also a
factor-2 approximation, however, as demonstrated by our experimental
evaluation, in practice $k$-cores have different structure than locally-dense
subgraphs, and as predicted by the theory, $k$-cores are not always
well-aligned with graph density.

increasing the model depth with finer-scale levels cannot improve the quality
of deblurring. To tackle the above problems, we present a deep hierarchical
multi-patch network inspired by Spatial Pyramid Matching to deal with blurry

performance saturation w.r.t. depth, we propose a stacked version of our
multi-patch model. Our proposed basic multi-patch model achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the GoPro dataset while enjoying a 40x faster
runtime compared to current multi-scale methods. With 30ms to process an image

1.2dB) are achieved on the GoPro dataset by increasing the network depth.
Moreover, by varying the depth of the stacked model, one can adapt the

large numbers of annotated data for their training in the first place. In this
paper, we propose a novel less-costly hallucination method for few-shot
learning which utilizes saliency maps. To this end, we employ a saliency
network to obtain the foregrounds and backgrounds of available image samples
and feed the resulting maps into a two-stream network to hallucinate datapoints
directly in the feature space from viable foreground-background combinations.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage saliency maps for
such a task and we demonstrate their usefulness in hallucinating additional
datapoints for few-shot learning. Our proposed network achieves the state of

their updates over the network using CSMA/CA protocol. We investigate the age
of information of the spreading process from a transmitter perspective, which
is referred to as the \textit{broadcast age of information (BAoI)}. To be
specific, BAoI is the age of the latest update successfully broadcasted to the
one-hop neighbors of a node, and thus is suitable to measure the rapidity of
the update spreading process. We establish an equivalent transmission model of
the network by deriving the transmission probability and the collision
probability of nodes. With this equivalent model, we then present the average
BAoI of the network explicitly. Our results present the scaling laws of average
BAoI with respect to node density and frame length, and are further illustrated
through numerical results. As is shown, the average BAoI is increasing with
node density and is convex in frame length, i.e., would be large when frame
length is very small or very large.

for how words interact in a sentence in order to produce the meaning of that
sentence. To do so, we exploited the perfect structural match of grammar and
categories of meaning spaces. Here, we give a mathematical foundation, referred
to as DisCoCirc, for how sentences interact in texts in order to produce the
meaning of that text. First we revisit DisCoCat. While in DisCoCat all meanings
are fixed as states (i.e. have no input), in DisCoCirc word meanings correspond
to a type, or system, and the states of this system can evolve. Sentences are
gates within a circuit which update the variable meanings of those words. Like
in DisCoCat, word meanings can live in a variety of spaces e.g. propositional,
vectorial, or cognitive. The compositional structure are string diagrams
representing information flows, and an entire text yields a single string
diagram in which word meanings lift to the meaning of an entire text. While the
developments in this paper are independent of a physical embodiment (cf.
classical vs. quantum computing), both the compositional formalism and
suggested meaning model are highly quantum-inspired, and implementation on a
quantum computer would come with a range of benefits. We also praise Jim Lambek
for his role in mathematical linguistics in general, and the development of the
DisCo program more specifically.

Navigation Camera onboard Hayabusa2 show a unique longitudinal variation in

western bulge. Applying the mission-derived shape model, we employ a finite
element model technique to analyze the locations that experience structural
failure within the present shape. Assuming that materials are uniformly
distributed, our model shows the longitudinal variation in structurally failed
regions when the spin period is shorter than ~3.75 h. Ryugu is structurally
intact in the subsurface region of the western bulge while other regions are
sensitive to structural failure. We infer that this variation is indicative of
the deformation process that occurred in the past, and the western bulge is
more relaxed structurally than the other region. Our analysis also shows that
this deformation process might occur at a spin period between ~3.5 h and ~3.0
h, providing the cohesive strength ranging between ~4 Pa and ~10 Pa.

a superposed two-state quantum system is often considered paradoxical because
it appears to predict two macroscopically different outcomes, such as an alive
and dead cat. However, nonlocal interferometry experiments testing
momentum-entangled photon pairs over all phases demonstrate that the cat state
does not fit this description and is not paradoxical. Both experiment and
theory imply that it instead represents a superposition of two nonlocally
coherent (i.e. phase-dependent) statistical correlations between its
sub-systems. This is not paradoxical. Standard quantum theory rigorously
predicts the experimentally-observed outcomes of this state. Neither sub-system
is superposed; rather, the correlations between the states of the subsystems
are superposed. This resolves the problem of definite outcomes. The nonlocal
properties of entanglement then ensure that only one outcome occurs while the
other outcome simultaneously does not occur, resolving a problem posed by
Einstein in 1927. The single outcome that occurs then triggers an irreversible
process leading to macroscopic registration of the outcome. This resolves the
quantum measurement problem. Collapse occurs because of entanglement and does
not require a special collapse postulate. Collapse is a consequence of standard
quantum physics and the irreversible nature of the macroscopic registration.

  Teams","Accepted at 1st International Workshop on Autonomous Teams (A-TEAMS),
  2018",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, software companies usually organize their work in teams. Social
science research on team development has shown that for a team to reach a
productive and autonomous stage, it has to be able to manage internal conflicts
and disagreements efficiently. To better facilitate the team development
process, we argue that software engineers' needs additional training in
negotiation skills and conflict resolution. In this position paper, we outline
ideas for what aspects to consider in such training. As an example, we argue
that a majority of the conflicts originate from team-level factors and that
they, therefore, should be managed on the team-level instead of in relation to
dyads.

paper origami. The mechanics of a single paper crease is studied
experimentally, and its non-elastic properties turn out to be crucial. The
entire origami construction is then described as a collection of individual
creases, its capability to launch small objects is evaluated, and the equation
of motion is found. Thus, the height of the launched ball is studied
theoretically and experimentally as a function of governing parameters.

intelligence (AI) applications to general ophthalmology, comparatively less
progress has been made toward solving problems in pediatric ophthalmology using
similar techniques. This article discusses the unique needs of pediatric
ophthalmology patients and how AI techniques can address these challenges,
surveys recent applications of AI to pediatric ophthalmology, and discusses
future directions in the field.
  RECENT FINDINGS: The most significant advances involve the automated
detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yielding results that rival
experts. Machine learning (ML) has also been successfully applied to the
classification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of post-operative
complications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and
refractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading
disability via eye tracking. In addition, ML techniques have been used for the
study of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images,
and ophthalmic image synthesis.
  SUMMARY: AI applications could significantly benefit clinical care for
pediatric ophthalmology patients by optimizing disease detection and grading,
broadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving
clinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician
performance in clinical trials before deployment with patients. Due to
widespread use of closed-access data sets and software implementations, it is
difficult to directly compare the performance of these approaches, and
reproducibility is poor. Open-access data sets and software implementations
could alleviate these issues, and encourage further AI applications to
pediatric ophthalmology.

and connect it to the agile software development context. Furthermore, I
propose additional theories from social psychology (mainly the theory of

would most certainly be useful for further sense-making of human
factors-related research on agile teams.

Adoption Framework can be used to assess agility and pinpoint focus areas for
companies that want to improve. Management found it useful in general to get
data on possible focus points for improvement in their agile transformation. We
believe the suggested tool could be useful as one step in the agile process
assessment.

It elicits its potential by generation of ROS, leading to DNA, protein and
lipid damage. Therefore, the deleterious effect of arsenic can be mitigated by
quenching ROS using antioxidants. There is a homology between the protein
coding regions of mice and human. Effect of these alterations in human can be
mimicked in mice. Therefore to understand the underlying mechanism of arsenic
toxicity and its amelioration by black tea, studies have been conducted in mice
model. Long term exposure to iAs leads to tumour growth, which has been found
to be alleviated by black tea. Observations reveal that black tea has two
salutary effects on the growth of tumour: the rate of growth of damaged cells
was appreciably reduced and an early saturation of the level of damage is
achieved. To take the experimental findings further, the experimental data have
been modelled with simple dynamical equations. The curves obtained from
\textit{in vivo} studies have been fitted with the data obtained from the
model. The corresponding steady states and their stabilities are analyzed.

the variability through products in Software Product Lines (SPLs). Often, the
SPLs requirements variability is by using variable use case model which is a
real challenge in actual approaches: large gap between their concepts and those
of real world leading to bad quality, poor supporting FM, and the variability
does not cover all requirements modeling levels. Aims. This paper proposes a
bio-inspired use case variability modeling methodology dealing with the above
shortages. Method. The methodology is carried out through variable business
domain use case meta modeling, variable applications family use case meta
modeling, and variable specific application use case generating. Results. This
methodology has leaded to integrated solutions to the above challenges: it
decreases the gap between computing concepts and real world ones. It supports
use case variability modeling by introducing versions and revisions features
and related relations. The variability is supported at three meta levels
covering business domain, applications family, and specific application
requirements. Conclusion. A comparative evaluation with the closest recent
works, upon some meaningful criteria in the domain, shows the conceptual and
practical great value of the proposed methodology and leads to promising
research perspectives
