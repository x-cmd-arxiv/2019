given distribution. However, simultaneous estimation of means and quantiles has
received little attention, despite being common practice. In this setting we
establish a multivariate central limit theorem for any finite combination of
sample means and quantiles under the assumption of a strongly mixing process,
which includes the standard Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings.
We build on this to provide a fast algorithm for constructing hyperrectangular
confidence regions having the desired simultaneous coverage probability and a
convenient marginal interpretation. The methods are incorporated into standard
ways of visualizing the results of Monte Carlo experiments enabling the
practitioner to more easily assess the reliability of the results. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach in various Monte Carlo settings
including simulation studies based on independent and identically distributed
samples and Bayesian analyses using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.

large zero point amplitude by virtue of its light mass. Quantum mechanical
calculations of the host material usually treat the muon as a point impurity,
ignoring this large vibrational amplitude. As a first order correction, the
muon zero point motion is usually described within the harmonic approximation,
despite the large anharmonicity of the crystal potential. Here we apply the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, a quantum variational method
devised to include strong anharmonic effects in total energy and vibrational
frequency calculations, in order to overcome these limitations and provide an
accurate ab initio description of the quantum nature of the muon. We applied
this full quantum treatment to the calculation of the muon contact hyperfine
field in textbook-case metallic systems, such as Fe, Ni, Co including MnSi and
MnGe, significantly improving agreement with experiments. Our results show that
muon vibrational frequencies are strongly renormalized by anharmonicity.
Finally, in contrast to the harmonic approximation, we show that including
quantum anharmonic fluctuations, the muon stabilizes at the octahedral site in
bcc Fe.

us to directly impose the inequality constraints on each subface. The
convergence of the method is studied for several challenging geometries in 2d

  Linear Systems","46 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Randomized linear system solvers have become popular as they have the
potential to reduce floating point complexity while still achieving desirable
convergence rates. One particularly promising class of methods, random
sketching solvers, has achieved the best known computational complexity bounds
in theory, but is blunted by two practical considerations: there is no clear
way of choosing the size of the sketching matrix apriori; and there is a
nontrivial storage cost of the sketched system. In this work, we make progress
towards addressing these issues by implicitly generating the sketched system
and solving it simultaneously through an iterative procedure. As a result, we
replace the question of the size of the sketching matrix with determining
appropriate stopping criteria; we also avoid the costs of explicitly
representing the sketched linear system; and our implicit representation also
solves the system at the same time, which controls the per-iteration
computational costs.
  Additionally, our approach allows us to generate a connection between random
sketching methods and randomized iterative solvers (e.g., randomized Kaczmarz
method, randomized Gauss-Seidel). As a consequence, we exploit this connection
to (1) produce a stronger, more precise convergence theory for such randomized
iterative solvers under arbitrary sampling schemes (i.i.d., adaptive,
permutation, dependent, etc.), and (2) improve the rates of convergence of
randomized iterative solvers at the expense of a user-determined increases in
per-iteration computational and storage costs. We demonstrate these concepts on
numerical examples on forty-nine distinct linear systems.

induces a collapse transition of the trails from a swollen to a collapsed

the universality class of the adsorption transition changes; this is known as
the special adsorption point. Using flatPERM, a stochastic growth Monte Carlo
algorithm, we simulate the adsorption of self-avoiding interacting trails on
the square lattice using three different boundary scenarios which differ with
respect to the orientation of the boundary and the type of surface interaction.
We confirm the expected phase diagram, showing swollen, collapsed, and adsorbed
phases in all three scenarios, and confirm universality of the normal
adsorption transition at low values of the bulk interaction strength.
Intriguingly, we cannot confirm universality of the special adsorption

explanation is that this is due to the presence of strong corrections to
scaling at this point.

scale-dependence and decorrelation with the matter field are as predicted by
perturbation theory. Due to the low mass of the hosting halos, the impact of
fingers of god is small on the range relevant for proposed 21-cm instruments.
We show that baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions could

we only require that an adversarial user must not be able to cause an
undetected error on the honest users' messages. For the 2-user MAC, we show
that the following 3-phase scheme is rate-optimal: a standard MAC code is first
used to achieve unauthenticated communication followed by two authentication
phases where each user authenticates their message treating the other user as a
possible adversary. We show that the authentication phases can be very short
since this form of authentication itself, when possible, can be achieved for
message sets whose size grow doubly exponentially in blocklength. This leads to
our result that the authenticated communication capacity region of a discrete
memoryless MAC is either zero or the (unauthenticated) MAC capacity region
itself. This also, arguably, explains the similar nature of authenticated
communication capacity of a discrete memoryless point-to-point adversarial
channel recently found by Kosut and Kliewer (ITW, 2018).

In this paper we study the effect of interface steps on the magnitude and phase
of valley-orbit coupling for an electron in a silicon quantum dot. Within the
effective mass approximation, we find that the location of a step on the
interface is important in determining both the magnitude and the phase of the
valley-orbit coupling in a Si/SiGe quantum dot. Specifically, our numerical
results show that the magnitude of valley orbit coupling can be suppressed up
to 75\% by a step of one atomic monolayer, and its phase can change by almost
$\pi$. When two steps are present, the minimum value of the valley-orbit
coupling can even approach zero. We also clarify the effects of an applied

for gravity contributes to the energy density of the fluid with an extra term
that can be related to the deceleration parameter, providing a way to estimate
the value of the Rastall parameter, termed as $\xi \lambda$, at present time.
By adopting a specific Ansatz for the $\xi \lambda$ term it is possible to
determine that the behaviour of the Hubble parameter in Rastall gravity has a
similar aspect to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late times, but at thermodynamics
level differs from the standard cosmology since the adiabatic behaviour for the
entropy depends on the value of the parameter state, $\omega$. However, the
entropy has a positive growth and simultaneously its convexity condition can be
guaranteed; when other contributions are considered such as matter production
and chemical potential, the adiabatic expansion can not be achieved, but the
theory keeps its thermodynamics consistency. The chemical potential seems to
have an interesting role since at effective level we could have a cosmological
constant or phantom expansion in the model.

graph, which seeks a mapping of the graph vertices to the cycle vertices, so as
to minimize the maximum stretch of any edge, subject to the constraint that the
restriction of the mapping to the cycle is the identity map. This problem has
its roots in the rich theory of retraction of topological spaces, and has
strong ties to well-studied metric embedding problems such as minimum bandwidth
and 0-extension.
  Our first result is an O(min{k, sqrt{n}})-approximation for retracting any
graph on n nodes to a cycle with k nodes. We also show a surprising connection
to Sperner's Lemma that rules out the possibility of improving this result
using natural convex relaxations of the problem. Nevertheless, if the problem
is restricted to planar graphs, we show that we can overcome these integrality
gaps using an exact combinatorial algorithm, which is the technical centerpiece
of the paper. Building on our planar graph algorithm, we also obtain a
constant-factor approximation algorithm for retraction of points in the
Euclidean plane to a uniform cycle.

symmetric pattern of concentric rings to a chiral structure of a spiral shape,
when the system is in hexagonal confinement. We find that the spiral formation
can be induced either by breaking the system symmetry with a wedge, or by
melting of the rings. In the former case, the chirality of the spiral is
determined by orientation of the wedge and thus can be controlled. In the
latter, the spiral rises due to thermally induced defects and is absent in the
average particle distribution that form highly regular hexagonal patterns in
the central part of the system. These hexagonal patterns can be explained by
interference of planar density waves. Thermodynamic considerations indicate
that equilibrium spirals can appear spontaneously in any stripe-forming system
confined in a hexagon with a small wedge, provided that certain conditions are
satisfied by a set of phenomenological parameters.

on a standard dataset such as CIFAR-10 when its width --- namely, number of

internal layers --- is allowed to increase to infinity? Such questions have
come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning
and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep
learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper
[Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures
the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained
by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. An
attraction of such ideas is that a pure kernel-based method is used to capture
the power of a fully-trained deep net of infinite width.
  The current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm for computing the
extension of NTK to convolutional neural nets, which we call Convolutional NTK
(CNTK), as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This
results in a significant new benchmark for the performance of a pure
kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being $10\%$ higher than the methods reported
in [Novak et al., 2019], and only $6\%$ lower than the performance of the
corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization, etc. are
turned off). Theoretically, we also give the first non-asymptotic proof showing
that a fully-trained sufficiently wide net is indeed equivalent to the kernel
regression predictor using NTK.

potential violation of TUR in such quantum systems. Next, focusing on the
resonant transport regime we determine the parameter range in which the

simulations of a serial double quantum dot system. Most significantly, we
demonstrate that the TUR always holds in noninteracting thermoelectric

apparent paradox of quantum theory. They considered two quantum systems that
were initially allowed to interact, and were then later separated. A
measurement of a physical observable performed on one system then had to have
an immediate effect on the conjugate observable in the other system - even if
the systems were causally disconnected! The authors viewed this as a clear
indication of the inconsistency of quantum mechanics. In the parton model of
the nucleon formulated by Bjorken, Feynman, and Gribov, the partons (quarks and
gluons) are viewed by an external hard probe as independent. The standard
argument is that, inside the nucleon boosted to an infinite-momentum frame, the
parton probed by a virtual photon with virtuality Q is causally disconnected
from the rest of the nucleon during the hard interaction. Yet, the parton and
the rest of the nucleon have to form a colour-singlet state due to colour
confinement, and so have to be in strongly correlated quantum states - we thus
encounter the EPR paradox at the sub-nucleonic scale. In this paper, we propose
a resolution of this paradox based on the quantum entanglement of partons. We
devise an experimental test of entanglement, and carry it out using data on
proton-proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our results
provide a strong direct indication of quantum entanglement at sub-nucleonic

cross-section of the loops depends on their individual magnetic and geometric
properties. The intensity scales proportionally to the average field strength
along the loop ($B_{avg}$) and inversely with the loop length ($L$) for a
combined dependence of $(B_{avg}/L)^{0.52\pm0.13}$. These loop properties are
inferred from magnetic extrapolations of the photospheric HMI/SDO line-of-sight

Force-Free (NLFF) methods. Through hydrodynamic modeling (EBTEL model) we show
that this behavior is compatible with impulsively heated loops with a
volumetric heating rate that scales as $\epsilon_H\sim
B_{avg}^{0.3\pm0.2}/L^{0.2\pm^{0.2}_{0.1}}$.

systems where there is significant spin--orbit coupling does not yet exist.
After reviewing the quasiclassical theory for interfaces, we here solve this

dynamical evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To study the effects of
stellar feedback on the star formation efficiency of the clouds and the
dynamical response of embedded star clusters, we perform a suite of isolated
GMC simulations with star formation and momentum feedback subgrid models using
the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \textsc{Arepo}. The properties of our
simulated GMCs span a wide range of initial mass, radius, and velocity
configurations. We find that the ratio of the final stellar mass to the total
cloud mass, $\epsilon_{\rm int}$, scales strongly with the initial cloud
surface density and momentum feedback strength. This correlation is explained
by an analytic model that considers force balancing between gravity and
momentum feedback. For all simulated GMCs, the stellar density profiles are
systematically steeper than that of the gas at the epochs of the peaks of star
formation, suggesting a centrally concentrated stellar distribution. We also
find that star clusters are always in a sub-virial state with a virial
parameter $\sim0.6$ prior to gas expulsion. Both the sub-virial dynamical state
and steeper stellar density profiles prevent clusters from dispersal during the
gas removal phase of their evolution. The final cluster bound fraction is a
continuously increasing function of $\epsilon_{\rm int}$. GMCs with star

designing future exoplanet-imaging missions. Recent yield studies of
direct-imaging missions have focused primarily on yield methods and trade
studies using ""toy"" models of missions. Here we increase the fidelity of these
calculations substantially, adopting more realistic exoplanet demographics as
input, an improved target list, and a realistic distribution of exozodi levels.
Most importantly, we define standardized inputs for instrument simulations, use
these standards to directly compare the performance of realistic instrument
designs, include the sensitivity of coronagraph contrast to stellar diameter,
and adopt engineering-based throughputs and detector parameters. We apply these
new high-fidelity yield models to study several critical design trades:
monolithic vs segmented primary mirrors, on-axis vs off-axis secondary mirrors,
and coronagraphs vs starshades. We show that as long as the gap size between
segments is sufficiently small, there is no difference in yield for
coronagraph-based missions with monolithic off-axis telescopes and segmented
off-axis telescopes, assuming that the requisite engineering constraints
imposed by the coronagraph can be met in both scenarios. We show that there is
currently a factor of ~2 yield penalty for coronagraph-based missions with
on-axis telescopes compared to off-axis telescopes, and note that there is room
for improvement in coronagraph designs for on-axis telescopes. We also
reproduce previous results in higher fidelity showing that the yields of
coronagraph-based missions continue to increase with aperture size while the
yields of starshade-based missions turnover at large apertures if refueling is
not possible. Finally, we provide absolute yield numbers with uncertainties
that include all major sources of astrophysical noise to guide future mission
design.

based on a sample of pure elliptical galaxies at z $\le$ 0.08. We show that the
properties of the inner regions of Es with the largest luminosity (L$_r$) and
central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$) are consistent with those associated
with the commonly used Salpeter IMF, whereas a Kroupa-like IMF is a better
description at $\sim$ 0.8R/Re (assuming [Ti/Fe] variations are limited). For
these galaxies the stellar mass-to-light ratio decreases at most by a factor of
2 from the central regions to Re. In contrast, for lower L$_r$ and $\sigma_0$
galaxies, the IMF is shallower and M$_{*}$/L$_r$ in the central regions is
similar to the outskirts. Although a factor of 2 is smaller than previous
reports based on a handful of galaxies, it is still large enough to matter for
dynamical mass estimates. Accounting self-consistently for these gradients when
estimating both M$_{*}$ and M$_{dyn}$ brings the two into good agreement:
gradients reduce M$_{dyn}$ by $\sim$ 0.2 dex while only slightly increasing the
M$_{*}$ inferred using a Kroupa IMF. This is a different resolution of the
M$_{*}$-M$_{dyn}$ discrepancy than has been followed in the recent literature
where M$_{*}$ of massive galaxies is increased by adopting a Salpeter IMF while
leaving Mdyn unchanged. A companion paper discusses how stellar population
differences are even more pronounced if one separates slow from fast rotators.

parameterized through the NS maximum mass, $M_{\rm TOV}$, and characteristic

the identity of the merger remnant, can therefore constrain the values of

of EOS constraints from BNS mergers, introducing the ""Multi-Messenger Matrix"",
a mapping between GW and EM measurables that defines the ranges of event chirp

rich, less $\alpha$-enhanced and smaller than SRs of the same luminosity $L_r$

SRs and FRs, objects which are small for their $L_r$ and $\sigma_0$ tend to be
younger. Their SP gradients are also different. 2) Ignoring the FR/SR dichotomy
leads one to conclude that compact galaxies are older than their larger
counterparts of the same mass, even though almost the opposite is true for FRs
and SRs individually. 3) SRs with $\sigma_0\le 250$ km s$^{-1}$ are remarkably
homogeneous within $\sim R_e$: they are old, $\alpha$-enhanced and only
slightly super-solar in metallicity. These SRs show no gradients in age and
$M_*/L_r$, negative gradients in metallicity, and slightly positive gradients
in [$\alpha$/Fe] (the latter are model dependent). SRs with $\sigma_0\ge 250$
km $s^{-1}$ are slightly younger and more metal rich, contradicting previous
work suggesting that age increases with $\sigma_0$. They also show larger
$M_*/L_r$ gradients. 4) Self-consistently accounting for $M_*/L$ gradients
yields $M_{\rm dyn}\approx M_*$ because gradients reduce $M_{\rm dyn}$ by $\sim
0.2$ dex while only slightly increasing the $M_*$ inferred using a Kroupa (not
Salpeter) IMF. 5) The FR population all but disappears above $M_*\ge 3\times

other scaling relations change. Our results support the finding that this is an
important mass scale which correlates with the environment and above which

evolution of states under Hamiltonian dynamics constitutes a severe challenge

entanglement blowup, which allows to simulate systems following global quenches
only to constant time. In this work, we present a scheme that allows to
significantly extend the simulation time for interacting fermionic or
equivalent spin systems. In the past when keeping track of evolution in
one-dimensional real space, the subspace parametrised by real-space matrix
product states satisfying area laws - often dubbed the ""physical corner"" of
Hilbert space - was chosen as variational set. In contrast, if the manifold
containing both tensor network states and fermionic mode transformations is
chosen, significantly longer times can be achieved. We argue and our results
suggest that in many cases it is genuine correlations between modes that is the
actual limiting factor: The system at hand is for intermediate times contained
in the ""physical corner"", but a different one than what is commonly assumed.

applications. One strategy to solve them in an approximate way is to translate
them into a sequence of convex feasibility problems via the recently developed
level set scheme and then solve each feasibility problem using projection
methods. However, if the problem is ill-conditioned, projection methods often
show zigzagging behavior and therefore converge slowly.
  To address this issue, we exploit the bounded perturbation resilience of the
projection methods and introduce two new perturbations which avoid zigzagging
behavior. The first perturbation is in the spirit of $k$-step methods and uses
gradient information from previous iterates. The second uses the approach of
surrogate constraint methods combined with relaxed, averaged projections.
  We apply two different projection methods in the unperturbed version, as well
as the two perturbed versions, to linear feasibility problems along with
nonlinear optimization problems arising from intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) treatment planning. We demonstrate that for all the considered
problems the perturbations can significantly accelerate the convergence of the
projection methods and hence the overall procedure of the level set scheme. For
the IMRT optimization problems the perturbed projection methods found an
approximate solution up to 4 times faster than the unperturbed methods while at
the same time achieving objective function values which were 0.5 to 5.1% lower.

significant traction due to their ability to leverage in-memory computations.
In a crossbar structure, they can perform multiply-and-accumulate operations
more efficiently than standard CMOS logic. By virtue of being resistive
switches, ReRAM switches can only reliably store one of two states. This is a
severe limitation on the range of values in a computational kernel. This paper
presents a novel scheme in alleviating the single-bit-per-device restriction by
exploiting frequency dependence of v-i plane hysteresis, and assigning kernel
information not only to the device conductance but also partially distributing
it to the frequency of a time-varying input. We show this approach reduces
average power consumption for a single crossbar convolution by up to a factor
of x16 for an unsigned 8-bit input image, where each convolutional process
consumes a worst-case of 1.1mW, and reduces area by a factor of x8, without
reducing accuracy to the level of binarized neural networks. This presents a
massive saving in computing cost when there are many simultaneous in-situ
multiply-and-accumulate processes occurring across different crossbars.

sublinear in the distance. Denoting by $T(0,\partial B(n))$ the first-passage
time from $0$ to $\{x : \|x\|_\infty = n\}$, we show existence of the ""time

normalized variance, which is also only a function of $I$, under the optimal

completion: from an incomplete RGB-D scan of a scene, we aim to detect the

open up new possibilities for interactions with objects in a scene, for
instance for virtual or robotic agents. We tackle this problem by introducing
RevealNet, a new data-driven approach that jointly detects object instances and

selected categorical features, and depend linearly on the other features. In a
basic and traditional formulation a separate model is fit for each value of the
categorical feature, using only the data that has the specific categorical
value. To this formulation we add Laplacian regularization, which encourages
the model parameters for neighboring categorical values to be similar.
Laplacian regularization allows us to specify one or more weighted graphs on
the stratification feature values. For example, stratifying over the days of
the week, we can specify that the Sunday model parameter should be close to the
Saturday and Monday model parameters. The regularization improves the
performance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the model
for each value of the categorical `borrows strength' from its neighbors. In
particular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appear
in the training data set.
  We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models,
based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When the
fitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem is
convex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plus
regularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method is
very efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers of
stratified feature values. We illustrate our method with a variety of examples.

stream in tidal disruption events (TDEs). When the initial periapsis is less
than about 15 gravitational radii, a large fraction of the shocked gas is
unbound in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because large
apsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape
speed at radius much below the apocenter. The rest of the fallback gas is left
in more tightly bound orbits and quickly joins the accretion flow. We propose
that the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission from the
accretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large
photospheric radius (or low blackbody temperature) and typical widths of the H
and/or He emission lines seen in optical TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed
spectrum in the infrared to be L_\nu ~ \nu^{~0.5}, shallower than a blackbody.
The partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the diverse
X-ray behaviors of optical TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys
filter out a large fraction of TDEs with low-mass blackholes due to lack of a
reprocessing layer, and the volumetric rate of optical TDEs is nearly flat wrt.
the blackhole mass for M < 10^7 solar masses. This filtering causes the optical
TDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ~10 or more. When the
CIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at the level of that
in ASASSN-14li may be produced, but the timescales and peak luminosities can be
highly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the
disk formation process by injecting gas at the intersection point according to
the prescribed velocity and density profiles.

been widely used for video analysis. However, for video face recognition, where
the base CNNs trained on large-scale data already provide discriminative
features, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a popular recurrent network, for
feature learning could lead to overfitting and degrade the performance instead.
We propose a Recurrent Embedding Aggregation Network (REAN) for set to set face
recognition. Compared with LSTM, REAN is robust against overfitting because it
only learns how to aggregate the pre-trained embeddings rather than learning
representations from scratch. Compared with quality-aware aggregation methods,
REAN can take advantage of the context information to circumvent the noise
introduced by redundant video frames. Empirical results on three public domain
video face recognition datasets, IJB-S, YTF, and PaSC show that the proposed
REAN significantly outperforms naive CNN-LSTM structure and quality-aware
aggregation methods.

their photometric properties with overlapping catalogs and discuss their

bursts of electromagnetic radiation but as the entire process in which magnetic
energy is released through magnetic reconnection and plasma instability,
emanate from active regions (ARs) in which high magnetic non-potentiality
resides in a wide variety of forms. This review focuses on the formation and
evolution of flare-productive ARs from both observational and theoretical
points of view. Starting from a general introduction of the genesis of ARs and
solar flares, we give an overview of the key observational features during the
long-term evolution in the pre-flare state, the rapid changes in the magnetic
field associated with the flare occurrence, and the physical mechanisms behind
these phenomena. Our picture of flare-productive ARs is summarized as follows:
subject to the turbulent convection, the rising magnetic flux in the interior
deforms into a complex structure and gains high non-potentiality; as the flux
appears on the surface, an AR with large free magnetic energy and helicity is
built, which is represented by delta-sunspots, sheared polarity inversion
lines, magnetic flux ropes, etc; the flare occurs when sufficient magnetic
energy has accumulated, and the drastic coronal evolution affects magnetic
fields even in the photosphere. We show that the improvement of observational
instruments and modeling capabilities has significantly advanced our
understanding in the last decades. Finally, we discuss the outstanding issues
and future perspective and further broaden our scope to the possible
applications of our knowledge to space-weather forecasting, extreme events in
history, and corresponding stellar activities.

excitations via an encoding into error detecting codes, supplemented with an
energy penalty formed from a sum of commuting Hamiltonian terms. Earlier work
showed that it is possible to suppress the initial thermally induced excitation
out of the encoded ground state, in the case of local Markovian environments,
by using an energy penalty strength that grows only logarithmically in the
system size, at a fixed temperature. The question of whether this result
applies beyond the initial time was left open. Here we answer this in the
affirmative. We show that thermal excitations out of the encoded ground state
can be suppressed at arbitrary times under the additional assumption that the
total evolution time is polynomial in the system size. Thus, computational
problems that can be solved efficiently using AQC in a closed system setting,
can still be solved efficiently subject to coupling to a thermal environment.
Our construction uses stabilizer subspace codes, which require at least
$4$-local interactions to achieve this result.

complex Sh2-235 (S235) to better understand in detail the origin of [CII]
emission. We complement these data with a fully-sampled Green Bank Telescope
radio recombination line map tracing the ionized hydrogen gas. About half of
the total [CII] emission associated with S235 is spatially coincident with
ionized hydrogen gas, although spectroscopic analysis shows little evidence
that this emission is coming from the ionized hydrogen volume.
Velocity-integrated [CII] intensity is strongly correlated with WISE 12um
intensity across the entire complex, indicating that both trace ultra-violet
radiation fields. The 22um and radio continuum intensities are only correlated
with [CII] intensity in the ionized hydrogen portion of the S235 region and the
correlations between the [CII] and molecular gas tracers are poor across the
region. We find similar results for emission averaged over a sample of external
galaxies, although the strength of the correlations is weaker. Therefore,
although many tracers are correlated with the strength of [CII] emission, only
WISE 12um emission is correlated on small-scales of the individual HII region

that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the closed field line
zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal
slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle
acceleration and pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission
similar to that generated near pulsar polar caps. We argue that the energetics
of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of the conversion
of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values
consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and
radio-loud magnetars. Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with
preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere, so that the charge density in the
closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field provoked by
the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\sim 1$ GHz
radio emission escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs
from known magnetars. The pair cascades crowd the closed flux tubes with
plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting the radio
pulse duration to $\sim1$ ms. Within the framework of our model, the current
dataset of the polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic
obliquity $\alpha\lesssim40^\circ$ and viewing angle $\zeta$ with respect to
the spin axis $\alpha<\zeta<180^\circ-\alpha$.

Quantum frequency conversion can overcome this issue, particularly if

applications over the years. Cornerstone results in this area from the late 80s
and early 90s state that for any $d$-dimensional $n$-point Euclidean space,
there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with $nO(\epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and
lightness $O(\epsilon^{-2d})$. Surprisingly, the fundamental question of
whether or not these dependencies on $\epsilon$ and $d$ for small $d$ can be
improved has remained elusive, even for $d = 2$. This question naturally arises
in any application of Euclidean spanners where precision is a necessity.
  The state-of-the-art bounds $nO(\epsilon^{-d+1})$ and $O(\epsilon^{-2d})$ on
the size and lightness of spanners are realized by the {\em greedy} spanner. In
2016, Filtser and Solomon proved that, in low dimensional spaces, the greedy
spanner is near-optimal. The question of whether the greedy spanner is truly
optimal remained open to date.
  The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We resolve these longstanding
questions by nailing down the exact dependencies on $\epsilon$ and $d$ and
showing that the greedy spanner is truly optimal. Specifically, for any $d=
O(1), \epsilon = \Omega({n}^{-\frac{1}{d-1}})$:
  - We show that any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner must have $n
\Omega(\epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges, implying that the greedy (and other) spanners
achieve the optimal size.
  - We show that any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner must have lightness
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-d})$, and then improve the upper bound on the lightness of
the greedy spanner from $O(\epsilon^{-2d})$ to $O(\epsilon^{-d})$.
  We then complement our negative result for the size of spanners with a rather
counterintuitive positive result: Steiner points lead to a quadratic
improvement in the size of spanners! Our bound for the size of Steiner spanners
is tight as well (up to lower-order terms).

to dynamically schedule different distributed deep learning tasks to maximize

elastic distributed training. Despite the recent successes in large mini-batch
distributed training, these methods are rarely tested in elastic distributed
training environments and suffer degraded performance in our experiments, when
we adjust the learning rate linearly immediately with respect to the batch
size. One difficulty we observe is that the noise in the stochastic momentum
estimation is accumulated over time and will have delayed effects when the
batch size changes. We therefore propose to smoothly adjust the learning rate
over time to alleviate the influence of the noisy momentum estimation. Our
experiments on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation
have demonstrated that our proposed Dynamic SGD method achieves stabilized

Therefore, we propose a simple, flexible, one-step technique (only requiring a
conventional deposition machine) to obtain scalable, high-quality, robust DIC
patterns, suitable for a range of microscopic techniques, by deposition of a
low melting temperature solder alloy in so-called 'island growth' mode, without
elevating the substrate temperature. Proof of principle is shown by
(near-)room-temperature deposition of InSn patterns, yielding highly dense,
homogeneous DIC patterns over large areas with a feature size that can be tuned
from as small as 10nm to 2um and with control over the feature shape and
density by changing the deposition parameters. Pattern optimization, in terms
of feature size, density, and contrast, is demonstrated for imaging with atomic
force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and
profilometry. Moreover, the performance of the InSn DIC patterns and their
robustness to large deformations is validated in two challenging case studies
of in-situ micro-mechanical testing: (i) self-adaptive isogeometric digital
height correlation of optical surface height profiles of a coarse, bimodal InSn
pattern providing microscopic 3D deformation fields (illustrated for
delamination of aluminum interconnects on a polyimide substrate) and (ii) DIC
on SEM images of a much finer InSn pattern allowing quantification of high
strains near fracture locations (illustrated for rupture of a Fe foil). As
such, the high controllability, performance and scalability of the DIC patterns
offers a promising step towards more routine DIC-based in-situ micro-mechanical
testing.

coupled to circumbinary accretion in a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH)
approaching merger reported in Bowen et al. 2018. We extend this simulation
from 3 to 12 binary orbital periods. We find that relativistic SMBBH accretion
acts as a resonant cavity, where quasi-periodic oscillations tied to the the
frequency at which the black hole's orbital phase matches a non-linear $m=1$
density feature, or ``lump'', in the circumbinary accretion disk permeate the
system. The rate of mass accretion onto each of the mini-disks around the black
holes is modulated at the beat frequency between the binary frequency and the
lump's mean orbital frequency, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm beat} = \Omega_{\rm bin} -
\bar{\Omega}_{\rm lump}$, while the total mass accretion rate of this
equal-mass binary is modulated at two different frequencies, $\gtrsim
\bar{\Omega}_{\rm lump}$ and $\approx 2 \Omega_{\rm beat}$. The instantaneous
rotation rate of the lump itself is also modulated at two frequencies close to
the modulation frequencies of the total accretion rate, $\bar{\Omega}_{\rm
lump}$ and $2 \Omega_{\rm beat}$. Because of the compact nature of the
mini-disks in SMBBHs approaching merger, the inflow times within the mini-disks
are comparable to the period on which their mass-supply varies, so that their
masses---and the accretion rates they supply to their black holes---are
strongly modulated at the same frequency. In essence, the azimuthal symmetry of
the circumbinary disk is broken by the dynamics of orbits near a binary, and
this $m=1$ asymmetry then drives quasi-periodic variation throughout the
system, including both accretion and disk-feeding. In SMBBHs approaching
merger, such time variability could introduce distinctive, increasingly rapid,
fluctuations in their electromagnetic emission.

polarized proton beam, which is defined as the number of full spin precessions
per revolution. A nine-magnet spin flipper has demonstrated high spin-flip
efficiency in the presence of two Siberian snakes [1]. The spin flipper drives
a spin resonance with a given frequency (or tune) and strength. When the drive
tune is close to the spin tune, the proton spin direction is not vertical
anymore, but precesses around the vertical direction. By measuring the
precession frequency of the horizontal component the spin tune can be precisely
measured. A driven coherent spin motion and fast turn-by-turn polarization
measurement are keys to the measurement. The vertical spin direction is
restored after turning the spin flipper off and the polarization value is not
affected by the measurement. The fact that this manipulation preserves the
polarization makes it possible to measure the spin tune during operation of a
high energy accelerator.

barriers to AV adoption. First, based on a literature review followed by
discussions with experts, ten barriers are identified. Second, the opinions of
eighteen experts from industry and academia regarding inter-relations between
these barriers are recorded. Third, a multicriteria decision making (MCDM)
technique, the grey-based Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory
(Grey-DEMATEL), is applied to characterize the structure of relationships
between the barriers. Fourth, robustness of the results is tested using
sensitivity analysis. Fifth, the key results are depicted in a causal loop
diagram (CLD), a systems thinking approach, to comprehend cause-and-effect
relationships between the barriers. The results indicate that the lack of
customer acceptance (LCA) is the most prominent barrier, the one which should
be addressed at the highest priority. The CLD suggests that LCA can be rather
mitigated by addressing two other prominent, yet more tangible, barriers --
lack of industry standards and the absence of regulations and certifications.
The study's overarching contribution thus lies in bringing to fore multiple
barriers to AV adoption and their potential influences on each other. Moreover,
the insights from this study can help associations related to AVs prioritize
their endeavors to expedite AV adoption. From the methodological perspective,
this is the first study in transportation literature that integrates

possible to ``amplify'' this dataset and output an even larger set of samples

an $(n,m)$ $\text{amplification procedure}$ takes as input $n$ independent
draws from an unknown distribution $D$, and outputs a set of $m > n$
``samples''. An amplification procedure is valid if no algorithm can
distinguish the set of $m$ samples produced by the amplifier from a set of $m$
independent draws from $D$, with probability greater than $2/3$. Perhaps
surprisingly, in many settings, a valid amplification procedure exists, even
when the size of the input dataset, $n$, is significantly less than what would
be necessary to learn $D$ to non-trivial accuracy. Specifically we consider two
fundamental settings: the case where $D$ is an arbitrary discrete distribution
supported on $\le k$ elements, and the case where $D$ is a $d$-dimensional
Gaussian with unknown mean, and fixed covariance. In the first case, we show
that an $\left(n, n + \Theta(\frac{n}{\sqrt{k}})\right)$ amplifier exists. In
particular, given $n=O(\sqrt{k})$ samples from $D$, one can output a set of
$m=n+1$ datapoints, whose total variation distance from the distribution of $m$
i.i.d. draws from $D$ is a small constant, despite the fact that one would need
quadratically more data, $n=\Theta(k)$, to learn $D$ up to small constant total
variation distance. In the Gaussian case, we show that an
$\left(n,n+\Theta(\frac{n}{\sqrt{d}} )\right)$ amplifier exists, even though
learning the distribution to small constant total variation distance requires
$\Theta(d)$ samples. In both the discrete and Gaussian settings, we show that
these results are tight, to constant factors. Beyond these results, we
formalize a number of curious directions for future research along this vein.

of the most promising means to search for new physics. Observation of this very
rare nuclear process, which violates Lepton Number conservation, would imply
the neutrino sector has a Majorana mass component and may also provide an
explanation for the universe matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In
the case where a heavy intermediate particle is exchanged in this process, QCD
contributions from short range interactions become relevant and the calculation
of matrix elements with four-quark operators becomes necessary. In these

four-quark operators from LQCD.

information. By factorizing the (rating) matrix into the product of
low-dimensional latent embeddings of rows (users) and columns (items), a
majority of existing matrix completion methods are transductive, since the
learned embeddings cannot generalize to unseen rows/columns or to new matrices.
To make matrix completion inductive, most previous works use content (side
information), such as user's age or movie's genre, to make predictions.
However, high-quality content is not always available, and can be hard to
extract. Under the extreme setting where not any side information is available
other than the matrix to complete, can we still learn an inductive matrix
completion model? In this paper, we propose an Inductive Graph-based Matrix
Completion (IGMC) model to address this problem. IGMC trains a graph neural
network (GNN) based purely on 1-hop subgraphs around (user, item) pairs
generated from the rating matrix and maps these subgraphs to their
corresponding ratings. It achieves highly competitive performance with
state-of-the-art transductive baselines. In addition, IGMC is inductive -- it
can generalize to users/items unseen during the training (given that their
interactions exist), and can even transfer to new tasks. Our transfer learning
experiments show that a model trained out of the MovieLens dataset can be
directly used to predict Douban movie ratings with surprisingly good
performance. Our work demonstrates that: 1) it is possible to train inductive
matrix completion models without using side information while achieving similar
or better performances than state-of-the-art transductive methods; 2) local
graph patterns around a (user, item) pair are effective predictors of the
rating this user gives to the item; and 3) Long-range dependencies might not be
necessary for modeling recommender systems.

terms of quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapolar order of the secular
approximation of the potential to the outer particle's $\omega_2$ precession
rate $(d\omega_2/d\tau)$. Then, we derive analytical criteria that determine
the vanishing of the $\omega_2$ quadrupole precession rate
$(d\omega_2/d\tau)_{\text{quad}}$ for different values of the inner perturber's
eccentricity $e_1$. Finally, we use such analytical considerations and describe
the behavior of $\omega_2$ of outer particles extracted from N-body
simulations. Our analytical study indicates that the values of the inclination
$i_2$ and the ascending node longitude $\Omega_2$ associated with the outer
particle that vanish $(d\omega_2/d\tau)_{\text{quad}}$ strongly depend on the
eccentricity $e_1$ of the inner perturber. In fact, if $e_1 <$ 0.25 ($>$
0.40825), $(d\omega_2/d\tau)_{\text{quad}}$ is only vanished for particles
whose $\Omega_2$ circulates (librates). For $e_1$ between 0.25 and 0.40825,
$(d\omega_2/d\tau)_{\text{quad}}$ can be vanished for any particle for a
suitable selection of pairs ($\Omega_2$, $i_2$). Our analysis of the N-body
simulations shows that the inverse Lidov-Kozai resonance is possible for small,
moderate and high values of $e_1$. Moreover, such a resonance produces
distinctive features in the evolution of a particle in the ($\Omega_2$, $i_2$)
plane. In fact, if $\omega_2$ librates and $\Omega_2$ circulates, the extremes
of $i_2$ at $\Omega_2 =$ 90$^{\circ}$ and 270$^{\circ}$ do not reach the same
value, while if $\omega_2$ and $\Omega_2$ librate, the evolutionary trajectory
of the particle in the ($\Omega_2$, $i_2$) plane evidences an asymmetry respect

types of problems admit a group of symmetries K which act on G by conjugation.
Under the assumption that the minimal isotropy group in K

define the corresponding quotient metric. For the special cases of the K-P

forecasting parameter constraints for future surveys requires accurately
accounting for the super-sample effects. If super-sample covariance is in fact
a major component of the survey error budget, it may be necessary to

interesting challenges for nuclear theory. These calculations could help to
test underlying nuclear models and interpret experimental data. Purpose:
Compare a direct measurement of the $^{138}$La $\beta$-decay $Q$ value with the
$\beta$-decay spectrum end-point energy measured by Quarati et al. using
LaBr$_3$ detectors [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 108, 30 (2016)]. Use new precise
measurements of the $^{138}$La $\beta$-decay and electron capture (EC) $Q$
values to improve theoretical calculations of the $\beta$-decay spectrum and EC
probabilities. Method: High-precision Penning trap mass spectrometry was used
to measure cyclotron frequency ratios of $^{138}$La, $^{138}$Ce and $^{138}$Ba
ions from which $\beta$-decay and EC $Q$ values for $^{138}$La were obtained.
Results: The $^{138}$La $\beta$-decay and EC $Q$ values were measured to be $Q$
= 1052.42(41) keV and $Q_{EC}$ = 1748.41(34) keV, improving the precision
compared to the values obtained in the most recent atomic mass evaluation
[Wang, et al., Chin. Phys. C 41, 030003 (2017)] by an order of magnitude. These
results are used for improved calculations of the $^{138}$La $\beta$-decay
shape factor and EC probabilities. New determinations for the $^{138}$Ce 2EC

also reported. Conclusion: The $^{138}$La $\beta$-decay $Q$ value measured by
Quarati et al. is in excellent agreement with our new result, which is an order
of magnitude more precise. Uncertainties in the shape factor calculations for
$^{138}$La beta-decay using our new $Q$ value are reduced by an order of
magnitude. Uncertainties in the EC probability ratios are also reduced and show
improved agreement with experimental data.

three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons, with emphasis on states carrying
embedded vorticity. Unlike typically stable 1D solitons, 2D and 3D ones are
vulnerable to instabilities induced by the critical and supercritical collapse,
respectively, in the 2D and 3D models with cubic focusing nonlinearity. Vortex
solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. For this
reason, a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2D and 3D
solitons may be stabilized. The review addresses, first, two well-established
topics, viz., the stabilization of vortex solitons by means of competing
nonlinearities, or by trapping potentials (harmonic-oscillator and
spatially-periodic ones). The former topic includes a new addition, viz., the
prediction of robust quantum droplets. Two other topics outline new schemes
elaborated for the creation of stable vortical solitons. One scheme relies on
the use of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in binary BEC, making it possible to
predict stable 2D and 3D solitons, which couple or mix components with
vorticities S=0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices (SVs) or mixed modes (MMs),
respectively). In this system, the situation is different in the 2D and 3D
geometries. In 2D, SOC helps to create a ground state (GS), represented by
stable SV or MM solitons, whose norm falls below the threshold value at which
the critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse
does not allow one to create a GS, but metastable solitons of the SV and MM
types can be constructed. Another new scheme makes it possible to create stable
2D vortex-ring solitons with arbitrarily high S in a binary BEC with components
coupled by microwave radiation. Some other topics are addressed too, such as
vortex solitons in dissipative media and attempts to create vortex solitons in
experiments.

performing molecular dynamics simulations using quantum and classical many-body

several classes of many-body polarization models such as induced dipoles or
Drude charges, by creating an auxiliary set of these same degrees of freedom
that are reversibly integrated through time. This gives rise to a singularly
perturbed Hamiltonian system that provides a good approximation to the time
evolution of the real mutual polarization field. To further improve upon the
accuracy of the XLMD dynamics, and to potentially extend it to other many-body
potentials, we introduce a stochastic modification which leads to a set of
singularly perturbed Langevin equations with degenerate noise. We prove that
the resulting Stochastic-XLMD converges to the accurate dynamics, and the
convergence rate is both optimal and is independent of the accuracy of the
initial polarization field. We carefully study the scaling of the damping
factor and numerical noise for efficient numerical simulation for
Stochastic-XLMD, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for model
polarizable force field systems.

MLE with a kinetics augmented model to obtain an estimate associated with an
adversarial dual sampler. To represent this sampler, we introduce a novel
neural architecture, dynamics embedding, that generalizes Hamiltonian
Monte-Carlo (HMC). The proposed approach inherits the flexibility of HMC while
enabling tractable entropy estimation for the augmented model. By learning both
a dual sampler and the primal model simultaneously, and sharing parameters
between them, we obviate the requirement to design a separate sampling
procedure once the model has been trained, leading to more effective learning.
We show that many existing estimators, such as contrastive divergence,
pseudo/composite-likelihood, score matching, minimum Stein discrepancy
estimator, non-local contrastive objectives, noise-contrastive estimation, and
minimum probability flow, are special cases of the proposed approach, each
expressed by a different (fixed) dual sampler. An empirical investigation shows
that adapting the sampler during MLE can significantly improve on
state-of-the-art estimators.

2002) and (Gressman-Strain-2011, AMUXY-2012) on the construction of classical
solutions in smooth Sobolev spaces which in particular are regular in the
spatial variables, it still remains an open problem to obtain global solutions
in an $L^\infty_{x,v}$ framework, similar to that in (Guo-2010), for the
Boltzmann equation with cutoff in general bounded domains. One main difficulty
arises from the interaction between the transport operator and the
velocity-diffusion-type collision operator in the non-cutoff Boltzmann and
Landau equations; another major difficulty is the potential formation of
singularities for solutions to the boundary value problem. In the present work
we introduce a new function space with low regularity in the spatial variable
to treat the problem in cases when the spatial domain is either a torus, or a
finite channel with boundary. For the latter case, either the inflow boundary
condition or the specular reflection boundary condition is considered. An
important property of the function space is that the $L^\infty_T L^2_v$ norm,
in velocity and time, of the distribution function is in the Wiener algebra
$A(\Omega)$ in the spatial variables. Besides the construction of global
solutions in these function spaces, we additionally study the large-time
behavior of solutions for both hard and soft potentials, and we further justify
the property of propagation of regularity of solutions in the spatial

than conventional vocoders for statistical parametric speech synthesis. As an
autoregressive (AR) model, WaveNet is limited by a slow sequential waveform
generation process. Some new models that use the inverse-autoregressive flow
(IAF) can generate a whole waveform in a one-shot manner. However, these
IAF-based models require sequential transformation during training, which
severely slows down the training speed. Other models such as Parallel WaveNet
and ClariNet bring together the benefits of AR and IAF-based models and train
an IAF model by transferring the knowledge from a pre-trained AR teacher to an
IAF student without any sequential transformation. However, both models require
additional training criteria, and their implementation is prohibitively
complicated.
  We propose a framework for neural source-filter (NSF) waveform modeling
without AR nor IAF-based approaches. This framework requires only three
components for waveform generation: a source module that generates a sine-based
signal as excitation, a non-AR dilated-convolution-based filter module that
transforms the excitation into a waveform, and a conditional module that
pre-processes the acoustic features for the source and filer modules. This
framework minimizes spectral-amplitude distances for model training, which can
be efficiently implemented by using short-time Fourier transform routines.
Under this framework, we designed three NSF models and compared them with
WaveNet. It was demonstrated that the NSF models generated waveforms at least
100 times faster than WaveNet, and the quality of the synthetic speech from the
best NSF model was better than or equally good as that from WaveNet.

LRGs to derive the averaged y-profile for each redshift bin. We then fit the
stacked profile with the theoretical prediction from the universal pressure
profile (UPP) by using the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method. We find that the
best-fit values of the UPP parameters for the three bins are generally
consistent with the previous studies, except for the noticeable evolution of
the parameters in the three redshift bins. We simultaneously fit the data in
the three redshift bins together, and find that the original UPP model cannot
fit the data at small angular scales very well in the first and third redshift
bins. The joint fits can be improved by including an additional parameter eta
to change the redshift-dependence of the model (i.e. E(z)^{8/3} ->
E(z)^{8/3+eta}) with best-fit value as eta=-3.11^{+1.09}_{-1.13}. This suggests
that the original UPP model with less redshift-dependence may provide a better

suggest a hint of large-scale filaments or sheet-like three-dimensional
structures crossing at the highest-density cluster core. By stacking the

hierarchical spatio-temporal models, which we refer to as STCOS, for the case
of Gaussian outcomes. Application of STCOS methodology from this literature
requires a level of proficiency with spatio-temporal methods and statistical
computing which may be a hurdle for potential users. The present work seeks to
bridge this gap by guiding readers through STCOS computations. We focus on the
R computing environment because of its popularity, free availability, and high
quality contributed packages. The stcos package is introduced to facilitate
computations for the STCOS model. A motivating application is the American
Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census
Bureau that measures key socioeconomic and demographic variables for various
populations in the United States. The STCOS methodology offers a principled
approach to compute model-based estimates and associated measures of
uncertainty for ACS variables on customized geographies and/or time periods. We
present a detailed case study with ACS data as a guide for change of support
analysis in R, and as a foundation which can be customized to other
applications.

geometric feature matching by leveraging multiple high-level features. In prior

The NN model is trained by an improved triplet loss function that fully
leverages all pairwise relationships within the triplet. Moreover, the fused

head magnetic resonance image~(MRI). It is a critical component in neuroimage
processing pipelines. Downstream deformable registration and whole brain
segmentation performance is highly dependent on accurate skullstripping.
Skullstripping is an especially challenging task for infant~(age range 0--18
months) head MRI images due to the significant size and shape variability of
the head and the brain in that age range. Infant brain tissue development also
changes the $T_1$-weighted image contrast over time, making consistent
skullstripping a difficult task. Existing tools for adult brain MRI
skullstripping are ill equipped to handle these variations and a specialized
infant MRI skullstripping algorithm is necessary. In this paper, we describe a
supervised skullstripping algorithm that utilizes three trained fully
convolutional neural networks~(CNN), each of which segments 2D $T_1$-weighted
slices in axial, coronal, and sagittal views respectively. The three
probabilistic segmentations in the three views are linearly fused and
thresholded to produce a final brain mask. We compared our method to existing
adult and infant skullstripping algorithms and showed significant improvement
based on Dice overlap metric~(average Dice of 0.97) with a manually labeled
ground truth data set. Label fusion experiments on multiple, unlabeled data
sets show that our method is consistent and has fewer failure modes. In
addition, our method is computationally very fast with a run time of 30 seconds

interactions in neuronal populations considers a weak Gamma distribution of
time delays when processing inputs, and is obtained via a time-coarse graining
technique that averages the population response. Previous analyses of the
stability of the Wilson-Cowan model focused on more simplified cases, where the
delays were either not present, constant or were of a specific type. Since
these simplifications may significantly alter the behavior of the model, we
focus on understanding the behavior of the system before time-course graining,
and for a wider range of delay distributions.
  For these generalized delay equations, we perform stability and bifurcation
analyses with respect to parameters that capture both the coupling profile, and
the time delay. The investigation is done through the examination of the
system's associated characteristic equation. Under mild assumptions, we give
complete mathematical proofs of our theoretical results, for the model with
general delay distributions and prove the transversality condition for the
possible Hopf bifurcations, in a generalized context. The stability region in
this parameter space is described theoretically for several types of delay
kernels, and numerical simulations are presented to substantiate the
theoretical results.
  We illustrate these theoretical principles in an application to a basal

be removed in post-processing. We describe an approach to automatically
generate process plans for support removal using a multi-axis machining
instrument. The goal is to fracture the contact regions between each support
component and the part, and to do it in the most cost-effective order while
avoiding collisions with evolving near-net shape, including the remaining
support components. A recursive algorithm identifies a maximal collection of
support components whose connection regions to the part are accessible as well
as the orientations at which they can be removed at a given round. For every
such region, the accessible orientations appear as a 'fiber' in the
collision-free space of the evolving near-net shape and the tool assembly. To
order the removal of accessible supports, the algorithm constructs a search
graph whose edges are weighted by the Riemannian distance between the fibers.
The least expensive process plan is obtained by solving a traveling salesman
problem (TSP) over the search graph. The sequence of configurations obtained by
solving TSP is used as the input to a motion planner that finds collision free
paths to visit all accessible features. The resulting part without the support
structure can then be finished using traditional machining to produce the
intended design. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through
benchmark examples in 3D.

many challenges such as uneven class distribution, unequal error cost, frequent
change of content and personalized context-sensitive discrimination. In this
research, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental
personalized e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three
significant contributions. First, we applied a novel term frequency difference
and category ratio based feature selection function TFDCR to select the most
discriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class.
Second, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to
update the discriminant function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function
called selectionRankWeight is introduced to upgrade the existing feature set
that determines new features carrying strong discriminating ability from an
incoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different
characteristics are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are
conducted to compare the feature selection efficiency of TFDCR and to observe
the filter performance under both the batch and the incremental learning mode.
The results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective f eature
selection function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic
feature update function overcomes the problem of drifting concepts. The
proposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility by substantially
improving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error of
misclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.

is sufficient (but not necessary) to certify the multipartite entanglement, and
occurs when a type of spin squeezing is created. The inequalities are similar
to those derived for continuous-variable systems, but instead are based on the
Heisenberg spin-uncertainty relation $\Delta J_{x}\Delta J_{y}\geq|\langle

inequalities that certify the full tripartite inseparability or genuine
multi-partite entanglement among systems with fixed spin $J$, as in
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states where $J=1/2$. These

based on Stokes operators. We illustrate with experiments that create

regression models that best explain this relationship by considering a variety

light nuclei. The importance of the emergence of the nuclear clustering was
discussed in the recent measurement of the photoabsorption cross sections as it
offered the possibility of the coexistence of various excitation modes which
are closely related to the nuclear clustering. To understand the excitation
mechanism, we study the electric-dipole ($E1$) responses of $^6$Li with a fully
microscopic six-body calculation. The ground-state wave function is accurately
described with a superposition of correlated Gaussian (CG) functions with the
aid of the stochastic variational method. The final-state wave functions are
also expressed by a number of the CG functions including important
configurations to describe the six-body continuum states excited by the $E1$
field. We found that the out-of-phase transitions occur due to the oscillations
of the valence nucleons against the $^4$He cluster at the low energies around
10 MeV indicating ``soft'' giant-dipole-resonance(GDR)-type excitations, which
are very unique in the $^6$Li system but could be found in other nuclear
systems. At the high energies beyond $\sim 30$ MeV typical GDR-type transitions
occur. The $^3$He-$^3$H clustering plays an important role to the GDR phenomena
in the intermediate energy regions around 20 MeV.

This paper presents artifacts, challenges, guidelines, and practices for the

elastic interfaces driven on a random substrate. In the mean field theory (the
Brownian force model), it is known that the avalanches are uncorrelated. Here
we obtain a simple field theory which describes the first deviations from this
uncorrelated behavior in a $\epsilon=d_c-d$ expansion below the upper critical
dimension $d_c$ of the model. We apply it to calculate the correlations between
(i) avalanche sizes (ii) avalanche dynamics in two successive avalanches, or
more generally, in two avalanches separated by a uniform displacement $W$ of
the interface. For (i) we obtain the correlations of the total sizes, of the
local sizes and of the total sizes with given seeds (starting points). For (ii)
we obtain the correlations of the velocities, of the durations, and of the
avalanche shapes. In general we find that the avalanches are {\it
anti-correlated}, the occurence of a larger avalanche making more likely the
occurence of a smaller one, and vice-versa. Examining the universality of our
results leads us to conjecture several new exact scaling relations for the
critical exponents that characterize the different distributions of
correlations. The avalanche size predictions are confronted to numerical
simulations for a $d=1$ interface with short range elasticity. They are also
compared to our recent related work on static avalanches (shocks). Finally we
show that the naive extrapolation of our result into the thermally activated

There has been a massive upsurge in the number of devices connected to a
network as well as the associated traffic volume. This has intensified the need
to better understand all possible attack vectors during system design and
implementation. Further, it has increased the need to mine large data sets,
analyzing which has become a daunting task. It is critical to scale monitoring
infrastructures to match this need, but a difficult goal for the small and
medium organization. Hence, there is a need to propose novel approaches that
address the big data problem in security. Information Centrality (IC) labels
network nodes with better vantage points for detecting network-based anomalies
as central nodes and uses them for detecting a category of attacks called
systemic attacks. The main idea is that since these central nodes already see a
lot of information flowing through the network, they are in a good position to
detect anomalies before other nodes. This research first dives into the
importance of using graphs in understanding the topology and information flow.
We then introduce the usage of information centrality, a centrality-based
index, to reduce data collection in existing communication networks. Using
IC-identified central nodes can accelerate outlier detection when armed with a
suitable anomaly detection technique. We also come up with a more efficient way
to compute Information centrality for large networks. Finally, we demonstrate
that central nodes detect anomalous behavior much faster than other non-central
nodes, given the anomalous behavior is systemic in nature.

quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses
to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel.
After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution
quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as
well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our
results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP
and suggests the heuristic method is sufficient for practical use. Moreover, we
observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of
reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine a returned results by
using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance NSP using
both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how these approach
might be used in practice.

logspace, inspired by the parameterised space bounded models developed by
Elberfeld, Stockhusen and Tantau (IPEC 2013, Algorithmica 2015). They defined
the operators paraW and paraBeta for parameterised space complexity classes by
allowing bounded nondeterminism with multiple-read and read-once access,
respectively. Using these operators, they characterised the parameterised
complexity of natural problems on graphs. In the spirit of the operators paraW
and paraBeta by Stockhusen and Tantau, we introduce variants based on
tail-nondeterminism, paraW[1] and paraBeta-Tail. Then, we consider counting
versions of all four operators applied to logspace and obtain several natural
complete problems for the resulting classes: counting of paths in digraphs,
counting first-order models for formulas, and counting graph homomorphisms.
Furthermore, we show that the complexity of a parameterised variant of the
determinant function for (0,1)-matrices is #paraBeta-Tail-L-hard and can be
written as the difference of two functions in #paraBetaTail-L. For example, we
show that the closure of #paraBetaTail-L under parameterised logspace
parsimonious reductions coincides with #paraBeta-L, that is, modulo
parameterised reductions, tail-nondeterminism with read-once access is the same
as read-once nondeterminism. We show that all introduced classes are closed
under addition and multiplication, and those without tail-nondeterminism are
closed under parameterised logspace parsimonious reductions. Finally, we
underline the significance of this topic by providing a promising outlook
showing several open problems and options for further directions of research.

substantially generalize the product i.i.d. condition required in most existing

numerical experiments, both for situations covered by our technical two

$(U,V,W)_\odot=(8.53,11.22,7.83)\pm(0.38,0.46,0.32)$ km s$^{-1}$,
$\Omega_0=28.71\pm0.22$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega'_0=-4.100\pm0.058$ km
s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, and $\Omega''_0= 0.736\pm0.033$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-3}$.
The linear rotation velocity at the adopted at the adopted solar distance
$R_0=8\pm0.15$ kpc is $V_0=229.7\pm4.6$ km s$^{-1}$. An analysis of the proper
motions for these 930 OSCs has shown that, apart from the rotation around the
Galactic z axis, there is rotation of the entire sample around the x axis with
an angular velocity of $0.48\pm0.15$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ differing
significantly from zero.

particularly finite amplitude IA rogue waves (IARWs) in a plasma medium
(containing pair ions, iso-thermal positrons and non-thermal electrons) are
theoretically investigated by deriving the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation
(NLSE). The criteria for the modulational instability of IAWs, and the basic
features of finite amplitude IARWs are identified. The modulationally stable
and unstable regions are determined by the sign of the ratio of the dispersive
coefficient to the nonlinear coefficient of NLSE. The latter is analyzed to
obtain the region for the existence of the IARWs, which corresponds to the
unstable region. The shape of the profile of the rogue waves depends on the
non-thermal parameter $\alpha$ and the ratio of electron temperature to
positron temperature. It is found that the increase in the value of the
non-thermal parameter enhances both the amplitude and width of IARWs, and that
the enhancement of positron (electron) temperature reduces (enhances) the
amplitude and width of IARWs. It is worth to mention that our present
investigation may be useful for understanding the salient features of IARWs in

ionosphere, etc.) and laboratory (viz., plasma processing reactor and neutral

While some users derive longterm value from their trackers, others face

technical aspects of these barriers. In this study, we analyse the behavioural
factors of discouragement and wearable abandonment strictly tied to user habits

a common detector volume. The TPC portion consists of a 10x10x10cm3 field cage,
which delivers charge from tracks to a 10x10cm2 quadruple GEM readout. Tracks
are reconstructed by interpolating the hit position of clusters on an array of
2x10mm2 zigzag pads The Cherenkov component consists of a 10x10cm2 readout

tracks pass though the drift volume of the TPC, the generated Cherenkov light
is able to escape through sparsely arranged wires making up one side of the
field cage, facing the CsI photocathode of the Cherenkov detector. The
Cherenkov detector is thus operated in a windowless, proximity focused
configuration for high efficiency. Pure CF4 is used as the working gas for both
detector components, mainly due to its transparency into the deep UV, as well
as its high N0. Results from the beam test, as well as results on its particle

occurs a that point. This means that the dynamical cosmological evolution up to

interrupted. Furthermore, by considering the $f(T)$ trace anomaly equation and

within the frameworks of classical linear elasticity and the bond-based
peridynamic theory of solid mechanics. We begin by reviewing corresponding
models from the classical theory of linear elasticity. This review includes a
new elementary and self-contained proof that there are exactly four material
symmetry classes of the elasticity tensor in two dimensions. We also summarize
classical plane strain and plane stress linear elastic models and explore their
connections to the pure two-dimensional linear elastic model, relying on the
definitions of the engineering constants. We then provide a novel formulation
for pure two-dimensional anisotropic bond-based linear peridynamic models,
which accommodates all four material symmetry classes. We further present
innovative formulations for peridynamic plane strain and plane stress, which
are obtained using direct analogies of the classical planar elasticity
assumptions, and we specialize these formulations to a variety of material
symmetry classes. The presented anisotropic peridynamic models are constrained
by Cauchy's relations, which are an intrinsic property of bond-based
peridynamic models. The uniqueness of the presented peridynamic plane strain
and plane stress formulations in this work is that we directly reduce
three-dimensional models to two-dimensional formulations, as opposed to
matching two-dimensional peridynamic models to classical plane strain and plane
stress formulations. This results in significant computational savings, while
retaining the dynamics of the original three-dimensional bond-based peridynamic
problems under suitable assumptions.
