through a lot of characterizations of different flavour. Depending on the
context, one can define Mal'tsev categories as those for which `any reflexive
relation is an equivalence'; `any relation is difunctional'; `the composition
of equivalence relations on a same object is commutative'; `each fibre of the
fibration of points is unital' or `the forgetful functor from internal
groupoids to reflexive graphs is saturated on subobjects'. For a variety of
universal algebras, these are also equivalent to the existence in its algebraic
theory of a Mal'tsev operation, i.e. a ternary operation $p(x,y,z)$ satisfying
the axioms $p(x,x,y)=y$ and $p(x,y,y)=x$. On the other hand, Mal'tsev
categories have been shown to be the right context in which to develop the
theory of centrality of equivalence relations, Baer sums of extensions, and
some homological lemmas such as the denormalized $3 \times 3$ Lemma, whose
validity in a regular category is equivalent to the weaker `Goursat property',
which has also turned out to be of wide interest.

We introduce Boomerang, a reputation system for crowdsourcing that elicits more

the person who gave it. With Boomerang, requesters find that their highly-rated
workers gain earliest access to their future tasks, and workers find tasks from
their highly-rated requesters at the top of their task feed. Field experiments
verify that Boomerang causes both workers and requesters to provide feedback

distributional representations of words. LDMI relies on the idea that, if a

co-occurring words, as opposed to the case when a single vector representation
is used for all the senses. After identifying the multi-sense words, LDMI
clusters the occurrences of these words to assign a sense to each occurrence.
Experiments on the contextual word similarity task show that LDMI leads to
better performance than competing approaches.

different topologies are investigated: ""solid models,"" where one of the two
phases is modeled as a solid material and the remaining volume is void space;
and ""shell models,"" where the interface between the two phases is assumed to be
a solid shell, with the rest of the volume modeled as void space. In both
cases, a wide range of relative densities and spinodal characteristic feature
sizes are investigated. The topology and morphology of all the numerically
generated models are carefully characterized to extract key geometrical
features and ensure that the distribution of curvatures and the aging law are
consistent with the physics of spinodal decomposition. Finite element meshes
are generated for each model, and the uniaxial compressive stiffness and
strength are extracted. We show that while solid spinodal models in the density
range of 30-70% are relatively inefficient (i.e., their strength and stiffness
exhibit a high-power scaling with relative density), shell spinodal models in
the density range of 0.01-1% are exceptionally stiff and strong. Spinodal shell
materials are also shown to be remarkably imperfection insensitive. These
findings are verified experimentally by in-situ uniaxial compression of
polymeric samples printed at the microscale by Direct Laser Writing (DLW). At
low relative densities, the strength and stiffness of shell spinodal models
outperform those of most lattice materials and approach theoretical bounds for
isotropic cellular materials. Most importantly, these materials can be produced
by self-assembly techniques over a range of length scales, providing unique
scalability.

deterministic and reproducible in-situ strain tuning of graphene electronic
devices. Central to this method is the full hBN encapsulation of graphene,
which preserves the exceptional quality of pristine graphene for transport
experiments. In addition, the on-substrate approach allows one to exploit
strain effects in the full range of possible sample geometries and at the same
time guarantees that changes in the gate capacitance remain negligible during
the deformation process. We use Raman spectroscopy to spatially map the strain
magnitude in devices with two different geometries and demonstrate the
possibility to engineer a strain gradient, which is relevant for accessing the
valley degree of freedom with pseudo-magnetic fields. Comparing the transport
characteristics of a suspended device with those of an on-substrate device, we
demonstrate that our new approach does not suffer from the ambiguities
encountered in suspended devices.

Mixed Membership Stochastic Block(MMSB) Models, Topic Models, and Adversarial
Clustering, can be unified through a geometric perspective, replacing model
specific assumptions and algorithms for individual models. The geometric
perspective leads to the formulation: \emph{find a latent $k-$ polytope $K$ in
${\bf R}^d$ given $n$ data points, each obtained by perturbing a latent point
in $K$}. This problem does not seem to have been considered in the literature.
The most important contribution of this paper is to show that the latent
$k-$polytope problem admits an efficient algorithm under deterministic
assumptions which naturally hold in Latent variable models considered in this
paper. ur algorithm runs in time $O^*(k\; \mbox{nnz})$ matching the best
running time of algorithms in special cases considered here and is better when
the data is sparse, as is the case in applications. An important novelty of the
algorithm is the introduction of \emph{subset smoothed polytope}, $K'$, the
convex hull of the ${n\choose \delta n}$ points obtained by averaging all
$\delta n$ subsets of the data points, for a given $\delta \in (0,1)$. We show
that $K$ and $K'$ are close in Hausdroff distance. Among the consequences of
our algorithm are the following: (a) MMSB Models and Topic Models: the first
quasi-input-sparsity time algorithm for parameter estimation for $k \in
O^*(1)$, (b) Adversarial Clustering: In $k-$means, if, an adversary is allowed
to move many data points from each cluster an arbitrary amount towards the
convex hull of the centers of other clusters, our algorithm still estimates
cluster centers well.

parameter $\delta$, it is denoted as $NS_{\delta}[f]$. Here we study the
algorithmic problem of approximating it for monotone $f$, such that
$NS_{\delta}[f] \geq 1/n^{C}$ for constant $C$, and where $\delta$ satisfies
$1/n \leq \delta \leq 1/2$. For such $f$ and $\delta$, we give a randomized
algorithm performing $O\left(\frac{\min(1,\sqrt{n} \delta \log^{1.5} n)
}{NS_{\delta}[f]} \text{poly}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ queries
and approximating $NS_{\delta}[f]$ to within a multiplicative factor of $(1\pm

lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{\min(1,\sqrt{n} \delta)}{NS_{\delta}[f] \cdot
n^{\xi}}\right)$ on the query complexity of any algorithm that approximates
$NS_{\delta}[f]$ to within any constant factor, where $\xi$ can be any positive

of its dependence on $n$.
  We introduce a novel descending-ascending view of noise sensitivity, and use
it as a central tool for the analysis of our algorithm. To prove lower bounds
on query complexity, we develop a technique that reduces computational
questions about query complexity to combinatorial questions about the existence
of ""thin"" functions with certain properties. The existence of such ""thin""
functions is proved using the probabilistic method. These techniques also yield
previously unknown lower bounds on the query complexity of approximating other
fundamental properties of Boolean functions: the total influence and the bias.

putting question marks at the listed PDG BW masses and widths. Furthermore,
some results are reviewed of a manifestly unitary model for meson spectroscopy,

to previous methods, the configurations are constructed in the Hartree-Fock

numbers as additional constraints. The goal of this work is to find paths
through the scission point where the overlaps between neighboring

astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing fundamental physics, and
place some of the most stringent constraints on this high-density EoS. Pulsar
timing - the process of accounting for every rotation of a pulsar over long
time periods - can precisely measure a wide variety of physical phenomena,
including those that allow the measurement of the masses of the components of a
pulsar binary system (Lorimer & Kramer 2005). One of these, called relativistic
Shapiro delay (Shapiro 1964), can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its
companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of
high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems. By
combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-year data set with recent orbital-phase-specific

to address this problem. We first propose a spatial-frequency CNN (SF-CNN)
based channel estimation exploiting both the spatial and frequency correlation,
where the corrupted channel matrices at adjacent subcarriers are input into the
CNN simultaneously. Then, exploiting the temporal correlation in time-varying
channels, a spatial-frequency-temporal CNN (SFT-CNN) based approach is
developed to further improve the accuracy. Moreover, we design a spatial
pilot-reduced CNN (SPR-CNN) to save spatial pilot overhead for channel
estimation, where channels in several successive coherence intervals are
grouped and estimated by a channel estimation unit with memory. Numerical
results show that the proposed SF-CNN and SFT-CNN based approaches outperform
the non-ideal minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator but with reduced
complexity, and achieve the performance close to the ideal MMSE estimator that
is very difficult to be implemented in practical situations. They are also
robust to different propagation scenarios. The SPR-CNN based approach achieves
comparable performance to SF-CNN and SFT-CNN based approaches while only
requires about one third of spatial pilot overhead at the cost of complexity.
Our work clearly shows that deep CNN can efficiently exploit channel
correlation to improve the estimation performance for mmWave massive MIMO

spaces over relational database instances. It has been argued convincingly that
this is not compatible with an open world semantics (Ceylan et al., KR 2016)
and with application scenarios that are modeled by continuous probability
distributions (Dalvi et al., CACM 2009).
  We recently introduced a model of PDBs as infinite probability spaces that
addresses these issues (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019). While that work was
mainly concerned with countably infinite probability spaces, our focus here is
on uncountable spaces. Such an extension is necessary to model typical
continuous probability distributions that appear in many applications. However,
an extension beyond countable probability spaces raises nontrivial foundational
issues concerned with the measurability of events and queries and ultimately
with the question whether queries have a well-defined semantics.
  It turns out that so-called finite point processes are the appropriate model
from probability theory for dealing with probabilistic databases. This model
allows us to construct suitable (uncountable) probability spaces of database
instances in a systematic way. Our main technical results are measurability
statements for relational algebra queries as well as aggregate queries and
datalog queries.

$X(3872)$. With the motivation of determining its further properties, which can
be observed in experiments, we now present a calculation of the decay processes
of this $K^*$, namely $K^*(4307)$, to two-body channels. Particularly, we
consider the decay channels $J/\psi K^*(892)$, $\bar{D}D_s$, $\bar{D}D_s^*$ and
$\bar{D}^* D_s^*$. The mechanisms of the decay to these channels involve
triangular loops and are a consequence of the internal structure of the state.
Thus, the values found for the decay widths of the proposed $K^*(4307)$ are
related to its nature and should be valuable for carrying on an experimental
study of the $K^*(4307)$. A $K^*$ state with such a mass (in the charmonium
region) and quantum numbers is a clear manifestation of an exotic meson, since,
having hidden charm (i.e., a $c\bar c$ pair), its mass and quantum numbers can

curves. We find that, in its first day, the inclination angle of a magnetar
decreases rapidly. The rapid alignment of the magnetic and rotation axis may
address the lack of persistent radio emission from mature magnetars. We also
find that in three cases the magnetic dipole moments of magnetars decrease
exponentially to a value a few times smaller than the initial value. The

the ensemble projections adequately sample the possible future climate

crosstalk and, despite efforts within the AFM community, a global approach for
eliminating this has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a method for
easily demonstrating the presence of hysteretic (ie, false ferroelectric)
long-range interactions between the sample and cantilever body. This method
should be easy to implement in any VM-AFM measurement. We then go on to
demonstrate fully quantitative and repeatable nanoelectromechanical
characterization using an interferometer. These quantitative measurements are
critical for a wide range of devices including mems actuators and sensors,
memristor, energy storage and memory.

  Mishap","3 pages (extended abstract)",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In the concluding remarks of Ontological Promiscuity Hobbs (1985) made what
we believe to be a very insightful observation: given that semantics is an
attempt at specifying the relation between language and the world, if ""one can
assume a theory of the world that is isomorphic to the way we talk about it ...
then semantics becomes nearly trivial"". But how exactly can we rectify our
logical formalisms so that semantics, an endeavor that has occupied the most
penetrating minds for over two centuries, can become (nearly) trivial, and what
exactly does it mean to assume a theory of the world in our semantics? In this
paper we hope to provide answers for both questions. First, we believe that a
commonsense theory of the world can (and should) be embedded in our semantic
formalisms resulting in a logical semantics grounded in commonsense
metaphysics. Moreover, we believe the first step to accomplishing this vision
is rectifying what we think was a crucial oversight in logical semantics,
namely the failure to distinguish between two fundamentally different types of
concepts: (i) ontological concepts, that correspond to what Cocchiarella (2001)
calls first-intension concepts and are types in a strongly-typed ontology; and
(ii) logical concepts (or second intension concepts), that are predicates
corresponding to properties of (and relations between) objects of various
ontological types1. In such a framework, which we will refer to henceforth by
ontologik, it will be shown how type unification and other type operations can
be used to account for the `missing text phenomenon' (MTP) (see Saba, 2019a)
that is at the heart of most challenges in the semantics of natural language,
by uncovering the significant amount of missing text that is never explicitly
stated in everyday discourse, but is often implicitly assumed as shared
background knowledge.

geometrically scaled Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Notch Flexure (ENF)
specimens were conducted to understand the nonlinear effects of the cohesive
stresses in the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). The results show a significant
difference between the mode I and mode II fracturing behaviors. It is shown
that, while the strength of the DCB specimens scales according to the Linear
Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), this is not the case for the ENF specimens.
Small specimens exhibit a pronounced pseudo-ductility with limited size effect
and a significant deviation from LEFM, whereas larger specimens behave in a
more brittle way, with the size effect on nominal strength closer to that
predicted by LEFM. This behavior, due to the significant size of the Fracture
Process Zone (FPZ) compared to the specimen size, needs to be taken into
serious consideration. It is shown that, for the specimen sizes investigated in
this work, neglecting the non-linear effects of the FPZ can lead to an
underestimation of the fracture energy by as much as 55%, with an error
decreasing for increasing specimen sizes. Both the mode I and II test data can
be captured very accurately by Ba\v{z}ant's type II Size Effect Law (SEL).

proved that the diffusion process generated by $\tilde{\mathbf{L}}_t$ on

stochastic differential equation (SDE). We also characterize the ergodicity of
the diffusion process generated by $\tilde{\mathbf{L}}_t$ in terms of
asymptotic properties of the coupled nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. Another
main result of the paper is that the restricted well-posedness of the
non-linear Fokker-Planck equation and its linearized version imply the
(restricted) well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov equation and that in this case
the laws of the solutions have the Markov property. All this is done under
merely measurebility conditions on the coefficients in their measure
dependence, hence in particular applies if the latter is of ""Nemytskii-type"".
As a consequence, we obtain the restricted weak well-posedness and the Markov
property of the so-called nonlinear distorted Brownian motion, whose associated
nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is a porous media equation perturbed by a
nonlinear transport term. This realizes a programme put forward by McKean in

single-species spatial domains cyclically dominate the entire territory until a

resolve the so-called ""bulk Lorentz factor crisis"" of sources with high Lorentz
factor, deduced from maximum gamma-gamma opacity and fast variability, and
apparently inconsistent slow/stationary radio knots. It also suggests that a
unique pattern of the non-thermal emission variability should appear after each
strong flare. Taking advantage of the 13 years of observation of the HBL Mrk
421 by the X-ray Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Swift-XRT, we
probe for such an intrinsic variability pattern. Its significance is then
statistically estimated via comparisons with numerous similar simulated
lightcurves. A suggested variability pattern is identified, consistent with a
main flare emission zone located in the most upstream 15.3 GHz radio knot at
0.38 mas from the core. Subsequent flux excesses in the lightcurve are
consistent with a perturbation crossing all the downstream radio knots with a
constant apparent speed of 45 c. The significance of the observed variability
pattern not arising from stochastic processes is found above 3 standard
deviations, opening a promising path for further investigations in other
blazars and with other energy bands. In addition to highlight the role of
stationary radio knots as high-energy particle accelerators in jets, the
developed method allows estimates of the apparent speed and size of a jet

(Qb) in natural surf zones using data from seven wave-dominated Australian
beaches. Qb is a critical, but rarely quantified, parameter for parametric surf
zone energy dissipation models which are commonly used as coastal management
tools. Here, Qb is quantified using a combination of remote sensing and in-situ
data. These data and machine learning techniques enable quantification of Qb
for a substantial dataset (>350,000 waves). The results show that Qb is a
highly variable parameter with a high degree of inter- and intra-beach
variability. Such variance could be explained (at least partially) by
correlations between Qb and environmental parameters. Tidal variations drive
changes in Qb of up to 70% for a given local water depth (h) on steep beaches,
and increased infragravity energy levels decreased terminal values of Qb by
about 20%. The links between Qb and environmental forcing lead to the
development of a correspondence between Qb and the Australian beach
morphodynamic model. Qb is larger for a given normalized depth (h/Hs, where Hs
is offshore wave height) for dissipative beaches than for intermediate beaches.
Finally, when comparing data to existing models, three commonly used
theoretical formulations for Qb are observed to be poor predictors with errors
of the order of 40%. Existing theoretical Qb models are shown to improve
(revised errors of the order of 10%) if the Rayleigh probability distribution
that describes the wave height is in these models is replaced by the Weibull
distribution.

invalid, which limits the performance of CNNs on the demand forecasting task.
In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called LC-ST-FCN

address the unique challenges of the region-level demand forecasting problem
within one end-to-end architecture (E2E). We first employ the 3D convolutional

then feed the spatiotemporal features extracted by the 3D convolutional layers
to the subsequent 2D convolutional layers. Afterward, the prediction value of
each region is obtained by the locally connected convolutional layers which
relax the parameter sharing scheme. We evaluate the proposed model on a real
dataset from a ride-sourcing service platform (DiDiChuxing) and observe
significant improvements compared with a bunch of baseline models. Besides, we
also illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by visualizing how
different types of convolutional layers transform their input and capture
useful features. The visualization results show that fully convolutional
architecture enables the model to better localize the related regions. And the
locally connected layers play an important role in dealing with the local

fields with a dynamic exponent $z$ is studied by the holographic approach. The
dual description is a $n+1$-dimensional probe brane moving in the
$d+1$-dimensional asymptotic Lifshitz geometry ended at $r=r_b$, which plays a
role as the UV energy cutoff. Using the holographic influence functional
method, we find that in the linear response region, by introducing a harmonic
trap for the mirror, which serves as a IR energy cutoff, the Von Neumann
entropy at late times will saturate by a power-law in time for generic values
of $z$ and $n$. The saturated value and the relaxation rate depend on the
parameter $\alpha\equiv 1+(n+2)/z$, which is restricted to $1<\alpha <3$ but
$\alpha \ne 2$. We find that the saturated values of the entropy are
qualitatively different for the theories with $1<\alpha<2$ and $2<\alpha<3$.
Additionally, the power law relaxation follows the rate $\propto
t^{-2\alpha-1}$. This probe brane approach provides an alternative way to study
the time evolution of the entanglement entropy in the linear response region

entanglement entropies based on Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture. We also compare our

equivalent in terms of the distributions they are capable of representing.
Thus, the practical advantage of global normalization in the context of modern
neural methods remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this
problem through an empirical study. We extend an approach for search-aware
training via a continuous relaxation of beam search (Goyal et al., 2017b) in
order to enable training of globally normalized recurrent sequence models
through simple backpropagation. We then use this technique to conduct an
empirical study of the interaction between global normalization, high-capacity
encoders, and search-aware optimization. We observe that in the context of
inexact search, globally normalized neural models are still more effective than
their locally normalized counterparts. Further, since our training approach is
sensitive to warm-starting with pre-trained models, we also propose a novel
initialization strategy based on self-normalization for pre-training globally
normalized models. We perform analysis of our approach on two tasks: CCG

methods are highly modular, readily plugged into existing deep CNNs. Extensive

estimation of polynomial regression, the true model is unknown and thus, a
model selection step is performed prior to estimation. The data-based model
selection step affects the subsequent estimation. In particular, the oracle
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), which is based on knowledge of the true model, is
inappropriate for post-model-selection performance analysis and system design
outside the asymptotic region. In this paper, we investigate
post-model-selection parameter estimation of a vector with an unknown support
set, where this support set represents the model. We analyze the estimation
performance of coherent estimators that force unselected parameters to zero. We
use the mean-squared-selected-error (MSSE) criterion and introduce the concept
of selective unbiasedness in the sense of Lehmann unbiasedness. We derive a
non-Bayesian Cram\'er-Raotype bound on the MSSE and on the mean-squared-error
(MSE) of any coherent estimator with a specific selective-bias function in the
Lehmann sense. We implement the selective CRB for the special case of sparse
vector estimation with an unknown support set. Finally, we demonstrate in
simulations that the proposed selective CRB is an informative lower bound on
the performance of the maximum selected likelihood estimator for a general
linear model with the generalized information criterion and for sparse vector
estimation with one step thresholding. It is shown that for these cases the
selective CRB outperforms the oracle CRB and Sando-Mitra-Stoica CRB (SMS-CRB)
[1].

users in a 5G cellular network. Such cellular network is based on a Cloud Radio
Access Network (CRAN) architecture with limited fronthaul capacity, where our
goal is to minimize delays of all users through an optimal resource allocation.
Earlier works minimize average delay of each user assuming same transmit power
for all users. Combining Pareto optimization and Markov Decision Process (MDP),
we show that every desired balance in the trade-off among infinite-horizon
average-reward delays, is achievable by minimizing a properly weighted sum
delays. In addition, we solve the problem in two realistic scenarios;
considering both power control and different (random) service times for the
users. In the latter scenario, we are able to define and minimize the more
preferred criterion of total delay vs. average delay for each user. We will
show that the resulting problem is equivalent to a discounted-reward
infinite-horizon MDP. Simulations show significant improvement in terms of
wider stability region for arrival rates in power-controlled scenario and
considerably reduced sum of users total delays in the case of random service
times.

(CMT) on 21cm brightness temperature excursion sets, to study the ionization
and heating history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during and before the
Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The ratio of eigenvalues of the CMT denoted by
$\beta$, gives shape information while it's trace gives the contour length of
holes and connected regions. We simulate the matter density, neutral hydrogen
fraction, spin temperature and brightness temperature field using the publicly
available code 21cmFAST in a redshift range of $z=20.22$ to $z=6$. We study the
redshift evolution of three quantities - the Betti number counts
$N_{con,hole}$, the characteristic size $r^{ch}_{con,hole}$ and shape
anisotropy parameter $\beta^{ch}_{con,hole}$ of connected regions and holes for
these fields and investigate the different physical origins of their evolution.
We make a qualitative comparison of different models of heating and ionization
during the EoR. We obtain different regimes of morphological evolution of
brightness temperature, depending upon how the shapes and sizes of connected
regions and holes change with redshift for different astrophysical settings
affecting the ionization and heating history of the IGM during and before the
EoR. We find that the morphology of the brightness temperature field traces the
morphology of ionized regions below a certain redshift value depending upon the
model, where $\Delta r^{ch}_{hole}<10 \%$ and $\Delta \beta^{ch}_{hole}<1 \%$
relative to the $x_{HI}$ field. This difference decreases with redshift.
Therefore, the ionization history of the IGM can be reconstructed using the
morphological description of $\delta T_b$ in real space.

sophisticated similarity metric termed ""mutual buddies similarity"" (MBS) is
proposed to exploit the relationship of multiple reciprocal nearest neighbors
for target matching. By doing so, our tracker obtains powerful discriminative
ability on distinguishing target and background as demonstrated by both
empirical and theoretical analyses. Besides, instead of utilizing single
template with the improper updating scheme in CFTs, we design a novel online
template updating strategy named ""memory filtering"" (MF), which aims to select
a certain amount of representative and reliable tracking results in history to
construct the current stable and expressive template set. This scheme is
beneficial for the proposed tracker to comprehensively ""understand"" the target
appearance variations, ""recall"" some stable results. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations on two benchmarks suggest that the proposed tracking
method performs favorably against some recently developed CFTs and other

in terms of strength of factor loadings. A new joint estimation method,
benefiting from unique feature of dimension reduction for high dimensional time
series, is proposed for the parameter representing the extent and some other
parameters involved in the estimation procedure. Moreover, a joint asymptotic
distribution for a pair of estimators is established. Simulations illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method in the finite sample
performance. Applications in cross-country macro-variables and stock returns

the right is a mixed commutative/non-commutative formalization of the Lambek

the adjunction between both sides. Thus, the adjoint functors allow one to pull
the exchange structural rule from the left side to the right side. We then give
a categorical model in terms of a monoidal adjunction, and then a concrete

sound in the absence of a physical cold stimulus. Multiple examples of
frisson-inducing sounds have been reported, but the mechanism of auditory
frisson remains elusive. Typical frisson-inducing sounds may contain a looming
effect, in which a sound appears to approach the listener's peripersonal space.
Previous studies on sound in peripersonal space have provided objective
measurements of sound-inducing effects, but few have investigated the
subjective experience of frisson-inducing sounds. Here we explored whether it
is possible to produce subjective feelings of frisson by moving a noise sound
(white noise, rolling beads noise, or frictional noise produced by rubbing a
plastic bag) stimulus around a listener's head. Our results demonstrated that
sound-induced frisson can be experienced stronger when auditory stimuli are
rotated around the head (binaural moving sounds) than the one without the
rotation (monaural static sounds), regardless of the source of the noise sound.
Pearson's correlation analysis showed that several acoustic features of
auditory stimuli, such as variance of interaural level difference (ILD),
loudness, and sharpness, were correlated with the magnitude of subjective
frisson. We had also observed that the subjective feelings of frisson by moving
a musical sound had increased comparing with a static musical sound.

luminosity. In spite of large theoretical and experimental research efforts,
the exact nature of the emission remains unresolved. In this work we utilize
layer-by-layer etching of multilayer hBN to localize the quantum emitters with
atomic precision. Our results suggest the position of the emitters correlates
with the fabrication method: emitters formed under plasma treatment are always
in close proximity to the crystal surface, while emitters created under
electron irradiation are distributed randomly throughout the entire crystal.
This disparity could be traced back to the lower kinetic energy of the ions in
the plasma compared to the kinetic energy of the electrons in the particle
accelerator. The emitter distance to the surface also correlates with the
excited state lifetime: near-surface emitters have a shorter compared to
emitters deep within the crystal. Finite-difference time-domain and density
functional theory simulations show that optical and electronic effects are not
responsible for this difference, indicating effects such as coupling to surface
defects or phonons might cause the reduced lifetime. Our results pave a way
toward identification of the defect, as well as engineering the emitter
properties.

loss, which leads to exposure bias and the inconsistency between the optimizing
function and evaluation metrics. Recently it has been shown that these two
issues can be addressed by incorporating techniques from reinforcement
learning, where one of the popular techniques is the advantage actor-critic
algorithm that calculates per-token advantage by estimating state value with a
parametrized estimator at the cost of introducing estimation bias. In this
paper, we estimate state value without using a parametrized value estimator.
With the properties of image captioning, namely, the deterministic state
transition function and the sparse reward, state value is equivalent to its
preceding state-action value, and we reformulate advantage function by simply
replacing the former with the latter. Moreover, the reformulated advantage is
extended to n-step, which can generally increase the absolute value of the mean
of reformulated advantage while lowering variance. Then two kinds of rollout
are adopted to estimate state-action value, which we call self-critical n-step
training. Empirically we find that our method can obtain better performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods that use the sequence level advantage
and parametrized estimator respectively on the widely used MSCOCO benchmark.

advertisement effects are not only outdated, but their sample size is
questionable and their environments do not reflect reality. With the advent of
the internet, social media and new information technologies, many recent
studies focus on the effects of online advertisement, meanwhile, the investment
in television advertisement still has not declined. In response to this, we
applied machine learning algorithms SVM and XGBoost, as well as Logistic
Regression, to construct a number of prediction models based on at-home
advertisement exposure time and demographic data, examining the predictability
of Actual Purchase and Purchase Intention behaviors of 3000 customers across 36
different products during the span of 3 months. If models based on exposure
time had unreliable predictability in contrast to models based on demographic
data, doubts would surface about the effectiveness of the hard investment in
television advertising. Based on our results, we found that models based on
advert exposure time were consistently low in their predictability in
comparison with models based on demographic data only, and with models based on
both demographic data and exposure time data. We also found that there was not
a statistically significant difference between these last two kinds of models.
This suggests that advert exposure time has little to no effect in the
short-term in increasing positive actual purchase behavior.

large and small amplitude electromagnetic fluctuations occurring on scale

equilibrium. The formulation of the gyrokinetic model is based on a second
order description of the single charged particle dynamics, derived from Lie
perturbation theory, where the fast particle gyromotion is decoupled from the
slow drifts, assuming that the ratio of the ion sound Larmor radius to the
perpendicular equilibrium pressure scale length is small. The collective
behavior of the plasma is obtained by a gyrokinetic Boltzmann equation that
describes the evolution of the gyroaveraged distribution function and includes
a non-linear gyrokinetic Dougherty collision operator. The gyrokinetic model is
then developed into a set of coupled fluid equations referred to as the
gyrokinetic moment hierarchy. To obtain this hierarchy, the gyroaveraged
distribution function is expanded onto a velocity-space Hermite-Laguerre
polynomial basis and the gyrokinetic equation is projected onto the same basis,
obtaining the spatial and temporal evolution of the Hermite-Laguerre expansion
coefficients. The Hermite-Laguerre projection is performed accurately at
arbitrary perpendicular wavenumber values. Finally, the self-consistent
evolution of the electromagnetic fields is described by a set of gyrokinetic
Maxwell's equations derived from a variational principle, with the velocity
integrals of the gyroaveraged distribution function explicitly evaluated.

received intense attention in order to ensure the reliability requirement for
mission-critical machine-type communication (cMTC) applications. In this paper,
the outage probability is asymptotically studied for MIMO channels to
thoroughly investigate the transmission reliability. To fully capture the
spatial correlation effects, the MIMO fading channel matrix is modelled
according to three types of Kronecker correlation structure, i.e., independent,
semi-correlated and full-correlated Rayleigh MIMO channels. The outage
probabilities under all three Kronecker models are expressed as representations
of the weighted sum of the generalized Fox's H functions. The simple analytical
results empower the asymptotic outage analyses at high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), which are conducted not only to reveal helpful insights into
understanding the behavior of fading effects, but also to offer useful design
guideline for MIMO configurations. Particularly, the asymptotic outage
probability is proved to be a monotonically increasing and convex function of
the transmission rate. In the absence of the channel state information (CSI),
the transmitter tends to equally allocate the total transmit power among its
antennas to enhance the system reliability especially in high SNR regime. In
the end, the analytical results are validated through extensive numerical
experiments.

such that an IP with $n\geq \tau(\Delta)$ many variables and $n +
\kappa(\Delta)\cdot \sqrt{n}$ many inequality constraints can be solved via a
MIP relaxation with fewer than $n$ integer constraints. From our results it

detected in near-infrared continuum photometry of Proxima Centauri. During a
campaign monitoring the star for possible exoplanet transits, we identified an
increase in Sloan i' flux leading to an observed peak at BJD 2457935.996 that
was at least 10\% over pre-flare flux in this band. It was followed by a
2-component rapid decline in the first 100 seconds that became a slower
exponential decay with time constant of 1350 seconds. A smaller flare event
1300 seconds after the first added an incremental peak flux increase of 1% of
pre-flare flux. Since the onset of the flare was not fully time-resolved at a
cadence of 62 seconds, its actual peak value is unknown but greater than the
time-average over a single exposure of 20 seconds. The i' band is
representative of broad optical and near-IR continuum flux over which the
integrated energy of the flare is 100 times the stellar luminosity. This meets
the criteria that established the concept of superflares on similar stars. The
resulting implied ultraviolet flux and space weather could have had an extreme
effect on the atmospheres of planets within the star's otherwise-habitable

The tension-free
stationary states of conformally invariant energies describe the simplest
curves of this form. Planar logarithmic spirals, for example, are associated
with conformal arc-length; their unique properties reflect the symmetry and the
manner of its breaking. Constructing their analogues in three-dimensions is not
so simple. The qualitative behavior of these states is controlled by two
parameters, the conserved scaling current $S$ and the magnitude of the torque
$M.$ Their conservation determines the curvature and the torsion. If the spiral
apex is located at the origin, the conserved \textit{special} conformal current
vanishes. Planar logarithmic spirals occur when $M$ and $S$ are tuned so that
$4MS =1$. More generally, the spiral exhibits internal structure, nutating
between two fixed cones aligned along the torque axis. It expands monotonically
as this pattern precesses about this axis. If the spiral is supercritical
($4MS>1$) the cones are identical and oppositely oriented. The torsion changes
sign where the projection along the torque axis turns, the spiral twisting one
way and then the other within each nutation. These elementary spirals provide
templates for understanding a broad range of self-similar spatial spiral
patterns occurring in nature. In particular, supercritical trajectories
approximate rather well the nutating tip of the growing tendril in a climbing
plant first described by Darwin.

approach that detects the objects without prior box. Working with multi-scale
features, the designed dual scale residual unit makes dual scale detectors no
longer run independently. The second scale detector learns the residual of the
first. Dubox has enhanced the capacity of heuristic-guided that can further
enable the first scale detector to maximize the detection of small targets and
the second to detect objects that cannot be identified by the first one.
Besides, for each scale detector, with the new classification-regression

Integrating these strategies, our detection algorithm has achieved excellent

rare-earth/transition-metal (RE-TM) magnets within density-functional theory
(DFT). The principal idea of the method is to calculate the crystal field
potential of the yttrium analogue (""Y-analogue"") of the RE-TM magnet, i.e. the
material where the lanthanide elements have been substituted with yttrium. The
advantage of dealing with Y-analogues is that the methodological and conceptual
difficulties associated with treating the highly-localized 4f electrons in DFT
are avoided, whilst the nominal valence electronic structure principally
responsible for the crystal field is preserved. In order to correctly describe
the crystal field potential in the core region of the atoms we use the
projector-augmented wave formalism of DFT, which allows the reconstruction of
the full charge density and electrostatic potential. The Y-analogue crystal
field potentials are combined with radial 4f charge densities obtained in
self-interaction-corrected calculations on the lanthanides to obtain crystal
field coefficients. We demonstrate our method on a test set of 10 materials
comprising 9 RE-TM magnets and elemental Tb. We show that the calculated easy
directions of magnetization agree with experimental observations, including a
correct description of the anisotropy within the basal plane of Tb and
NdCo$_5$. We further show that the Y-analogue calculations generally agree
quantitatively with previous calculations using the open-core approximation to
treat the 4f electrons, and argue that our simple approach may be useful for
large-scale computational screening of new magnetic materials.

requests, and pays for, fresh data updates from a source provider. Data
freshness is captured by the {\it age of information} (AoI) metric, defined as
the time elapsed since the latest update has reached the destination. The
source incurs an operational cost, modeled as an increasing convex function of
the number of updates. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as
an increasing convex function of the AoI. The source charges the destination
for each update and designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its profit; the
destination on the other hand chooses a data update schedule to minimize the
summation of its payments to the source and its age-related cost. The
interaction among the source and destination is hence game-theoretic. Motivated
by the existing pricing literature, we first study a time-dependent pricing
scheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested. We
show in this case that the game equilibrium leads to only one data update,
which does not yield the maximum profit to the source. This motivates us to
consider a quantity-based pricing scheme, in which the price of each update
depends on how many updates have been previously requested. We show that among
all pricing schemes in which the price of an update may vary according to both
time and quantity, the quantity-based pricing scheme performs best: it
maximizes the source's profit and minimizes the social cost of the system,
defined as the aggregate source's operational cost and the destination's
age-related cost. Numerical results show that the optimal quantity-based
pricing can be 27% more profitable for the source and incurs 54% less social
cost, compared with the optimal time-dependent pricing.

makes it possible to generate pure circularly-polarized Stokes and anti-Stokes

identification of these high-field broken-symmetry states has mostly relied on
macroscopic transport techniques. Here, we study splitting of the zero LL of

the spin degeneracy in the two valleys is also lifted by the magnetic fields.
When the Fermi level lies inside the spin-polarized states (at v = 1 or -1),
the spin splitting is dramatically enhanced because of the strong many-body
effects. At v = 0, we direct image the wavefunctions of the QHIFM states at

cluster formation should scale directly with star formation, this efficiency
varies widely across galaxies. To explore this variation we measure the z-band
GC specific frequency ($S_{N,z}$) for 43 early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Fornax Cluster
Survey. Combined with the homogenous measurements of $S_{N,z}$ in 100 ETGs from
the HST/ACS Virgo Cluster Survey from Peng et al. (2008), we investigate the
dependence of $S_{N,z}$ on mass and environment over a range of galaxy
properties. We find that $S_{N,z}$ behaves similarly in the two galaxy
clusters, despite the clusters' order-of-magnitude difference in mass density.
The $S_{N,z}$ is low in intermediate-mass ETGs ($-20<M_z<-23$), and increases
with galaxy luminosity. It is elevated at low masses, on average, but with a
large scatter driven by galaxies in dense environments. The densest
environments with the strongest tidal forces appear to strip the GC systems of
low-mass galaxies. However, in low-mass galaxies that are not in strong tidal
fields, denser environments correlate with enhanced GC formation efficiencies.
Normalizing by inferred halo masses, the GC mass fraction,
$\eta=(3.36\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}$, is constant for ETGs with stellar masses
$\mathcal{M}_\star \lesssim 3\times10^{10}M_\odot$, in agreement with previous
studies. The lack of correlation between the fraction of GCs and the nuclear

novel hybrid chemical route, where colloidal crystalline GDC nanoparticles from
continuous hydrothermal synthesis are dispersed into a metalorganic YSZ matrix
precursor. The result is a mixture of metal oxides in which GDC nanoparticles
are finely distributed in a continuous metalorganic polymeric matrix to be
crystallized after calcination. The GDC nanoparticles reduce the temperature
necessary to obtain crystalline YSZ, which is already formed at 400 {\deg}C.
The nanocomposite reveals structural stability up to 800 {\deg}C when treated
in both air and reducing atmosphere, showing the onset of diffusion below 1000
{\deg}C. The diffusional processes are largely dependent on the nanometric
grain size, with Zr4+ diffusing abruptly towards GDC in air at 1000 {\deg}C and
GDC/YSZ interdiffusion being hindered in reducing environment despite the onset
temperature of 900 {\deg}C. The nanocomposite precursor is an inkjet-printable
reactive water-based material, suitable for the deposition of thin films with a
thickness below 100 nm after calcination at 750 {\deg}C. The crystal structure
of the film reveals no interaction between GDC and YSZ but a microstrain (0.3%
tensile strain for YSZ). The thin film microstructure shows a compact layer
with 94% density. The nanocomposite shows high oxygen ionic conductivity at low
temperatures (> 5 * 10-3 S cm-1 at 500 {\deg}C), low activation energy (0.55
eV), and dominant oxygen ionic conductivity even in reducing conditions (pO2 <
10-25 atm). We show that these properties arise from the large interface
between the components of the composite, due to the embedding of the GDC
nanoparticles in the YSZ matrix, while ZrO-CeO intermixing can be avoided and
no n-type conductivity is observed even at low oxygen activities and high
temperatures.

is devoted to various questions concerning the analytic K-homology of $(X,h)$.
In the fist part, assuming either $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$ or

$L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex, denoted here
$\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}$, induces a class in $K_0 (X)\equiv

$\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$, is proved also for
$\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{abs}}$, the rolled-up operator of the maximal
$L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex. We then show that when
$\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$ we have
$[\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}]=\pi_*[\overline{\eth}_M]$ with
$\pi:M\rightarrow X$ an arbitrary resolution and with $[\overline{\eth}_M]\in
K_0 (M)$ the analytic K-homology class induced by
$\overline{\partial}+\overline{\partial}^t$ on $M$. In the second part of the
paper we focus on complex projective varieties $(V,h)$ endowed with the
Fubini-Study metric. First, assuming $\dim(V)\leq 2$, we compare the
Baum-Fulton-MacPherson K-homology class of $V$ with the class defined
analytically through the rolled-up operator of any $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$
complex. We show that there is no $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex on
$(\mathrm{reg}(V),h)$ whose rolled-up operator induces a K-homology class that
equals the Baum-Fulton-MacPherson class. Finally in the last part of the paper
we prove that under suitable assumptions on $V$ the push-forward of
$[\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}]$ in the K-homology of the classifying space
of the fundamental group of $V$ is a birational invariant.

significantly improves the performance. 3) The triplet mutual information among

instance-level deep mutual information to a triplet-level formation, which
further helps to learn more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on

consisting of alternating layers of heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) heavy-fermion metal CeIn$_3$. The strength of the AFM
fluctuations is tuned by applying hydrostatic pressure to
CeCoIn$_5(m)$/CeIn$_3(n)$ superlattices with $m$ and $n$ unit-cell-thick layers
of CeCoIn$_5$ and CeIn$_3$, respectively. Superconductivity in CeCoIn$_5$ and
AFM order in CeIn$_3$ coexist in spatially separated layers. At ambient
pressure, N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$ of the CeIn$_3$ block layers (BLs) of
CeCoIn$_5$(7)/CeIn$_3(n)$ shows little dependence on $n$, in contrast to
CeIn$_3(n)$/LaIn$_3$(4) superlattices where $T_N$ is strongly suppressed with
decreasing $n$. This suggests that each CeIn$_3$ BL is magnetically coupled by
the RKKY interaction through the adjacent CeCoIn$_5$ BL and a 3D magnetic state
is formed. With applying pressure to CeCoIn$_5$(7)/CeIn$_3$(13), $T_N$ of the
CeIn$_3$ BLs is suppressed up to 2.4 GPa, showing a similar pressure dependence
as CeIn$_3$ single crystals. An analysis of upper critical field reveals that
the superconductivity in the CeCoIn$_5$ BLs is barely influenced by the AFM
fluctuations in the CeIn$_3$ BLs, even when the CeIn$_3$ BLs are in the
vicinity of the AFM quantum critical point. This is in stark contrast to
CeCoIn$_5$/CeRhIn$_5$ superlattice where the superconductivity in the
CeCoIn$_5$ BLs is profoundly affected by AFM fluctuations in the CeRhIn$_5$
BLs. The present results show that although AFM fluctuations are injected into
the CeCoIn$_5$ BLs from the CeIn$_3$ BLs through the interface, they barely
affect the force which binds superconducting electron pairs. These results
demonstrate that 2D AFM fluctuations are essentially important for the pairing

coupled to another, the ""probe"", in a compact spacetime region. Measurements of
observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables
in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state
of the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the
conditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field
theory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe
observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are
typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual
measurement on the coupled theory. A formula is given for the post-selected
system state, conditioned on measurement outcomes, which is closely related to
the notion of an instrument as introduced by Davies and Lewis. This formula has
the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites,
provided that their coupling regions can be causally ordered and a certain
causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics; the composite is
independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists. The general
framework is amenable to calculation, as is shown in a specific example. This

  Monte carlo rule is an organic combination of the current dynamic rules of

also reflects the individual's bounded rational behavior and the ambivalence
between the pursuit of high returns and high risks. In addition, it also
reflects the individual's behavioral execution preferences.
  The implementation of monte carlo rule brings an extremely good result,
higher cooperation level and stronger robustness are achieved by comparing with
the unconditional imitation rule, replicator dynamics rule and fermi rule.
  When analyse the equilibrium density of cooperators as a function of the
temptation to defect, it appears a smooth transition between the mixed state of
coexistence of cooperators and defectors and the pure state of defectors when
enhancing the temptation, which can be perfectly characterized by the
trigonometric behavior instead of the power-law behavior discovered in the
pioneer's work.
  When discuss the relationship between the temptation to defect and the
average returns of cooperators and defectors, it is found that cooperators'
average returns is almost a constant throughout the whole temptation parameter
ranges while defectors' decreases as the growth of temptation.
  Additionally, the insensitivity of cooperation level to the initial density
of cooperators and the sensitivity to the social population have been both
demonstrated.

probe. However, cosmological constraints established with galaxy cluster number
count are highly dependent on the calibration of the mass-observable relations.
Thanks to its nearly mass independence the specific mass accretion rate of
galaxy clusters is nearly insensitive to the calibration of mass-observable
relations. The study of galaxy cluster number count evolution allows to probe
the galaxy cluster mass accretion history in the context of an homogenous
Universe. In this paper, we use relative abundance matching to infer the galaxy
cluster mass accretion rate (MAR) for $z \in [0.0,0.6[$. Then, we use the MAR
to set cosmological constraints. We found that this cosmological probe is
sensitive to $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{-0.3} H_0^{-0.2}$ whereas the galaxy
cluster count is sensitive to $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.3}$. We used the
second $Planck$ catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources and we derive $\sigma_8
\Omega_{\rm m}^{-0.3} H_0^{-0.2} = 0.75 \pm 0.06$. This results is consistent
with cosmological constraints derived from galaxy clusters number counts,
angular power spectrum, and cosmic microwave background analyses. Therefore,
the MAR is a key cosmological probe that can break the $\sigma_8$-$\Omega_{\rm
m}$ degeneracy and that is not sensitive to the calibration of the
mass-observable relations and does not requires a parametric form for the

  defects","26 pages; 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We seek a rational route to large-deformation, thermo-mechanical modeling of
solids with metrical defects. It assumes the reference and deformed geometries
to be of the Weyl type and introduces the Weyl one-form -- an additional set of
degrees of freedom that determine ratios of lengths in different tangent
spaces. The Weyl one-form prevents the metric from being compatible with the
connection and enables exploitation of the incompatibility for characterizing
metrical defects in the body. When such a body undergoes temperature changes,
additional incompatibilities appear and interact with the defects. This
interaction is modeled using the Weyl transform, which keeps the Weyl
connection invariant whilst changing the non-metricity of the configuration. An
immediate consequence of the Weyl connection is that the critical points of the
stored energy are shifted. We exploit this feature to represent the residual
stresses. In order to relate stress and strain in our non-Euclidean setting,
use is made of the Doyle-Ericksen formula, which is interpreted as a relation
between the intrinsic geometry of the body and the stresses developed. Thus the
Cauchy stress is conjugate to the Weyl transformed metric tensor of the
deformed configuration. The evolution equation for the Weyl one-form is
consistent with the two laws of thermodynamics. Our temperature evolution
equation, which couples temperature, deformation and Weyl one-form, follows
from the first law of thermodynamics. Using the model, the self-stress
generated by a point defect is calculated and compared with the linear elastic
solutions. We also obtain conditions on the defect distribution (Weyl one-form)
that render a thermo-mechanical deformation stress-free. Using this condition,
we compute specific stress-free deformation profiles for a class of prescribed
temperature changes.

numerical simulations of a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)

that determines the value of the epidemic threshold is the directionality of
the links connecting different layers, regardless of the degree distribution

directed multilayer networks and the widespread use of disease-like spreading
processes in a broad range of phenomena such as diffusion processes in social

work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS
DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and
metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled
population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space
consisting of redshift, ($z_{\rm QSO}$ and $z_{\rm abs}$), optical extinction,
and HI column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on
these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived
for DLAs at z=3: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and
metals, the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly
affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral
hydrogen is underestimated by 10 to 50%, and the mass density in metals is
underestimated by 30 to 200%. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on
redshift. At redshift z=2.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals
might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively.
Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and
model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.

efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated considering fourteen distinct
classes of PQ events which conform to the IEEE Standard 1159. The search
performance of the 2D learning approach has been compared to the other six
well-known feature selection wrappers by considering two induction algorithms:
Naive Bayes (NB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Further, the robustness of the
selected/reduced feature subsets has been investigated considering seven
different levels of noise. The results of this investigation convincingly
demonstrate that the proposed 2D learning can identify significantly better and
robust feature subsets for PQ events.

order to identify the relationship between them is an expensive and
time-consuming task. To handle these challenges, different computational
approaches have been developed. Based on the observation that genes associated
with similar diseases have a higher likelihood of interaction, a large class of
these approaches relay on analyzing the topological properties of biological
networks. However, the incomplete and noisy nature of biological networks is
known as an important challenge in these approaches. In this paper, we propose
a two-step framework for disease gene prioritization: (1) construction of a
reliable human FLN using sequence information and machine learning techniques,
(2) prioritizing the disease gene relations based on the constructed FLN. On
our framework, unlike other FLN based frameworks that using FLNs based on
integration of various low quality biological data, the sequence of proteins is
used as the comprehensive data to construct a reliable initial network. In
addition, the physicochemical properties of amino-acids are employed to
describe the functionality of proteins. All in all, the proposed approach is
evaluated and the results indicate the high efficiency and validity of the FLN
in disease gene prioritization.

Immediately, GRB 190114C was followed up by a massive observational campaign

obtain the LAT light curve of GRB 190114C and show that it exhibits similar
features to other bright LAT-detected bursts; the first high-energy photon
($\geq$ 100 MeV) is delayed with the onset of the prompt phase and the flux
light curve exhibits a long-lived emission (lasting much longer than the prompt
phase) and a short-lasting bright peak (located at the beginning of long-lived
emission). Analyzing the multi-wavelength observations, we show that the
short-lasting LAT and GBM bright peaks are consistent with the synchrotron
self-Compton reverse-shock model and the long-lived observations with the
standard synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from a stratified
stellar-wind like medium to a uniform ISM-like medium. Given the best-fit
values, a bright optical flash produced by synchrotron reverse-shock emission
is expected. From our analysis we infer that the high-energy photons are
produced in the deceleration phase of the outflow and some additional processes
to synchrotron in the forward shocks should be considered to properly describe
the LAT photons with energies beyond the synchrotron limit. Moreover, we claim
that an outflow endowed with magnetic fields could describe the polarization
and properties exhibited in the light curve of GRB 190114C.

efficiently solve problems, is one of the central research tasks in
evolutionary computation. In this work, we make progress in understanding the
interplay between parent and offspring population size of the $(\mu,\lambda)$
EA. Previous works, roughly speaking, indicate that for $\lambda \ge
(1+\varepsilon) e \mu$, this EA easily optimizes the OneMax function, whereas
an offspring population size $\lambda \le (1 -\varepsilon) e \mu$ leads to an
exponential runtime.
  Motivated also by the observation that in the efficient regime the
$(\mu,\lambda)$ EA loses its ability to escape local optima, we take a closer
look into this phase transition. Among other results, we show that when $\mu
\le n^{1/2 - c}$ for any constant $c > 0$, then for any $\lambda \le e \mu$ we
have a super-polynomial runtime. However, if $\mu \ge n^{2/3 + c}$, then for
any $\lambda \ge e \mu$, the runtime is polynomial. For the latter result we
observe that the $(\mu,\lambda)$ EA profits from better individuals also
because these, by creating slightly worse offspring, stabilize slightly
sub-optimal sub-populations. While these first results close to the phase
transition do not yet give a complete picture, they indicate that the boundary
between efficient and super-polynomial is not just the line $\lambda = e \mu$,
and that the reasons for efficiency or not are more complex than what was known
so far.

influence of the thermal noise can be treated using a plethora of schemes,
several of which decompose the corresponding correlation functions in terms of

hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), which is built using only certain
forms of bath correlation functions. In the case where the environment is
described by a complex spectral density or is at a very low temperature,
approaches utilizing the exponential decomposition become very inefficient.
Here we utilize an alternative decomposition scheme for the bath correlation
function based on Chebyshev polynomials and Bessel functions to derive a
hierarchical equations of motion approach up to an arbitrary order in the
environmental coupling. These hierarchical equations are similar in structure
to the popular exponential HEOM scheme, but are formulated using the
derivatives of the Bessel functions. The proposed scheme is tested up to the
fourth order in perturbation theory for a two-level system and compared to
benchmark calculations for the case of zero-temperature quantum Ohmic and
super-Ohmic noise. Furthermore, the benefits and shortcomings of the present

show that certain radial functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be easily
approximated with depth $3$ networks, cannot be approximated by depth $2$
networks, even up to constant accuracy, unless their size is exponential in
$d$. However, the functions used to demonstrate this are rapidly oscillating,
with a Lipschitz parameter scaling polynomially with the dimension $d$ (or
equivalently, by scaling the function, the hardness result applies to
$\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz functions only when the target accuracy $\epsilon$
is at most $\text{poly}(1/d)$). In this paper, we study whether such depth
separations might still hold in the natural setting of
$\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions, when $\epsilon$ does not scale
with $d$. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the answer is negative: In
contrast to the intuition suggested by previous work, it \emph{is} possible to
approximate $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions with depth $2$, size
$\text{poly}(d)$ networks, for every constant $\epsilon$. We complement it by
showing that approximating such functions is also possible with depth $2$, size
$\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ networks, for every constant $d$. Finally, we show
that it is not possible to have polynomial dependence in both $d,1/\epsilon$
simultaneously. Overall, our results indicate that in order to show depth

applications. By sensor fusion, we can compensate the deficiencies of

tightly coupled lidar-IMU fusion method in this paper. By jointly minimizing
the cost derived from lidar and IMU measurements, the lidar-IMU odometry (LIO)
can perform well with acceptable drift after long-term experiment, even in
challenging cases where the lidar measurements can be degraded. Besides, to
obtain more reliable estimations of the lidar poses, a rotation-constrained
refinement algorithm (LIO-mapping) is proposed to further align the lidar poses
with the global map. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed
method can estimate the poses of the sensor pair at the IMU update rate with
high precision, even under fast motion conditions or with insufficient
features.

naturally as eigenfunctions of an integral operator defined by the Brownian

piecewise parabolas gives a locally higher order numerical method for
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) when compared to the standard

the structure, quality and dynamics of real-world networks like the Internet

agents without a central authority. In these games selfish agents which
correspond to nodes in a network strategically buy incident edges to improve
their centrality. However, past research on these games has only considered the
creation of networks with unit-weight edges. In practice, e.g. when
constructing a fiber-optic network, the choice of which nodes to connect and
also the induced price for a link crucially depends on the distance between the
involved nodes and such settings can be modeled via edge-weighted graphs. We
incorporate arbitrary edge weights by generalizing the well-known model by
Fabrikant et al.[PODC'03] to edge-weighted host graphs and focus on the
geometric setting where the weights are induced by the distances in some metric
space. In stark contrast to the state-of-the-art for the unit-weight version,
where the Price of Anarchy is conjectured to be constant and where resolving
this is a major open problem, we prove a tight non-constant bound on the Price
of Anarchy for the metric version and a slightly weaker upper bound for the
non-metric case. Moreover, we analyze the existence of equilibria, the
computational hardness and the game dynamics for several natural metrics. The
model we propose can be seen as the game-theoretic analogue of a variant of the
classical Network Design Problem. Thus, low-cost equilibria of our game

design.

initial works mainly focus on weak gravitational fields and the anomalous
current is obtained for conformally flat spaces with small scale factors. In
this paper, we generalize the results to the case with arbitrary scale factors.
Firstly, we derive the transformation law of current under Weyl transformation,
from which one can read off the anomalous current in general conformally flat
spaces. Secondly, by using the Weyl transformation of currents we provide a new
derivation of the Weyl-anomaly-induced current near the boundary. Thus we have
obtained the two kinds of anomalous currents in the literature from a unified
formula. Finally, we extend the discussions to n-form fields and find similar
anomalous currents.

the rapidly growing backhaul traffic in a mobile network. New 5G technology and
dense femtocell enable one user to connect to multiple base-stations
simultaneously. Practical implementation requires the caches in BSs to be
regarded as a cache server, but few of the existing works considered how to
offload traffic, or how to schedule HTTP requests to CBSs. In this work, we
propose a DNS-based HTTP traffic allocation framework. It schedules user
traffic among multiple CBSs by DNS resolution, with the consideration of
load-balancing, traffic allocation consistency and scheduling granularity of
DNS. To address these issues, we formulate the user-traffic allocation problem
in DNS-based mobile edge caching, aiming at maximizing QoS gain and allocation
consistency while maintaining load balance. Then we present a simple greedy
algorithm which gives a more consistent solution when user-traffic changes
dynamically. Theoretical analysis proves that it is within 3/4 of the optimal
solution. Extensive evaluations in numerical and trace-driven situations show
that the greedy algorithm can avoid about 50% unnecessary shift in user-traffic
allocation, yield more stable cache hit ratio and balance the load between CBSs
without losing much of the QoS gain.

same time as neutrino masses in the type-I seesaw model. This framework
provides a dynamical origin for the scalar potential of the Standard Model and
suggests a new approach to the hierarchy problem. Here we review the
preliminary analysis of Ref. [1], that showed the viability of this scenario,
as well as the improved study of Ref. [2], that led to a better identification
of the region of the parameter space where the Neutrino Option can be realized.
We find that experimental constraints from both Higgs and neutrino physics can
be accommodated introducing 2 heavy Majorana neutrinos with mass $M_1\simeq
M_2\sim 0.5 - 10$ PeV and Yukawa couplings to the lepton doublet of order $
10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, assuming that at the scale $M$ the classical Higgs potential
is approximately conformal, with a quartic Higgs coupling $\lambda_0\sim
0.01-0.05$. Specifying the light neutrino mass ordering, the ratio $M_2/M_1$ or
a given value of the top quark mass identifies narrower ranges for all the
parameters. Although no further signature of the Neutrino Option is generally
predicted at the currently accessible energy scales, conformal UV completions
have been proposed, that could be tested e.g. via detection of gravitational
waves. Leptogenesis can also be successfully realized in this scenario, that
intriguingly ties together the breaking of the conformal and electroweak
symmetries with the violation of lepton number.

interacting with an environment typically constituted by a continuum of bosonic

where, in general, one has neither control over the bosonic modes, nor the
ability to tune distinct interaction mechanisms. Despite this apparent lack of
control, we present a suitable transformation that approximately maps the
spin-boson dynamics into that of a tunable multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model
undergoing dissipation. Interestingly, the latter model describes the coherent
interaction between a spin and a single bosonic mode via the simultaneous
exchange of n bosons per spin excitation. Resorting to the so-called reaction
coordinate method, we identify a relevant collective bosonic mode in the
environment which is then used to generate multiphoton interactions following
the proposed theoretical framework. Moreover, we show that spin-boson models
featuring structured environments can lead into non-Markovian multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings dynamics. We discuss the validity of the proposed method
depending on the parameters and analyze its performance, which is supported by
numerical simulations. In this manner, the spin-boson model serves as a good

applications in energy harvesting due to their reduced phonon thermal

staircase-like QD energy levels. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear Seebeck
effect can lead to significant electron transports for such a nanowire with
staircase-like energy levels. The asymmetrical alignment of energy levels of
quantum dots embedded in nanowires can be controlled to allow resonant electron
transport under forward temperature bias, while they are in off-resonant regime
under backward bias. Under such a mechanism,the power output and efficiency of
such a SLNW are better than SLNWs with uniform QD energy levels. The SLNW HE
has direction-dependent power output and heat current. In addition, the HE has
the functionality of a heat diode with impressive negative differential thermal
conductance under open circuit condition.

on reducing the delay that congestion signals experience within a queue

regulation of the load becomes more sloppy, and the queue tends to overshoot
and undershoot more as a result, leading the data itself to experience greater
peaks in queuing delay as well as intermittent under-utilization. Where the
service rate of a queue varies, it is preferable to measure the queue in units
of time not bytes. However, the size of the queued backlog can be measured in
bytes and signalled at the last instant as data leaves the queue, whereas
measuring queuing delay introduces inherent delay. This paper proposes 'scaled
sojourn time', which scales queuing delay by the ratio between the backlogs at

advanced collision avoidance, in which several cars cooperate to reach an
optimal overall outcome, that no single car acting in isolation could achieve.
For example, one car may automatically swerve to allow another to avoid an
obstacle. However, this requires solving the challenging problem of deciding
what joint trajectories an ad-hoc group of cooperating vehicles should follow,
with no obvious leader known in advance. To avoid the complexities of agreeing
what plan to follow in an ever-evolving situation, a protocol requiring no
leader and no explicit inter-vehicle agreement is desirable, which nevertheless
yields cooperative, robust behaviour. One method is demonstrated here, in
simulation. This uses the notion of ""desired"" versus ""planned"" trajectories,
allowing vehicles to influence each other for mutual benefit, without requiring
a leader or explicit agreement protocol. Essentially the desired trajectory is
that which the vehicle would choose if other cooperating vehicles were not
present, avoiding the predicted paths of non-cooperating actors. The planned
trajectory additionally accounts for the planned trajectories of other
cooperating vehicles, giving the safest currently available path. Both
trajectories are broadcast. As each vehicle attempts to (weakly) avoid the
desired trajectories of other vehicles, cooperative behaviour emerges. A simple
form of model predictive control is used. The cost function penalises predicted
collisions, accounting for severity. There is a weak preference for maintaining
the current road lane, but no explicit reference trajectory. This decentralised
planning and simple optimisation scheme results in effective handling of a wide
range of collision scenarios, with no hard limit to the number of cooperating
vehicles. The computing cost is linear in the number of vehicles.

central force interactions in two dimensions. We further demonstrate the
emergence of a stiffening transition when the coordination is increased towards

with an auxeticity transition above which the material's Poisson's ratio

force-free spheromak CME model initialised using parameters derived from
remote-sensing observations. Using observation-based CME input parameters, we
perform MHD simulations of the events with the cone and spheromak CME models.
Results show that spheromak CMEs propagate faster than cone CMEs when
initialised with the same kinematic parameters. We interpret these differences
as due to different Lorentz forces acting within cone and spheromak CMEs,
leading to different CME expansions. Such discrepancies can be mitigated by
initialising spheromak CMEs with a reduced speed corresponding to the radial
speed only. Results at Earth evidence that the spheromak model improves the
predictions of B(Bz) up to 12-60(22-40) percentage points compared to a cone
model. Considering virtual spacecraft located around Earth, B(Bz) predictions
reach 45-70%(58-78%) of the observed peak values. The spheromak model predicts
inaccurate magnetic field parameters at Earth for CMEs propagating away from
the Sun-Earth line, while it successfully predicts the CME properties and
arrival time in the case of strictly Earth-directed events. Modelling CMEs
propagating away from the Sun-Earth line requires extra care due to limitations

initial condition for the formation of planetary systems, but estimates vary by
orders of magnitude. In some disks with resolvable cavities, sharp inner disk
warps cast two-sided shadows on the outer rings; can the cooling of the gas as
it crosses the shadows bring constraints on its mass? The finite cooling
timescale should result in dust temperature decrements shifted ahead of the
optical/IR shadows in the direction of rotation. However, some systems show
temperature drops, while others do not. The depth of the drops and the
amplitude of the shift depend on the outer disk surface density Sigma through
the extent of cooling during the shadow crossing time, and also on the
efficiency of radiative diffusion. These phenomena may bear observational
counterparts, which we describe with a simple one-dimensional model. An
application to the HD142527 disk suggests an asymmetry in its shadows, and
predicts a >~10deg shift for a massive gaseous disk, with peak Sigma > 8.3
g/cm2. Another application to the DoAr44 disk limits the peak surface density
to Sigma < 13g/cm2

band characteristics via polynomial and Gaussian fits to test their spectral
similarity to Ceres, the asteroid 24 Themis (thought to be covered in ice
frost), and the asteroid 51 Nemausa (spectrally similar to the CM meteorites).
We confirm most of the observations are inconsistent with what is seen in
meteorites and require additional absorbers. We find clusters in band centers
that correspond to Ceres- and Themis-like spectra, but no hiatus in the
distribution suitable for use to simply distinguish between them. We also find
a range of band centers in the spectra that approaches what is seen on Comet
67P. Finally, variation is seen between observations for some objects, with the
variation on 324 Bamberga consistent with hemispheric-level difference in
composition. Given the ubiquity of objects with 3-$\mu$m spectra unlike what we
see in meteorites, and the similarity of those spectra to the published spectra
of Ceres and Themis, these objects appear much more to be archetypes than

information from blockchain nodes (servers) to Internet of Things (IoT)

protocols, upon generation of a new block, each IoT device receives a copy of
the block header, authenticated via digital signature by one or more trusted
servers. Since it relies on unicast transmissions, the required communication
resources grow linearly with the number of IoT devices. We propose a more
efficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted,
together with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a
delay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in
time, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally,
the BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the
unreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback
required from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely
authentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the
packet loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the
performance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point
for designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.

widespread use of endoscopy in different clinical applications, we contend that
the robust and reliable identification of such artifacts and the automated
restoration of corrupted video frames is a fundamental medical imaging problem.
Existing state-of-the-art methods only deal with the detection and restoration
of selected artifacts. However, typically endoscopy videos contain numerous
artifacts which motivates to establish a comprehensive solution.
  We propose a fully automatic framework that can: 1) detect and classify six
different primary artifacts, 2) provide a quality score for each frame and 3)
restore mildly corrupted frames. To detect different artifacts our framework
exploits fast multi-scale, single stage convolutional neural network detector.
We introduce a quality metric to assess frame quality and predict image
restoration success. Generative adversarial networks with carefully chosen
regularization are finally used to restore corrupted frames.
  Our detector yields the highest mean average precision (mAP at 5% threshold)
of 49.0 and the lowest computational time of 88 ms allowing for accurate
real-time processing. Our restoration models for blind deblurring, saturation
correction and inpainting demonstrate significant improvements over previous
methods. On a set of 10 test videos we show that our approach preserves an
average of 68.7% which is 25% more frames than that retained from the raw

subjects' head fixations on ODIs. Inspired by generative adversarial imitation
learning (GAIL), this paper proposes a novel approach to predict saliency of
head fixations on ODIs, named SalGAIL. First, we establish a dataset for
attention on ODIs (AOI). In contrast to traditional datasets, our AOI dataset
is large-scale, which contains the head fixations of 30 subjects viewing 600
ODIs. Next, we mine our AOI dataset and determine three findings: (1) The
consistency of head fixations are consistent among subjects, and it grows
alongside the increased subject number; (2) The head fixations exist with a
front center bias (FCB); and (3) The magnitude of head movement is similar
across subjects. According to these findings, our SalGAIL approach applies deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict the head fixations of one subject, in
which GAIL learns the reward of DRL, rather than the traditional human-designed
reward. Then, multi-stream DRL is developed to yield the head fixations of
different subjects, and the saliency map of an ODI is generated via convoluting
predicted head fixations. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach in predicting saliency maps of ODIs, significantly better than 10

hardware testing, in which test cases are generated automatically from
high-level specifications. Nowadays, systems typically consist of multiple
interacting components and, due to their complexity, testing presents a
considerable portion of the effort and cost in the design process. Exploiting
the compositional structure of system specifications can considerably reduce
the effort in model-based testing. Moreover, inferring properties about the
system from testing its individual components allows the designer to reduce the
amount of integration testing.
  In this paper, we study compositional properties of the IOCO-testing theory.
We propose a new approach to composition and hiding operations, inspired by
contract-based design and interface theories. These operations preserve
behaviors that are compatible under composition and hiding, and prune away
incompatible ones. The resulting specification characterizes the input
sequences for which the unit testing of components is sufficient to infer the
correctness of component integration without the need for further tests. We
provide a methodology that uses these results to minimize integration testing
effort, but also to detect potential weaknesses in specifications. While we
focus on asynchronous models and the IOCO conformance relation, the resulting
methodology can be applied to a broader class of systems.

dynamics of active Brownian particles, and their motility induced phase
separation. Frictional forces increase the angular diffusivity of the
particles, in the dilute phase, and prevent colliding particles from resolving
their collision by sliding one past to the other. This leads to qualitatively
changes of motility-induced phase diagram in the volume-fraction motility
plane. While frictionless systems become unstable towards phase separation as
the motility increases only if their volume fraction overcomes a threshold,
frictional system become unstable regardless of their volume fraction. These
results suggest the possibility of controlling the motility induced phase

architectures such as autoencoders and Generative Adversarial networks produce
spectacular results on highly complex data, such as images of faces or
landscapes. While these results open up a wide range of new, advanced synthesis
applications, there is also a severe lack of theoretical understanding of how
these networks work. This results in a wide range of practical problems, such
as difficulties in training, the tendency to sample images with little or no
variability, and generalisation problems. In this paper, we propose to analyse
the ability of the simplest generative network, the autoencoder, to encode and
decode two simple geometric attributes : size and position. We believe that, in
order to understand more complicated tasks, it is necessary to first understand
how these networks process simple attributes. For the first property, we
analyse the case of images of centred disks with variable radii. We explain how
the autoencoder projects these images to and from a latent space of smallest
possible dimension, a scalar. In particular, we describe a closed-form solution
to the decoding training problem in a network without biases, and show that
during training, the network indeed finds this solution. We then investigate
the best regularisation approaches which yield networks that generalise well.
For the second property, position, we look at the encoding and decoding of
Dirac delta functions, also known as `one-hot' vectors. We describe a
hand-crafted filter that achieves encoding perfectly, and show that the network
naturally finds this filter during training. We also show experimentally that
the decoding can be achieved if the dataset is sampled in an appropriate
manner.

2018 October 28+/-5 (Tail A), UT 2018 December 31+/-5 (Tail B), and UT 2019
February 10+/-7, with durations of 10 to 20 days. With a mean particle radius
100 micron, the estimated masses of the tails are M_A = 2e7 kg, M_B = 3e6 kg
and M_C = 3e5 kg, respectively, and the mass loss rates from the nucleus are 10
to 20 kg/s for Tail A, 2 to 3 kg/s for Tail B and about 0.2 kg/s for Tail C. In
its optical colors Gault is more similar to C-type asteroids than to S-types,
even though the latter are numerically dominant in the inner asteroid belt. A
spectroscopic upper limit to the production of gas is set at 1 kg/s. Discrete
emission in three protracted episodes effectively rules out an impact origin
for the observed activity. Sublimation driven activity is unlikely given the
inner belt orbit and the absence of detectable gas. In any case, sublimation
would not easily account for the observed multiple ejections. The closest
similarity is between Gault and active asteroid 311P/(2013 P5), an object
showing repeated but aperiodic ejections of dust over a 9 month period. While
Gault is 10 times larger than 311P/(2013 P5), and the spin-up time to radiation
torques is 100 times longer, its properties are likewise most consistent with
episodic emission from a body rotating near breakup.

interactions at low energy. A combined framework of both expansions has been
developed and applied for baryons with three light-quark-flavors. The small
scale expansion of the combined approach is identified as the $\xi$-expansion,
in which the power counting of the expansions is linked according to
$O(p)=O(1/N_c)=O(\xi)$. The physical baryon masses as well as lattice QCD
baryon masses for different quark mass masses are analyzed to $O(\xi^3)$ in
that framework. $\sigma$ terms are addressed using the Feynman Hellmann
theorem. For the nucleon, a useful connection between the deviation of the
Gell-Mann-Okubo relation and the $\sigma$ term $\sigma_{8N}$ associated with
the scalar density $\bar u u+\bar d d-2\bar s s$ is identified. In particular,
the deviation from the tree level relation $\sigma_{8N}=\frac 13(2
m_N-m_\Sigma-m_\Xi)$, which gives rise to the so called $\sigma$-term puzzle,
is studied in the $\xi$-expansion. A large correction non-analytic in $\xi$
results for that relation, making plausible the resolution of the puzzle.
Issues with the determination of the strangeness $\sigma$ terms are discussed,
emphasizing the need for lattice calculations at smaller $m_s$ for better
understanding the range of validity of the effective theory. The analysis
presented here leads to $\sigma_{\pi N}=69(10)$~MeV and $\sigma_{\pi

options to preprocess sequences of system calls so that they can be processed
by neural networks. These input options are based on one-hot encoding and
learning word2vec or GloVe representations of system calls. As an additional
option, we analyze if the mapping of system calls to their respective kernel
modules is an adequate generalization step for (a) replacing system calls or
(b) enhancing system call data with additional information regarding their
context. However, when performing such preprocessing steps it is important to
ensure that no relevant information is lost during the process. The overall
objective of system call based intrusion detection is to categorize sequences
of system calls as benign or malicious behavior. Therefore, this scenario is
used to evaluate the different input options as a classification task. The
results show, that each of the four different methods is a valid option when
preprocessing input data, but the use of kernel modules only is not recommended
because too much information is being lost during the mapping process.

ultrashort, intense laser pulses. The dynamics is mediated by the soft modes

due to carriers cooling arrests the remnants of the transient orders into the
topological defects in the eventual state with distinct new properties that

also demonstrate the importance of correct treatment of the atomic

low-energy performance of the detectors, meaning it is crucial that the
detector uncertainties be taken into account. Finally, we demonstrate that the
potential scintillation event rate can be much larger than may otherwise be

WIMPs using the conventional prompt S1 scintillation signals. This is important

observations of a black-hole shadow by the Event Horizon Telescope. We explore
modifications of spinning and non-spinning black-hole spacetimes inspired by
asymptotically safe quantum gravity which features a scale dependence of the
Newton coupling. As a consequence, the predictions of our model, such as the
shadow shape and size, depend on one free parameter determining the curvature
scale at which deviations from General Relativity set in. In more general
new-physics settings, it can also depart substantially from the Planck scale.
In this case, the free parameter is constrained by observations, since the
corresponding curvature scale is significantly below the Planck-scale. The
leading new-physics effect can be recast as a scale-dependent black-hole mass,
resulting in distinct observational signatures of our model. As a concrete
example, we show that two mass-measurements, extracted from the size of the
shadow and from Keplerian orbital motion of stars, allow to distinguish the
classical from the modified, regular black-hole spacetime, yielding a bound on
the free parameter. For spinning black holes, we further find that the
singularity-resolving new physics puts a characteristic dent in the shadow.
Finally, we argue, based on the underlying physical mechanism, that the effects

separation logics for concurrency have employed an algebraic structure of

The method is divided into the offline and online steps. In the offline step,
basis functions are prepared from a snapshot space via a well-designed

utilized to patch up for a solution through DG formulation in the online step

this is a generic situation in that every smooth knot K in three space has a

of neuroimaging with the emergence of the connectionist approach. In this new
context, it is important to know not only which brain areas are activated by a
particular stimulus but, mainly, how these areas are structurally and
functionally connected, distributed, and organized in relation to other areas.
Additionally, the arrangement of the network elements, i.e., its topology, and
the dynamics they give rise to are also important. This new approach is called
connectomics. It brings together a series of techniques and methodologies
capable of systematizing, from the different types of signals and images of the
nervous system, how neuronal units to brain areas are connected. Through this
approach, the different patterns of connectivity can be graphically and
mathematically represented by the so-called connectomes. The connectome uses
quantitative metrics to evaluate structural and functional information from
images of neural tracts and pathways or signals from the metabolic and/or
electrophysiologic activity of cell populations or brain areas. Besides, with
adequate treatment of this information, it is also possible to infer causal
relationships. In this way, structural and functional evaluations are
complementary descriptions which, together, represent the anatomic and
physiologic neural properties, establishing a new paradigm for understanding
how the brain functions by looking at brain connections. Here, we highlight
five critical elements of a network that allows an integrative analysis,
focusing mainly on a functional description. These elements include; (i) the
properties of its nodes; (ii) the metrics for connectivity and coupling between
nodes; (iii) the network topologies; (iv) the network dynamics and (v) the

bounds with the increase in population. Surveillance through computer vision
and expert decision making systems can help to understand the crowd phenomena

identification of unwanted incidents and their prevention. Motion flow is one
of the important crowd phenomena that can be instrumental in describing the
crowd behavior. Flows can be useful in understanding instabilities in the
crowd. However, extracting motion flows is a challenging task due to randomness
in crowd movement and limitations of the sensing device. Moreover, low-level
features such as optical flow can be misleading if the randomness is high. In
this paper, we propose a new model based on Langevin equation to analyze the
linear dominant flows in videos of densely crowded scenarios. We assume a force
model with three components, namely external force, confinement/drift force,
and disturbance force. These forces are found to be sufficient to describe the
linear or near-linear motion in dense crowd videos. The method is significantly
faster as compared to existing popular crowd segmentation methods. The
evaluation of the proposed model has been carried out on publicly available
datasets as well as using our dataset. It has been observed that the proposed
method is able to estimate and segment the linear flows in the dense crowd with
better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art techniques with substantial

problem of workflow satisfiability, which asks whether the existence of

the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) studied in the context of workflow
specifications in which the set of steps may vary from one instance of the
workflow to another. This, in turn, means that some constraints may only apply
to certain workflow instances. Inevitably, WSP becomes more complex for such
workflow specifications. Other approaches have considered the possibility of
associating costs with the violation of `soft' constraints and authorizations.
Workflow satisfiability in this context becomes a question of minimizing the
cost of allocating users to steps in the workflow. In this paper, we introduce
new problems, which we believe to be of practical relevance, that combine these
approaches. In particular, we consider the question of whether, given a
workflow specification with costs and a `budget', all possible workflow
instances have an allocation of users to steps that does not exceed the budget.

However, the properties of COCA have never been systematically explored, and
its robustness to the inclusion of noisy datasets, or datasets that define
conflicting clustering structures, is unclear. We rigorously benchmark COCA,
and present Kernel Learning Integrative Clustering (KLIC) as an alternative
strategy. KLIC frames the challenge of combining clustering structures as a
multiple kernel learning problem, in which different datasets each provide a
weighted contribution to the final clustering. This allows the contribution of
noisy datasets to be down-weighted relative to more informative datasets. We
compare the performances of KLIC and COCA in a variety of situations through
simulation studies. We also present the output of KLIC and COCA in real data

catastrophic forgetting, making continual or lifelong learning difficult for
machine learning. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for
continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is
difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured
comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at
test time task identity is provided and--in case it is not--whether it must be
inferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each
scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario
we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning
methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in
terms of difficulty and in terms of how efficient different methods are. In
particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental
learning), we find that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight
consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences
seems required for solving this scenario.

pattern mining. While ranking or selecting patterns is well-studied for
itemsets it is surprisingly under-researched for other, more complex, pattern
types.
  In this paper we propose a new quality measure for episodes. An episode is
essentially a set of events with possible restrictions on the order of events.
We say that an episode is significant if its occurrence is abnormally compact,
that is, only few gap events occur between the actual episode events, when
compared to the expected length according to the independence model. We can
apply this measure as a post-pruning step by first discovering frequent
episodes and then rank them according to this measure.
  In order to compute the score we will need to compute the mean and the
variance according to the independence model. As a main technical contribution
we introduce a technique that allows us to compute these values. Such a task is
surprisingly complex and in order to solve it we develop intricate finite state
machines that allow us to compute the needed statistics. We also show that
asymptotically our score can be interpreted as a P-value. In our experiments we
demonstrate that despite its intricacy our ranking is fast: we can rank tens of
thousands episodes in seconds. Our experiments with text data demonstrate that
our measure ranks interpretable episodes high.

uncertainty principle (GUP) black hole in the presence of two natural cutoffs

allows the existence of sub-Planckian black holes, where the black hole mass
$m$ is replaced by
$M=m\Big(1+\frac{\beta^{2}}{2}\frac{M_{pl}^{2}}{m^{2}}-\beta\frac{M_{pl}}{m}\Big)$.
Considering a wave-packet with a Gaussian profile, we evaluate the HWF and the
probability that the source might be a (quantum) black hole. By decreasing the
free parameter the general form of probability distribution,
${\mathcal{P}}_{BH}$, is preserved , but this resulted in reducing the
probability for the particle to be a black hole accordingly. The probability
for the particle to be a black hole grows when the mass is increasing slowly
for larger positive $\beta$, and for a minimum mass value it reaches to $0$. In
effect, for larger $\beta$ the magnitude of $M$ and $r_{H}$ increases, matching
with our intuition that either the particle ought to be more localized or more
massive to be a black hole. The scenario undergoes a change for some values of
$\beta$ significantly, where there is a minimum in ${\mathcal{P}}_{BH}$ , so
this expresses that every particle can have some probability of decaying to a
black hole. In addition, for sufficiently large $\beta$ we find that every
particle could be fundamentally a quantum black hole.

species diffusion, accumulate over a limited portion of the complex plane. The

network size, a system deemed deterministically stable, hence resilient, may
