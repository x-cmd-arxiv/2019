over-parametrized regime, for a suitable initialization, with high probability
GD can find a global minimum exponentially fast. Generalization error estimates
along the GD path are also established. As a consequence, it is shown that when
the target function is in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a
kernel defined by the initialization, there exist generalizable early-stopping

uniformly close to the functions given by the related random feature model.
Consequently, in this ""implicit regularization"" setting, the deep neural

introducing a scalar-isoscalar fictitious particle that represents the origin
of quark shell interaction; in this way the states of the system are
eigenstates of the total momentum of the baryon. Only one-particle excitations
are considered. A two-quark core takes the place of the diquark, while the
third quark is excited to reproduce the baryonic resonances. For the $N(939)$
and $\Delta(1232)$, that represent the ground states of the spectra, the three
quarks are considered identical particles and the wave functions are completely
antisymmetric. The model is used to calculate the spectra of the $N$ and
$\Delta$ resonances and the nucleon magnetic moments. The results are compared
to the present experimental data. Due to the presence of the core and to the
one-particle excitations, the structure of the obtained spectra is analogous to
that given by the quark-diquark models.

rates and a graying population mean that care availability is becoming a
significant problem, causing concern amongst policy-makers that substantial
public investment in formal care will be required in decades to come. In this
paper we present an agent-based simulation of care provision in the UK, in
which individual agents can decide to provide informal care, or pay for private
care, for their loved ones. Agents base these decisions on factors including
their own health, employment status, financial resources, relationship to the
individual in need, and geographical location. Results demonstrate that the
model can produce similar patterns of care need and availability as is observed
in the real world, despite the model containing minimal empirical data. We
propose that our model better captures the complexities of social care

(where the set $S\subset[m]$ contains the sizes of the side information sets,
and the number of users is $n=\sum_{s\in S}\binom{m}{s}$, with no two users
having the same side information set): (i) the consecutive case:
$S=[s_\min:s_\max]$ for some $0 \leq s_\min\leq s_\max \leq m-t$, and (ii) the
complement-consecutive case: $S=[0:m-t]\backslash[s_\min:s_\max]$, for some $0

decentralized PICOD in those cases is the same as for the classical
(centralized) PICOD counterpart, except when the problem is no longer pliable,
that is, it reduces to an IC problem where every user needs to decode all
messages not in its side information set. Although the optimal code-length may
be the same in both centralized and decentralized settings, the actual optimal
codes are not. For the decentralized PICOD, sparse Maximum Distance Separable

the scaling limit of the process is the inverse of an $\alpha$-stable

to be (virtually) concordant if there is a compact oriented $3$-manifold $W$
and a smoothly and properly embedded annulus $A$ in $W \times [0,1]$ such that
$\partial W=\Sigma_1 \sqcup -\Sigma_0$ and $\partial A=K_1 \sqcup -K_0$. This
notion of concordance, due to Turaev, is equivalent to concordance of virtual
knots, due to Kauffman. A prime virtual knot, in the sense of Matveev, is one
for which no thickened surface representative $K \subset \Sigma \times [0,1]$
admits a nontrivial decomposition along a separating vertical annulus that
intersects $K$ in two points. Here we prove that every knot $K \subset \Sigma

corresponding results for classical knot concordance, due to Bleiler,
Kirby-Lickorish, Livingston, Myers, Nakanishi, and Soma. The new challenge for

every hyperbolic knot in $\Sigma \times [0,1]$ is prime and not every composite

noisy linked data in many emerging applications, and have recently attracted
the attention of the database research community. A fundamental problem on
uncertain graphs is the s-t reliability, which measures the probability that a
target node t is reachable from a source node s in a probabilistic (or
uncertain) graph, i.e., a graph where every edge is assigned a probability of
existence.
  Due to the inherent complexity of the s-t reliability estimation problem
(#P-hard), various sampling and indexing based efficient algorithms were
proposed in the literature. However, since they have not been thoroughly
compared with each other, it is not clear whether the later algorithm
outperforms the earlier ones. More importantly, the comparison framework,
datasets, and metrics were often not consistent (e.g., different convergence
criteria were employed to find the optimal number of samples) across these
works. We address this serious concern by re-implementing six state-of-the-art
s-t reliability estimation methods in a common system and code base, using
several medium and large-scale, real-world graph datasets, identical evaluation
metrics, and query workloads.
  Through our systematic and in-depth analysis of experimental results, we
report surprising findings, such as many follow-up algorithms can actually be
several orders of magnitude inefficient, less accurate, and more memory
intensive compared to the ones that were proposed earlier. We conclude by
discussing our recommendations on the road ahead.

independent concepts, fuel different protocols with quantum vs classical
advantage, and have distinct classical simulation costs. A natural question is
what are the relations between these concepts, advantages, and costs. To
address this question, it is useful to have a map that captures all the
connections between Bell non-locality and KS contextuality in quantum theory.
The aim of this work is to introduce such a map. After defining the
theory-independent notions of Bell non-locality and KS contextuality for ideal
measurements, we show that, in quantum theory, due to Neumark's dilation
theorem, every matrix of quantum Bell non-local correlations can be mapped to
an identical matrix of KS contextual correlations produced in a scenario with
identical relations of compatibility but where measurements are ideal and no
space-like separation is required. A more difficult problem is identifying
connections in the opposite direction. We show that there are ""one-to-one"" and
partial connections between KS contextual correlations and Bell non-local
correlations for some KS contextuality scenarios, but not for all of them.
However, there is also a method that transforms any matrix of KS contextual
correlations for quantum systems of dimension $d$ into a matrix of Bell
non-local correlations between two quantum subsystems each of them of dimension
$d$. We collect all these connections in map and list some problems which can
benefit from this map.

important source of patient-generated data, providing unique insights into
population health. A fundamental step to incorporating Twitter data in
pharmacoepidemiological research is to automatically recognize medication
mentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names may fail
due to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced
method to recognize them. Methods: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning
classifier, able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary
supplements. Kusuri (""medication"" in Japanese) is composed of two modules.
First, four different classifiers (lexicon-based, spelling-variant-based,
pattern-based and one based on a weakly-trained neural network) are applied in
parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names. Second, an
ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantical and
long-range dependencies of important words in the tweets discovered is used to
make the final decision. Results: On a balanced (50-50) corpus of 15,005
tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with 93.7%
F1-score, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of
all tweets posted by 113 Twitter users (98,959 tweets, with only 0.26%
mentioning medications), Kusuri obtained 76.3% F1-score. There is not a prior
drug extraction system that compares running on such an extremely unbalanced
dataset. Conclusion: The system identifies tweets mentioning drug names with
performance high enough to ensure its usefulness and ready to be integrated in
larger natural language processing systems.

regularized posterior by normalizing the likelihood and by imposing physical
constraints through priors of the parameters and states. We investigate joint
parameter-state estimation by the regularized posterior in a physically
motivated nonlinear stochastic energy balance model (SEBM) for paleoclimate
reconstruction. The high-dimensional posterior is sampled by a particle Gibbs
sampler that combines MCMC with an optimal particle filter exploiting the
structure of the SEBM. In tests using either Gaussian or uniform priors based
on the physical range of parameters, the regularized posteriors overcome the
ill-posedness and lead to samples within physical ranges, quantifying the
uncertainty in estimation. Due to the ill-posedness and the regularization, the
posterior of parameters presents a relatively large uncertainty, and
consequently, the maximum of the posterior, which is the minimizer in a
variational approach, can have a large variation. In contrast, the posterior of
states generally concentrates near the truth, substantially filtering out
observation noise and reducing uncertainty in the unconstrained SEBM.

Often such systems due to their natural repulsion exhibit remarkable
hyperuniformity properties, that is, the number of points landing in any given
region fluctuates at a much smaller scale compared to that of a set of i.i.d.
random points. A well known conjecture from physics appearing in the works of
Jancovici, Lebowitz, Manificat, Martin, and Yalcin ('80,'83,'93), states that
the variance of the number of points landing in a set should grow like the
surface area instead of the volume unlike i.i.d. random points. In a recent
beautiful work, Chatterjee (2017) gave the first proof of such a result in
dimension three for a Coulomb type system, known as the hierarchical Coulomb
gas, inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising ferromagnet. However
the case of dimensions greater than three had remained open. In this paper, we
establish the correct fluctuation behavior up to logarithmic factors in all
dimensions greater than three, for the hierarchical model. Using similar
methods, we also prove sharp variance bounds for smooth linear statistics which
were unknown in any dimension bigger than two. A key intermediate step is to
obtain precise results about the ground states of such models whose behavior
can be interpreted as hierarchical analogues of various crystalline conjectures
predicted for energy minimizing systems, and could be of independent interest.

computational investigations of the effects of mass and force-constant (FC)
disorder on phonon spectra. The method is based on the recently developed
typical medium dynamical cluster approach (TMDCA), which is a Green's function
approach. Excellent quantitative agreement with previous exact diagonalization
results establishes the veracity of the method. Application of the method to a
model system of binary mass and FC-disordered system leads to several findings.
A narrow resonance, significantly below the van Hove singularity, that has been
termed as the boson peak, is seen to emerge for low soft particle
concentrations. We show, using the typical phonon spectrum, that the states
constituting the boson peak cross over from being completely localized to being
extended as a function of increasing soft particle concentration. In general,
an interplay of mass and FC disorder is found to be cooperative in nature,
enhancing phonon localization over all frequencies. However, for certain range
of frequencies, and depending on material parameters, FC disorder can
delocalize the states that were localized by mass disorder, and vice-versa.
Modeling vacancies as weakly bonded sites with vanishing mass, we find that
vacancies, even at very low concentrations, are extremely effective in
localizing phonons. Thus, inducing vacancies is proposed as a promising route
for efficient thermoelectrics. Finally, we use model parameters corresponding
to the alloy system, Ni1-xPtx, and show that mass disorder alone is
insufficient to explain the pseudogap in the phonon spectrum; the concomitant
presence of FC disorder is necessary.

this norm is regularized regression in the presence of rare features which
poses a challenge to various methods within high-dimensional statistics, and in

coupled. In this context, we developed a hybrid time integration scheme that
spatially couples the explicit scheme of Heun and the implicit scheme of Crank
and Nicolson using a dedicated transition function. This scheme is linearly
stable and second-order accurate. In this paper, an extension of this hybrid
scheme is introduced to deal with a temporal adaptive procedure. The idea is to
treat the time integration procedure with unstructured grids as it is performed
with Cartesian grids with local mesh refinement. Depending on its
characteristic size, each mesh cell is assigned a rank. And for two cells from
two consecutive ranks, the ratio of the associated time steps for time marching
the solutions is $2$. As a consequence, the cells with the lowest rank iterate
more than the other ones to reach the same physical time. In a finite-volume
context, a key ingredient is to keep the conservation property for the
interfaces that separate two cells of different ranks. After introducing the
different schemes, the paper recalls briefly the coupling procedure, and
details the extension to the temporal adaptive procedure. The new time

constant the Hawking radiation is enhanced, and only in the regime of large
coupling it is suppressed, as one could expect. The reason for such
counter-intuitive behavior is the important role of the grey-body factors: for
small and moderate couplings the temperature falls relatively slowly, while the
effective potentials for black holes of the same mass become considerably
lower, allowing for much higher transmission rates. We have also estimated the
lifetime of such black holes and shown that the range of black-hole masses at

By employing the operator counting method, we calculate the $S^3$ free energy
and the topologically twisted index $\mathcal{I}$ at large-$N$. The result for
$\mathcal{I}$, it turns out, can be also obtained from the variational
principle of the entropy functional with mesonic fluxes. We also study
asymptotically AdS${}_4$ black holes which are magnetically charged with
respect to the vector field in the Betti multiplet. By extremizing the entropy
functional with baryonic flux, we compute the entropy and find that it agrees
with the entropy of an explicit solution in a four-dimensional gauged
supergravity which is a consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional
supergravity in AdS${}_4\times M^{1,1,1}$.

clumpy way. Recent observations suggest the presence of broad gas density
distributions in the circumgalactic medium which could be related to the
accretion of filaments. By means of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations,
we explore here the evolution of cold accreting filaments flowing through the
hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) of high-z galaxies. In particular, we examine
the nonlinear effects of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) on the development
of broad gas density distributions and on the formation of cold, dense clumps.
We explore a large parameter space in filament and perturbation properties,
such as, filament Mach number, initial perturbation wavelength, and thickness
of the interface between the filament and the halo. We find that the time
averaged density distribution of the cold gas is qualitatively consistent with
a skewed log-normal probability distribution function (PDF) plus an additional
component in form of a high density tail for high Mach-numbers. Our results
suggest a tight correlation between the accreting velocity and the maximum
densities developing in the filament which is consistent with the variance-Mach
number relation for turbulence. Therefore, cosmological accretion could be a
viable mechanism to produce turbulence and broad gas density distributions

reproduced in numerical renormalization group simulations, and is explained
qualitatively by a competition between Kondo temperature and the induced

transmission spectra require understanding of degeneracies between model
parameters and observations that can resolve them. We conduct a systematic
investigation of such degeneracies using a combination of detailed atmospheric
retrievals and a range of model assumptions, focusing on H$_2$-rich
atmospheres. As a case study, we consider the well-studied hot Jupiter HD
209458 b. We perform extensive retrievals with models ranging from simple
isothermal and isobaric atmospheres to those with full pressure-temperature
profiles, inhomogeneous cloud/haze coverage, multiple molecular species, and
data in the optical-infrared wavelengths. Our study reveals four key insights.
First, we find that a combination of models with minimal assumptions and
broadband transmission spectra with current facilities allow precise estimates
of chemical abundances. In particular, high-precision optical and infrared
spectra along with models including variable cloud coverage and prominent
opacity sources, Na and K being important in optical, provide joint constraints
on cloud/haze properties and chemical abundances. Second, we show that the
degeneracy between planetary radius and its reference pressure is well
characterised and has little effect on abundance estimates, contrary to
previous claims using semi-analytic models. Third, collision induced absorption
due to H$_2$-H$_2$ and H$_2$-He interactions plays a critical role in correctly
estimating atmospheric abundances. Finally, our results highlight the
inadequacy of simplified semi-analytic models with isobaric assumptions for
reliable retrievals of transmission spectra. Transmission spectra obtained with
current facilities such as HST and VLT can provide strong constraints on
atmospheric abundances of exoplanets.

stars M $>$ 1.5 $M_\odot$ more likely to host planets with masses between 2-13
M$_{\rm Jup}$ and semi-major axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence. We fit a
double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semi-major axis (a) for planet
populations around high-mass stars (M $>$ 1.5M$_\odot$) of the form $\frac{d^2
N}{dm da} \propto m^\alpha a^\beta$, finding $\alpha$ = -2.4 $\pm$ 0.8 and
$\beta$ = -2.0 $\pm$ 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of $9^{+5}_{-4}$%
between 5-13 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate
is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with 0.8$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$% of
stars hosting a brown dwarf companion between 13-80 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and 10-100
au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and
semi-major axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a
bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semi-major axes, brown dwarfs
exhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant
planets from the RV method, our results are consistent with a peak in
occurrence of giant planets between ~1-10 au. We discuss how these trends,
including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to
formation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown

proposed as an efficient method for simulation-based cosmological parameter
inference. Compared to the standard likelihood-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach, DELFI has several advantages: it is highly parallelizable,
there is no need to assume a possibly incorrect functional form for the
likelihood and complicated effects (e.g the mask and detector systematics) are
easier to handle with forward models. In light of this, we present two DELFI
pipelines to perform weak lensing parameter inference with lognormal
realizations of the tomographic shear field -- using the C_l summary statistic.
The first pipeline accounts for the non-Gaussianities of the shear field,
intrinsic alignments and photometric-redshift error. We validate that it is
accurate enough for Stage III experiments and estimate that O(1000) simulations
are needed to perform inference on Stage IV data. By comparing the second DELFI
pipeline, which makes no assumption about the functional form of the
likelihood, with the standard MCMC approach, which assumes a Gaussian
likelihood, we test the impact of the Gaussian likelihood approximation in the
MCMC analysis. We find it has a negligible impact on Stage IV parameter
constraints. Our pipeline is a step towards seamlessly propagating all
data-processing, instrumental, theoretical and astrophysical systematics
through to the final parameter constraints.

years ago to build models of thick disks and flattened elliptical galaxies.
Through it, any spherical potential can be converted to an axisymmetric
potential via the replacement of spherical polar $r^2$ with $R^2 + ( a +
\!\sqrt{z^2+b^2} )^2$, where ($R,z$) are cylindrical coordinates and $a$ and
$b$ are constants. We show that if the spherical potential has everywhere
positive density, and satisfies some straightforward constraints, then the
transformed model also corresponds to positive density everywhere. This is in
sharp contradistinction to substitutions like $r^2 \rightarrow R^2 + z^2/q^2$,
which leads to simple potentials but can give negative densities. We use the
Miyamoto--Nagai substitution to generate a number of new flattened models with
analytic potential--density pairs. These include (i) a flattened model with an
asymptotically flat rotation curve, which (unlike Binney's logarithmic model)
is always non-negative for a wide-range of axis ratios, (ii) flattened

MRI for site and scanner biases using a novel method based on invariant
representation.
  Theory and Methods: Pooled imaging data from multiple sources are subject to
variation between the sources. Correcting for these biases has become very
important as imaging studies increase in size and multi-site cases become more
common. We propose learning an intermediate representation invariant to
site/protocol variables, a technique adapted from information theory-based
algorithmic fairness; by leveraging the data processing inequality, such a
representation can then be used to create an image reconstruction that is
uninformative of its original source, yet still faithful to underlying
structures. To implement this, we use a deep learning method based on
variational auto-encoders (VAE) to construct scanner invariant encodings of the
imaging data.
  Results: To evaluate our method, we use training data from the 2018 MICCAI
Computational Diffusion MRI (CDMRI) Challenge Harmonization dataset. Our
proposed method shows improvements on independent test data relative to a
recently published baseline method on each subtask, mapping data from three
different scanning contexts to and from one separate target scanning context.
  Conclusion: As imaging studies continue to grow, the use of pooled multi-site
imaging will similarly increase. Invariant representation presents a strong
candidate for the harmonization of these data.

challenging task due to the complexity and dynamics of the LOB. So far, there
have been very limited attempts for extracting relevant features based on LOB
data. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a new set of
handcrafted features and performing an extensive experimental evaluation on
both liquid and illiquid stocks. More specifically, we implement a new set of
econometrical features that capture statistical properties of the underlying
securities for the task of mid-price prediction. Moreover, we develop a new
experimental protocol for online learning that treats the task as a
multi-objective optimization problem and predicts i) the direction of the next
price movement and ii) the number of order book events that occur until the
change takes place. In order to predict the mid-price movement, the features
are fed into nine different deep learning models based on multi-layer
perceptrons (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM) neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is then
evaluated on liquid and illiquid stocks, which are based on TotalView-ITCH US
and Nordic stocks, respectively. For some stocks, results suggest that the
correct choice of a feature set and a model can lead to the successful
prediction of how long it takes to have a stock price movement.

constraints are then enforced by the compiler, which has a wide degree of

take advantage of control and data dependencies, something that is beyond the
abilities of current C/C++ compilers. In rmc-compiler, RMC compilation is
modeled as an SMT problem with a cost term; the solution with the minimum cost
determines the compilation strategy. In testing on ARM and POWER devices, RMC
performs quite well, with modest performance improvements relative to C++11 on

improvements on a read-mostly list test that heavily benefits from use of data

  Hence, either a nonlocal minimal graph is discontinuous at the boundary, or a
small perturbation of the prescribed conditions produces boundary
discontinuities.
  The proof relies on a sliding method combined with a fine boundary regularity
analysis, based on a discontinuity/smoothness alternative. Namely, we establish
that nonlocal minimal graphs are either discontinuous at the boundary or their
derivative is H\""older continuous up to the boundary. In this spirit, we prove
that the boundary regularity of nonlocal minimal graphs in the plane ""jumps""
from discontinuous to $C^{1,\gamma}$, with no intermediate possibilities
allowed.

satisfied up to the boundary.
  As an interesting byproduct of our analysis, one obtains a detailed

despite the fact that these particles should be blown out by stellar radiation
pressure on very short timescales. So far, no fully satisfying explanation has
been found for this apparent paradox. We investigate the possibility that the
observed abundances of submicron grains could be ""naturally"" produced in bright
debris discs, where the high collisional activity produces them at a rate high
enough to partially compensate for their rapid removal. We also investigate to
what extent this potential presence of small grains can affect our
understanding of some debris disc characteristics. We use a code following the
collisional evolution of a debris disc down to submicron grains far below the
limiting blow-out size $s_{blow}$. We explore different configurations: A and G
stars, cold and warm discs, ""bright"" and ""very bright"" systems. We find that,
in bright discs (fractional luminosity $>10^{-3}$) around A stars, there is
always a high-enough amount of submicron grains to leave detectable signatures,
both in scattered-light, where the disc's color becomes blue, and in the mid-IR
($10<\lambda<20\mu$m), where it boosts the disc's luminosity by at least a
factor of 2 and induces a pronounced silicate solid-state band around $10\mu$m.
We also show that, with this additional contribution of submicron grains, the
SED can mimic that of two debris belts separated by a factor of 2 in radial
distance. For G stars, the effect of $s<s_{blow}$ grains remains limited in the
spectra, in spite of the fact that they dominate the system's geometrical cross
section. We also find that, for all considered cases, the halo of small (bound
and unbound) grains that extends far beyond the main disc contributes to
$\sim50$% of the flux up to $\lambda\sim50\mu$m wavelengths.

closed geometrical manifolds, like the Euler angles in viewpoint estimation or
the normals in surface normal estimation. A natural framework for posing such
continuous output problems are $n$-spheres, which are naturally closed
geometric manifolds defined in the $\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)}$ space. By introducing a
spherical exponential mapping on $n$-spheres at the regression output, we
obtain well-behaved gradients, leading to stable training. We show how our
spherical regression can be utilized for several computer vision challenges,
specifically viewpoint estimation, surface normal estimation and 3D rotation
estimation. For all these problems our experiments demonstrate the benefit of
spherical regression. All paper resources are available at

order can be written as $eFe$ for any idempotent $e$ in an algebra $F$, which

these algebras are Morita equivalent. These algebras have the property that the
completed algebra controlling the fiber over a maximal ideal has the same form
as a subalgebra in a skew group ring, which gives a new perspective to a number
of result about these algebras.
  We also discuss how this approach relates to the study of Coulomb branches in
the sense of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima, which are particularly beautiful
examples of principal Galois orders. These include most of the interesting
examples of principal Galois orders, such as $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. In this

canonical bases for the Grothendieck group. In particular, we classify
Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and relate their characters

vectors.

establish on a 2-classes stochastic model that the performance of the subtree

modeling approach is based on game theory with multiple concurrent
leader-follower pairs, and accounts for common traffic rules. We parameterize
the intersection layouts and geometries to model uncontrolled intersections
with various configurations, and apply the proposed approach to model the
interactive behavior of vehicles at these intersections. Based on simulation
results in various traffic scenarios, we show that the model exhibits
reasonable behavior expected in traffic, including the capability of
reproducing scenarios extracted from real-world traffic data and reasonable
performance in resolving traffic conflicts. The model is further validated
based on the level-of-service traffic quality rating system and demonstrates
manageable computational complexity compared to traditional multi-player
game-theoretic models.

multi-peak morphology observed in high-luminosity states to the more sinusoidal

revealed two flares with unusual properties in the 2016 observation: they are
long (~1 ks to be compared with 0.1-1 s of typical magnetar bursts) and faint
(~1E34 erg/s, with respect to 1E38 erg/s or more in magnetars). Their spectra
are comparatively soft and resemble the hotter thermal component of the

distribution of CO and its photodissociation products. This significantly
influences the gas-phase chemistry in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around
evolved stars. A better understanding of CO photodissociation in outflows also
provides a more precise estimate of mass-loss rates. We aim to update the CO
photodissociation rate in an expanding spherical envelope assuming that the
interstellar radiation field (ISRF) photons penetrate through the envelope.
This will allow us to precisely estimate the CO abundance distributions in CSEs
around evolved stars. We used the most recent CO spectroscopic data to
precisely calculate the depth dependency of the photodissociation rate of each
CO dissociating line. We calculated the CO self- and mutual-shielding functions
in an expanding envelope. We investigated the dependence of the CO profile on
the five fundamental parameters mass-loss rate, the expansion velocity, the CO
initial abundance, the CO excitation temperature, and the strength of the ISRF.
Our derived CO envelope size is smaller than the commonly used radius derived
by Mamon et al. 1988. The difference between results varies from 1% to 39% and
depends on the H2 and CO densities of the envelope. We list two fitting
parameters for a large grid of models to estimate the CO abundance
distribution. We demonstrate that the CO envelope size can differ between
outflows with the same effective content of CO, but different CO abundance,
mass-loss rate, and the expansion velocity as a consequence of differing
amounts of shielding by H2 and CO. We find that the abundance of CO close to
the star and the outflow density both can have a significant effect on the size
of the molecular envelope. We also demonstrate that modest variations in the
ISRF can cause measurable differences in the envelope extent.

unsupervised POS tagging that yields fully grounded output and requires no

clusters well in our use case and employ a decipherment-based approach to
grounding. This approach presumes a sequence of cluster IDs is a `ciphertext'

show intrinsically that, despite the difficulty of the task, we obtain
reasonable performance across a variety of languages. We also show
extrinsically that incorporating our POS tagger into a name tagger leads to
state-of-the-art tagging performance in Sinhalese and Kinyarwanda, two
languages with nearly no labeled POS data available. We further demonstrate our
tagger's utility by incorporating it into a true `zero-resource' variant of the
Malopa (Ammar et al., 2016) dependency parser model that removes the current
reliance on multilingual resources and gold POS tags for new languages.

well suited to study the interfacial properties of granular or heterophase
systems. Traditionally, the identification of the interface between, for
precipitate and matrix phases, in APT data has been obtained either by
extracting iso-concentration surfaces based on a user-supplied concentration
value or by manually perturbing the concentration value until the
iso-concentration surface qualitatively matches the interface. These approaches
are subjective, not scalable, and may lead to inconsistencies due to local
composition inhomogeneities.
  We propose a digital image segmentation approach based on deep neural
networks that transfer learned knowledge from natural images to automatically
segment the data obtained from APT into different phases. This approach not
only provides an efficient way to segment the data and extract interfacial
properties but does so without the need for expensive interface labeling for
training the segmentation model.
  We consider here a system with a precipitate phase in a matrix and with three
different interface modalities---layered, isolated, and interconnected---that
are obtained for different relative geometries of the precipitate phase. We
demonstrate the accuracy of our segmentation approach through qualitative
visualization of the interfaces, as well as through quantitative comparisons
with proximity histograms obtained by using more traditional approaches.

emission features in the public RGS spectra archive, in particular, to perform
the correlation between X-ray spectral diagnostics parameters with measurements
at other wavelengths. This paper focuses on the methodology of catalogue
generation, describing the automated line detection algorithm. A moderate
sample (~2400 observations) of high-quality RGS spectra available at XMM-Newton
Science Archive is used as our starting point. A list of potential emission
lines is selected based on a multi-scale peak detection algorithm in a uniform
and automated way without prior assumption on the underlying astrophysical
model. The candidate line list is validated via spectral fitting with simple
continuum and line profile models. We also compare the catalogue content with
published literature results on a small number of exemplary sources. We
generate a catalogue of emission lines ~12000 detected in ~1600 observations
toward stars, X-ray binaries, supernovae remnants, active galactic nuclei, and
groups and clusters of galaxies. For each line, we report the observed
wavelength, broadening, energy and photon flux, and equivalent width, etc.

analyzing a generic 3D MHD simulation of an eruptive flare. Even though the
simulation was undesigned to recover the magnetic field and Lorentz force
properties, it is fully consistent with them, and it provides key additional
informations to understand them. The area where the magnetic field increases
gradually develops between current ribbons, which spread away from each other
and are connected to the coronal region. This area is merely the footprint of
the coronal post-flare loops, whose contraction increases their shear field
component and the magnetic energy density in line with the ideal induction
equation. For simulated data, we computed the Lorentz force density map by
applying the method used in observations. We obtained increase of the downward
component of the Lorentz force density around the PIL -consistent with
observations. However, this significantly differs from the Lorentz force
density maps obtained directly from the 3D magnetic field and current. These
results altogether question previous interpretations based on the implosion

observed increases in photospheric horizontal magnetic fields result from the
reconnection-driven contraction of sheared flare-loops.

cryptographic primitives used to hide the access pattern to data whose storage

response time and the exorbitant increase in resource costs incurred by either
ORAM or PIR prevent their usage. In an ideal scenario, a privacy-preserving
storage protocols with small overhead would be implemented for these heavily

  To answer this question, we consider $\mathit{differential\ privacy\ access}$

The normalized patterns permit to implement the SLEF algorithm, which is based

of a DL algorithm. Methods: We trained a DL algorithm to predict 1-year
progression to nvAMD, and used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate this
approach on two groups of eyes in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS):
none/early/intermediate AMD, and intermediate AMD (iAMD) only. We compared the

using the sensitivity at 80% specificity for progression to nvAMD. Results: The
DL algorithm's sensitivity for predicting progression to nvAMD from
none/early/iAMD (78+/-6%) was higher than manual grades from the 9-step scale

least four profile components, short-term nulling lasting from 4 to 450 pulses,
complex subpulse drifting behaviours and intermittency on scales of tens of

communications and radar systems coexist, modeled as having both Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Additive Radar Interference (ARI). The issue of how
to adapt or re-design convolutional codes (decoded by the Viterbi algorithm)
and LDPC codes (decoded by the sum-product algorithm and optimized by using the
EXIT chart method) to effectively handle the overall non-Gaussian ARI noise is
investigated. A decoding metric is derived from the non-Gaussian ARI channel
transition probability as a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR).
  Two design methodologies are benchmarked against a baseline ""unaltered legacy
system"", where a code designed for AWGN-only noise, but used on the
non-Gaussian ARI channel, is decoded by using the AWGN-only metric (i.e., as if
INR is zero). The methodologies are: M1) codes designed for AWGN-only noise,
but decoded with the new metric that accounts for both SNR and INR; and M2)
codes optimized for the overall non-Gaussian ARI channel. Both methodologies
give better average Bit Error Rate (BER) in the high INR regime compared to the
baseline. In the low INR regime, both methodologies perform as the baseline
since in this case the radar interference is weak. Interestingly, the
performance improvement of M2 over M1 is minimal. In practice, this implies
that specifications in terms of channel error correcting codes for commercially
available wireless systems need not be changed, and that it suffices to use an
appropriate INR-based decoding metric in order to effectively cope with the
ARI.

are subjected to the spin-orbit coupling induced by Raman beams. The fermions,
although not directly coupled to the Raman lasers, acquire an effective
spin-orbit coupling through the spin-exchange interaction between the two
species. Our calculation shows that this is a promising way of obtaining
spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas without Raman-induced heating, where the
long-sought topological Fermi superfluids and topological bands can be
realized. Conversely, we find that the presence of fermions not only provides a
new way to create the supersolid stripe phase of the bosons, but more
strikingly it can also greatly increase the spatial period of the bosonic
density stripes, and hence makes this phase directly observable in the
experiment. This system provides a new and practical platform to explore the
physics of spin-orbit coupling, which possesses a dynamic nature through the
interaction between the two species.

cooperation, where a server connects with multiple users and the users can
cooperate with each other through a cooperation network. We propose a
centralized coded caching scheme based on a new deterministic placement
strategy and a parallel delivery strategy. It is shown that the new scheme
optimally allocate the communication loads on the server and users, obtaining
cooperation gain and parallel gain that greatly reduces the transmission delay.
Furthermore, we show that the number of users who parallelly send information
should decrease when the users' caching size increases. In other words, letting
more users parallelly send information could be harmful. Finally, we derive a
constant multiplicative gap between the lower bound and upper bound on the
transmission delay, which proves that our scheme is order optimal.

to interpret, and second, they suffer from overfitting. There have been many
attempts to define interpretability in neural networks, but they typically lack
causality or generality. A myriad of regularization techniques have been
developed to prevent overfitting, and this has driven deep learning to become
the hot topic it is today; however, while most regularization techniques are
justified empirically and even intuitively, there is not much underlying
theory. This paper argues that to extract the features used in neural networks
to make decisions, it's important to look at the paths between clusters
existing in the hidden spaces of neural networks. These features are of
particular interest because they reflect the true decision making process of
the neural network. This analysis is then furthered to present an ensemble
algorithm for arbitrary neural networks which has guarantees for test accuracy.
Finally, a discussion detailing the aforementioned guarantees is introduced and
the implications to neural networks, including an intuitive explanation for all
current regularization methods, are presented. The ensemble algorithm has
generated state-of-the-art results for Wide-ResNets on CIFAR-10 (top 5 for all
models) and has improved test accuracy for all models it has been applied to.

an upper bound on the optimal nonergodic sublinear rate. Finally, an example in
two dimensional space is constructed to provide a lower bound on the optimal

matches exactly the upper bound obtained by the dual SDP, we have thus
established the worst case nonergodic sublinear convergence rate which is
optimal in terms of both the order as well as the constants involved. Our

presented several interesting features. First, a satellite sunspot appeared and
collided with a pre-existing opposite polarity magnetic field and caused a
recurrent solar jet event. Second, the evolution of the jets showed
blowout-like nature and standard characteristics. Third, the satellite sunspot
exhibited a motion toward southeast of AR11166 and merged with the emerging
flux near the opposite polarity sunspot penumbra, which afterward, due to flux
convergence and cancellation episodes, caused recurrent jets. Fourth, three of
the blowout jets associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), were observed
from field of view of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. Fifth,
almost all the blowout jet eruptions were accompanied with flares or with more
intense brightening in the jet base region, while almost standard jets did not
manifest such obvious feature during eruptions. The most important, the blowout
jets were inclined to faster and larger scale than the standard jets. The
standard jets instead were inclined to relative longer-lasting. The obvious
shearing and twisting motions of the magnetic field may be interpreted as due
to the shearing and twisting motions for a blowout jet eruption. From the
statistical results, about 30% blowout jets directly developed into CMEs. It
suggests that the blowout jets and CMEs should have a tight relationship.

to comoving distance will manifest itself as redshift-dependent 2pCF. Our
method decomposes the redshift difference of the two-dimensional correlation
function into the Legendre polynomials whose amplitudes are modeled by radial

tightens the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and ${w}$ by $\sim 40\%$ compared to the

non-linear systematics and use of full two-dimensional shape information of the

thin film of thermotropic liquid crystal is subjected to hybrid anchoring by an
air interface and a water substrate, and viewed under polarized optical
microscopy. Upon heating from smectic-A to nematic, a packing of focal conic
domains melts into a dense array of boojums---nematic surface defects---which
then coarsens by pair-annihilation. With the aid of Landau-de Gennes numerical
modeling, we elucidate the topological and geometrical rules underlying this
transformation. In the transition from nematic to smectic-A, we show that focal
conic domain packings are organized over large scales in patterns that retain a
geometric memory of the nematic boojum configuration, which can be recovered
with remarkable fidelity.

transmission between user equipment (UE) and cell begins. This delay can be
taken advantage to reduce the communication distance, improve coverage
probability, and increase overall energy-efficiency of the small cell network.
To demonstrate such merits, we suggest a simple access scheme and analyze the
distribution of coverage probability and throughput as a function of delay and
transmit distance. Sufficient number of small base stations (SBSs) handle the
peak traffic load. To improve energy-efficiency of the network, a number of
SBSs are switched off at low traffic periods. Energy-efficiency can be further
improved by turning all of the SBSs on and off, rather than selecting a subset
and leaving them off. By doing so, coverage probability and bit-rate can be
improved by delaying their transmissions and waiting for a closer SBS to become
available. Results show that by turning SBSs on and off continuously and taking
advantage of initial delay to connect a SBS yield an order of magnitude
improvement in energy-efficiency, improves the coverage probability
significantly at low signal to interference and noise (SINR) regime.

devising a novel stereo inspired neural network to directly map any 2D pose to

performs favorably against the state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation methods. We
also evaluate the generalization ability of our model both quantitatively and

ferromagnetic state at a finite temperature. The ground state exhibited a
continuous degeneracy that was lifted by an order-from-disorder mechanism at
infinitesimal temperatures with the appearance of a six-fold planar anisotropy.
The nanoparticle array consisted of 7.5 nm diameter maghemite spheres with
bulk-like superexchange interactions between Fe-ions in the core, and weaker
exchange between surface Fe-ions and a radial anisotropy. The triangular
nanoparticle array ordered at the same reduced temperature as the simple dipole

anisotropy. We find that the vacancies on the octahedral sites in the
nanoparticles combine with the surface anisotropy to produce an effective
random temperature-dependent anisotropy for each particle. This leads to a
reduction in the net magnetization of the nanoparticle array at zero
temperature compared to the simple dipole array.

reduction in the communication data rate. We evaluate JCR performance
trade-offs using the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) metric for radar estimation and a
novel distortion minimum mean square error (MMSE) metric for data

problems for the adaptive JCR waveform design. Simulations show that an optimal
virtual (non-uniform) waveform achieves a significant performance improvement
as compared to a uniform waveform. For a radar CRB constrained optimization,
the optimal radar range of operation and the optimal communication distortion
MMSE (DMMSE) are improved. For a communication DMMSE constrained optimization
with a high DMMSE constraint, the optimal radar CRB is enhanced. For a weighted
MMSE average optimization, the advantage of the virtual waveform over the

Comparison of MMSE-based optimization with traditional virtual preamble

In this work, we consider the use of CNNs to classify simulated S0 galaxies
based on fundamental physical properties. In particular, we undertake two
investigations: (1) the classification of simulated S0 galaxies into three
distinct evolutionary paths (isolated, tidal interaction in a group halo, and
Spiral-Spiral merger), and (2) the prediction of the mass ratio for the S0s
formed via mergers. To train the CNNs, we first run several hundred N-body
simulations to model the formation of S0s under idealised conditions; and then
we build our training datasets by creating images of stellar density and two
dimensional kinematic maps for each simulated S0. Our trained networks have
remarkable accuracies exceeding 99% when classifying the S0 formation pathway.
For the case of predicting merger mass ratios, the mean predictions are
consistent with the true values to within roughly one standard deviation across
the full range of our data. Our work demonstrates the potential of CNNs to
classify galaxies by the fundamental physical properties which drive their

The task becomes more challenging on temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact
is associated with a timestamp. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at
past timestamps and they are not able to predict facts happening in the future.
This paper proposes Recurrent Event Network (RE-NET), a novel autoregressive
architecture for predicting future interactions. The occurrence of a fact
(event) is modeled as a probability distribution conditioned on temporal
sequences of past knowledge graphs. Specifically, our RE-NET employs a
recurrent event encoder to encode past facts and uses a neighborhood aggregator
to model the connection of facts at the same timestamp. Future facts can then
be inferred in a sequential manner based on the two modules. We evaluate our
proposed method via link prediction at future times on five public datasets.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the strength of RENET, especially
on multi-step inference over future timestamps, and achieve state-of-the-art
performance on all five datasets. Code and data can be found at

that our BAL QSOs on average do not have a higher Eddington ratio than that

of seven strong BAL QSOs possessing sub-relativistic BAL outflows, we see the
prevalence of large \civ-BEL blueshift ($\sim$3100 km s$^{-1}$) and weak \oiii\
emission (particularly the narrow \oiii$\lambda$5007 component), indicative of
nuclear outflows affecting the narrow emission-line (NEL) regions. In another
subset consisting of thirteen BAL QSOs having simultaneous observations of
\mgii\ and \hb, we found a strong correlation between 3000~\AA\ and 5000~\AA\
monochromatic luminosity, consistent with that from non-BAL QSOs matched in
redshift and luminosity; however, there is no correlation between \mgii\ and
\hb\ in FWHM, likely due to nuclear outflows influencing the BEL regions. Our
spectroscopic investigations offer strong evidence that the presence of nuclear
outflows plays an important role in shaping the BEL/NEL regions of these
quasars and possibly, regulating the growth of central supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). We propose that BEL blueshift and BAL could be different
manifestations of the same outflow system viewed at different sightlines and/or
phases.

  channel",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  \emph{Population recovery} is the problem of learning an unknown distribution
over an unknown set of $n$-bit strings, given access to independent draws from
the distribution that have been independently corrupted according to some noise
channel. Recent work has intensively studied such problems both for the
bit-flip and erasure noise channels.
  We initiate the study of population recovery under the \emph{deletion
channel}, in which each bit is independently \emph{deleted} with some fixed
probability and the surviving bits are concatenated and transmitted. This is a
far more challenging noise model than bit-flip~noise or erasure noise; indeed,
even the simplest case in which the population size is 1 (corresponding to a
trivial distribution supported on a single string) corresponds to the
\emph{trace reconstruction} problem, a challenging problem that has received
much recent attention (see e.g.~\cite{DOS17,NP17,PZ17,HPP18,HHP18}).
  We give algorithms and lower bounds for population recovery under the
deletion channel when the population size is some $\ell>1$. As our main sample
complexity upper bound, we show that for any $\ell=o(\log n/\log \log n)$, a
population of $\ell$ strings from $\{0,1\}^n$ can be learned under deletion
channel noise using $\smash{2^{n^{1/2+o(1)}}}$ samples. On the lower bound
side, we show that $n^{\Omega(\ell)}$ samples are required to perform
population recovery under the deletion channel, for all $\ell \leq
n^{1/2-\epsilon}$.
  Our upper bounds are obtained via a robust multivariate generalization of a
polynomial-based analysis, due to Krasikov and Roddity \cite{KR97}, of how the
$k$-deck of a bit-string uniquely identifies the string; this is a very
different approach from recent algorithms for trace reconstruction (the
$\ell=1$ case). Our lower bounds build on moment-matching results of
Roos~\cite{Roo00} and Daskalakis and Papadimitriou~\cite{DP15}.

tasks and also perform broad, yet simple skills with a wide variety of objects.
However, learning a model that can both perform complex tasks and generalize to
previously unseen objects and goals remains a significant challenge. We study
this challenge in the context of ""improvisational"" tool use: a robot is
presented with novel objects and a user-specified goal (e.g., sweep some
clutter into the dustpan), and must figure out, using only raw image
observations, how to accomplish the goal using the available objects as tools.
We approach this problem by training a model with both a visual and physical
understanding of multi-object interactions, and develop a sampling-based
optimizer that can leverage these interactions to accomplish tasks. We do so by
combining diverse demonstration data with self-supervised interaction data,
aiming to leverage the interaction data to build generalizable models and the
demonstration data to guide the model-based RL planner to solve complex tasks.
Our experiments show that our approach can solve a variety of complex tool use
tasks from raw pixel inputs, outperforming both imitation learning and
self-supervised learning individually. Furthermore, we show that the robot can
perceive and use novel objects as tools, including objects that are not
conventional tools, while also choosing dynamically to use or not use tools
depending on whether or not they are required.

system AR~Scorpii. The optical emission from this binary is modulating with the
beat frequency of the system, and it is highly polarized, with the degree of
the polarization reaching $\sim 40$\%. The angle of the polarization
monotonically increases with the spin phase, and the total swing angle can
reach $360^{\circ}$ over one spin phase. It is also observed that the
morphology of the pulse profile and the degree of linear polarization evolve
with the orbital phase. These polarization properties can constrain the
scenario for nonthermal emission from AR Scorpii. In this paper, we study the
polarization properties predicted by the emission model, in which (i) the
pulsed optical emission is produced by the synchrotron emission from
relativistic electrons trapped by magnetic field lines of the WD and (ii) the
emission is mainly produced at magnetic mirror points of the electron motion.
We find that this model can reproduce the large swing of the polarization
angle, provided that the distribution of the initial pitch angle of the
electrons that are leaving the M-type star is biased to a smaller angle rather
than a uniform distribution. The observed direction of the swing suggests that
the Earth viewing angle is less than $90^{\circ}$ measured from the WD spin
axis. The current model prefers an Earth viewing angle of
$50^{\circ}-60^{\circ}$ and a magnetic inclination angle of
$50^{\circ}-60^{\circ}$ (or $120^{\circ}-130^{\circ}$). We discuss that the
different contribution of the emission from M-type star to total emission
causes a large variation in the pulsed fraction and the degree of the linear
polarization along the orbital phase.

\mathbb{R}^d$, with probability at least $2/3$, one has
$Q_p(x)=(1\pm\epsilon)\|Ax\|_p$, where $p\geq 0$, and where the randomness is
over the construction of $Q_p$. The central question is: How many bits are
necessary to store $Q_p$?
  This problem has applications to the communication of approximating the
number of non-zeros in a matrix product, the size of coresets in projective
clustering, the memory of streaming algorithms for regression in the row-update
model, and embedding subspaces of $L_p$ in functional analysis. A major open
question is the dependence on the approximation factor $\epsilon$.
  We show if $p\geq 0$ is not a positive even integer and
$d=\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$, then $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2}d)$ bits are
necessary. On the other hand, if $p$ is a positive even integer, then there is
an upper bound of $O(d^p\log(nd))$ bits independent of $\epsilon$. Our results
are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and show in particular that one cannot
compress $A$ to $O(d)$ ""directions"" $v_1,\dots,v_{O(d)}$, such that for any

arbitrary functions of these inner products (and in fact arbitrary data
structures built from $A$), and thus rules out the possibility of a singular
value decomposition for $\ell_1$ in a very strong sense. Indeed, as
$\epsilon\to 0$, for $p = 1$ the space complexity becomes arbitrarily large,
while for $p = 2$ it is at most $O(d^2 \log(nd))$. As corollaries of our main
lower bound, we obtain new lower bounds for a wide range of applications,

quantum computers. We call them volumetric benchmarks (VBs) because they
generalize IBM's benchmark for measuring quantum volume \cite{Cross18}. The
quantum volume benchmark defines a family of square circuits whose depth $d$
and width $w$ are the same. A volumetric benchmark defines a family of
rectangular quantum circuits, for which $d$ and $w$ are uncoupled to allow the
study of time/space performance trade-offs. Each VB defines a mapping from
circuit shapes -- $(w,d)$ pairs -- to test suites $\mathcal{C}(w,d)$. A test
suite is an ensemble of test circuits that share a common structure. The test
suite $\mathcal{C}$ for a given circuit shape may be a single circuit $C$, a
specific list of circuits $\{C_1\ldots C_N\}$ that must all be run, or a large
set of possible circuits equipped with a distribution $Pr(C)$. The circuits in
a given VB share a structure, which is limited only by designers' creativity.
We list some known benchmarks, and other circuit families, that fit into the VB
framework: several families of random circuits, periodic circuits, and
algorithm-inspired circuits. The last ingredient defining a benchmark is a
success criterion that defines when a processor is judged to have ""passed"" a
given test circuit. We discuss several options. Benchmark data can be analyzed
in many ways to extract many properties, but we propose a simple, universal

  Density Network","CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D human pose estimation from a monocular image or 2D joints is an ill-posed
problem because of depth ambiguity and occluded joints. We argue that 3D human
pose estimation from a monocular input is an inverse problem where multiple
feasible solutions can exist. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
generate multiple feasible hypotheses of the 3D pose from 2D joints.In contrast
to existing deep learning approaches which minimize a mean square error based
on an unimodal Gaussian distribution, our method is able to generate multiple
feasible hypotheses of 3D pose based on a multimodal mixture density networks.
Our experiments show that the 3D poses estimated by our approach from an input
of 2D joints are consistent in 2D reprojections, which supports our argument
that multiple solutions exist for the 2D-to-3D inverse problem. Furthermore, we
show state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M dataset in both best
hypothesis and multi-view settings, and we demonstrate the generalization
capacity of our model by testing on the MPII and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Our
code is available at the project website.

as inference in a graphical model with partially observed nodes and unknown
graph structures (relations in dialog). The given dialog entities are viewed as
the observed nodes. The answer to a given question is represented by a node
with missing value. We first introduce an Expectation Maximization algorithm to
infer both the underlying dialog structures and the missing node values
(desired answers). Based on this, we proceed to propose a differentiable graph

Privately owned cars that operate on internal combustion engines have been the
dominant modes of passenger transport for much of the last century. However,
recent advances in transport technologies and services, such as the development
of autonomous vehicles, the emergence of shared mobility services, and the
commercialization of alternative fuel vehicle technologies, promise to
revolutionise how humans travel. The implications are profound: some have
predicted the end of private car dependent Western societies, others have
portended greater suburbanization than has ever been observed before. If
transport systems are to fulfil current and future needs of different
subpopulations, and satisfy short and long-term societal objectives, it is
imperative that we comprehend the many factors that shape individual behaviour.
This chapter introduces the technologies and services most likely to disrupt
prevailing practices in the transport sector. We review past studies that have
examined current and future demand for these new technologies and services, and
their likely short and long-term impacts on extant mobility patterns. We
conclude with a summary of what these new technologies and services might mean

electron-hole pair excitations in this system can be long-lived, up to several
hundred nanoseconds, since the decay into surface phonons is found to be a
highly non-linear process. We combine first-principles calculations with help
of a hybrid functional (HSE06) with modeling by a Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian

phonon spectra are calculated with particular emphasis on the Sn-related
surface phonon modes. The calculations demonstrate that the adequate treatment
of electronic correlations leads to a stiffening of the wagging mode of
neighboring Sn atoms; thus, we predict that the onset of electronic
correlations at low temperature should be observable in the phonon spectrum,

applying stress in proper symmetry channels allows one to tune the nematic

path loss of millimeter wave signals in massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. However, due to the joint optimization of the digital and
analog precoding matrices as well as extra constraints for the analog part, the
hybrid precoding design is still a tough issue in current research. In this
paper, we adopt the thought of clustering in unsupervised learning and provide
design schemes for fully-connected hybrid precoding (FHP) and
adaptively-connected hybrid precoding (AHP) in multi-user massive MIMO systems.
For FHP, we propose the hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-based (HAC-based)
scheme to explore the relevance among RF chains in optimal hybrid procoding
design. The similar RF chains are merged into an individual RF chain when
insufficient RF chains are equipped at the base station (BS). For AHP, we
propose the modified-K-means-based (MKM-based) scheme to explore the relevance
among antennas at the BS. The similar antennas are supported by the same RF
chain to make full use of the flexible connection in AHP. Particularly, in
proposed MKM-based AHP design, the clustering centers are updated by
alternating-optimum-based (AO-based) scheme with a special initialization
method, which is capable to individually provide feasible sub-connected hybrid
precoding (SHP) design. Simulation results highlight the superior spectrum
efficiency of proposed HAC-based FHP scheme, and the high power efficiency of
proposed MKM-based AHP scheme. Moreover, all the proposed schemes are clarified

explosion, leaves little hydrogen mass at explosion as inferred from
observations of SNe IIb. In the case of a massive primary star with a zero age
main sequence mass of M(ZAMS)=16Mo that during its giant phase swallows a main

agents have a tendency to maximize their socioeconomic standing. We find that
such social networks of agents invariably undergo a community formation process
from simple chain-like structure to more complex networks as the living cost
parameter is increased. The point where this occurs, depends also on the
relative proportion of the dictator and ultimatum games being played. We find
that it is harder for complex social structures to form when the dictator game
strategy in social transactions of agents becomes more dominant over that of
the ultimatum game.

efficiency of narrow bandgap materials (such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe) at high
temperatures due to the introduction of an additional term to the thermal
conductivity and a reduction in the Seebeck coefficient. In this work, we
present a theoretical investigation into the ability of nanoinclusions to
reduce the detrimental effect of bipolar transport. Using the quantum
mechanical non equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) transport formalism, we
simulate electronic transport through two-dimensional systems containing
densely packed nanoinclusions, separated by distances similar to the electron
mean free path. Specifically, considering an n type material, where the bipolar
effect comes from the valence band, we insert nanoinclusions that impose
potential barriers only for the minority holes. We then extract the materials
electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and electronic thermal
conductivity including its bipolar contribution. We show that nanoinclusions
can indeed have some success in reducing the minority carrier transport and the
bipolar effect on both the electronic thermal conductivity and the Seebeck
coefficient. The benefits from reducing the bipolar conductivity are larger the
more conductive the minority band is to begin with (larger hole mean free path
in particular), as expected. Interestingly, however, the benefits on the
Seebeck coefficient and the power factor are even more pronounced not only when
the minority mean free path is large, but when it is larger compared to the
majority conduction band mean free path. Finally, we extract an overall
estimate for the benefits that nanoinclusions can have on the ZT figure of
merit.

proportional to the number of particles at each site. Particles are added to
the system with a site-dependent creation rate, and removed from the system
with a uniform annihilation rate. On a fully-connected lattice with a large
number of sites, the mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for
the number of particles at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping,
creation and annihilation rates. This model of particles is mapped to a model
of population dynamics: the site label is interpreted as a level of fitness,
the site-dependent creation rate is interpreted as a selection function, and
the hopping process is interpreted as the introduction of mutants. In the limit
of large density, the fraction of the total population occupying each site
approaches the limiting distribution in the house-of-cards model of
selection-mutation, introduced by Kingman. A single site can be occupied by a
macroscopic fraction of the particles if the mutation rate is below a critical
value (which matches the critical value worked out in the house-of-cards
model). This feature generalises to classes of selection functions that
increase sufficiently fast at high fitness. The process can be mapped to a
model of evolving networks, inspired by the Bianconi--Barab\'asi model, but
involving a large and fixed set of nodes. Each node forms links at a rate
biased by its fitness, moreover links are destroyed at a uniform rate, and
redirected at a certain rate. If this redirection rate matches the mutation
rate, the number of links pointing to nodes of a given fitness level is
distributed as the numbers of particles in the non-conserving zero-range
process. There is a finite critical redirection rate if the density of quenched
fitnesses goes to zero sufficiently fast at high fitness.

the modifications of the Fermi-surface topology with pressure from the analysis
of pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations present in the
Hall-effect and magnetoresistance data. The simultaneous analysis of the Hall
and longitudinal conductivity data in a two-band model revealed an only weak
decrease in the electron- and hole charge-carrier densities up to 1.2 GPa,
while the mobilities are essentially pressure independent along the a-direction

for B||a and B||c point at a robust Fermi-surface topology. In contrast to the
stability of the Fermi-surface topology and of the density of charge carriers,
our results evidence a strong pressure variation of the magnitude of transverse
magnetoresistance for B||a contrary to the results for B||c. We can relate the
former to an increase in the charge-carrier mobilities along the

further utilization in any network operation. In recent years, a number of

in attempts to optimally verify the location information supplied by network
users. Such LVSs, however, are somewhat limited since they rely on knowledge of
a number of channel parameters for their operation. To overcome such

This new form of LVS can adapt itself to changing environments without knowing
the channel parameters. Here, for the first time, we use real-world data to
show how our ML-LVS can outperform information-theoretic LVSs. We demonstrate
this improved performance within the context of vehicular networks using
Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements at multiple verifying base
stations. We also demonstrate the validity of the ML-LVS even in scenarios
where a sophisticated adversary optimizes her attack location.

it looks valid in all constant-radius neighborhoods. This idea is formalized in
the concept of locally checkable labelings (LCLs), introduced by Naor and
Stockmeyer (1995). Recently, Chang et al. (2016) showed that in bounded-degree
graphs, every LCL problem belongs to one of the following classes:
  - ""Easy"": solvable in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds with both deterministic and
randomized distributed algorithms.
  - ""Hard"": requires at least $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds with deterministic and
$\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds with randomized distributed algorithms.
  Hence for any parameterized LCL problem, when we move from local problems
towards global problems, there is some point at which complexity suddenly jumps
from easy to hard. For example, for vertex coloring in $d$-regular graphs it is
now known that this jump is at precisely $d$ colors: coloring with $d+1$ colors
is easy, while coloring with $d$ colors is hard.
  However, it is currently poorly understood where this jump takes place when
one looks at defective colorings. To study this question, we define $k$-partial
$c$-coloring as follows: nodes are labeled with numbers between $1$ and $c$,
and every node is incident to at least $k$ properly colored edges.
  It is known that $1$-partial $2$-coloring (a.k.a. weak $2$-coloring) is easy
for any $d \ge 1$. As our main result, we show that $k$-partial $2$-coloring
becomes hard as soon as $k \ge 2$, no matter how large a $d$ we have.
  We also show that this is fundamentally different from $k$-partial
$3$-coloring: no matter which $k \ge 3$ we choose, the problem is always hard
for $d = k$ but it becomes easy when $d \gg k$. The same was known previously
for partial $c$-coloring with $c \ge 4$, but the case of $c < 4$ was open.

high intensity, and their frequency can be tuned from terahertz to mid-infrared

energy behaviour of the amplitudes using the Standard Model Effective Field
Theory (SMEFT) to parametrise the departures from the SM. We discuss the origin
of the energy growth that arise from effective contact interactions by
appealing to the Goldstone equivalence theorem and find that the amplitudes
obey expected patterns of (non-)interference. The results are connected to
unitary-violating behaviour in the framework of anomalous SM interactions.
Therein, we identify the appearance of additional growth due to the violation
of $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry that leads to substantial differences between the
SMEFT and the anomalous couplings approaches. We also discuss the embeddings of
the scattering amplitudes into physical collider processes, presenting the
parametric SMEFT sensitivity to relevant top quark operators and paying special
attention to the extent to which the high energy behaviour of the $2\to2$
amplitude is retained in the actual processes accessible at colliders. The

Orbits (GTOs), launched at specific inclinations, Molniya-type satellites and

200 years) within a realistic dynamical model, aimed primarily at recording the
dynamical lifetime of such orbits (defined as the time needed for atmospheric
reentry) and understanding its dependence on initial conditions and other
parameters, such as the area-to-mass ratio (A/m). Our results are presented in
the form of 2-D lifetime maps, for different values of inclination, A/m, and

on the inclination) can naturally reenter within 25-90 years, but these numbers
are significantly less optimistic for large debris (e.g., upper stages), with
the notable exception of those launched from high latitude (Baikonur). We
estimate the reentry probability and mean dynamical lifetime for different
classes of GTOs and we find that both quantities depend primarily and strongly
on initial perigee altitude. Atmospheric drag and higher A/m values extend the
reentry zones, especially at low inclinations. For high inclinations, this

retinopathy(DR) detection. Most methods based on deep convolutional neural
network (DCNN) have small receptive fields, and hence they are unable to
capture global context information of larger regions, with difficult to
identify lesions. The final segmented retina vessels contain more noise with
low classification accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DCNN
structure named as D-Net. In the proposed D-Net, the dilation convolution is
used in the backbone network to obtain a larger receptive field without losing
spatial resolution, so as to reduce the loss of feature information and to
reduce the difficulty of tiny thin vessels segmentation. The large receptive
field can better distinguished between the lesion area and the blood vessel
area. In the proposed Multi-Scale Information Fusion module (MSIF), parallel
convolution layers with different dilation rates are used, so that the model
can obtain more dense feature information and better capture retinal vessel
information of different sizes. In the decoding module, the skip layer
connection is used to propagate context information to higher resolution
layers, so as to prevent low-level information from passing the entire network
structure. Finally, our method was verified on DRIVE, STARE and CHASE dataset.
The experimental results show that our network structure outperforms some
state-of-art method, such as N4-fields, U-Net, and DRIU in terms of accuracy,

equal or much larger than the size of the holes $\varepsilon$. Such a diluted
porous medium is interesting because it contains some cases where we have a
non-negligible effect on the solution when $(\varepsilon,d_{\varepsilon})\to
(0,0)$. Smaller distance was avoided for mathematical reasons and for theses
large distances, the geometry of the holes does not affect -- or few -- the
asymptotic result. Very recently, it was shown for the 2D-Euler equations that
a porous medium is non-negligible only for inter-holes distance much smaller
than the size of the holes. For this result, the regularity of holes boundary
plays a crucial role, and the permeability criterium depends on the geometry of
the lateral boundary. In this paper, we relax slightly the regularity
condition, allowing a corner, and we note that a line of irregular obstacles
cannot slow down a perfect fluid in any regime such that $\varepsilon \ln

customers dislike unfair prices---those marked up steeply over cost---and that
firms take these concerns into account when setting prices. Since they do not
observe firms' costs, customers must extract costs from prices. The theory
assumes that customers infer less than rationally: when a price rises due to a
cost increase, customers partially misattribute the higher price to a higher
markup---which they find unfair. Firms anticipate this response and trim their
price increases, which drives the passthrough of costs into prices below one:
prices are somewhat rigid. Embedded in a New Keynesian model as a replacement
for the usual pricing frictions, our theory produces monetary nonneutrality:
when monetary policy loosens and inflation rises, customers misperceive markups
as higher and feel unfairly treated; firms mitigate this perceived unfairness
by reducing their markups; in general equilibrium, employment rises. The theory
also features a hybrid short-run Phillips curve, realistic impulse responses of
output and employment to monetary and technology shocks, and an upward-sloping
long-run Phillips curve.

under water-rock interaction (WRI) and geostress is developed. Processes
including WRI, asperity deformation, mineral chemical dissolution and pressure
dissolution etc., are taken into account. A feature of this model lies in its
approximate linearization to the non-linear pressure dissolution process, which
makes this model compatible with existing numerical solute transport models.
Case study shows that although usually only a thin layer of rock surface is
invaded by WRI, the mechanical weakening of this thin layer tend to induce
significant increase in rock surface deformation. Thus, the distributed flow
field, mineral dissolution rates, and surface alteration increments etc., are
all affected. This indicates that when fracture flow related issues are
concerned, we should focus on the top thin layer of rock surface rather than
the matrix. Results also show that fluid flow enhances the dissolution of rocks
and development of flowing channels; however, at places where stress induces
high pressure-dissolution but fluid flows slowly, minerals precipitate and fill
up fracture voids. This suggests the hydraulic condition plays a key role in
the development of fracture flow channels and the evolution of fracture
geometry.

Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS). Safe and efficient removal of
debris from MEO is problematic due to the high cost for maneuvers needed to
directly reach the Earth (reentry orbits) and the relatively crowded GNSS
neighborhood (graveyard orbits). Recent studies have highlighted the
complicated secular dynamics in the MEO region, but also the possibility of
exploiting these dynamics, for designing removal strategies. In this paper, we
present our numerical exploration of the long-term dynamics in MEO, performed
with the purpose of unveiling the set of reentry and graveyard solutions that
could be reached with maneuvers of reasonable DV cost. We simulated the
dynamics over 120-200 years for an extended grid of millions of fictitious MEO
satellites that covered all inclinations from 0 to 90deg, using non-averaged
equations of motion and a suitable dynamical model that accounted for the
principal geopotential terms, 3rd-body perturbations and solar radiation
pressure (SRP). We found a sizeable set of usable solutions with reentry times
that exceed ~40years, mainly around three specific inclination values: 46deg,
56deg, and 68deg; a result compatible with our understanding of MEO secular
dynamics. For DV <= 300 m/s (i.e., achieved if you start from a typical GNSS
orbit and target a disposal orbit with e<0.3), reentry times from GNSS
altitudes exceed ~70 years, while low-cost (DV ~= 5-35 m/s) graveyard orbits,
stable for at lest 200 years, are found for eccentricities up to e~0.018. This
investigation was carried out in the framework of the EC-funded ""ReDSHIFT""

properties of elemental media with respect to energy, enabling more precise
material identification than single-energy CT. The increased precision comes
with the cost of a higher radiation dose. A straightforward way to lower the
dose is to reduce the number of projections per energy, but this makes
tomographic reconstruction more ill-posed. In this paper, we propose how this
problem can be overcome with a combination of a regularization method that
promotes structural similarity between images at different energies and a
suitably selected low-dose data acquisition protocol using non-overlapping
projections. The performance of various joint regularization models is assessed
with both simulated and experimental data, using the novel low-dose data
acquisition protocol. Three of the models are well-established, namely the
joint total variation, the linear parallel level sets and the spectral
smoothness promoting regularization models. Furthermore, one new joint
regularization model is introduced for multi-energy CT: a regularization based
on the structure function from the structural similarity index. The findings
show that joint regularization outperforms individual channel-by-channel
reconstruction. Furthermore, the proposed combination of joint reconstruction
and non-overlapping projection geometry enables significant reduction of

problems, and there is a strong necessity to support the standards histological
and cytological evaluations by biochemical composition information. Over the
past decades, there has been a very active research in the development of Raman
spectroscopy techniques for oncological applications and large scale clinical
diagnosis. A major issue that has received a lot of attention in the Raman
literature is the fact that variations in instrumental responses and intrinsic
spectral backgrounds over different days of measurements or devices creates
strong inconsistency of Raman intensity spectra over the various experimental
condition, thus making the use of Raman spectroscopy on a large scale and
reproductive basis difficult. We explore different methods to tackle this
inconsistency and show that regular preprocessing methods such as baseline
correction, normalization or wavelet transformation are inefficient on our
datasets. We find that subtracting the mean background spectrum estimated by
identifying non-cell regions in Raman images makes the data more consistent. As
a proof of concept, we employ our single-cell Raman Imaging protocol to
diagnosis challenging follicular lesions, that is known to be particularly
difficult due to the lack of obvious morphological and cytological criteria for
malignancy. We explore dimensionality reduction with both PCA and feature
selection methods, and classification is then performed at the single cell
level with standard classifiers such as k Nearest Neighbors or Random Forest.
We investigate Raman hyperspectral images from FTC133, RO82W-1 and NthyOri 3-1
cell lines and show that the chemical information for the diagnosis is mostly
contained in the cytoplasm. We also reveal some important wavenumber for
malignancy, that can be associated mainly to lipids, cytochrome and
phenylalanine.

was underlined by Lindegren et al. (2018), and initiated by several works
making use of Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and asteroseismology. Despite a
very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation
remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining
astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we
undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant
branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about
500 and 700 red giants (both RGB and RC) selected by the K2 Galactic
Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging into a thorough comparison
of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the
influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the
Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and
open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to
retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point,
in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we
initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous
calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax
offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third

from long-range interactions of free electrons and whose existence in real
systems has been subject to debate for decades. Here we use a quantum simulator
consisting of a four-site square plaquette of quantum dots to demonstrate
Nagaoka ferromagnetism. This form of itinerant magnetism has been rigorously
studied theoretically but has remained unattainable in experiment. We load the
plaquette with three electrons and demonstrate the predicted emergence of
spontaneous ferromagnetic correlations through pairwise measurements of spin.
We find the ferromagnetic ground state is remarkably robust to engineered
disorder in the on-site potentials and can induce a transition to the low-spin
state by changing the plaquette topology to an open chain. This demonstration
of Nagaoka ferromagnetism highlights that quantum simulators can be used to
study physical phenomena that have not yet been observed in any system before.
The work also constitutes an important step towards large-scale quantum dot
simulators of correlated electron systems.

the target.
  Motivated by questions like how fast fit individuals take over a population,
we analyze random processes exhibiting a $(1+\delta)$-multiplicative growth in

hitting time. This drift theorem gives a simple and insightful proof of the
level-based theorem first proposed by Lehre (2011). Our version of this theorem
has, for the first time, the best-possible near-linear dependence on $1/\delta$

requires a population size near-linear in $\delta$ (this was super-quadratic in
previous results). These improvements immediately lead to stronger run time
guarantees for a number of applications.

analyzing a storage ring's beam position monitor (BPM) system requirements has
been developed. The ultimate performance of a ring-based accelerator, based on
brightness or luminosity, is determined not only by global parameters, but also
by local beam properties at some particular points of interest (POI). BPMs used
for monitoring the beam properties, however, can not be located at these
points. Therefore, the underlying and fundamental purpose of a BPM system is to
predict whether the beam properties at POIs reach their desired values. The
prediction process is a regression problem with BPM readings as the training
data, but containing random noise. A Bayesian Gaussian regression approach can
determine the probability distribution of the predictive errors, which can be
used to conversely analyze the BPM system requirements. This approach is
demonstrated by using turn-by-turn data to reconstruct a linear optics model,
and predict the brightness degradation for a ring-based light source. The
quality of BPMs was found to be more important than their quantity in
mitigating predictive errors.

inclusion of toxic lead. In this study, high-throughput density functional
theory (DFT) methods are used to computationally model and screen 1845 halide
perovskites in search of new materials without these limitations that are
promising for solar cell applications. This study focuses on finding materials
that are comprised of nontoxic elements, stable in a humid operating
environment, and have an optimal bandgap for one of single junction, tandem
Si-perovskite, or quantum dot-based solar cells. Single junction materials are
also screened on predicted single junction photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies
exceeding 22.7%, which is the current highest reported PV efficiency for halide
perovskites. Generally, these methods qualitatively reproduce the properties of
known promising nontoxic halide perovskites that have either been
experimentally evaluated or predicted from theory. From a set of 1845
materials, 15 materials pass all screening criteria for single junction cell
applications, 13 of which have not been previously investigated, such as
(CH3NH3)0.75Cs0.25SnI3, ((NH2)2CH)Ag0.5Sb0.5Br3, CsMn0.875Fe0.125I3,

temperatures are often found at very short length scales, such as nanoparticle

melting of a spherically symmetric nanoparticle. Errors which have propagated

comparing the results with the available data, we test the validity and
applicability of the diquark structure which turns a three-body problem into a
two-body one, so greatly simplifies the calculation. It is indicated that the
two approaches (diquark and a subsystem within which the two light quarks are
free) lead to similar numerical results even though the model parameters in the
two schemes might deviate slightly. Thus, the diquark approach seems

dark matter in the Universe, in spite of the extensive investigations pursued
over a very long lapse of time, the nature of this matter and of its (other
than gravitational, if any) interactions have remained unknown. Very likely, at
least a fraction of this matter consists of fossil particles; a possibility
that in the last decades has prompted direct and indirect searches for these
relics. Particular attention has been (and is being) devoted to the
investigation about the physical effects that fossil particles, and in
particular Weakly Interacting Particles (WIMPs), moving in our galaxy can
produce when they scatter off the material of an appropriate underground
detector. In this note we consider the present status of this type of
experimental investigation, and comment about some important results obtained
recently by the DAMA Collaboration and their possible developments.

energy systems integration. The variable energy efficiencies of the energy
conversion and storage components in MES introduce nonlinearity to the model
and thus complicate the analysis and optimization of MES. In this paper, we
propose a standardized matrix modeling approach to automatically model MES with
variable energy efficiencies based on the energy hub (EH) modeling framework.
We use piecewise linearization to approximate the variable energy efficiencies;
as a result, a component with variable efficiency is equivalent to several
parallel components with constant efficiencies. The nonlinear energy conversion
and storage relationship in EH can thus be further modeled under a linear
modeling framework using matrices. Such matrix modeling approach makes the
modeling of an arbitrary EH with nonlinear energy components highly automated
by computers. The proposed modeling approach can further facilitate the
operation and planning optimization of EH with variable efficiencies. Case
studies are presented to show how the nonlinear approximation accuracy and
calculation efficiency can be balanced using the proposed model in the optimal
operation of EH.

inter-oscillator coupling, although both are positive naturally, can be either
single negative or double negative effectively within a certain frequency
range. At the frequency where the effective mass and coupling are both
infinite, a flat band emerges that will induce an extremely high density of
states. At the critical point of band degeneracy, a Dirac-like point emerges
where both effective mass and the inverse of effective coupling are
simultaneously zero, so that zero index is realized for phonons. Moreover, the
phononic topological phase transition is observed that the phononic band gap
switches between single mass-negative and single coupling-negative regime. As a
consequence, a topological interface state is identified, well explained by the

delamination was kept in the residual image. A UAV-based nondestructive survey
was carried out on an in-service bridge for a case study and two delamination

both raw and residual thermal image. Results were compared and evaluated based
on the hammer sounding test on the same bridge. The performance of
detectability was noticeably improved while direct implementation of
post-processing on raw image exhibited over- and under-estimation of

Prior works have sought to address this issue by using graphical models or

fragmented predictions. Moreover, recent works have demonstrated that
channel-wise information also acts a pivotal part in CNNs. In this work, we
introduce two simple yet effective network units, the spatial relation module

between any two spatial positions or feature maps, and then produce
relation-augmented feature representations. The spatial and channel relation
modules are general and extensible, and can be used in a plug-and-play fashion

simultaneously achieve both data security and storage efficiency.
State-of-the-art encrypted deduplication systems mainly build on deterministic
encryption to preserve deduplication effectiveness. However, such deterministic
encryption reveals the underlying frequency distribution of the original
plaintext chunks. This allows an adversary to launch frequency analysis against
the ciphertext chunks and infer the content of the original plaintext chunks.
In this paper, we study how frequency analysis affects information leakage in
encrypted deduplication storage, from both attack and defense perspectives.
Specifically, we target backup workloads, and propose a new inference attack
that exploits chunk locality to increase the coverage of inferred chunks. We
further combine the new inference attack with the knowledge of chunk sizes and
show its attack effectiveness against variable-size chunks. We conduct
trace-driven evaluation on both real-world and synthetic datasets and show that
our proposed attacks infer a significant fraction of plaintext chunks under
backup workloads. To defend against frequency analysis, we present two defense
approaches, namely MinHash encryption and scrambling. Our trace-driven
evaluation shows that our combined MinHash encryption and scrambling scheme
effectively mitigates the severity of the inference attacks, while maintaining
high storage efficiency and incurring limited metadata access overhead.

Being a theory of geometries, the phase transitions which in usual lattice

will in the CDT case be transitions between different types of geometries. This
picture is interwoven with the topology of space which is kept fixed in the
lattice theory, the reason being that ""classical"" geometries around which the
quantum fluctuations take place depend crucially on the imposed topology. Thus
it is possible that the topology of space can influence the phase transitions
and the corresponding critical phenomena used to extract continuum physics. In
this article we perform a systematic comparison between a CDT phase transition
where space has spherical topology and the ""same"" transition where space has
toroidal topology. The ""classical"" geometries around which the systems
fluctuate are very different it the two cases, but we find that the order of

neutron star (NS) and showing periodic dips. The spectrum of the persistent
emission was modeled with a blackbody component having a temperature between
1.31 and 1.67 keV and with a Comptonization component with an electron
temperature of 9.4 keV and a photon index $\Gamma$ between 2.5 and 2.9. The
presence of absorption features associated with highly ionized elements
suggested the presence of partially ionized plasma in the system. Aims: In this
work we performed a study of the spectrum of XB 1916-053, which aims to shed
light on the nature of the seed photons that contribute to the Comptonization
component. Methods: We analyzed three Suzaku observations of XB 1916-053: the
first was performed in November 2006 and the others were carried out in October
2014. We extracted the persistent spectra from each observation and combined
the spectra of the most recent observations, obtaining a single spectrum with a
higher statistic. We also extracted and combined the spectra of the dips
observed during the same observations. Results: On the basis of the available
data statistics, we infer that the scenario in which the corona Comptonizes
photons emitted both by the innermost region of the accretion disk and the NS
surface is not statistically relevant with respect to the case in which only
photons emitted by the NS surface are Comptonized. We find that the source is
in a soft spectral state in all the analyzed observations. We detect the
K$\alpha$ absorption lines of \ion{Fe}{xxv} and \ion{Fe}{xxvi}, which have
already been reported in literature, and for the first time the K$\beta$
absorption lines of the same ions. We also detect an edge at 0.876 keV, which
is consistent with a \ion{O}{viii} K absorption edge. (Abridged)

in a variety of conditions. In this Contribution, it is shown that the QPT in

is still challenge to derive a fine molecular-level picture on the results

selection of a full QPT path may be strongly affected by the different
microscopic proton transfer mechanisms, i.e. proton transfer from hydronium ion

through a time dependent permanent polarization without any applied electric

charge in a lossless way. For both cases, we show that Maxwell's equations, and
in particular Faraday's law are modified, along with the required boundary
conditions through the addition of an effective impressed magnetic current
boundary source. For the free charge case, we highlight the example of an
electromagnetic generator based on Lorentz force, where the impressed force per
unit charge that polarizes the conductor comes from mechanical motion of free
charge with an impressed velocity of a conductor relative to a stationary DC
magnetic field. The bound charge generator is an idealized permanently
polarized bar electret with a time dependent permanent polarization, the
underlying principle behind piezoelectric nano-generators. In the open circuit
state, both electricity generators are equivalent to idealized Hertzian
dipoles, with the open circuit voltage equal to the induced emf. Analyzing the
short circuit responses, we show that the bound charge electricity generator
has a capacitive source impedance. In contrast, we show for the ideal free
charge AC electricity generator, the back emf from the inductance of the loop
that defines the short circuit, directly cancels the source emf, so the voltage
across the inductor is solely determined by the magnetic current boundary
source. Thus, we determine the magnetic current boundary source is the
topological invariant that best describes the output voltage of an AC

(PE) communicating locally. We proceed by simulating the Self-Development of a
Network (SDN) of membranes, and this implies a medium able to implement
artificial physics laws that simulates simplified membrane-agents, dividing and
homogenizing. This is a difficult challenge: our current version of SDN-media
uses PEs with 77 bits of state and 13878 gates. This high level of complexity
forced us to work out an efficient and expressive scheme for programming the
medium, the goal of this paper it to present it. The PE's communication graph
has to be a maximal planar graph. Fields of bits are spread in 2D, over three
locus: the vertices, edges and faces of this planar graph. They constitute
three data types, which abstract away the ensemble of PEs. The simplicial
proximity between bits is used to define operations on fields, thus
implementing ""{\it spatial type}"". Expression combining operations can be
translated in logical circuits.
  The efficiency is achieved because fields of different locus are combined
using reduction operation. This allows to factorize computation by exploiting
the symmetries always present when simulating physics.
  The expressiveness is achieved by allowing a modular procedural programming:
Instead of directly focusing on a specific target update function, we develop a
library or reusable functions mapping fields to other fields.
  We consider two kinds of maximal planar graph: with isotropic distribution of
PEs or with the hexagonal lattice structure. The first compares to amorphous
computing medium and has a better potential for hardware scalability, the
second compares with cellular automata computing medium, it is more efficient.

study in 77 patients with brain tumors who had undergone both MRI and computed
tomography (CT) imaging as part of their simulation for external beam treatment
planning. We designed a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate
synthetic CT images from MRI images. We used Mutual Information (MI) as the
loss function in the generator to overcome the misalignment between MRI and CT
images (unregistered data). The model was trained using all MRI slices with
corresponding CT slices from each training subject s MRI/CT pair. Results: The
proposed GAN method produced an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 47.2 +-
11.0 HU over 5-fold cross validation. The overall mean Dice similarity
coefficient between CT and synthetic CT images was 80% +- 6% in bone for all
test data. Though training a GAN model may take several hours, the model only
needs to be trained once. Generating a complete synthetic CT volume for each
new patient MRI volume using a trained GAN model took only one second.
Conclusions: The GAN model we developed produced highly accurate synthetic CT
images from conventional, single-sequence MRI images in seconds. Our proposed
method has strong potential to perform well in a clinical workflow for MRI-only

continuously interpolate both of these centrality measures away from the

betweenness and closeness centralities reduce, respectively, to the well-known

traditional production environments have a server archive instance per

studies. This paper proposes an innovator ownership concept and access control
mechanisms that provide a multi-repository environment and integrates well with

  Methods: A secure accounting mechanism for medical imaging repositories were
designed and instantiated as an extension of a well-known open-source archive.
A new Web services layer was implemented to provide a vendor-neutral solution
complaint with modern DICOM-Web protocols for storage, search and retrieve of

  Results: The concept validation was done through the integration of proposed

also consider the case where the approximate Markov chain is pseudo-marginal,
requiring unbiased estimators for its approximate marginal target. Convergence
results with asymptotic variance formulae are shown for this case, and for the
case where the IS weights based on unbiased estimators are only calculated for
distinct output samples of the so-called `jump' chain, which, with a suitable
reweighting, allows for improved efficiency. As the IS type weights may assume
negative values, extended classes of unbiased estimators may be used for the IS
type correction, such as those obtained from randomised multilevel Monte Carlo.
Using Euler approximations and coupling of particle filters, we apply the
resulting estimator using randomised weights to the problem of parameter
inference for partially observed It\^{o} diffusions. Convergence of the
estimator is verified to hold under regularity assumptions which do not require
that the diffusion can be simulated exactly. In the context of approximate

the selection of a suitably large tolerance, with IS correction possible to
finer tolerance, and with provided approximate confidence intervals. A
prominent question is the efficiency of MCMC-IS compared to standard direct

computing environments because of its lightweight and effiency. However, it
requires adequate control and management via an orchestrator. As a result,
cloud providers are adopting the open-access Kubernetes platform as the
standard orchestrator of containerized applications. To ensure applications'
availability in Kubernetes, the latter uses Raft protocol's replication
mechanism. Despite its simplicity, Raft assumes that machines fail only when
shutdown. This failure event is rarely the only reason for a machine's
malfunction. Indeed, software errors or malicious attacks can cause machines to
exhibit Byzantine (i.e. random) behavior and thereby corrupt the accuracy and
availability of the replication protocol. In this paper, we propose a
Kubernetes multi-Master Robust (KmMR) platform to overcome this limitation.
KmMR is based on the adaptation and integration of the BFT-SMaRt fault-tolerant
replication protocol into Kubernetes environment. Unlike Raft protocol,
BFT-SMaRt is resistant to both Byzantine and non-Byzantine faults. Experimental
results show that KmMR is able to guarantee the continuity of services, even
when the total number of tolerated faults is exceeded. In addition, KmMR
provides on average a consensus time 1000 times shorter than that achieved by
the conventional platform (with Raft), in such condition. Finally, we show that
KmMR generates a small additional cost in terms of resource consumption
compared to the conventional platform.

binary Bose-Einstein condensates with a small mass imbalance between the
species confined in a two-dimensional harmonic trap where one of the two
species has been segmented into two parts by a potential barrier. To trigger
the dynamics the potential barrier is suddenly removed and subsequently the
segments perform a counterflow dynamics. We consider a relative phase
difference of $\pi$ between the segments, while a singly quantized vortex may
be imprinted at the center of the other species. The number of vortex
structures developed within the segmented species following the merging of its
segments is found to depend on the presence of an initial vortex on the other
species. In particular, a $\pi$ phase difference in the segmented species and a
vortex in the other species result in a single vortex-bright-soliton structure.
However, when the non-segmented species does not contain a vortex the
counterflow dynamics of the segmented species gives rise to a vortex dipole in
it accompanied by two bright solitary waves arising in the non-segmented
species. Turning to strongly mass imbalanced mixtures, with a heavier segmented
species, we find that the same overall dynamics takes place, while the
quench-induced nonlinear excitations become more robust. Inspecting the
dynamics of the angular momentum we show that it can be transferred from one

control of critical processes such as maintaining the thermal stability of
patients, or in alarm systems for detecting temperature-related hazards.
However, the security of these systems has yet to be completely explored,
leaving potential attack surfaces that can be exploited to take control over
critical systems.
  In this paper we investigate the reliability of temperature-based control
systems from a security and safety perspective. We show how unexpected
consequences and safety risks can be induced by physical-level attacks on
analog temperature sensing components. For instance, we demonstrate that an
adversary could remotely manipulate the temperature sensor measurements of an
infant incubator to cause potential safety issues, without tampering with the
victim system or triggering automatic temperature alarms. This attack exploits
the unintended rectification effect that can be induced in operational and
instrumentation amplifiers to control the sensor output, tricking the internal
control loop of the victim system to heat up or cool down. Furthermore, we show
how the exploit of this hardware-level vulnerability could affect different
classes of analog sensors that share similar signal conditioning processes.
  Our experimental results indicate that conventional defenses commonly
deployed in these systems are not sufficient to mitigate the threat, so we
propose a prototype design of a low-cost anomaly detector for critical
applications to ensure the integrity of temperature sensor signals.

generalization of the delta method for ratios of expectations and the
consistency of the nonparametric percentile bootstrap. We also investigate
finite-sample inference and show a partial impossibility result: nonasymptotic
uniform confidence intervals can be built for ratios of expectations but not at

forensic applications to single out possible suspects (e.g., detecting the
author of child abuse or terrorist propaganda material), many accurate camera
model attribution methods have been developed in the literature. One of their
main drawbacks, however, is the typical closed-set assumption of the problem.
This means that an investigated photograph is always assigned to one camera
model within a set of known ones present during investigation, i.e., training
time, and the fact that the picture can come from a completely unrelated camera
model during actual testing is usually ignored. Under realistic conditions, it
is not possible to assume that every picture under analysis belongs to one of

the first in-depth study on the possibility of solving the camera model

from an unknown one. We compare different feature extraction algorithms and
classifiers specially targeting open-set recognition. We also evaluate possible
open-set training protocols that can be applied along with any open-set

limited end-effector DOF or small payload capacity. In this dissertation, a
quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator is investigated that has a unique topology
to enable the end-effector to track 6-DOF trajectory with the minimum possible
number of actuators/links and hence, maximize the payload and/or mission time.
The proposed system is designed, modeled, and constructed. An identification
process is carried out to find the system parameters. An experimental setup is
proposed with a 6-DOF state measurement and estimation scheme. The system
feasibility is validated via numerical and experimental results. The inverse
kinematics require a solution of complicated algebraic-differential equations.
Therefore, an algorithm is developed to get an approximate solution of these
equations. Furthermore, the motion control of this quadrotor manipulation
system is quite challenging. The system has strong nonlinearities, fast
dynamics and unstable dynamics that are very susceptible to parameters
variations and external disturbances. Thus, a linear Disturbance Observer
(DOb)-based robust controller is utilized to address these issues. A modified
DOb loop is proposed and designed to use the direct measurements. A Model
Predictive Control (MPC) is used in the external loop of the DOb to save power
consumption that increases the mission time and to consider of the actuators
constraints. The manipulation tasks require estimating (applying) certain force
at the end-effector. However, the current developed techniques have limitations
because they are model-based methods, based on ignoring some dynamics, or
requiring an indicator of the environment contact. Hence, a robust sensorless
force estimation and impedance control scheme is proposed to overcome these
limitations.

ionized flux were considered as thermal evaporation, dcMS and HiPIMS,
respectively, for ~20000 adatoms. It is shown that higher ionization fraction
of the deposition flux leads to smoother surfaces by two major mechanisms i.e.
decreasing clustering in the vapor phase and bi-collision of high energy ions
at the film surface. The bi-collision event consists of local amorphization
which fills the gaps between islands followed by crystallization due to
secondary collisions. We found bi-collision events to be very important to
prevent island growth to become dominant and increase the surface roughness.
Regardless of the deposition method, epitaxial Cu thin films suffer from
stacking fault areas (twin boundaries) in agreement with recent experimental
results. In addition, HiPIMS deposition presents considerable interface mixing
while it is negligible in thermal evaporation and dcMS deposition, those
present less adhesion accordingly.

discovery have stagnated. In addition, there are still rarely used ring systems
from FDA approved drug that can be optimized and used for repurposing purpose.
In the present work, these rarely used drug ring system were re-purposed with
our bidirectional target and ring screening (TR- dual screening) approach
within our defined objectives. The TR-dual screening suggested RARbeta and
cyproheptadine as a pair of target and ring system. The selected ring system
was virtually grown with predefined criterion, ranking of molecular docking and
top score poses made us select test compounds for synthesis and biological
proof. Among the tested compounds, 6c proved RARbeta agonist activity. The
concept of TR dual optimization can contribute to picking either a compound
having acceptable ADMET profile or a target for a selected drug scaffold.

to human constraints. We find that optimal row lengths and blades sizes depend
on sports and athletes strength, and provide an optimisation scheme.

and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The
computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying
physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed
or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various
investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on
the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments
on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that
need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This
paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on
an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but
with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of
computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing
models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model
opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial
intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.

while dealing with the increase of users traffic. In Heterogeneous Networks

number of files that are successfully delivered to users, by jointly optimizing
caching placement and channel allocation in cache-enabled D2D-assisted HetNets.
At first, an analytical upper-bound on the average content delivery delay is
derived. Then, the joint optimization problem is formulated. The non-convexity
of the problem is alleviated, and the optimal solution is determined. Due to
the high time complexity of the obtained solution, a low-complex sub-optimal
approach is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
solutions and compare them to conventional approaches. Finally, by
investigating the impact of key parameters, e.g. power, caching capacity, QoS
requirements, etc., guidelines to design these networks are obtained.
