safety-critical systems that employ machine learning and deep learning models,
such as automated driving vehicles. In order to use machine learning in a
safety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security
of the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely
accepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these
systems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered
system is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into
requirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models
used in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant
technical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to
select a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and
explore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning
systems --- that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of
machine learning models and systems --- as well as discuss related works and
research directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our
results show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of
requirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of
interpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a
conventional system quality standard SQuARE with the characteristics of machine
learning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find
that a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the
greatest impact on conventional quality models.

$P_c(4450)^+$ state split into two narrow states, $P_c(4440)^+$ and
$P_c(4457)^+$, having the masses $M=(4440.3\pm 1.3^{+4.1}_{-4.7})$ MeV and
$M=(4457.3\pm 0.6^{+4.1}_{-1.7})$ MeV, and decay widths $\Gamma=(20.6\pm
4.9^{+8.7}_{-10.1})$ MeV and $\Gamma=(6.4\pm 2.0^{+5.7}_{-1.9})$ MeV,
respectively. In addition, a third narrow peak, $P_c(4312)^+$, having the mass
$M=(4311.9\pm 0.7^{+6.8}_{-0.6})$ MeV and decay width $\Gamma=(9.8\pm
2.7^{+3.7}_{-4.5})$ MeV is also observed. The LHCb analysis is not sensitive to
broad $J/\psi p$ contributions like the former $P_c(4380)^+$, implying that
there could be more states present in the data. Also the spin-parity, $J^P$,
assignments of the states are not yet determined. We interpret these resonances
in the compact diquark model as hidden-charm diquark-diquark-antiquark baryons,
having the following spin and angular momentum quantum numbers: $P_c(4312)^+
=\{\bar c [cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=0}; L_P=0, J^P=3/2^-\}$, the $S$-wave state, and
the other two as $P$-wave states, with $P_c(4440)^+ =\{\bar c [cu]_{s=1}

[ud]_{s=0}; L_P=1, J^P=5/2^+ \}$. The subscripts denote the spins of the
diquarks and $L_P=0,1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the
pentaquark. These assignments are in accord with the heavy-quark-symmetry
selection rules for $\Lambda_b$-baryon decays, in which the spin $S=0$ of the
light diquark $[ud]_{s=0}$ is conserved. The masses of observed states can be
accommodated in this framework and the two heaviest states have the positive
parities as opposed to the molecular-like interpretations.

big data-set is split into small data chunks that are replicated on different
servers among thousands of servers. The heterogeneous server structure of the
system makes the scheduling much harder than scheduling for systems with
homogeneous servers. Throughput optimality of the system on one hand and delay
optimality on the other hand creates a dilemma for assigning tasks to servers.
The JSQ-MaxWeight and Balanced-Pandas algorithms are the states of the arts
algorithms with theoretical guarantees on throughput and delay optimality for
systems with two and three levels of data locality. However, the scheduling
complexity of these two algorithms are way too much. Hence, we use the power of
$d$ choices algorithm combined with the Balanced-Pandas algorithm and the
JSQ-MaxWeight algorithm, and compare the complexity of the simple algorithms
and the power of $d$ choices versions of them. We will further show that the
Balanced-Pandas algorithm combined with the power of the $d$ choices,
Balanced-Pandas-Pod, not only performs better than simple Balanced-Pandas, but
also is less sensitive to the parameter $d$ than the combination of the
JSQ-MaxWeight algorithm and the power of the $d$ choices, JSQ-MaxWeight-Pod. In
fact in our extensive simulation results, the Balanced-Pandas-Pod algorithm is
performing better than the simple Balanced-Pandas algorithm in low and medium
loads, where data centers are usually performing at, and performs almost the
same as the Balanced-Pandas algorithm at high loads. Note that the load
balancing complexity of Balanced-Pandas and JSQ-MaxWeight algorithms are
$O(M)$, where $M$ is the number of servers in the system which is in the order
of thousands servers, whereas the complexity of Balanced-Pandas-Pod and

communication paradigm that relies on the integration of a massive number of
antenna elements over the entire surfaces of man-made structures. The LIS
concept provides many advantages, such as the capability to provide reliable
and space-intensive communications by effectively establishing line-of-sight
(LOS) channels. In this paper, the system spectral efficiency (SSE) of an
uplink LIS system is asymptotically analyzed under a practical LIS environment
with a well-defined uplink frame structure. In order to verify the impact on
the SSE of pilot contamination, the SSE of a multi-LIS system is asymptotically
studied and a theoretical bound on its performance is derived. Given this
performance bound, an optimal pilot training length for multi-LIS systems
subjected to pilot contamination is characterized and, subsequently, the
performance-maximizing number of devices that the LIS system must service is
derived. Simulation results show that the derived analyses are in close
agreement with the exact mutual information in presence of a large number of
antennas, and the achievable SSE is limited by the effect of pilot
contamination and intra/inter-LIS interference through the LOS path, even if
the LIS is equipped with an infinite number of antennas. Additionally, the SSE
obtained with the proposed pilot training length and number of scheduled
devices is shown to reach the one obtained via a brute-force search for the

  MIMO Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on edge caching in mm/{\mu}Wave hybrid wireless networks,
in which all mmWave SBSs and {\mu}Wave MBSs are capable of storing contents to
alleviate the traffic burden on the backhaul link that connect the BSs and the
core network to retrieve the non-cached contents. The main aim of this work is
to address the effect of capacity-limited backhaul on the average success
probability (ASP) of file delivery and latency. In particular, we consider a
more practical mmWave hybrid beamforming in small cells and massive MIMO
communication in macro cells. Based on stochastic geometry and a simple
retransmission protocol, we derive the association probabilities by which the
ASP of file delivery and latency are derived. Taking no caching event as the
benchmark, we evaluate these QoS performance metrics under MC and UC placement
policies. The theoretical results demonstrate that backhaul capacity indeed has
a significant impact on network performance especially under weak backhaul
capacity. Besides, we also show the tradeoff among cache size, retransmission
attempts, ASP of file delivery, and latency. The interplay shows that cache
size and retransmission under different caching placement schemes alleviates
the backhaul requirements. Simulation results are present to valid our
analysis.

conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-hour

Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band
of 75 MHz, dedicated to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly
congested. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a vehicular
communication system, operated over the unlicensed bands 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz and
5.725 GHz - 5.875 GHz. Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing
track in the centre of Bristol, UK and our system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5
implementation. Our performance investigation compares key communication
metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal strength indicator)
measured by operating our system over the licensed DSRC and the considered
unlicensed bands. In particular, when operated over the 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz band,
our system achieves comparable performance to the case when the DSRC band is
used. On the other hand, as soon as the system, is operated over the 5.725 GHz
- 5.875 GHz band, the packet delivery rate is 30% smaller compared to the case
when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system
over unlicensed ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental

star-forming galaxies of all morphologies are 'rougher' and more asymmetric
than older, more quiescent ones. Combining a subset of the EDisCS clusters we

  I extended upon the research of Wang et al. (""Developing a Model of Loop
  Actions by Mining Loop Characteristics from a Large Code Corpus"" In
  Proceedings of 31st International Conference on Software Maintenance and
  Evolution, Bremen, Germany, September 2015. )",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many algorithmic steps require more than one statement to implement, but not
big enough to be a method (e.g., add element, find the maximum, determine a
value, etc.). These steps are generally implemented by loops. Internal comments
for the loops often describe these intermediary steps, however, unfortunately a
very small percentage of code is well documented to help new users/coders. As a
result, information at levels of abstraction between the individual statement
and the whole method is not leveraged by current source code analyses, as that
information is not easily available beyond any internal comments describing the
code blocks.
  Hence, this project explores the generality of an approach to automatically
determine the high level actions of loop constructs. The approach is to mine
loop characteristics of a given loop structure over the repository of the
Quorum language source code, map it to an (already developed for Java) action
identification model, and thus identify the action performed by the specified
loop. The results are promising enough to conclude that this approach could be
applied to other programming languages too.

velocity gradients. In the same way, turbulence affects the orientation of
aggregates of organic matter settling in the ocean. In fact most solid
particles encountered in Nature are not spherical, and their orientation
affects their settling speed, as well as collision rates between particles.
Therefore it is important to understand the distribution of orientations of
non-spherical particles settling in turbulence. Here we study the angular
dynamics of small prolate spheroids settling in homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. We consider a limit of the problem where the fluid torque due to
convective inertia dominates, so that rods settle essentially horizontally.
Turbulence causes the orientation of the settling particles to fluctuate, and
we calculate their orientation distribution for prolate spheroids with
arbitrary aspect ratios for large settling number Sv (a dimensionless measure
of the settling speed), assuming small Stokes number St (a dimensionless
measure of particle inertia). This overdamped theory predicts that the
orientation distribution is very narrow at large Sv, with a variance
proportional to ${\rm Sv}^{-4}$. By considering the role of particle inertia,
we analyse the limitations of the overdamped theory, and determine its range of
applicability. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with numerical
simulations of simplified models of turbulent flows. Finally we contrast our
results with those of an alternative theory predicting that the orientation
variance scales as ${\rm Sv}^{-2}$ at large Sv.

function (VDF) from samples complete for all sigma, where galaxies with sigma
greater than the sigma-completeness limit of the SDSS spectroscopic survey are
included. We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS
spectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod). The
sigma_spec for our sample is systematically higher than sigma_mod for all
ranges of sigma, implying that rotational velocity may affect sigma_spec
measurements. The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar
for lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec
VDF at log sigma > 2.35. Very few galaxies are observed to have sigma > 350
km/s. Despite differences in sample selection and methods, our VDFs are in
close agreement with previous determinations for the local universe, and our
results confirm that complete sampling is necessary to accurately discern the
shape of the VDF at all ranges. We also find that both late and early type
galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation component of
most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements. Early-type
galaxies dominate the population of high sigma galaxies, while late-type
galaxies dominate the low sigma statistic. Our results warrant a more thorough
and cautious approach in using long-slit spectroscopy to derive the statistics
of local galaxies. Higher quality photometric measurements will enable more
accurate and less uncertain measurements of the sigma_mod VDF, as described
here. A follow-up paper uses the final samples from this work in conjunction

its detection is unfeasible so far. Because of the general interest in the
phenomenology and understanding of random lasers and, moreover, because it is a
first example of self-starting mode-locking we devise and test a way to measure
such peculiar non-linear coupling. Through a detailed analysis of multi-mode

observed for spatially overlapping resonances and turn out to sensitively
depend on the frequency matching being satisfied, eventually demonstrating the
occurrence of non-linear mode-locked mode-coupling.

increased sensitivity towards light dark matter particles. In this manuscript
we describe the analysis of one detector operated in the first run of
CRESST-III (05/2016-02/2018) achieving a nuclear recoil threshold of 30.1eV.
This result was obtained with a 23.6g CaWO$_4$ crystal operated as a cryogenic
scintillating calorimeter in the CRESST setup at the Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso (LNGS). Both the primary phonon/heat signal and the simultaneously
emitted scintillation light, which is absorbed in a separate
silicon-on-sapphire light absorber, are measured with highly sensitive
transition edge sensors operated at ~15mK. The unique combination of these
sensors with the light element oxygen present in our target yields sensitivity
to dark matter particle masses as low as 160MeV/c$^2$.

players have continuous control over the degree of contribution, and we examine
the gradualism arising from the free rider effect. This game belongs to the
class of variable concession games which generalize wars of attrition.
Previously known examples of variable concession games in the literature yield
equilibria characterized by singular control strategies without any delay of
concession. However, these no-delay equilibria are in contrast to mixed
strategy equilibria of canonical wars of attrition in which each player delays
concession by a randomized time. We find that a variable contribution game with
a single state variable, which extends the Nerlove-Arrow model, possesses an
equilibrium characterized by regular control strategies that result in a
gradual concession. This equilibrium naturally generalizes the mixed strategy
equilibria from the canonical wars of attrition. Stochasticity of the problem
accentuates the qualitative difference between a singular control solution and
a regular control equilibrium solution. We also find that asymmetry between the
players can mitigate the inefficiency caused by the gradualism.

populations (MPs), are common in almost all Galactic globular clusters.
Recently, MPs have also been detected in a number of massive clusters with ages
in excess of 2 Gyr in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), thus indicating that
age is likely a control parameter for the presence of MPs. However, to
conclusively confirm this notion, additional studies of star clusters in the
LMC's `age gap' of 3--6 Gyr are required. Here, we use {\sl Hubble Space
Telescope} observations to study the 3 Gyr-old cluster NGC 2121. Compared with
so-called `simple' stellar population models, the cluster's red-giant branch
exhibits an apparent spread in a specific color index that is sensitive to
intrinsic chemical spreads. The observed spread can be explained by an
intrinsic spread in nitrogen abundance of $\sim$0.5--1.0 dex}. NGC 2121 has a
comparable mass to its younger counterparts without MPs, indicating that
cluster mass might not be the dominant parameter controlling the presence of
MPs. The transition phase between the occurrence of clusters with or without
MPs seems to occur at ages of 2--3 Gyr, indicating that cluster age may play a
dominant role in the establishment of MPs.

computer games and robotic control tasks. A known problem, though, is that
policies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare,
catastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for
improving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a
set of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common
situations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was
developed, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic
perturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the
expected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or
optimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of
catastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward),
except through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we
introduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using
a risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on
a self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to
model risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that
a risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and
experiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an

several folds. It is striking that a mere adjustment of the network topology

parameter, the system can have either Fermi points (type-I) or Fermi lines
(type-II). In general, there are three different types of disorders for Dirac
fermions in two dimensions, namely, the random scalar potential, the random
vector potentials along and perpendicular to the tilting direction, and the
random mass. We study the effects of weak disorder in terms of the
renormalization group, which is performed by integrating out the modes with
large energies, instead of large momenta. Since the parametrization of the
low-energy degrees of freedom depends on the structure of the Fermi surface,
the resulting one-loop renormalization-group equations depend on the type of
tilted Dirac fermions. Whenever the disorder is a marginal perturbation, we
examine its role on low-energy physics by a mean-field approximation of the
replica field theory or the first-order Born approximation. Based on our
analysis, we suggest the phase diagrams of a two-dimensional tilted Dirac
fermion in the presence of different types of disorder.

temporal sequences of words, the data mining algorithm can find a set of
characteristic episodes for all the training data as a whole. The words that

  Predictive Uncertainty: A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ensemble learning is a mainstay in modern data science practice. Conventional
ensemble algorithms assign to base models a set of deterministic, constant
model weights that (1) do not fully account for individual models' varying
accuracy across data subgroups, nor (2) provide uncertainty estimates for the
ensemble prediction. These shortcomings can yield predictions that are precise
but biased, which can negatively impact the performance of the algorithm in
real-word applications. In this work, we present an adaptive, probabilistic
approach to ensemble learning using a transformed Gaussian process as a prior
for the ensemble weights. Given input features, our method optimally combines
base models based on their predictive accuracy in the feature space, and
provides interpretable estimates of the uncertainty associated with both model
selection, as reflected by the ensemble weights, and the overall ensemble
predictions. Furthermore, to ensure that this quantification of the model
uncertainty is accurate, we propose additional machinery to non-parametrically
model the ensemble's predictive cumulative density function (CDF) so that it is
consistent with the empirical distribution of the data. We apply the proposed
method to data simulated from a nonlinear regression model, and to generate a
spatial prediction model and associated prediction uncertainties for fine
particle levels in eastern Massachusetts, USA.

differentiated body to determine the shape, structure, and composition of the
dwarf planet Haumea. Previous studies of Haumea's light curve have suggested
Haumea is a uniform triaxial ellipsoid consistent with a Jacobi ellipsoid with
axes $\approx 960 \times 774 \times 513$ km, and bulk density $\approx 2600 \,
{\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$. In contrast, observations of a recent stellar
occultation by Haumea indicate its axes are $\approx 1161 \times 852 \times
523$ km and its bulk density $\approx 1885 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$; these
results suggest that Haumea cannot be a fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium and
must be partially supported by interparticle forces. We have written a code to
reconcile these contradictory results and to determine if Haumea is in fact a
fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. The code calculates the equilibrium shape,
density, and ice crust thickness of a differentiated Haumea after imposing
(semi-) axes lengths $a$ and $b$. We find Haumea is consistent with a
differentiated triaxial ellipsoid fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium with axes of
best fit $a$ = 1050 km, $b$ = 840 km, and $c$ = 537 km. This solution for
Haumea has $\rho_{\rm avg} = 2018 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$, $\rho_{\rm
core} = 2680 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$, and core axes $a_{\rm c} = 883$ km,
$b_{\rm c} = 723$ km, and $c_{\rm c}=470$ km, which equates to an ice mantle
comprising $\sim 17\%$ of Haumea's volume and ranging from 67 to 167 km in
thickness. The thick ice crust we infer allows for Haumea's collisional family
to represent only a small fraction of Haumea's pre-collisional ice crust. For a
wide range of parameters, the core density we calculate for Haumea suggests
that today the core is composed of hydrated silicates and likely underwent
serpentinization in the past.

methods are trained and evaluated on simulated datasets, where the

degradation (i.e., bicubic downsampling) to their high-resolution (HR)
counterparts. However, the degradations in real-world LR images are far more
complicated. As a consequence, the SISR models trained on simulated data become
less effective when applied to practical scenarios. In this paper, we build a
real-world super-resolution (RealSR) dataset where paired LR-HR images on the
same scene are captured by adjusting the focal length of a digital camera. An
image registration algorithm is developed to progressively align the image
pairs at different resolutions. Considering that the degradation kernels are
naturally non-uniform in our dataset, we present a Laplacian pyramid based

often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms are not easy to deal with
incomplete data. They are usually involved with complicated parameter selection
operations, also sensitive to noise and time-consuming. In this paper, we
reported a new deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data
DPC-CT. It is the tight coupling of the deep learning neural network and DPC-CT
reconstruction algorithm in the phase-contrast projection sinogram domain. The
estimated result is the complete phase-contrast projection sinogram not the
artifacts caused by the incomplete data. After training, this framework is
determined and can reconstruct the final DPC-CT images for a given incomplete

gains two-fold benefit toward higher accuracy for partial re-ID. On the one

thus suppresses the spatial misalignment. Experimental results confirm that our
method significantly improves the learned representation and the achieved
accuracy is on par with the state of the art.

particles (""atoms"") give excellent agreement with the equipartition theorem for
the average energy, but we find that these simulations exhibit finite-size
effects in the dynamics that cause local fluctuations in energy to deviate
significantly from the analogous energy fluctuation relation (EFR). The main
conclusion of our study is that systems separated into nanometer-sized ""blocks""
inside much larger simulations exhibit excess fluctuations in potential energy
(pe) that diverge inversely proportional to T in a manner that is strongly
dependent on the range of interaction. Specifically, at low T with long-range
interactions pe fluctuations exceed the EFR by at least an order of magnitude,
dropping abruptly to below the EFR when interactions include only 1st-neighbor
atoms. A simplistic model that includes 2nd-neighbor interactions matches the
behavior of the excess pe fluctuations, but only if the 2nd-neighbor terms are
not included in Boltzmann's factor, attributable to energy localization due to
anharmonic effects. Characterizing energy correlations as a function of time
and distance reveals that excess pe fluctuations in a block coincide with
negative pe correlations between neighboring blocks, whereas reduced pe
fluctuations coincide with positive pe correlations. Indeed, anomalous pe
fluctuations in small systems at low T can be quantified by using the net
energy in Boltzmann's factor that includes the pe from a surrounding shell of
similarly small systems, or equivalently an effective local temperature. Our
analysis elucidates the source of non-Boltzmann fluctuations, and the need to
include mesoscopic thermal effects from the local environment for a consistent
theoretical description of the equilibrium fluctuations in MD simulations of
standard models with long-range interactions.

concern that can affect efficiency, robustness and pollutant formation. The
focus of this paper is on flame lift-off and re-attachment to the nozzle of a
swirl combustor. Using time-resolved experimental measurements, a data-driven
approach known as cluster-based reduced order modeling (CROM) is employed to 1)
isolate key flow patterns and their sequence during the flame transitions, and
2) formulate a forecasting model to predict the flame instability. The flow
patterns isolated by the CROM methodology confirm some of the experimental
conclusions about the flame transition mechanism. In particular, CROM
highlights the key role of the precessing vortex core (PVC) in the flame
detachment process in an unsupervised manner. For the attachment process,
strong flow recirculation far from the nozzle appears to drive the flame
upstream, thus initiating re-attachment. Different data-types (velocity field,
OH concentration) were processed by the modeling tool, and the predictive
capabilities of these different models are also compared. It was found that the
swirling velocity possesses the best predictive properties, which gives a
supplemental argument for the role of the PVC in causing the flame transition.
The model is tested against unseen data and successfully predicts the
probability of flame transition (both detachment and attachment) when trained
with swirling velocity with minimal user input. The model trained with OH-PLIF
data was only successful at predicting the flame attachment, which implies that
different physical mechanisms are present for different types of flame
transition. Overall, these aspects show the great potential of data-driven
methods, particularly probabilistic forecasting techniques, in analyzing and
predicting large-scale features in complex turbulent combustion problems.

In reality, however, social interaction takes place not only between pairs of
individuals as in the graph model, but rather in the context of multi-user

through a more general hypergraph model, resulting in the need to build
scalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we present MESH, a
flexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH
provides an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that
naturally extends the think like a vertex model common to many popular graph
processing systems. Our framework provides a flexible implementation based on
an underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices for
the key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We
implement MESH on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in
Apache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets and experiments conducted on a
local 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate
that MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics,
as well as scalability with cluster size. We further show that it is
competitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph processing system
based on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about
5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not
come at the cost of performance.

can be conducive to the acceleration of non-thermal electrons, in addition to
the hot, thermal electrons responsible for their X-ray emission through thermal
Comptonization. Here we investigate the mechanism of such particle
acceleration, based on observationally inferred parameters for AGN disk
coronae. One possibility to account for the observed non-thermal electrons is
diffusive shock acceleration, as long as the gyrofactor $\eta_g$ does not
exceed $\sim10^6$. These non-thermal electrons can generate gamma rays via
inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, which can appear in the MeV band,
while those with energies above $\sim100$ MeV would be attenuated via internal
$\gamma\gamma$ pair production. The integrated emission from all AGNs with
thermal and non-thermal Comptonization can reproduce the observed cosmic
background radiation in X-rays as well as gamma-rays up to $\sim 10$ MeV.
Furthermore, if protons are accelerated in the same conditions as electrons and
$\eta_g\sim30$, our observationally motivated model is also able to account for
the diffuse neutrino flux at energies below 100-300 TeV. The next generation of
MeV gamma-ray and neutrino facilities can test these expectations by searching
for signals from bright, nearby Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151 and IC 4329A.

conventional 3D reconstruction techniques gets challenging in participating
media such as murky water, fog, or smoke. We have developed a method that uses
a time-of-flight (ToF) camera to estimate an object region and depth in
participating media simultaneously. The scattering component is saturated, so
it does not depend on the scene depth, and received signals bouncing off
distant points are negligible due to light attenuation in the participating
media, so the observation of such a point contains only a scattering component.
These phenomena enable us to estimate the scattering component in an object
region from a background that only contains the scattering component. The
problem is formulated as robust estimation where the object region is regarded
as outliers, and it enables the simultaneous estimation of an object region and
depth on the basis of an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS)
optimization scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
using captured images from a Kinect v2 in real foggy scenes and evaluate the
applicability with synthesized data.

relates to membrane potential decays shortly after pulsing. Discharge is silent
on molecular or ionic transport, and does not address the fact that tracer
molecule uptake vs time is measure at about 100s after pulsing ceases. Our
critique of AD notes that there can be an association of AD with BPC, but
associations are only necessary, not sufficient. A BPC mechanism hypothesis
must be shown to be causal, able to describe time-dependent molecular influx.
The two hypotheses involve very different time-scales (less than a microsecond
vs 100 s) and very different quantities (volts/s vs molecules/s). Unlike
pore-based hypotheses the AD hypothesis lacks explicit molecular transport
mechanisms, and does not address the greatly delayed measured molecular uptake.
We conclude that AD is an implausible candidate for explaining BPC.

model very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel scene graph
generation algorithm with external knowledge and image reconstruction loss to
overcome these dataset issues. In particular, we extract commonsense knowledge
from the external knowledge base to refine object and phrase features for
improving generalizability in scene graph generation. To address the bias of
noisy object annotations, we introduce an auxiliary image reconstruction path
to regularize the scene graph generation network. Extensive experiments show
that our framework can generate better scene graphs, achieving the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: Visual Relationship
Detection and Visual Genome datasets.

degradation of clustering performance. Due to the powerful ability of deep
feature extraction and non-linear feature representation, the clustering
algorithm based on deep learning has become a hot research topic in the field
of hyperspectral remote sensing. However, most deep clustering algorithms for
hyperspectral images utilize deep neural networks as feature extractor without
considering prior knowledge constraints that are suitable for clustering. To
solve this problem, we propose an intra-class distance constrained deep
clustering algorithm for high-dimensional hyperspectral images. The proposed
algorithm constrains the feature mapping procedure of the auto-encoder network
by intra-class distance so that raw images are transformed from the original
high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional feature space that is more
conducive to clustering. Furthermore, the related learning process is treated
as a joint optimization problem of deep feature extraction and clustering.
Experimental results demonstrate the intense competitiveness of the proposed
algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods of
hyperspectral images.

detection models with weak supervision. However, a single weak supervision
source usually does not contain enough information to train a well-performing
model. To this end, we propose a unified framework to train saliency detection
models with diverse weak supervision sources. In this paper, we use category
labels, captions, and unlabelled data for training, yet other supervision
sources can also be plugged into this flexible framework. We design a
classification network (CNet) and a caption generation network (PNet), which
learn to predict object categories and generate captions, respectively,
meanwhile highlight the most important regions for corresponding tasks. An
attention transfer loss is designed to transmit supervision signal between
networks, such that the network designed to be trained with one supervision
source can benefit from another. An attention coherence loss is defined on
unlabelled data to encourage the networks to detect generally salient regions
instead of task-specific regions. We use CNet and PNet to generate pixel-level
pseudo labels to train a saliency prediction network (SNet). During the testing
phases, we only need SNet to predict saliency maps. Experiments demonstrate the
performance of our method compares favourably against unsupervised and weakly

aligning all palmprint images to a reference image and bringing them to a same

foundational, and representation-theoretic aspects, and key features of this
emerging field on abstract representation theory include the following. First,
generalizing the classical focus on representations over fields, it is
concerned with the study of representations over rings, differential-graded
algebras, ring spectra, and in more general abstract stable homotopy theories.
Second, restricting attention to specific shapes, it offers an explanation of
the axioms of triangulated categories, higher triangulations, and monoidal
triangulations. This has led to fairly general results concerning additivity of
traces. Third, along similar lines of thought it suggests the development of
abstract cubical homotopy theory as an additional calculational toolkit. An
interesting symmetry in this case is given by a global form of Serre duality.
Fourth, abstract tilting equivalences give rise to non-trivial elements in
spectral Picard groupoids and hence contribute to their calculation. And,
finally, it stimulates a deeper digression of the notion of stability itself,
leading to various characterizations and relative versions of stability.

introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects

the study of phase coexistence or the roughening of an interface. Here we show,
instead, that when the thermodynamic limit is taken with these boundary

transition temperature) without breaking neither ergodicity nor symmetry. Then,
the low temperature phase is characterized by a regime (condensation) of strong

This is due to critical correlations perduring for all T below Tc. The argument
is developed exactly in the $d=1$ case and numerically in the d=2 case.

with its NP-completeness nature, another important challenge is effective
modeling of the node-wise and structure-wise affinity across graphs and the
resulting objective, to guide the matching procedure effectively finding the
true matching against noises. To this end, this paper devises an end-to-end
differentiable deep network pipeline to learn the affinity for graph matching.
It involves a supervised permutation loss regarding with node correspondence to
capture the combinatorial nature for graph matching. Meanwhile deep graph
embedding models are adopted to parameterize both intra-graph and cross-graph
affinity functions, instead of the traditional shallow and simple parametric
forms e.g. a Gaussian kernel. The embedding can also effectively capture the
higher-order structure beyond second-order edges. The permutation loss model is
agnostic to the number of nodes, and the embedding model is shared among nodes
such that the network allows for varying numbers of nodes in graphs for
training and inference. Moreover, our network is class-agnostic with some
generalization capability across different categories. All these features are
welcomed for real-world applications. Experiments show its superiority against
state-of-the-art graph matching learning methods.

leverage the fictitious play property of the mean-field games, and the deep
reinforcement learning technique to learn the stationary solution of the game,
in a completely distributed fashion. We analytically show that the proposed
procedure converges to the unique stationary solution of the MFG. This, in
turn, ensures that the optimal policies can be learned in a completely

mitigation by impurity injection may significantly increase the runaway

increased number of target electrons available for the avalanche process in
weakly ionized plasmas, which is only partially compensated by the increased
friction force on fast electrons. We derive an expression for the avalanche
growth rate in partially ionized plasmas and investigate the effects of
impurity injection on the avalanche multiplication factor and on the final
runaway current for ITER-like parameters. For impurity densities relevant for
disruption mitigation, the maximum amplification of a runaway seed can be
increased by tens of orders of magnitude compared to previous predictions. This
motivates careful studies to determine the required densities and impurity

from the hot CNO cycle in Type I x-ray bursts. Understanding the properties of
resonances between $E_x = 4$ and 5 MeV in $^{19}$Ne is crucial in the
calculation of this reaction rate. The spins and parities of these states are
well known, with the exception of the 4.14- and 4.20-MeV states, which have
adopted spin-parities of 9/2$^-$ and 7/2$^-$, respectively. Gamma-ray
transitions from these states were studied using triton-$\gamma$-$\gamma$
coincidences from the $^{19}$F($^{3}$He,$t\gamma$)$^{19}$Ne reaction measured
with GODDESS (Gammasphere ORRUBA Dual Detectors for Experimental Structure
Studies) at Argonne National Laboratory. The observed transitions from the
4.14- and 4.20-MeV states provide strong evidence that the $J^\pi$ values are
actually 7/2$^-$ and 9/2$^-$, respectively. These assignments are consistent
with the values in the $^{19}$F mirror nucleus and in contrast to previously
accepted assignments.

variety of fields, there is an increasing interest in understanding the complex

Propagation (RAP), which decomposes the output predictions of DNNs with a new
perspective of separating the relevant (positive) and irrelevant (negative)
attributions according to the relative influence between the layers. The
relevance of each neuron is identified with respect to its degree of
contribution, separated into positive and negative, while preserving the
conservation rule. Considering the relevance assigned to neurons in terms of
relative priority, RAP allows each neuron to be assigned with a bi-polar
importance score concerning the output: from highly relevant to highly
irrelevant. Therefore, our method makes it possible to interpret DNNs with much
clearer and attentive visualizations of the separated attributions than the
conventional explaining methods. To verify that the attributions propagated by
RAP correctly account for each meaning, we utilize the evaluation metrics: (i)
Outside-inside relevance ratio, (ii) Segmentation mIOU and (iii) Region
perturbation. In all experiments and metrics, we present a sizable gap in
comparison to the existing literature. Our source code is available in

most important discoveries in condensed matter physics, and results in abrupt
orbital transitions from the insulating to metallic phases by elevating
temperature across a critical point (TMIT). Although the MIT was previously
expected to be mainly driven by the orbital Coulomb repulsion energy, the
entropy contribution to the orbital free energy that also determines the
relative stability of the metallic and insulating phases was largely
overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate an orbital-entropy dominated reversible
electronic phase transition in the metastable perovskite family of correlated
rare-earth nicklates (ReNiO3), in addition to their previously known MIT driven
by orbital Coulomb energies. In reverse to MIT, the resistivity of ReNiO3
abruptly increases by 2-3 orders by elevating T across another critical point
(TR-MIT) below TMIT, and such transition is named as reverse-metal to insulator
transition (R-MIT). Combining the afterwards exponentially decreasing
resistivity in the insulating phase of ReNiO3 at further temperature elevation,
a distinguished delta-temperatural transport character is established, which is
potentially applicable for locking the working temperatures range for electric
devices. The TR-MIT is shown to be enhanced via reducing the compositional
complexity and size of Re or imparting bi-axial compressive strains, and
meanwhile the transition sharpness of delta-temperatural transport is reduced.
Our discovery indicates that temperature range for a thermodynamically stable
insulating phase of ReNiO3 is in between of TR-MIT and TMIT, while a new
conductive phase with high orbital entropy is formed by further descending
temperature below TR-MIT.

crystalline superconductors, whose microscopic origin is still under debate.
Here, we unveil a new aspect of the vortex dynamics in a noncentrosymmetric 2D
crystalline superconductor of MoS$_{2}$ through the nonreciprocal transport
measurement. The second harmonic resistance $R^{2w}$ at low temperature with
high current indicates the classical vortex flow accompanying the ratchet
motion. Furthermore, we found that $R^{2w}$ is substantially suppressed in the
quantum metallic state with low current region, allowing identification of the
quantum and classical ratchet motions of vortices by the magnitude of the
second harmonic generation. This suggests that nonreciprocal transport
measurement can be a powerful tool to probe the vortex dynamics in
noncentrosymmetric 2D superconductors.

linear-time sequential access-- the proposed system uses a set of parsing
items, with constant-time random access. This change makes it possible to
construct any discontinuous constituency tree in exactly $4n - 2$ transitions
for a sentence of length $n$. At each parsing step, the parser considers every
item in the set to be combined with a focus item and to construct a new
constituent in a bottom-up fashion. The parsing strategy is based on the
assumption that most syntactic structures can be parsed incrementally and that
the set --the memory of the parser-- remains reasonably small on average.
Moreover, we introduce a provably correct dynamic oracle for the new transition
system, and present the first experiments in discontinuous constituency parsing
using a dynamic oracle. Our parser obtains state-of-the-art results on three

trajectory for every initial condition) satisfying the classical semiflow
property. Moreover, the selection respects the well accepted admissibility
criteria for physical solutions, namely, maximization of the entropy production
rate and the weak--strong uniqueness principle. Consequently, strong solutions
are always selected whenever they exist and stationary states are stable and
included in the selection as well. To this end, we introduce a notion of
dissipative solution, which is given by a triple of density, momentum and total
entropy defined as expectations of a suitable measure--valued solution.

size of the LV change significantly in a cardiac cycle. In this work, we
propose a temporal affine network (TAN) to perform image analysis in a warped
image space, where the shape and size variations due to the cardiac motion as
well as other artifacts are largely compensated. Furthermore, we perform three
frequent echocardiogram interpretation tasks simultaneously: standard cardiac
plane recognition, LV landmark detection, and LV segmentation. Instead of using
three networks with one dedicating to each task, we use a multi-task network to
perform three tasks simultaneously. Since three tasks share the same encoder,
the compact network improves the segmentation accuracy with more supervision.
The network is further finetuned with optical flow adjusted annotations to
enhance motion coherence in the segmentation result. Experiments on 1,714 2D
echocardiographic sequences demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy with real-time efficiency.

These failures stem from the intrinsic difficulty of single image reflection

context encoding modules that are capable of leveraging high-level contextual
clues to reduce indeterminacy within areas containing strong reflections. For
the latter, we introduce an alignment-invariant loss function that facilitates
exploiting misaligned real-world training data that is much easier to collect.
Experimental results collectively show that our method outperforms the

freshness of information from the UE's perspective in a communication network.
Recently, Kadota et al. [1] have proposed an index-type approximately optimal
scheduling policy for minimizing the average-AoI metric for a downlink
transmission problem. For delay-sensitive applications, including real-time
control of a cyber-physical system, or scheduling URLLC traffic in 5G, it is
essential to have a more stringent uniform control on AoI across all users. In
this paper, we derive an exactly optimal scheduling policy for this problem in
a downlink cellular system with erasure channels. Our proof of optimality
involves an explicit solution to the associated average-cost Bellman Equation,
which might be of independent theoretical interest. We also establish that the
resulting Age-process is positive recurrent under the optimal policy, and has
an exponentially light tail, with the optimal large-deviation exponent.
Finally, motivated by typical applications in small-cell residential networks,
we consider the problem of minimizing the peak-AoI with throughput constraints
to specific UEs, and derive a heuristic policy for this problem. Extensive
numerical simulations have been carried out to compare the efficacy of the
proposed policies with other well-known scheduling policies, such as Randomized
scheduling and Proportional Fair.

management of the traffic-sign inventory. It provides accurate and timely way
to manage traffic-sign inventory with a minimal human effort. In the computer
vision community the recognition and detection of traffic signs is a
well-researched problem. A vast majority of existing approaches perform well on
traffic signs needed for advanced drivers-assistance and autonomous systems.
However, this represents a relatively small number of all traffic signs (around
50 categories out of several hundred) and performance on the remaining set of
traffic signs, which are required to eliminate the manual labor in traffic-sign
inventory management, remains an open question. In this paper, we address the
issue of detecting and recognizing a large number of traffic-sign categories
suitable for automating traffic-sign inventory management. We adopt a
convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, the Mask R-CNN, to address the
full pipeline of detection and recognition with automatic end-to-end learning.
We propose several improvements that are evaluated on the detection of traffic
signs and result in an improved overall performance. This approach is applied
to detection of 200 traffic-sign categories represented in our novel dataset.
Results are reported on highly challenging traffic-sign categories that have
not yet been considered in previous works. We provide comprehensive analysis of
the deep learning method for the detection of traffic signs with large
intra-category appearance variation and show below 3% error rates with the
proposed approach, which is sufficient for deployment in practical applications

the influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on above-mentioned quantities.
We find, that in the scalar-relativistic case (without SOC), electronic
structure and electron-phonon interaction show the quasi-two dimensional
character. Strong Fermi surface nesting is present, which leads to appearance
of the Kohn anomaly in the phonon spectrum and enhanced electron-phonon
coupling for the phonons propagating in the Ca-Bi atomic layers. However,
strong spin-orbit coupling in this material changes the topology of the Fermi
surface, reduces the nesting and the electron-phonon coupling becomes weaker
and more isotropic. The electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda$ is reduced
by SOC almost twice, from 0.94 to 0.54, giving even stronger effect on the
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, which drops from 5.2~K (without
SOC) to 1.3~K (with SOC). Relativistic values of $\lambda$ and $T_c$ remain in
a good agreement with experimental findings, confirming the general need for
including SOC in analysis of the electron-phonon interaction in materials
containing heavy elements.

finds small planets that have previously been missed. We showcase TLS'
capabilities using the K2 EVEREST-detrended light curve of the star K2-32
(EPIC205071984) that was known to have three transiting planets. TLS detects
these known Neptune-sized planets K2-32b, d, and c in an iterative search and
finds an additional transit signal with a high signal detection efficiency
(SDE_TLS) of 26.1 at a period of 4.34882 (-0.00075, +0.00069) d. We show that
this signal remains detectable (SDE_TLS = 13.2) with TLS in the K2SFF light
curve of K2-32, which includes a less optimal detrending of the systematic
trends. The signal is below common detection thresholds, however, if searched
with BLS in the K2SFF light curve (SDE_BLS = 8.9) as in previous searches.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling shows that the radius of this candidate is
1.01 (-0.09, +0.10) Earth radii. We analyze its phase-folded transit light
curve using the vespa software and calculate a false positive probability FPP =
3.1e-3, formally validating K2-32e as a planet. Taking into account the
multiplicity boost of the system, FPP < 3.1e-4. K2-32 now hosts at least four
planets that are very close to a 1:2:5:7 mean motion resonance chain. The
offset of the orbital periods of K2-32e and b from a 1:2 mean motion resonance
is in very good agreement with the sample of transiting multi-planet systems
from Kepler, lending further credence to the planetary nature of K2-32e. We
expect that TLS can find many more transits of Earth-sized and smaller planets
in the Kepler data that have hitherto remained undetected with BLS and similar
algorithms.

loss of molecules occupying their rotational and hyperfine ground state is best
described by second-order rate equations, consistent with the expectation for
complex-mediated collisions, but that the rate is lower than the limit of
universal loss. The loss is insensitive to magnetic field but increases for
excited rotational states. We demonstrate that dipolar effects lead to
significantly faster loss for an incoherent mixture of rotational states.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) requires large labeled data, significant
hyper-parameter tuning effort and expertise, and high computational resources.
In this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address
these issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series.
We consider two scenarios for transfer learning using RNNs: i)
domain-adaptation, i.e., leveraging a deep RNN - namely, TimeNet - pre-trained
for feature extraction on time series from diverse domains, and adapting it for
feature extraction and subsequent target tasks in healthcare domain, ii)
task-adaptation, i.e., pre-training a deep RNN - namely, HealthNet - on diverse
tasks in healthcare domain, and adapting it to new target tasks in the same
domain. We evaluate the above approaches on publicly available MIMIC-III
benchmark dataset, and demonstrate that (a) computationally-efficient linear
models trained using features extracted via pre-trained RNNs outperform or, in
the worst case, perform as well as deep RNNs and statistical hand-crafted
features based models trained specifically for target task; (b) models obtained
by adapting pre-trained models for target tasks are significantly more robust
to the size of labeled data compared to task-specific RNNs, while also being
computationally efficient. We, therefore, conclude that pre-trained deep models
like TimeNet and HealthNet allow leveraging the advantages of deep learning for
clinical time series analysis tasks, while also minimize dependence on
hand-crafted features, deal robustly with scarce labeled training data
scenarios without overfitting, as well as reduce dependence on expertise and
resources required to train deep networks from scratch.

development, the growth of tissue, and limb regeneration. As a result,
mechanisms for incorporating it into traditional models for cell movement,
interaction, and proliferation are of great importance. A previously well-used
method in order to incorporate domain growth into on-lattice reaction-diffusion
models causes a build up of particles on the boundaries of the domain, which is
particularly evident when diffusion is low in comparison to the rate of domain
growth. Here, we present a new method which addresses this unphysical build up
of particles at the boundaries, and demonstrate that it is accurate even for
scenarios in which the previous method fails. Further, we discuss for which
parameter regimes it is feasible to continue using the original method due to
diffusion dominating the domain growth mechanism.

quality, high dynamic range Stokes images of the observed sky from the
corresponding under-sampled Fourier domain measurements. In practice, these
measurements are contaminated by the instrumental and atmospheric effects that
are well represented by Jones matrices, and are most often varying with
observation direction and time. These effects, usually unknown, act as a
limiting factor in achieving the required imaging performance and thus, their
calibration is crucial. To address this issue, we develop a global algorithm,
named Polca SARA, aiming to perform full polarization, direction-dependent
calibration and sparse imaging by employing a non-convex optimization
technique. In contrast with the existing approaches, the proposed method offers
global convergence guarantees and flexibility to incorporate sophisticated
priors to regularize the imaging as well as the calibration problem. Thus, we
adapt a polarimetric imaging specific method, enforcing the physical
polarization constraint along with a sparsity prior for the sought images. We
perform extensive simulation studies of the proposed algorithm. While
indicating the superior performance of polarization constraint based imaging,
the obtained results also highlight the importance of calibrating for
direction-dependent effects as well as for off-diagonal terms (denoting
polarization leakage) in the associated Jones matrices, without inclusion of
which the imaging quality deteriorates.

optimization of rate-distortion performance. Most existing methods adopt
spatially invariant bit length allocation and incorporate discrete entropy
approximation to constrain compression rate. Nonetheless, the information
content is spatially variant, where the regions with complex and salient
structures generally are more essential to image compression. Taking the
spatial variation of image content into account, this paper presents a
content-weighted encoder-decoder model, which involves an importance map subnet
to produce the importance mask for locally adaptive bit rate allocation.
Consequently, the summation of importance mask can thus be utilized as an
alternative of entropy estimation for compression rate control. Furthermore,
the quantized representations of the learned code and importance map are still
spatially dependent, which can be losslessly compressed using arithmetic
coding. To compress the codes effectively and efficiently, we propose a trimmed
convolutional network to predict the conditional probability of quantized
codes. Experiments show that the proposed method can produce visually much
better results, and performs favorably in comparison with deep and traditional
lossy image compression approaches.

effective core potentials). Taking the water molecule as an example, we
investigate the influence of Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg (BFD) pseudopotentials and
their associated basis sets on vertical excitation energies obtained with sCI
and FN-DMC methods. Although these pseudopotentials are known to be relatively
safe for ground state properties, we evidence that special care may be required

comparing all-electron and valence-only calculations, we show that using

adversarial network based on existing datasets of time-lapse videos and image
sequences. We propose a multi-frame joint conditional generation framework to
effectively learn the correlation between the illumination change of an outdoor
scene and the time of the day. We further present a multi-domain training
scheme for robust training of our generative models from two datasets with
different distributions and missing timestamp labels. Compared to alternative
time-lapse video synthesis algorithms, our method uses the timestamp as the
control variable and does not require a reference video to guide the synthesis
of the final output. We conduct ablation studies to validate our algorithm and
compare with state-of-the-art techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively.

vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological research studies.
Currently, measurements are often still obtained from manual segmentations on
brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure. Automatic WMH segmentation
methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods
is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could
evaluate their method on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset,
giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge
(https://wmh.isi.uu.nl/).
  Sixty T1+FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with manual WMH
segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was
used for evaluation. Segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted
to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the
methods: (1) Dice similarity coefficient, (2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th
percentile), (3) absolute log-transformed volume difference, (4) sensitivity
for detecting individual lesions, and (5) F1-score for individual lesions.
Additionally, methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness.
  Twenty participants submitted their method for evaluation. This paper
provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of
four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one
clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all methods
generalize to unseen scanners.
  The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public
platform for method evaluation.

training over-parameterized neural networks (where the network size is larger
than what is needed to achieve low error). The key insight is that with
sufficient over-parameterization, gradient-based methods will implicitly leave
some components of the network relatively unchanged, so the optimization
dynamics will behave as if those components are essentially fixed at their
initial random values. In fact, fixing these explicitly leads to the well-known
approach of learning with random features. In other words, these techniques
imply that we can successfully learn with neural networks, whenever we can
successfully learn with random features. In this paper, we first review these
techniques, providing a simple and self-contained analysis for one-hidden-layer
networks. We then argue that despite the impressive positive results, random
feature approaches are also inherently limited in what they can explain. In
particular, we rigorously show that random features cannot be used to learn
even a single ReLU neuron with standard Gaussian inputs, unless the network
size (or magnitude of the weights) is exponentially large. Since a single
neuron is learnable with gradient-based methods, we conclude that we are still
far from a satisfying general explanation for the empirical success of neural
networks.

questions their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose a
randomized diversification as a defense strategy. We introduce a multi-channel
architecture in a gray-box scenario, which assumes that the architecture of the
classifier and the training data set are known to the attacker. The attacker
does not only have access to a secret key and to the internal states of the
system at the test time. The defender processes an input in multiple channels.
Each channel introduces its own randomization in a special transform domain
based on a secret key shared between the training and testing stages. Such a
transform based randomization with a shared key preserves the gradients in
key-defined sub-spaces for the defender but it prevents gradient back
propagation and the creation of various bypass systems for the attacker. An
additional benefit of multi-channel randomization is the aggregation that fuses
soft-outputs from all channels, thus increasing the reliability of the final
score. The sharing of a secret key creates an information advantage to the
defender. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an increased robustness of the
proposed method to a number of known state-of-the-art attacks.

the algorithm is to efficiently maintain a proper coloring of the intervals

The problem is closely connected to the online vertex coloring problem of

best possible competitive ratio. We first show that a sub-quadratic time direct
implementation of the KT-algorithm is unlikely to exist conditioned on the
correctness of the Online Boolean Matrix Vector multiplication conjecture due

structure maintains a proper coloring in amortized $O(\log n + \Delta)$ update
time where $n$ is the total number of intervals inserted and $\Delta$ is the

galaxies can differ depending on their surrounding environments. In order to
investigate how galaxies grow their structures and what physical processes are
involved in the evolution of galaxies, one requires spatially resolved images
of not only stellar components but also star-forming regions within galaxies.
We conducted the Adaptive Optics(AO)-assisted imaging observations for
star-forming galaxies in a dense proto-cluster core at $z=2.53$ with IRCS and
AO188 mounted on the Subaru Telescope. A combination of AO and narrow-band
filters allows us to obtain resolved maps of H$\alpha$-emitting regions with an
angular resolution of 0.1--0.2~arcsec, which corresponds to $\sim1$ kpc at
$z\sim2.5$. Based on stacking analyses, we compare radial profiles of
star-forming regions and stellar components and find that the star-forming
region of a sub-sample with $\rm log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim10-11$ is more extended
than the stellar component, indicating the inside-out growth of the structure.
This trend is similar to the one for star-forming galaxies in general fields at
$z=2-2.5$ obtained with the same observational technique. Our results suggest
that the structural evolution of star-forming galaxies at $z=2-2.5$ is mainly
driven by internal secular processes irrespective of surrounding environments.

  https://pqhieu.github.io/cvpr19.html",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning techniques have become the to-go models for most vision-related
tasks on 2D images. However, their power has not been fully realised on several
tasks in 3D space, e.g., 3D scene understanding. In this work, we jointly
address the problems of semantic and instance segmentation of 3D point clouds.
Specifically, we develop a multi-task pointwise network that simultaneously
performs two tasks: predicting the semantic classes of 3D points and embedding
the points into high-dimensional vectors so that points of the same object
instance are represented by similar embeddings. We then propose a multi-value
conditional random field model to incorporate the semantic and instance labels
and formulate the problem of semantic and instance segmentation as jointly
optimising labels in the field model. The proposed method is thoroughly
evaluated and compared with existing methods on different indoor scene datasets
including S3DIS and SceneNN. Experimental results showed the robustness of the
proposed joint semantic-instance segmentation scheme over its single
components. Our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance on semantic
segmentation.

antiferromagnet/ferromagnet/oxide heterostructure films where skyrmions can be
stabilized without any external magnetic field due to the presence of exchange
bias. These isolated skyrmions were annihilated by applying a voltage pulse
that increased PMA. On the other hand, decreasing PMA promoted formation of
more skyrmions. Furthermore, skyrmions can be created from chiral domains by
increasing PMA of the system. To corroborate our experimental observations, we
performed micromagnetic simulation. The proposed method could potentially lead
to novel skyrmion-based memory devices.

regularized amplitudes, providing a recipe for constructing simple and general
polarized amplitude projectors in D dimensions that avoids conventional Lorentz
tensor decomposition and avoids also dimensional splitting. Because of the
latter, commutation between Lorentz index contraction and loop integration is
preserved within this prescription, which entails certain technical advantages.
The usage of these D-dimensional polarized amplitude projectors results in
helicity amplitudes that can be expressed solely in terms of external momenta,
but different from those defined in the existing dimensional regularization
schemes. Furthermore, we argue that despite being different from the
conventional dimensional regularization scheme (CDR), owing to the
amplitude-level factorization of ultraviolet and infrared singularities, our
prescription can be used, within an infrared subtraction framework, in a hybrid
way without re-calculating the (process-independent) integrated subtraction
coefficients, many of which are available in CDR. This hybrid CDR-compatible
prescription is shown to be unitary. We include two examples to demonstrate
this explicitly and also to illustrate its usage in practice.

enough to allow complete rulesets for these calculi to be expressed in around

networking systems through simplifying the process of network management and
reducing the cost of network configuration. Currently, the management of
failures in the data plane is limited to two mechanisms: proactive and
reactive. Such failure recovery techniques are activated after occurrences of
failures. Therefore, packet loss is highly likely to occur as a result of
service disruption and unavailability. This issue is not only related to the
slow speed of recovery mechanisms, but also the delay caused by the failure
detection process. In this paper, we define a new approach to the management of
fault tolerance in software-defined networks where the goal is to eliminate the
convergence process altogether, rather than speed up failure detection and
recovery. We propose a new framework, called Smart Routing, which works based
on the forewarning signs on failures in order to compute alternative paths and
isolate the risky links from the routing tables of the data plane devices. We
validate our framework through a set of experiments that demonstrate how the

superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, of the in-plane electrical
conductivity, magnetoconductivity and magnetization, including the low and
moderate magnetic field regimes, in a high-quality single crystal and a thin
film of the prototypical optimally-doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (OPT
Y-123), in which the inhomogeneity effects are minimized. Then, it is presented
a comparison of these experimental data with the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approach that takes into account the unavoidable
contribution of the fluctuating pairs, the only theoretical scenario allowing
at present to analyze these roundings at the quantitative level. These analyses
demonstrate that the measured rounding effects around $T_c$ may be explained
quantitative and consistently in terms of the GL scenario, even up to the
rounding onset temperatures if the quantum localization, associated with the
shrinkage of the superconducting wavefunction, is taken into account. The
implications of our results on the pseudogap physics of optimally-doped
cuprates are also discussed.

we prove that if one of the permutations is invariant under conjugation and

starting from their birthplace in a massive trans-Neptunian disk that was
dispersed by migrating giant planets. Most comets that remain bound to the
Solar system are stored in the Oort cloud. Galactic tides and passing stars
make some of these bodies evolve into observable comets in the inner Solar
system. Our approach models each step in a full-fledged numerical framework.
Subsequent analysis consists of applying plausible fading models and computing
the original orbits to compare with observations. Our results match the
observed semimajor axis distribution of LPCs when Whipple's power-law fading
scheme with an exponent $\kappa= 0.6^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ is adopted. The cumulative
perihelion ($q$) distribution is fit well by a linear increase plus a weak
quadratic term. Beyond $q = 15$~au, however, the population increases steeply
and the isotropy of LPC orbital planes breaks. We find tentative evidence from
the perihelion distribution of LPCs that the returning comets are depleted in
supervolatiles and become active due to water ice sublimation for $q\leq 3$ au.
Using an independent calibration of the population of the initial disk, our
predicted LPC flux is smaller than observations suggest by a factor of $\simeq
2$. Current data only characterize comets from the outer Oort cloud (semimajor
axes $\gtrsim 10^4$~au). A true boost in understanding the Oort cloud's
structure should result from future surveys when they detect LPCs with
perihelia beyond $15$~au. Our results provide observational predictions of what
can be expected from these new data.

problem already discussed by M. Gromov in 1983, who proposed an argument toward

developed by P. A. White and others by the 1950s. We propose to study the
problem of systolically extremal metrics in the context of generalized metrics
of nonpositive curvature. A natural approach would be to work in the class of
Alexandrov surfaces of finite total curvature, where one can exploit the tools
of the completion provided in the context of Radon measures as studied by
Reshetnyak and others. However the generalized metrics in this sense still
don't have enough regularity. Instead, we develop a more hands-on approach and
show that, for each genus, every systolically extremal nonpositively curved
surface is piecewise flat with finitely many conical singularities. This result
exploits a decomposition of the surface into flat systolic bands and
nonsystolic polygonal regions, as well as the combinatorial/topological
estimates of Malestein-Rivin-Theran, Przytycki, Aougab-Biringer-Gaster and
Greene on the number of curves meeting at most once, combined with a kite
excision move. The move merges pairs of conical singularities on a surface of

weighing scale because of the complexity and similarity. In this paper, a fruit
recognition system using CNN is proposed. The proposed method uses deep
learning techniques for the classification. We have used Fruits-360 dataset for
the evaluation purpose. From the dataset, we have established a dataset which
contains 17,823 images from 25 different categories. The images are divided
into training and test dataset. Moreover, for the classification accuracies, we
have used various combinations of hidden layer and epochs for different cases
and made a comparison between them. The overall performance losses of the
network for different cases also observed. Finally, we have achieved the best
test accuracy of 100% and a training accuracy of 99.79%.

$SO(4)$. As the 3-sphere is a group, both left and right multiplication on
itself are commuting symmetries which together generate the full symmetry
group. This gives rise to a notion of left and right momenta for the problem,
and allows for a reduction in stages, first by the left and then the right, or
vice versa. The intermediate reduced spaces obtained by left or right reduction
are shown to be coadjoint orbits of the special Euclidean group $SE(4)$. The
full reduced spaces are generically 4-dimensional and we describe these spaces

  The dynamics of the 2-body problem descend through a double cover to give a
dynamical system on $SO(4)$, which after reduction is the same as that of a
4-dimensional spinning top with symmetry. This connection allows us to `hit two
birds with one stone' and derive results about both the spinning top and the

cloud computing. This is a challenging problem as a cloud service provider may
have insufficient resources to satisfy all user requests. Furthermore,
allocating available resources optimally to different applications is also
challenging. Resource sharing among different cloud service providers can
improve resource availability and resource utilization as certain cloud service
providers may have free resources available that can be ``rented'' by other
service providers. However, different cloud service providers can have
different objectives or \emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for a
framework that can share and allocate resources in an efficient and effective
way, while taking into account the objectives of various service providers that
results in a \emph{multi-objective optimization} problem. In this paper, we
present a \emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT) based framework for resource
sharing and allocation among different service providers with varying
objectives that form a coalition. We show that the resource sharing problem can
be modeled as an $N-$player \emph{canonical} cooperative game with
\emph{non-transferable utility} (NTU) and prove that the game is convex for
monotonic non-decreasing utilities. We propose an $\mathcal{O}({N})$ algorithm
that provides an allocation from the \emph{core}, hence guaranteeing
\emph{Pareto optimality}. We evaluate the performance of our proposed resource
sharing framework in a number of simulation settings and show that our proposed
framework improves user satisfaction and utility of service providers.

of holes from a doped Mott insulator to such a band results in a drop of

thus be produced by dipolar excitations. Using nonequilibrium dynamical mean

system model of identical clients communicating via message passing. The first
problem that we consider is Liveness Verification. It asks whether there is a
computation such that one of the clients visits a final state infinitely often.
The complexity of the problem has been open since 2010 when it was shown to be
P-hard and solvable in EXPSPACE. We close the gap by a polynomial-time
algorithm. The algorithm relies on a characterization of live computations in
terms of paths in a suitable graph, combined with a fixed-point iteration to
efficiently check the existence of such paths. The second problem is Fair
Liveness Verification. It asks for a computation where all participating
clients visit a final state infinitely often. We adjust the algorithm to also
solve fair liveness in polynomial time.
  Both problems can be instrumented to answer model checking questions for
broadcast networks against linear time temporal logic specifications. The first
problem in this context is Fair Model Checking. It demands that for all
computations of a broadcast network, all participating clients satisfy the
specification. We solve the problem via the Vardi-Wolper construction and a
reduction to Liveness Verification. The second problem is Sparse Model
Checking. It asks whether each computation has a participating client that
satisfies the specification. We reduce the problem to Fair Liveness
Verification.

allowing for the transfer matrix to be diagonalizable with simple spectrum.
These SoV basis are then used to completely characterize the transfer matrix
spectrum for the rank one and two reflection algebras. The rank one case is
developed for both the rational and trigonometric fundamental representations
of the 6-vertex reflection algebra. On the one hand, we extend the complete
spectrum characterization to representations previously lying outside the SoV
approach, e.g. those for which the standard Algebraic Bethe Ansatz applies. On
the other hand, we show that our new SoV construction can be reduced to the
generalized Sklyanin's one whenever it is applicable. The rank two case is
developed explicitly for the fundamental representations of the $Y(gl_3)$
reflection algebra associated to general integrable boundary conditions. For
both rank one and two our SoV approach leads to a complete characterization of
the transfer matrix spectrum in terms of a set of polynomial solutions to the
corresponding quantum spectral curve equation. Those are finite difference
functional equations of order equal to the rank plus one, i.e., here two and
three respectively for the $Y(gl_2)$ and $Y(gl_3)$ reflection algebras.

synchronously with the magnetic field, and a stable precession torque is
available and drives the DW motion with a steady velocity. In large frequency
region, the DW only oscillates around its equilibrium position and cannot

differentiating the two motion modes on several parameters are investigated in

composed of matrix games indexed by the state, the value of the incomplete

interaction terms that give {\it real} spectra. Such interacting systems could
describe new physics. The simplest non-Hermitian Lagrangian density is
$L=L_0+L_{int}=\bar\psi(i\not\partial-m)\psi-g\bar\psi\gamma^5\psi$. The
associated relativistic Dirac equation is PT invariant in 1+1 dimensions and
the associated Hamiltonian commutes with PT. However, the dispersion relation
$p^2=m^2-g^2$ shows that the PT symmetry is broken in the chiral limit $m\to0$.
For interactions $L_{int}=-g(\bar\psi\gamma^5\psi)^N$ with N=2,3, if the
associated Dirac equation is PT invariant, the dispersion relation gives
complex energies as $m\to0$. Other models are studied in which x-dependent
PT-symmetric potentials such as $ix^3$, $-x^4$, $i\kappa/x$, Hulth\'en, or
periodic potentials are coupled to $\psi$ and the classical trajectories plane
are examined. Some combinations of these potentials give a real spectrum. In
3+1 dimensions, the simplest system
$L=L_0+L_{int}=\bar\psi(i\not\partial-m)\psi-g\bar\psi\gamma^5\psi$ resembles
the 1+1-dimensional case but the Dirac equation is not PT invariant because
$T^2=-1$. This explains the appearance of complex eigenvalues as $m\to0$. Other
Lorentz-invariant 2-point and 4-point interactions give non-Hermitian
PT-symmetric terms in the Dirac equation. Only the axial vector and tensor
Lagrangian interactions $L_{int}=-i\bar\psi\tilde B_\mu\gamma^5\gamma^\mu\psi$
and $L_{int}=-i\bar\psi T_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\psi$ fulfil both requirements
of PT invariance of the associated Dirac equation and non-Hermiticity. Both
models give complex spectra as $m\to0$. The effect on the spectrum of the
additional constraint of selfadjointness of the Hamiltonian with respect to the
PT inner product is investigated.

a scalar field whose present-day value is controlled by a coupling to the
neutrino sector. The behaviour of the scalar field depends on three functions:
a kinetic function, the scalar field potential, and the scalar field-neutrino
coupling function. We present an analytic treatment of the background evolution
during radiation- and matter-domination for exponential and inverse power law
potentials, and find a relaxation of constraints compared to previous work on
the amount of early dark energy in the exponential case. We then carry out a
numerical analysis of the background cosmology for both types of potential and
various illustrative choices of the kinetic and coupling functions. By applying
bounds from Planck on the amount of early dark energy, we are able to constrain
the magnitude of the kinetic function at early times.

them by adding minuscule perturbations to the input images. The robustness of
existing defenses suffers greatly under white-box attack settings, where an
adversary has full knowledge about the network and can iterate several times to
find strong perturbations. We observe that the main reason for the existence of
such perturbations is the close proximity of different class samples in the
learned feature space. This allows model decisions to be totally changed by
adding an imperceptible perturbation in the inputs. To counter this, we propose
to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep
networks. Specifically, we force the features for each class to lie inside a
convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other
classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant
decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the
features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the
strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance
on clean images. We report extensive evaluations in both black-box and
white-box attack scenarios and show significant gains in comparison to
state-of-the art defenses.

subpopulations in microbial communities are believed to be important to
dispersal, quest for food, and material transport. However, except in
circumstances where motile cells drive colony expansion (e.g. bacterial
swarming), the physiological functions of motile subpopulations in bacterial
communities are largely unclear. Here we discovered that motile cells in
routinely cultured sessile colonies of peritrichously flagellated bacteria can
self-organize into two adjacent, centimeter-scale motile rings surrounding the
entire colony. The motile rings arise from spontaneous segregation of a
homogeneous swimmer suspension that mimics a phase separation; the process is
mediated by intercellular interactions and shear-induced depletion. As a result
of this self-organization, cells drive fluid flows to circulate around the
colony at a constant peak speed of approximately 30 microns per second,
providing a stable and high-speed avenue for directed material transport at the
macroscopic scale. These findings present a unique form of bacterial
self-organization that influences population structure and material

we invert this paradigm: by introducing particular control ""errors"" in standard

while introducing the capabilities of quantum state readout and polarisation
transfer. We exploit this nuclear quantum state selectivity on an ensemble of

  On the one hand, Biane understood that Pitman's theorem is intimately related
to the representation theory of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q\left(
\mathfrak{sl}_2 \right)$, in the so-called crystal regime $q \rightarrow 0$. On
the other hand, Bougerol and Jeulin showed the appearance of exactly the same
Pitman transform in the infinite curvature limit $r \rightarrow \infty$ of a
Brownian motion on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3 = SL_2(\mathbb{C})/SU_2$.
This paper aims at understanding this phenomenon by giving a unifying point of
view.
  In order to do so, we exhibit a presentation $\mathcal{U}_q^\hbar\left(
\mathfrak{sl}_2 \right)$ of the Jimbo-Drinfeld quantum group which isolates the
role of curvature $r$ and that of the Planck constant $\hbar$. The simple
relationship between parameters is $q=e^{-r}$. The semi-classical limits $\hbar
\rightarrow 0$ are the Poisson-Lie groups dual to $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ with
varying curvatures $r \in \mathbb{R}_+$. We also construct classical and
quantum random walks, drawing a full picture which includes Biane's quantum
walks and the construction of Bougerol-Jeulin. Taking the curvature parameter
$r$ to infinity leads indeed to the crystal regime at the level of
representation theory ($\hbar>0$) and to the Bougerol-Jeulin construction in
the classical world ($\hbar=0$).
  All these results are neatly in accordance with the philosophy of Kirillov's
orbit method.

increasing the qubit-field detuning (out-of-resonance) reduces the nonclassical

that the qubit geometric phase can be remarkably preserved irrespective of the

medical imaging have a spherical topology in a manifold space, e.g., brain
cortical or subcortical surfaces represented by triangular meshes, with large
inter-subject and intrasubject variations in vertex number and local
connectivity. Hence, there is no consistent neighborhood definition and thus no
straightforward convolution/transposed convolution operations for
cortical/subcortical surface data. In this paper, by leveraging the regular and
consistent geometric structure of the resampled cortical surface mapped onto
the spherical space, we propose a novel convolution filter analogous to the
standard convolution on the image grid. Accordingly, we develop corresponding
operations for convolution, pooling, and transposed convolution for spherical
surface data and thus construct spherical CNNs. Specifically, we propose the
Spherical U-Net architecture by replacing all operations in the standard U-Net
with their spherical operation counterparts. We then apply the Spherical U-Net
to two challenging and neuroscientifically important tasks in infant brains:
cortical surface parcellation and cortical attribute map development

applied to determine a discrete set of eigenfunctions with complex eigenvalues.

wide variety of techniques in the PG regime, most significantly a finite Q

imaging of electronic structure allows the doping and energy dependence of
these distinct broken symmetry states to be visualized simultaneously. Using
this approach, we show that, even though their reported ordering temperatures
T$_{DW}$ and T$_{NE}$ are unrelated to each other, both the DW and NE states
always exhibit their maximum spectral intensity at the same energy, and using
independent measurements that this is the pseudogap energy $\Delta^*$.
Moreover, no new energy-gap opening coincides with the appearance of the DW

while the observed pseudogap opening coincides with the appearance of the NE
state (which should theoretically be incapable of opening a Fermi-surface gap).

energy-gap opening at the breaking of two highly distinct symmetries can be
understood as the natural consequence of a vestigial nematic state , within the

unfortunately these tensors bear no direct relation to AIS. This paper proposes
to overcome this deficiency and suggests a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able
to calculate the risk to life based on the severity on any organ injury,
focussing on real-life pedestrian accidents. The OTM uses a power method, named
Peak Virtual Power (PVP), and calculates the risk to life of brain white and
grey matters as a function of impact direction and impact speed. The OTM
firstly calibrates PVP against the medical critical AIS threshold observed in
each part of the head as a function of speed. This base PVP critical trauma
function is then scaled and banded across all AIS levels using the confirmed
property that AIS and the probability of death is statistically and numerically
a cubic one. The OTM model has been tested against four real-life pedestrian
accidents and proven to be able to predict pedestrian head trauma severity. In
some cases, the method did however under-estimate the head trauma by 1 AIS
level, because of post-impact haemorrhage which cannot be captured with the
employed Lagrangian Finite Element (FE) solver. It is also shown that the
location of the injury predictions using PVP coincide with the post mortem
reports and are different to the predictions made using maximum principal

networks have recently attracted attention, owing to the interference canceling
benefits of highly-directional beamforming in such systems. In principle,
fine-tuned coordinated scheduling and beamforming can drastically reduce
cross-operator interference. However, this goes at the expense of the exchange
of global channel state information, which is not realistic in particular when
considering inter-operator coordination. Indeed, such an exchange of
information is expensive in terms of backhaul infrastructure, and besides, it
raises sensitive privacy issues between otherwise competing operators. In this
paper, we expose the existence of a trade-off between coordination and privacy.
We propose an algorithm capable of balancing spectrum sharing performance with
privacy preservation based on the sharing of a low-rate beam-related
information. Such information is subject to a data obfuscation mechanism
borrowed from the digital security literature so as to control the privacy,
measured in terms of information-theoretical equivocation.

  In this paper, we present an entirely unsupervised abbreviation

abbreviation disambiguation performance by obtaining better context

abbreviation disambiguation approach with a transparent model that allows
performance analysis without requiring full-scale evaluation, making it highly
relevant for real-world deployments.
  In our thorough empirical evaluation, UAD achieves high performance on large

  spectroscopy and pathogen detection",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Flow linear dichroism is a biophysical spectroscopic technique that exploits
the shear-induced alignment of elongated particles in suspension. Motivated by
the broad aim of optimising the sensitivity of this technique, and more
specifically by a handheld synthetic biotechnology prototype for
waterborne-pathogen detection, a model of steady and oscillating
pressure-driven channel flow and orientation dynamics of a suspension of
slender microscopic fibres is developed. The model couples the Fokker-Planck
equation for Brownian suspensions with the narrow channel flow equations, the
latter modified to incorporate mechanical anisotropy induced by the particles.
The linear dichroism signal is estimated through integrating the perpendicular
components of the distribution function via an appropriate formula which takes
the bi-axial nature of the orientation into account. For the specific
application of pathogen detection via binding of M13 bacteriophage, it is found
that increases in the channel depth are more significant in improving the
linear dichroism signal than increases in the channel width. Increasing channel
depth to $2~$mm and pressure gradient to $5 \times 10^4~$Pa/m essentially
maximises the alignment. Oscillating flow can produce nearly equal alignment to
steady flow at appropriate frequencies, which has significant potential
practical value in the analysis of small sample volumes.

The radiation drag force, known as Poynting-Robertson effect, acts as a
dissipative force against the matter's orbital motion, removing very
efficiently angular momentum and energy from it. The thesis is organised in
three parts: (1) for ray-tracing purposes, I have developed a mathematical
method for deriving a set of high-accurate approximate polynomial formulae to
easily integrate photon geodesics in a Schwarzschild spacetime; (2) I gave two

highly correlated with its focus level, the focus-level maps are preliminarily
obtained based on visual quality scores, as pre-estimations. However, the
pre-estimations are not ideal. Thus the fast bilateral solver is then adopted
to smooth the pre-estimations, and edges in the multi-focus source images can
be preserved simultaneously. The edge-preserving smoothed results are utilized
as final focus-level maps. Moreover, this work provides a confidence-map
solution for the unstable fusion in the focus-level-changed boundary regions.

tackle the dark energy/modified gravity problem. In this review, the success
and the shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model, based on General Relativity and
standard model of particles, are discussed in view of the most recent
observational constraints. The motivations for considering extensions and
modifications of General Relativity are taken into account, with particular
attention to $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ theories of gravity where dynamics is
represented by curvature or torsion field respectively. The features of $f(R)$
models are explored in metric and Palatini formalisms. We discuss the
connection between $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor theories highlighting the
role of conformal transformations in the Einstein and Jordan frames.
Cosmological dynamics of $f(R)$ models is investigated through the
corresponding viability criteria. Afterwards, the equivalent formulation of
General Relativity (Teleparallel Equivalent General Relativity) in terms of
torsion and its extension to $f(T)$ gravity is considered. Finally, the
cosmographic method is adopted to break the degeneracy among dark energy
models. A novel approach, built upon rational Pad\'e and Chebyshev polynomials,
is proposed to overcome limits of standard cosmography based on Taylor
expansion. The approach provides accurate model-independent approximations of
the Hubble flow. Numerical analyses, based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain
integration of cosmic data, are presented to bound coefficients of the
cosmographic series. These techniques are thus applied to reconstruct $f(R)$
and $f(T)$ functions and to frame the late-time expansion history of the
universe with no \emph{a priori} assumptions on its equation of state. A
comparison between the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with $f(R)$ and $f(T)$
models is reported.

predicted in many scenarios of new physics, including models with an extended
gauge sector (EGM). Due to the large variety of models (other unification
groups, models with Supersymmetry, Little Higgs Models, Extra Dimensions) the
more general EGM approach is here considered. For what concerns
$W'$-production, these models are parametrised by two parameters, the
$W^\prime$ mass $M_{W^\prime}$ and the $W$-$W^\prime$ mixing parameter $\xi$.
The diboson $WZ$ production allows to place stringent constraints on this
mixing angle and the $W'$ mass, which we determine and present for the first
time by using data from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the
ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC, with integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$.
By comparing the experimental limits to the theoretical predictions for the
total cross section of $W'$ resonant production and its subsequent decay into
$WZ$ pairs, we show that the derived constraints on the mixing angle for the
benchmark model are rather small, between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, i.e.,
greatly improved with respect to those derived from the global analysis of
electroweak data which yield $\xi\sim 10^{-2}$. We combine the limits derived
from $WZ$ production data with those obtained from the $W'\to e\nu$ process in
order to significantly extend the exclusion region in the $M_{W'}$-$\xi$
parameter plane and obtain the most stringent exclusion limits to date. We
present the combined allowed parameter space for the EGM $W'$ boson after
incorporating indirect constraints from low energy electroweak data, direct

two alternative objectives i.e., maximizing air taxi ridership and maximizing

between trip length and trip cost based on mode choice behavior of travelers to
determine optimal choices of skyports in an urban city. We examine the
sensitivity of skyport locations based on two objectives, three air taxi
pricing strategies, and varying transfer times at skyports. A case study of New
York City is conducted considering a network of 149 taxi zones and 3 airports
with over 20 million for-hire-vehicles trip data to the airports to discuss
insights around the choice of skyport locations in the city, and demand
allocation to different skyports under various parameter settings. Results
suggest that a minimum of 9 skyports located between Manhattan, Queens and
Brooklyn can adequately accommodate the airport access travel needs and are
sufficiently stable against transfer time increases. Findings from this study
can help air taxi providers strategize infrastructure design options and
investment decisions based on skyport location choices.

data explosion which produces a large variety of data filled with redundant
information. Because dimension reduction is an essential tool which embeds
high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional subspace to avoid redundant
information, it has attracted interests from researchers all over the world.
However, facing with features from multiple views, it's difficult for most
dimension reduction methods to fully comprehended multi-view features and
integrate compatible and complementary information from these features to
construct low-dimensional subspace directly. Furthermore, most multi-view
dimension reduction methods cannot handle features from nonlinear spaces with
high dimensions. Therefore, how to construct a multi-view dimension reduction
methods which can deal with multi-view features from high-dimensional nonlinear
space is of vital importance but challenging. In order to address this problem,
we proposed a novel method named Co-regularized Multi-view Sparse
Reconstruction Embedding (CMSRE) in this paper. By exploiting correlations of
sparse reconstruction from multiple views, CMSRE is able to learn local sparse
structures of nonlinear manifolds from multiple views and constructs
significative low-dimensional representations for them. Due to the proposed
co-regularized scheme, correlations of sparse reconstructions from multiple
views are preserved by CMSRE as much as possible. Furthermore, sparse
representation produces more meaningful correlations between features from each
single view, which helps CMSRE to gain better performances. Various evaluations
based on the applications of document classification, face recognition and
image retrieval can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
multi-view dimension reduction.

  Infrared Camera","This paper was submitted to Applied Energy",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is crucial to reduce natural gas methane emissions, which can potentially
offset the climate benefits of replacing coal with gas. Optical gas imaging
(OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive
and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this
paper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using
convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable
automatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane
leaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide
range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m).
Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the
methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants,
collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of
leaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by
comparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection
algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a
moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the
detection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can
exceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary
detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely
(~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater
than 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m),
performance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect
large leaks (>950 gCH4/h). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be
deployed in OGI surveys to allow automatic vigilance of methane leak detection
with high detection accuracy in the real world.

language of terms, of specifications, of proofs and of program language, which
are connected by Lucas-Interpretation providing ""next-step-guidance"" as well as
providing prover power to check user input. So this paper is structured from
the point of view of computer mathematics and thus cannot give a serious
description of effects on educational practice -- this is up to collaboration
with educational science; such collaboration is prepared by a series of
questions, some of which are biased towards software usability (and mainly to
be solved by computer mathematicians) and some of which are biased towards
genuine research in educational sciences.

operator. The sheer complexity of power systems exceeding a few buses, however,
makes it an extremely computationally demanding task. The emergence of deep
learning methods that are able to handle immense amounts of data, and infer
valuable information appears as a promising alternative. This paper has two
main contributions. First, inspired by the remarkable performance of
convolutional neural networks for image processing, we represent for the first
time power system snapshots as 2-dimensional images, thus taking advantage of
the wide range of deep learning methods available for image processing. Second,
we train deep neural networks on a large database for the NESTA 162-bus system
to assess both N-1 security and small-signal stability. We find that our
approach is over 255 times faster than a standard small-signal stability
assessment, and it can correctly determine unsafe points with over 99%
accuracy.

temperature has also experimentally revealed. We associate both effects with
the temperature and dose rate dependence of the effective charge yield in the
thick oxides described within the framework of the previously proposed model.
We have also simulated the I-V characteristics of the transistors for different

Multicellular gene expression programming algorithm based on fuzzy control
(Multicellular GEP Algorithm Based On Fuzzy Control, MGEP-FC) is proposed. The
MGEP-FC algorithm describes the size of cross rate, mutation rate and real
number mutation rate by constructing fuzzy membership function. According to
the concentration and dispersion of individual fitness values in population,
the crossover rate, mutation rate and real number set mutation rate of genetic
operation are dynamically adjusted. In order to make the diversity of the
population continue in the iterative process, a new genetic operation scheme is
designed, which combines the new individuals with the parent population to
build a temporary population, and the diversity of the temporary and
subpopulation are optimized. The results of 12 Benchmark optimization
experiments show that the MGEP-FC algorithm has been greatly improved in
stability, global convergence and optimization speed.

penetrating through macro- and microporous materials by applying a voltage. In
this work, we demonstrate the liquid metal penetration effect in various porous
materials such as tissue paper, thick and fine sponges, fabrics, and meshes.
The penetration effect mimics one of the three well-known superfluid properties
of liquid helium superfluid that only occur at near-zero Kelvin. The underlying
mechanism is that the high surface tension of liquid metal can be significantly
reduced to near-zero due to the voltage induced oxidation of the liquid metal
surface in a solution. It is the extremely low surface tension and gravity that
cause the liquid metal to superwet the solid surface, leading to the
penetration phenomena. Our findings offer new opportunities for novel
microfluidic applications and could promote further discovery of more exotic
fluid states of liquid metals.
