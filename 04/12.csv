$u_0\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ the characterization of solutions behavior under the
mass-energy threshold is known for the NLS case from the works of Holmer and
Roudenko in the radial [16] and Duyckaerts, Holmer and Roudenko in the
nonradial setting [10] and further generalizations (see [1,11,14]); for the
generalized Hartree case it is developed in [2]. In particular, scattering is
proved following the road map developed by Kenig and Merle [17], using the
concentration compactness and rigidity approach, which is now standard in the
dispersive problems.
  In this work we give an alternative proof of scattering for both NLS and
gHartree equations in the radial setting in the inter-critical regime,
following the approach of Dodson and Murphy [8] for the focusing 3d cubic NLS
equation, which relies on the scattering criterion of Tao [27], combined with
the radial Sobolev and Morawetz-type estimates. We first generalize it in the
NLS case, and then extend it to the nonlocal Hartree-type potential. This
method provides a simplified way to prove scattering, which may be useful in
other contexts.

which it is crucial to accurately reproduce the time-evolution of interest
rates. Several stochastic dynamics have been proposed in the literature to
model either the instantaneous interest rate or the instantaneous forward rate.
A successful approach to model the latter is the celebrated Heath-Jarrow-Morton
framework, in which its dynamics is entirely specified by volatility factors.
On its multifactor version, this model considers several noisy components to
capture at best the dynamics of several time-maturing forward rates. However,
as no general analytical solution is available, there is a trade-off between
the number of noisy factors considered and the computational time to perform a
numerical simulation. Here, we employ the quantum principal component analysis
to reduce the number of noisy factors required to accurately simulate the time
evolution of several time-maturing forward rates. The principal components are
experimentally estimated with the $5$-qubit IBMQX2 quantum computer for
$2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ cross-correlation matrices, which are based on
historical data for two and three time-maturing forward rates. This manuscript
is a first step towards the design of a general quantum algorithm to fully
simulate on quantum computers the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model for pricing
interest-rate financial derivatives. It shows indeed that practical
applications of quantum computers in finance will be achievable in the near
future.

Accepted version, to appear in EJP",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, locally finite, transitive graph, and consider
Bernoulli bond percolation on $G$. In recent work, we conjectured that if $G$
is nonamenable then the matrix of critical connection probabilities
$T_{p_c}(u,v)=\mathbb{P}_{p_c}(u\leftrightarrow v)$ is bounded as an operator
$T_{p_c}:L^2(V)\to L^2(V)$ and proved that this conjecture holds for several
classes of graphs. We also noted in that work that the conjecture implies two
older conjectures, namely that percolation on transitive nonamenable graphs
always has a nontrivial nonuniqueness phase, and that critical percolation on
the same class of graphs has mean-field critical behaviour.
  In this paper we further investigate the consequences of the $L^2$
boundedness conjecture. In particular, we prove that the following hold for all
transitive graphs: i) The two-point function decays exponentially in the
distance for all $p<p_{2\to 2}$; ii) If $p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then the critical
exponent governing the extrinsic diameter of a critical cluster is $1$; iii)
Below $p_{2\to 2}$, percolation is ""ballistic"" in the sense that the intrinsic
distance between two points is exponentially unlikely to be much larger than
their extrinsic distance; iv) If $p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then $\|T_{p_c}\|_{q\to q}
\asymp (q-1)^{-1}$ and $p_{q\to q}-p_c \asymp q-1$ as $q\downarrow 1$. v) If
$p_c<p_{2\to 2}$, then various 'multiple-arm' events have probabilities
comparable to the upper bound given by the BK inequality. In particular, the
probability that the origin is a trifurcation point is of order $(p-p_c)^3$ as
$p \downarrow p_c$. All of these results are new even in the Gromov hyperbolic
case.
  Finally, we apply these results together with duality arguments to compute
the critical exponents governing the geometry of intrinsic geodesics at the
uniqueness threshold of percolation in the hyperbolic plane.

derive the properties of optimal electromagnetic searches for these candidates,
subject to the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) on amplification. We show that a
single-pole resonant search may possess substantial sensitivity outside of the
resonator bandwidth and that optimizing this sensitivity may increase scan
rates by up to five orders of magnitude at low frequencies. Additional
enhancements can be obtained with resonator quality factors exceeding one
million, which corresponds to the linewidth of the dark matter signal. We
present the resonator optimization in the broader context of determining the
optimal receiver architecture (resonant or otherwise). We discuss prior
probabilities on the dark matter signal and their role in the search
optimization. We determine frequency-integrated sensitivity to be the figure of
merit in a wideband search and demonstrate that it is limited by the Bode-Fano
criterion. The optimized single-pole resonator is approximately 75% of the
Bode-Fano limit, establishing it as a fundamentally near-ideal, single-moded
dark matter detection scheme. Our analysis shows, in contrast to previous work,
that the scanned single-pole resonant search is superior to a reactive
broadband search. Our results motivate the broad application of quantum

M.~Kapranov showed in the context of Lie-Rinehard algebras that there exists an
extension of this anchored bundle to an infinite rank universal free Lie
algebroid $FR(E)\supset E$. We adapt his construction to the case of an
anchored bundle equipped with an arbitrary connection, $(E,\nabla)$, and show
that it gives rise to a unique connection $\tilde \nabla$ on $FR(E)$ which is
compatible with its Lie algebroid structure, thus turning $(FR(E), \tilde
\nabla)$ into a Cartan-Lie algebroid. Moreover, this construction is universal:
any connection-preserving vector bundle morphism from $(E,\nabla)$ to a
Cartan-Lie Algebroid $(A,\bar \nabla)$ factors through a unique Cartan-Lie
algebroid morphism from $(FR(E), \tilde \nabla)$ to $(A,\bar \nabla)$.
  Suppose that, in addition, $M$ is equipped with a geometrical structure
defined by some tensor field $t$ which is compatible with $(E,\rho,\nabla)$ in
the sense of being annihilated by a natural $E$-connection that one can
associate to these data. For example, for a Riemannian base $(M,g)$ of an
involutive anchored bundle $(E,\rho)$, this condition implies that $M$ carries
a Riemannian foliation. %In general, the compatibility of a tensor $t$ with
$(E,\rho,\nabla)$ implies its adequate invariance transversal to $\rho(E)$. It
is shown that every $E$-compatible tensor field $t$ becomes invariant with
respect to the Lie algebroid representation associated canonically to the
Cartan-Lie algebroid $(FR(E), \tilde \nabla)$.

common on modern camera sensors. Classic stereo algorithms and prior
learning-based depth estimation techniques under-perform when applied on this
dual-pixel data, the former due to too-strong assumptions about RGB image

can be effectively applied to dual-pixel data, and much smaller models can be
constructed that still infer high quality depth. To demonstrate this, we
capture a large dataset of in-the-wild 5-viewpoint RGB images paired with
corresponding dual-pixel data, and show how view supervision with this data can
be used to learn depth up to the unknown ambiguities. On our new task, our

  Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as
the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We
provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new
prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These
new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model
freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but

these challenges, we present FECBench, a framework to guide providers in

to both parent compounds (NdFeO$_3$ and DyFeO$_3$), the magnetic structure of
Fe$^{3+}$ belongs to ${\Gamma}_{4}$ irreducible representation (G$_{x}$,
F$_{z}$) at room temperature. The experimental measurements confirmed the spin
reorientation where magnetic structure of Fe$^{3+}$ changes from ${\Gamma}_{4}$
to ${\Gamma}_{2}$(F$_{x}$, G$_{z}$) between 75 and 20 \,K while maintaining
G-type configuration. Such a gradual spin reorientation is unusual since the
large single ion anisotropy of Dy$^{3+}$ ions causes an abrupt
${\Gamma}_{4}$${\rightarrow}$ ${\Gamma}_{1}$(G$_{y}$) spin reorientation in
DyFeO$_3$. Between 20 and 10 \,K, the Fe$^{3+}$ magnetic structure is
represented by ${\Gamma}_{2}$ (F$_{x}$, G$_{z}$). Unexpectedly, magnetic
structure of Fe$^{3+}$ with ${\Gamma}_{4}$ representation re-emerges below
10\,K which also coincides with the development of rare-earth
(Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$) magnetic ordering having C$_{y}$ configuration with
magnetic moment of 1.8 ${\mu}_{B}$. The absence of any signature of second
order phase transition in the specific heat confirms the role of
$R$(Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$)-Fe$^{3+}$ exchange interaction in the observed
""rare-earth ordering"" unlike DyFeO$_3$ where Dy$^{3+}$ ordering takes place
independently to the magnetic ordering of Fe$^{3+}$ magnetic structure. Our
(DFT+U+SO) calculations show that the C-type arrangement of rare-earth ions
(Nd$^{3+}$/Dy$^{3+}$) with ${\Gamma}_{2}$ configuration for Fe$^{3+}$ moments
is the ground state whereas ${\Gamma}_{4}$ phase is energetically very close.
Nd-Fe and Nd-Dy exchange interactions, estimated from DFT, are observed to have

  Communication","11 pages, 21 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.MS cs.NA cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is often viewed as a scalable $\mathcal{O}(n)$
solver for sparse linear systems. Yet, parallel AMG lacks scalability due to
increasingly large costs associated with communication, both in the initial
construction of a multigrid hierarchy as well as the iterative solve phase.
This work introduces a parallel implementation of AMG to reduce the cost of
communication, yielding an increase in scalability. Standard inter-process
communication consists of sending data regardless of the send and receive
process locations. Performance tests show notable differences in the cost of
intra- and inter-node communication, motivating a restructuring of
communication. In this case, the communication schedule takes advantage of the
less costly intra-node communication, reducing both the number and size of
inter-node messages. Node-centric communication extends to the range of
components in both the setup and solve phase of AMG, yielding an increase in
the weak and strong scalability of the entire method.

work and location. The idea is that each road side unit (RSU) issues a signed
time-stamped tag as a proof for the vehicle's anonymous location. Proofs sent
from multiple consecutive RSUs is used to create vehicle trajectory which is
used as vehicle anonymous identity. Also, one RSU is not able to issue
trajectories for vehicles, rather the contributions of several RSUs are needed.
By this way, attackers need to compromise an infeasible number of RSUs to
create fake trajectories. Moreover, upon receiving the proof of location from
an RSU, the vehicle should solve a computational puzzle by running proof of
work (PoW) algorithm. So, it should provide a valid solution (proof of work) to
the next RSU before it can obtain a proof of location. Using the PoW can
prevent the vehicles from creating multiple trajectories in case of low-dense
RSUs. Then, during any reported event, e.g., road congestion, the event manager
uses a matching technique to identify the trajectories sent from Sybil
vehicles. The scheme depends on the fact that the Sybil trajectories are
bounded physically to one vehicle; therefore, their trajectories should
overlap. Extensive experiments and simulations demonstrate that our scheme
achieves high detection rate to Sybil attacks with low false negative and
acceptable communication and computation overhead.

attaching superparamagnetic beads to the flagellar hook, we can control the

sheet that is free to bend are known, the boundary conditions that supplement
these equations on free edges have remained elusive. Intuitively,
unstretchability is captured by a constraint on the metric within the bulk.
Naively one would then guess that this constraint is enough to ensure that the
deformations determining the boundary conditions on these edges respect the
isometry constraint. If matters were this simple, unfortunately, it would imply
unbalanced torques (as well as forces) along the edge unless manifestly
unphysical constraints are met by the boundary geometry. In this paper we
identify the source of the problem: not only the local arc-length but also the
geodesic curvature need to be constrained explicitly on all free edges. We
derive the boundary conditions which follow. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
there is no need to introduce boundary layers. This framework is applied to
isolated conical defects, both with deficit as well, but more briefly, as
surplus angles. Using these boundary conditions, we show that the lateral
tension within a circular cone of fixed radius is equal but opposite to the
radial compression, and independent of the deficit angle itself. We proceed to
examine the effect of an oblique outer edge on this cone perturbatively
demonstrating that both the correction to the geometry as well as the stress
distribution in the cone kicks in at second order in the eccentricity of the
edge.

nearest neighbor interactions on a quasi-two-dimensional kagome bilayer. This
geometrically frustrated lattice consists of two kagome layers connected by a
triangular-lattice linking layer. By combining Monte Carlo with precessional
spin dynamics simulations, we compute the dynamical structure factor of the
classical spin liquid in kagome bilayer and investigate the thermal and
dilution effects. While the low frequency and long wavelength dynamics of the
cooperative paramagnetic phase is dominated by spin diffusion, weak magnon
excitations persist at higher energies, giving rise the half moon pattern in
the dynamical structure factor. In the presence of spin vacancies, the
dynamical properties of the diluted system can be understood within the two
population picture. The spin diffusion of the ""correlated"" spin clusters is
mainly driven by the zero-energy weather-van modes, giving rise to an
autocorrelation function that decays exponentially with time. On the other
hand, the diffusive dynamics of the quasi-free ""orphan"" spins leads to a
distinctive longer time power-law tail in the autocorrelation function. We
discuss the implications of our work for the glassy behaviors observed in the

compute a 3D model of human body pose, hand pose, and facial expression from a

a new, unified, 3D model of the human body, SMPL-X, that extends SMPL with
fully articulated hands and an expressive face. Learning to regress the
parameters of SMPL-X directly from images is challenging without paired images
and 3D ground truth. Consequently, we follow the approach of SMPLify, which
estimates 2D features and then optimizes model parameters to fit the features.
We improve on SMPLify in several significant ways: (1) we detect 2D features
corresponding to the face, hands, and feet and fit the full SMPL-X model to
these; (2) we train a new neural network pose prior using a large MoCap
dataset; (3) we define a new interpenetration penalty that is both fast and
accurate; (4) we automatically detect gender and the appropriate body models
(male, female, or neutral); (5) our PyTorch implementation achieves a speedup
of more than 8x over Chumpy. We use the new method, SMPLify-X, to fit SMPL-X to
both controlled images and images in the wild. We evaluate 3D accuracy on a new
curated dataset comprising 100 images with pseudo ground-truth. This is a step
towards automatic expressive human capture from monocular RGB data. The models,

The power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, in which the
provers are allowed to share entanglement, has proven to be much more difficult

Vidick (FOCS 2012). As for upper bounds, MIP* could be as large as RE, the

  The main result of this work is the inclusion of NEEXP (nondeterministic
doubly exponential time) in MIP*. This is an exponential improvement over the
prior lower bound and shows that proof systems with entangled provers are at
least exponentially more powerful than classical provers. In our protocol the
verifier delegates a classical, exponentially large MIP protocol for NEEXP to
two entangled provers: the provers obtain their exponentially large questions
by measuring their shared state, and use a classical PCP to certify the
correctness of their exponentially-long answers. For the soundness of our
protocol, it is crucial that each player should not only sample its own
question correctly but also avoid performing measurements that would reveal the
other player's sampled question. We ensure this by commanding the players to
perform a complementary measurement, relying on the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle to prevent the forbidden measurements from being performed.

Caltech-256, SUN-397, Flowers-102 etc. Some important conclusions from our

fine-tuning on small detection datasets, especially when precise localization
is needed. For example, we obtain 81.1% mAP on the PASCAL-VOC dataset at 0.7
IoU after pre-training on OpenImagesV4, which is 7.6% better than the recently

pre-training also benefits other localization tasks like semantic segmentation

pooled Conv5) which are similar in the object detection feature space are
likely to be similar in the image classification feature space but the converse
is not true. 4) Visualization of features reveals that detection neurons have
activations over an entire object, while activations for classification

reached, but with varying relaxation times. We conclude that regulations may
improve economic mobility and reduce inequality. Moreover, our results indicate
that the removal of social protection entails a high cost associated with the
hysteresis of the distribution of wealth. Economic inequalities increase during
a period without social protection, but also they remain high for an even
longer time and, in some extreme cases, inequality may be irreversible,

results for a double-blind survey of 195 single and 22 wide binary white dwarfs

cooling ages in the range 9 to 300 Myr, and hydrogen-rich atmospheres so that
the presence of atmospheric metals can be confidently linked to ongoing
accretion from a circumstellar disc. The entire sample has infrared photometry,
whereas 168 targets have corresponding ultraviolet spectra. Three stars with
infrared excesses due to debris discs are recovered, yielding a nominal
frequency of $1.5_{-0.5}^{+1.5}$ per cent, while in stark contrast, the
fraction of stars with atmospheric metals is $45\pm4$ per cent. Thus, only one
out of 30 polluted white dwarfs exhibits an infrared excess at 3-4 $\mu$m in
IRAC photometry, which reinforces the fact that atmospheric metal pollution is
the most sensitive tracer of white dwarf planetary systems. The corresponding
fraction of infrared excesses around white dwarfs with wide binary companions
is consistent with zero, using both the infrared survey data and an independent
assessment of potential binarity for well-established dusty and polluted stars.
In contrast, the frequency of atmospheric pollution among the targets in wide
binaries is indistinct from apparently single stars, and moreover the
multiplicity of polluted white dwarfs in a complete and volume-limited sample
is the same as for field stars. Therefore, it appears that the delivery of
planetesimal material onto white dwarfs is ultimately not driven by stellar
companions, but by the dynamics of planetary bodies.

is charged under a new $U(1)_d$ gauge force which kinetically mixes with the SM
hypercharge. The gauge boson of the $U(1)_d$ is the dark photon, $\gamma_d$.
Traditional searches for VLQs rely on decays into Standard Model electroweak
bosons $W,Z$ or Higgs. However, since no evidence for VLQs has been found at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), it is imperative to search for other novel
signatures of VLQs beyond their traditional decays. As we will show, if the
dark photon is much less massive than the Standard Model electroweak sector,
$M_{\gamma_d}\ll M_Z$, for the large majority of the allowed parameter space
the VLQ predominately decays into the dark photon and the dark Higgs that
breaks the $U(1)_d$ . That is, this VLQ is a `maverick top partner' with
nontraditional decays. One of the appeals of this scenario is that pair
production of the VLQ at the LHC occurs through the strong force and the rate
is determined by the gauge structure. Hence, the production of the dark photon
at the LHC only depends on the strong force and is largely independent of the
small kinetic mixing with hypercharge. This scenario provides a robust
framework to search for a light dark sector via searches for heavy colored
particles at the LHC.

by massive ($M_{\rm{halo}}\gtrsim10^{12}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) dark matter
halos. Assuming quasars and galaxies trace the same large-scale structures,
this should also manifest as strong clustering of galaxies around quasars.
Previous work on high-redshift quasar environments, mostly focused at $z>5$,
have failed to find convincing evidence for these overdensities. Here we
conduct a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 quasars
at $z\sim4$ probing scales of $R\lesssim7\,h^{-1}\,{\rm{Mpc}}$. We measure an
average LAE overdensity around quasars of 1.4 for our full sample, which we
quantify by fitting the quasar-LAE cross-correlation function. We find
consistency with a power-law shape with correlation length of
$r^{QG}_{0}=2.78^{+1.16}_{-1.05}\,h^{-1}\,{\rm{cMpc}}$ for a fixed slope of
$\gamma=1.8$. We also measure the LAE auto-correlation length and find
$r^{GG}_{0}=9.12^{+1.32}_{-1.31}\,h^{-1}$\,cMpc ($\gamma=1.8$), which is $3.3$
times higher than the value measured in blank fields. Taken together our
results clearly indicate that LAEs are significantly clustered around $z\sim4$
quasars. We compare the observed clustering with the expectation from a
deterministic bias model, whereby LAEs and quasars probe the same underlying
dark matter overdensities, and find that our measurements fall short of the
predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1. We discuss possible explanations
for this discrepancy including large-scale quenching or the presence of excess
dust in galaxies near quasars. Finally, the large cosmic variance from
field-to-field observed in our sample (10/17 fields are actually underdense)
cautions one from over-interpreting studies of $z\sim6$ quasar environments
based on a single or handful of quasar fields.

Interestingly FSRQs are evident to exhibit a Keplerian disc component along
with a powerful jet. We compute the jet intrinsic luminosities by beaming
corrections determined by different cooling mechanisms. Observed $\gamma$-ray
luminosities and spectroscopic measurements of broad emission lines suggest a
correlation of the accretion disc luminosity with jet intrinsic luminosity.
Also, theoretical and observational inferences for these jetted sources
indicate a signature of hot advective accretion flow and a dynamically dominant
magnetic field at jet-footprint. Indeed it is difficult to imagine the powerful
jet launching from a geometrically thin Keplerian disc. We propose a
magnetized, advective disc-outflow symbiosis with explicit cooling to address a
unified classification of blazars by controlling both the mass accretion rate
and magnetic field strength. The large scale strong magnetic fields influence
the accretion dynamics, remove angular momentum from the infalling matter, help
in the formation of strong outflows/jets, and lead to synchrotron emissions
simultaneously. We suggest that the BL Lacs are more optically thin and
magnetically dominated than FSRQs at the jet-footprint to explain their

consider a pure diffusion model for their Galactic transport and determine its
free parameters by fitting data in a wide energy range: measurements of the
interstellar spectrum by Voyager at MeV energies, radio synchrotron data
(sensitive to GeV electrons and positrons) and local observations by AMS up to
~ 1 TeV. For the first time, we also model the time-dependent fluxes of cosmic

solar modulation in a simple extension of the widely used force-field

Our model of the interstellar spectrum of cosmic ray electrons and positrons
requires the presence of a number of spectral breaks, both in the source

achieving ultra-low-background neutrinoless double beta decay sensitivity is
the detection of single $^{136}$Ba ions produced in the decay of $^{136}$Xe

detector must be developed and demonstrated in bulk liquid or dry gaseous

synthesized specifically for this purpose. One particularly promising

baryons in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is inversely correlated with the
mass of their central supermassive black holes (BHs) in the EAGLE hydrodynamic

provided more energy to transport baryons beyond the virial radius, which
additionally reduces gas accretion and star formation. We continue this
research by focusing on the relationship between the 1) BH masses, 2) physical
and observational properties of the CGM, and 3) galaxy colours for Milky
Way-mass systems. The ratio of the cumulative BH feedback energy over the
gaseous halo binding energy is a strong predictor of the CGM gas content, with
BHs injecting >~10x the binding energy resulting in gas-poor haloes. Observable
tracers of the CGM, including CIV, OVI, and HI absorption line measurements,
are found to be effective tracers of the total z~0 CGM halo mass. We use
high-cadence simulation outputs to demonstrate that BH feedback pushes baryons
beyond the virial radius within 100 Myr timescales, but that CGM metal tracers
take longer (0.5-2.5 Gyr) to respond. Secular evolution of galaxies results in
blue, star-forming or red, passive populations depending on the cumulative
feedback from BHs. The reddest quartile of galaxies with M_*=10^{10.2-10.7}

  Retrieval with Graph Based Replicated Storage",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of private information retrieval with graph-based replicated
storage was recently introduced by Raviv, Tamo and Yaakobi. Its capacity
remains open in almost all cases. In this work the asymptotic (large number of
messages) capacity of this problem is studied along with its generalizations to
include arbitrary $T$-privacy and $X$-security constraints, where the privacy
of the user must be protected against any set of up to $T$ colluding servers
and the security of the stored data must be protected against any set of up to
$X$ colluding servers. A general achievable scheme for arbitrary storage
patterns is presented that achieves the rate $(\rho_{\min}-X-T)/N$, where $N$
is the total number of servers, and each message is replicated at least
$\rho_{\min}$ times. Notably, the scheme makes use of a special structure
inspired by dual Generalized Reed Solomon (GRS) codes. A general converse is
also presented. The two bounds are shown to match for many settings, including
symmetric storage patterns. Finally, the asymptotic capacity is fully
characterized for the case without security constraints $(X=0)$ for arbitrary
storage patterns provided that each message is replicated no more than $T+2$
times. As an example of this result, consider PIR with arbitrary graph based
storage ($T=1, X=0$) where every message is replicated at exactly $3$ servers.
For this $3$-replicated storage setting, the asymptotic capacity is equal to
$2/\nu_2(G)$ where $\nu_2(G)$ is the maximum size of a $2$-matching in a
storage graph $G[V,E]$. In this undirected graph, the vertices $V$ correspond
to the set of servers, and there is an edge $uv\in E$ between vertices $u,v$
only if a subset of messages is replicated at both servers $u$ and $v$.

wave (CDW) phase transition whose origins are still not fully understood. Here,
we present ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(TR-ARPES) measurements complemented by time-resolved reflectivity (TRR) which
allows us to establish the contribution of excitonic and electron-phonon
interactions to the CDW. We monitor the energy shift of the valence band (VB)
and coupling to coherent phonons as a function of laser fluence. The VB shift,
directly related to the CDW gap closure, exhibits a markedly slower recovery
dynamics at fluences above Fth = 60 microJ cm-2. This observation coincides
with a shift in the relative weight of coherently coupled phonons to higher
frequency modes in time-resolved reflectivity (TRR), suggesting a phonon
bottleneck. Using a rate equation model, the emergence of a high-fluence
bottleneck is attributed to an abrupt reduction in coupled phonon damping and
an increase in exciton dissociation rate linked to the loss of CDW superlattice
phonons. Thus, our work establishes the important role of both excitonic and
phononic interactions in the CDW phase transition and the advantage of
combining complementary femtosecond techniques to understand the complex

in angle-resolved photon spectrum, which sensitively relies on the polarization
of the electron beam. The asymmetry is particularly significant in high-energy

emission from these galaxies at lower metallicities generally underpredicts
this line ratio, which is typically attributed to a deficit of photons >35 eV.
We show that applying a model that includes empirical abundances scaled with
metallicity strongly influences the thermal balance in HII regions and
preserves the [O III]/H\b{eta} offset even in the presence of a harder
radiation field generated by interacting binaries. Additional heating
mechanisms are more successful in addressing the offset. In accordance with the
high sSFR typical of dwarf galaxies in the sample, we demonstrate that cosmic
ray heating serves as one mechanism capable of aligning spectral synthesis
predictions with observations. We also show that incorporating a range of
physical conditions in our modeling can create even better agreement between
model calculations and observed emission line ratios. Together these results
emphasize that both the hardness of the incident continuum and the variety of
physical conditions present in nebular gas clouds must be accurately accounted

require flexible tools for the selection and analysis of astrophysical
transients. We here introduce the Alert Management, Photometry and Evaluation
of Lightcurves (AMPEL) system, an analysis framework designed for
high-throughput surveys and suited for streamed data. AMPEL combines the
functionality of an alert broker with a generic framework capable of hosting
user-contributed code, that encourages provenance and keeps track of the
varying information states that a transient displays. The latter concept
includes information gathered over time and data policies such as access or
calibration levels.
  We describe a novel ongoing real-time multi-messenger analysis using AMPEL to
combine IceCube neutrino data with the alert streams of the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF). We also reprocess the first four months of ZTF public alerts,
and compare the yields of more than 200 different transient selection functions
to quantify efficiencies for selecting Type Ia supernovae that were reported to
the Transient Name Server (TNS). We highlight three channels suitable for (1)
the collection of a complete sample of extragalactic transients, (2) immediate
follow-up of nearby transients and (3) follow-up campaigns targeting young,
extragalactic transients. We confirm ZTF completeness in that all TNS
supernovae positioned on active CCD regions were detected.
  AMPEL can assist in filtering transients in real time, running alert reaction
simulations, the reprocessing of full datasets as well as in the final
scientific analysis of transient data. This text introduces how users can
design their own channels for inclusion in the AMPEL live instance that parses
the ZTF stream and the real-time submission of high quality extragalactic
supernova candidates to the TNS.

of view of the processor. Considering these measures as stochastic processes in
a stationary environment (defined by the arrival processes, message processing

derive explicit solutions for their Laplace transforms and show some
interesting decomposition properties. Previous work has mostly focused on
computation of expectations in very particular cases. We argue that using
bufferless or very small buffer systems is best and support this by simulation.
We also pose some open problems including assessment of enqueueing policies
that may be better in cases where one wishes to minimize more general
functionals of the age of information measures.

them are low-mass galaxies similar to the populations of blue compact dwarfs

producing a GRB progenitor is still largely unknown, as are the resolved gas
properties and kinematics of these galaxies and their formation history. Here
we present a sample of six spatially resolved GRB hosts at z<0.3 observed with
3D spectroscopy at high spectral resolution (R=8,000-13,000) using FLAMES/VLT.
We analyzed the resolved gas kinematics of the full sample and the abundances
in a subsample. Only two galaxies show a regular disk-like rotation field,
another two are dispersion-dominated, the remaining two have a double emission
component associated with different parts of the galaxy, which might indicate a
recent merger. All galaxies show evidence for broad components underlying the
main emission peak (sigma = 50-110 km/s). This broad component is more
metal-rich than the narrow components, it is blueshifted in most cases, and it
follows a different velocity structure. We find a weak correlation between the
SF rate and the width of the broad component, its flux compared to the narrow
component, and the maximum outflow velocity of the gas, but we do not find any
correlation with the SF density, metallicity or stellar mass. We associate this
broad component with a metal-rich outflow from star-forming regions. The GRB is
not located in the brightest region of the host, but is always associated with
some star-forming region showing a clear wind component. Our study shows the
potential of 3D spectroscopy to study the SF processes in galaxies hosting
extreme transients, the need for high S/N, and the perils using unresolved or
only partially resolved data for these kinds of studies.

work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome the channel

state-of-the-art SeqSleepNet and train the network in the source domain, i.e.
the large dataset. Afterwards, the pretrained network is finetuned in the
target domain, i.e. the small cohort, to complete knowledge transfer. We study
two transfer learning scenarios with slight and heavy channel mismatch between
the source and target domains. We also investigate whether, and if so, how
finetuning entirely or partially the pretrained network would affect the
performance of sleep staging on the target domain. Using the Montreal Archive

of two-dimensional mass spectrometry for high fidelity determination of a

covariance two-dimensional mass spectrometry (pC-2DMS) detects intrinsic
statistical correlations between biomolecular fragments originating from the
same or consecutive decomposition events. This enables identification of pairs
of ions produced along the same fragmentation pathway of a biomolecule across
its entire fragment mass spectrum. We demonstrate that the fragment-fragment

mass-to-charge ratios on which standard one-dimensional MS is based. We
illustrate the power of pC-2DMS by using it to resolve structural isomers of

neutron star solutions are constructed numerically due to the complexity of the
field equations with realistic equations of state. However, in order to relate
observables like the neutron star mass and radius to interior quantities like
central density and pressure, it would be useful to provide an accurate,
analytic modeling of a neutron star interior. One such solution for static and
isolated neutron stars is the Tolman VII solution characterized only by two
parameters (e.g. mass and radius), though its agreement with numerical
solutions is not perfect. We here introduce an improved analytic model based on
the Tolman VII solution by introducing an additional parameter to make the
analytic density profile agree better with the numerically obtained one. This
additional parameter can be fitted in terms of the stellar mass, radius and
central density in an equation-of-state-insensitive way. In most cases, we find
that the new model more accurately describes realistic profiles than the

with more representative spatial information that helps discriminate nodules

sensitivity of 92.67% with 1 false positive per scan and sensitivity of 94.19%
with 2 false positives per scan for lung nodule detection on 888 scans in the

pulmonary nodules (3 mm-10 mm) and results in fewer false positives.
Experimental results show that utilizing MIP images can increase the
sensitivity and lower the number of false positives, which demonstrates the
effectiveness and significance of the proposed MIP-based CNNs framework for
automatic pulmonary nodule detection in CT scans. The proposed method also

problem in which multiphase flow and transport are tightly coupled with the
porous medium deformation. To capture this dynamic interplay, fully implicit
methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred. The main
bottleneck of a monolithic approach is that it requires solution of large
linear systems that result from the discretization and linearization of the
governing balance equations. Because such systems are non-symmetric,
indefinite, and highly ill-conditioned, preconditioning is critical for fast
convergence. Recently, most efforts in designing efficient preconditioners for
multiphase poromechanics have been dominated by physics-based strategies.
Current state-of-the-art ""black-box"" solvers such as algebraic multigrid (AMG)
are ineffective because they cannot effectively capture the strong coupling
between the mechanics and the flow sub-problems, as well as the coupling
inherent in the multiphase flow and transport process. In this work, we develop
an algebraic framework based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that is suited for
tightly coupled systems of PDEs. Using this framework, the decoupling between
the equations is done algebraically through defining appropriate interpolation
and restriction operators. One can then employ existing solvers for each of the
decoupled blocks or design a new solver based on knowledge of the physics. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework when used as a ""black-box""
solver for multiphase poromechanics. We show that the framework is flexible to
accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable for
large problems.

the Galactic centre has bipolar lobes that can be seen in both X-rays and
radio, indicating broadly collimated outflows from the centre, directed
perpendicular to the Galactic plane. On far larger scales approaching the size
of the Galaxy itself, gamma-ray observations have identified the so-called
Fermi Bubble features, implying that our Galactic centre has, or has recently
had, a period of active energy release leading to a production of relativistic
particles that now populate huge cavities on both sides of the Galactic plane.
The X-ray maps from the ROSAT all-sky survey show that the edges of these
cavities close to the Galactic plane are bright in X-rays. At intermediate
scales (~150 pc), radio astronomers have found the Galactic Centre Lobe, an
apparent bubble of emission seen only at positive Galactic latitudes, but again
indicative of energy injection from near the Galactic centre. Here we report
the discovery of prominent X-ray structures on these intermediate
(hundred-parsec) scales above and below the plane, which appear to connect the
Galactic centre region to the Fermi bubbles. We propose that these
newly-discovered structures, which we term the Galactic Centre Chimneys,
constitute a channel through which energy and mass, injected by a
quasi-continuous train of episodic events at the Galactic centre, are
transported from the central parsecs to the base of the Fermi bubbles.

vertex ranks its neighbors in a strict order of preference. A matching M in G

Popular matchings are a well-studied generalization of stable matchings,
introduced with the goal of enlarging the set of admissible solutions, while
maintaining a certain level of fairness. Every stable matching is a min-size
popular matching. Unfortunately, when there are edge costs, it is NP-hard to
find a popular matching of minimum cost -- even worse, the min-cost popular
matching problem is hard to approximate up to any factor.
  Let opt be the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Our goal is to
efficiently compute a matching of cost at most opt by paying the price of
mildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bi-criteria
algorithms that find in polynomial time a near-popular or quasi-popular
matching of cost at most opt. Moreover, one of the algorithms finds a
quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional
matching, which could be much smaller than opt.
  Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended formulation for an
integral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching
polytopes. We complement these results by showing that it is NP-hard to find a
quasi-popular matching of minimum cost, and that both the popular and
quasi-popular matching polytopes have near-exponential extension complexity.

amplifying the photo-generated carriers (electrons or holes) via a Geiger-mode
avalanche. The Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) is the combined probability
that a photon is absorbed in the active volume of the device with a
subsequently triggered avalanche. Absorption and avalanche triggering
probabilities are correlated since the latter probability depends on where the
photon is absorbed. In this paper, we introduce a physics motivated
parameterization of the avalanche triggering probability that describes the PDE
of a SiPM as a function of its reverse bias voltage, at different wavelengths.
This parameterization is based on the fact that in p-on-n SiPMs the induced
avalanches are electron-driven in the ultra-violet and near-ultra-violet
ranges, while they become increasingly hole-driven towards the near-infra-red
range. The model has been successfully applied to characterize two Hamamatsu
MPPCs and one FBK SiPM, and it can be extended to other SiPMs. Furthermore,
this model provides key insight on the electric field structure within SiPMs,

the new narrow-band images of H$\alpha$, [O~I] $\lambda$6300 and [S II]
$\lambda$6716 allows us to measure electron densities and excitations at each
point in the outflow with the spatial resolution of HST, while the I-band image
traces out the boundary of the cavity evacuated by the outflow. Comparing these
images with those taken $\sim$ 20 years ago yields high precision proper
motions for all the HH objects in the outflow. HH 11 is a bullet-like clump,
and emerges from the exciting source SVS 13A towards the Earth at 24 degrees to
line of sight. In contrast, HH 8 and HH 10 consist of two rings of shocked gas
that show no bulk proper motions even though the emitting gas is blueshifted.
The HH 8 rings are expanding with time. These shocks mark places where ambient
material located along the path of the jet redirects the outflow. HH 7 consists
of multiple shells, and emits strongly in H$_2$ in what appears to be a
terminal bow shock for the outflow, implying that the jet has yet to fully
break out of its nascent cloud core. The jet largely fragments into clumps by
the time it reaches HH 7. As in the case of HH 110, deflection from ambient
material plays a key role in producing observable shock waves in the HH 7-11
outflow.

parallel-in-time integration schemes to reduce the time-to-solution is of
increasing interest, particularly in the numerical weather forecasting field.
We present a multi-level parallel-in-time integration method combining the
Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) with a spatial
discretization based on Spherical Harmonics (SH). The iterative algorithm
computes multiple time steps concurrently by interweaving parallel high-order
fine corrections and serial corrections performed on a coarsened problem. To do
that, we design a methodology relying on the spectral basis of the SH to
coarsen and interpolate the problem in space. The methods are evaluated on the
shallow-water equations on the sphere using a set of tests commonly used in the
atmospheric flow community. We assess the convergence of PFASST-SH upon
refinement in time. We also investigate the impact of the coarsening strategy
on the accuracy of the scheme, and specifically on its ability to capture the
high-frequency modes accumulating in the solution. Finally, we study the
computational cost of PFASST-SH to demonstrate that our scheme resolves the
main features of the solution multiple times faster than the serial schemes.

(using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC), convolving it with
point-spread functions of calibrator stars, and comparing the convolved models
with the observational data. The disc surface density parameters are explored
with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique. Our analysis recovers emission from
both of the discs interior to the well known optically thick walls, modelled as
a ring of emission at ~15AU in Oph IRS 48, and ~7AU for HD 169142, and
identifies asymmetries in both discs. Given the brightness of the
near-symmetric rings compared to the reported companion candidates, we suggest
that the reported companion candidates can be interpreted as slightly
asymmetric disc emission or illumination.

synchrotron burn-off effect. The radial profile of the spectral index has a
break at $R\sim80''$, implying a maximum electron energy of $\sim$200 TeV which
is larger than a previous estimate, and the 25-keV spectral break corresponds
to a maximum electron energy of $\sim$140 TeV for an assumed magnetic field
strength of 80 $\mu$G. Combining the X-ray data and a previous radio-to-IR SED,
we measure a cooling break frequency to be $\sim 10^{15}$ Hz, which constrains

view of the ill-posedness of the corresponding inverse problem, a modified
Tikhonov regularization method is proposed by constructing a new regularizing
filter function based on the singular value theory of compact operator. The
convergence and the optimal asymptotic order of the regularized solution are
obtained. Then the classical Tikhonov regularization method and the modified

initial drug concentration distribution. For three various desired release
profiles (constant release, linear decrease release and linear increase
followed by a constant release profiles), better results can be obtained by
using the modified Tikhonov regularization method. The numerical results
demonstrate that the modified Tikhonov regularization method not only has the

representation space. In particular, we adopt the recently proposed Word
Mover's Distance with word2vec embeddings and extend it to measure the
dissimilarity in language used in multiple consecutive speaker turns. To
validate our approach, we apply this measure for two case studies in the
clinical psychology domain. We find that our proposed measure is correlated
with the therapist's empathy towards their patient in Motivational Interviewing
and with affective behaviors in Couples Therapy. In both case studies, our
proposed metric exhibits higher correlation than previously proposed measures.
When applied to the couples with relationship improvement, we also notice a
significant decrease in the proposed measure over the course of therapy,
indicating higher linguistic coordination.

by revising the classical band theory with the inclusion of topology.
Re-evaluating the band evolution from an ""atomic crystal"" [a normal insulator
(NI)] to a solid crystal, such as a semiconductor, we demonstrate that there
exists ubiquitously an intermediate phase of topological insulator (TI), whose
critical transition point displays a linear scaling between electron hopping
potential and average bond length, underlined by deformation-potential theory.
The validity of the scaling relation is verified in various two-dimensional
(2D) lattices regardless of lattice symmetry, periodicity, and form of electron
hoppings, based on a generic tight-binding model. Significantly, this linear
scaling is shown to set an upper bound for the degree of structural disorder to
destroy the topological order in a crystalline solid, as exemplified by
formation of vacancies and thermal disorder. Our work formulates a simple
framework for understanding the physical nature of TPTs with significant
implications in practical applications of topological materials.

around data privacy. The effect is uncertainty as to which technical offerings
adequately match expectations expressed in legal standards. The uncertainty is
exacerbated by a litany of successful privacy attacks, demonstrating that
traditional statistical disclosure limitation techniques often fall short of
the sort of privacy envisioned by legal standards.
  We define predicate singling out, a new type of privacy attack intended to
capture the concept of singling out appearing in the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Informally, an adversary predicate singles out a dataset $X$
using the output of a data release mechanism $M(X)$ if it manages to find a
predicate $p$ matching exactly one row $x \in X$ with probability much better
than a statistical baseline. A data release mechanism that precludes such
attacks is secure against predicate singling out (PSO secure).
  We argue that PSO security is a mathematical concept with legal consequences.
Any data release mechanism that purports to ""render anonymous"" personal data
under the GDPR must be secure against singling out, and hence must be PSO
secure. We then analyze PSO security, showing that it fails to self-compose.
Namely, a combination of $\omega(\log n)$ exact counts, each individually PSO
secure, enables an attacker to predicate single out. In fact, the composition
of just two PSO-secure mechanisms can fail to provide PSO security.
  Finally, we ask whether differential privacy and $k$-anonymity are PSO
secure. Leveraging a connection to statistical generalization, we show that
differential privacy implies PSO security. However, $k$-anonymity does not:
there exists a simple and general predicate singling out attack under mild
assumptions on the $k$-anonymizer and the data distribution.

from $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. We show
that when run for few iterations, the output of Lanczos on $A$ is almost
deterministic. More precisely, we show that for any $ \varepsilon \in (0, 1)$
there exists $c >0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$ and a certain global
property of the spectrum of $A$ (in particular, not depending on $n$) such that
when Lanczos is run for at most $c \log n$ iterations, the output Jacobi
coefficients deviate from their medians by $t$ with probability at most
$\exp(-n^\varepsilon t^2)$ for $t<\Vert A \Vert$. We directly obtain a similar
result for the Ritz values and vectors. Our techniques also yield asymptotic
results: Suppose one runs Lanczos on a sequence of Hermitian matrices $A_n \in
M_n(\mathbb{C})$ whose spectral distributions converge in Kolmogorov distance
with rate $O(n^{-\varepsilon})$ to a density $\mu$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$.
Then we show that for large enough $n$, and for $k=O(\sqrt{\log n})$, the
Jacobi coefficients output after $k$ iterations concentrate around those for
$\mu$. The asymptotic setting is relevant since Lanczos is often used to
approximate the spectral density of an infinite-dimensional operator by way of
the Jacobi coefficients; our result provides some theoretical justification for
this approach.
  In a different direction, we show that Lanczos fails with high probability to
identify outliers of the spectrum when run for at most $c' \log n$ iterations,
where again $c'$ depends only on the same global property of the spectrum of
$A$. Classical results imply that the bound $c' \log n$ is tight up to a
constant factor.

of tolerating byzantine faults. ezBFT's main goal is to minimize the
client-side latency in WAN deployments. It achieves this by (i) having no
designated primary replica, and instead, enabling every replica to order the
requests that it receives from clients; (ii) using only three communication
steps to order requests in the common case; and (iii) involving clients
actively in the consensus process. In addition, ezBFT minimizes the potentially
negative effect of a byzantine replica on the overall system performance. We
developed ezBFT's formal specification in TLA+, show that it provides the
classic properties of BFT protocols including consistency, stability, and
liveness, and developed an implementation. Our experimental evaluation reveals
that ezBFT improves client-side latency by as much as 40% over state-of-the-art

vehicles should be aware of their surroundings and make decisions by
interacting with other road participants. Moreover, different strategies should
be made when the autonomous vehicle is interacting with drivers having
different level of cooperativeness. Whether the vehicle is on the merge-lane or
main-lane will also influence the driving maneuvers since drivers will behave
differently when they have the right-of-way than otherwise. Many traditional
methods have been proposed to solve decision making problems under merging
scenarios. However, these works either are incapable of modeling complicated

handle the uncertainties in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an
interaction-aware decision making with adaptive strategies (IDAS) approach that
can let the autonomous vehicle negotiate the road with other drivers by
leveraging their cooperativeness under merging scenarios. A single policy is
learned under the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting via the
curriculum learning strategy, which enables the agent to automatically infer
other drivers' various behaviors and make decisions strategically. A masking
mechanism is also proposed to prevent the agent from exploring states that
violate common sense of human judgment and increase the learning efficiency. An
exemplar merging scenario was used to implement and examine the proposed

assumption that the file popularity distribution is perfectly known. In this
paper, we consider optimal caching designs for perfect, imperfect and unknown
file popularity distributions in large-scale multi-tier wireless networks.
First, in the case of perfect file popularity distribution, we formulate the
optimization problem to maximize the successful transmission probability (STP),
which is a nonconvex problem. We develop an efficient parallel iterative
algorithm to obtain a stationary point using parallel successive convex
approximation (SCA). Then, in the case of imperfect file popularity
distribution, we formulate the robust optimization problem to maximize the
worst-case STP. To solve this challenging maximin problem, we transform it to
an equivalent complementary geometric programming (CGP), and develop an
efficient iterative algorithm which is shown to converge to a stationary point
using SCA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly
considering the estimation error of file popularity distribution in the
optimization of caching design. Next, in the case of unknown file popularity
distribution, we formulate the stochastic optimization problem to maximize the
stochastic STP (i.e., the STP in the stochastic form), which is a challenging
nonconvex stochastic optimization problem. Based on stochastic parallel SCA, we
develop an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point, by
exploiting structural properties of the stochastic STP and making full use of
instantaneous file requests. As far as we know, this is the first work
considering stochastic optimization in a large-scale multi-tier wireless
network. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the proposed solutions
achieve significant gains over existing schemes in all three cases.

Density estimators have been widely used for unsupervised anomaly detection. By

anomaly label information, which would be valuable for improving the anomaly
detection performance. The proposed method effectively utilizes the anomaly

Then a new training approach is developed based on a state-of-the-art deep RL

blazar science, and the tools designed to generate them. Blazar astrophysics is
becoming increasingly data driven, depending on the integration and combined
analysis of large quantities of data from the entire span of observational
astrophysics techniques. The project was therefore chosen as one of the pilot
activities within the United Nations Open Universe Initiative. In this work we
developed a data analysis pipeline called Swift_deepsky, based on the Swift
XRTDAS software and the XIMAGE package, encapsulated into a Docker container.
Swift_deepsky, downloads and reads low-level data, generates higher-level
products, detects X-ray sources and estimates several intensity and spectral
parameters for each detection, thus facilitating the generation of complete and
up-to-date science-ready catalogues from an entire space-mission dataset. The
Docker version of the pipeline and its derived products is publicly available
from the Open Universe Website at openuniverse.asi.it. We present the results
of a detailed X-ray image analysis based on Swift_deepsky on all Swift XRT
observations including a known blazar, carried out during the first 14 years of
operations of the Swift Observatory. The resulting database includes over
27,000 images integrated in different X-ray bands, and a catalogue, called
1OUSXB, that provides intensity and spectral information for 33,396 X-ray
sources, 8,896 of which are single or multiple detections of 2,308 distinct
blazars. All the results can be accessed on-line in a variety of ways: e.g.,
from the Open Universe portal at openuniverse.asi.it, through Virtual
Observatory services, via the VOU-Blazar tool and the SSDC SED builder. One of
the most innovative aspects of this work is that the results can be safely
reproduced and extended by anyone.

mainly affects the women population. chances of effective treatment increases
with early diagnosis. Mammography is considered one of the effective and proven
techniques for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Tissues around masses look
identical in mammogram, which makes automatic detection process a very
challenging task. They are indistinguishable from the surrounding parenchyma.
In this paper, we present an efficient and automated approach to segment masses
in mammograms. The proposed method uses hierarchical clustering to isolate the
salient area, and then features are extracted to reject false detection. We
applied our method on two popular publicly available datasets (mini-MIAS and
DDSM). A total of 56 images from mini-mias database, and 76 images from DDSM
were randomly selected. Results are explained in-terms of ROC (Receiver
Operating Characteristics) curves and compared with the other techniques.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the proposed
system in automatic mass identification in mammograms.

show that density non-uniformities modify the remote action of the pressure
field. It results into distant velocity correlations being submitted to a
stronger non-linear transfer of energy. A simple example is proposed to
illustrate this property and a spectral analysis of non-linear transfer terms
is undertook to further characterize it. From there, we derive that large
eddies in variable density flows remain permanent for a smaller set of initial
conditions than when density is constant. Permanence strictly applies to
initial spectra having an infrared exponent smaller than 2 instead of 4.

classifiers with different architectures and target classes into a single
classifier, given only a generic set of unlabelled data. We call this problem
Unifying Heterogeneous Classifiers (UHC). This problem is motivated by
scenarios where data is collected from multiple sources, but the sources cannot
share their data, e.g., due to privacy concerns, and only privately trained
models can be shared. In addition, each source may not be able to gather data
to train all classes due to data availability at each source, and may not be
able to train the same classification model due to different computational
resources. To tackle this problem, we propose a generalisation of knowledge
distillation to merge HCs. We derive a probabilistic relation between the
outputs of HCs and the probability over all classes. Based on this relation, we
propose two classes of methods based on cross-entropy minimisation and matrix
factorisation, which allow us to estimate soft labels over all classes from
unlabelled samples and use them in lieu of ground truth labels to train a
unified classifier. Our extensive experiments on ImageNet, LSUN, and Places365
datasets show that our approaches significantly outperform a naive extension of
distillation and can achieve almost the same accuracy as classifiers that are
trained in a centralised, supervised manner.

is well coupled with the neutral gas. In cases where outflows are driven, their
momentum fluxes are always comparable to the observations of nearby

transition of the star formation mode from massive stars to normal solar-type

visualized structures. Seeing that, our goal is to train a DNN to obtain UT
images, when using speech as input. We also test two approaches to represent

to mitigate traffic congestion. However, studies concerning the traffic
dynamics of bicycle flow are very limited. This study experimentally
investigated bicycle flow dynamics on a wide road, modeled using a 3-m-wide
track. The results showed that the bicycle flow rate remained nearly constant
across a wide range of densities, in marked contrast to single-file bicycle
flow, which exhibits a unimodal fundamental diagram. By studying the weight
density of the radial locations of cyclists, we argue that this behavior arises
from the formation of more lanes with the increase of global density. The extra
lanes prevent the longitudinal density from increasing as quickly as in
single-file bicycle flow. When the density is larger than 0.5 bicycles/m2, the
flow rate begins to decrease, and stop-and-go traffic emerges. A
cognitive-science-based model to reproduce bicycle dynamics is proposed, in
which cyclists apply simple cognitive procedures to adapt their target
directions and desired riding speeds. To incorporate differences in
acceleration, deceleration, and turning, different relaxation times are used.
The model can reproduce the experimental results acceptably well and may also
provide guidance on infrastructure design.

learn a mapping for speech-to-speech conversion from a speaker to a target
speaker. However, this method might not be adequate to remove corrupting noise
components for robust ASR because it was designed to convert speech itself. In
this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method based on generative
adversarial nets (GANs) with disentangled representation learning to achieve
robustness in ASR systems. In particular, two separated encoders, context and
domain encoders, are introduced to learn distinct latent variables. The latent
variables allow us to convert the domain of speech according to its context and
domain representation. We improved word accuracies by 6.55~15.70\% for the
CHiME4 challenge corpus by applying a noisy-to-clean environment adaptation for
robust ASR. In addition, similar to the method based on the CycleGAN, this
method can be used for gender adaptation in gender-mismatched recognition.

Instead
of training deep models for this purpose in a blind manner, we propose to
inspect factors that contribute to gaze guidance during daily tasks. Bottom-up
saliency and optical flow are assessed versus strong spatial prior baselines.
Task-specific cues such as vanishing point, manipulation point, and hand
regions are analyzed as representatives of top-down information. We also look
into the contribution of these factors by investigating a simple recurrent
neural model for ego-centric gaze prediction. First, deep features are
extracted for all input video frames. Then, a gated recurrent unit is employed
to integrate information over time and to predict the next fixation. We also
propose an integrated model that combines the recurrent model with several
top-down and bottom-up cues. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets
reveal that (1) spatial biases are strong in egocentric videos, (2) bottom-up
saliency models perform poorly in predicting gaze and underperform spatial
biases, (3) deep features perform better compared to traditional features, (4)
as opposed to hand regions, the manipulation point is a strong influential cue
for gaze prediction, (5) combining the proposed recurrent model with bottom-up
cues, vanishing points and, in particular, manipulation point results in the
best gaze prediction accuracy over egocentric videos, (6) the knowledge
transfer works best for cases where the tasks or sequences are similar, and (7)

two-dimensional magnetic vdW materials, providing new paradigms for spintronic
applications. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we
investigate the spin-dependent electronic transport across vdW magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs) composed of Fe3GeTe2 ferromagnetic electrodes and a graphene
or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) spacer layer. For both types of junctions, we
find that the junction resistance changes by thousands of percent when the
magnetization of the electrodes is switched from parallel to antiparallel. Such
a giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is driven by dissimilar
electronic structure of the two spin-conducting channels in Fe3GeTe2, resulting
in a mismatch between the incoming and outgoing Bloch states in the electrodes
and thus suppressed transmission for an antiparallel-aligned MTJ. The vdW
bounding between electrodes and a spacer layer makes this result virtually
independent of the type of the spacer layer, making the predicted giant TMR
effect robust with respect to strain, lattice mismatch, interface distance and
other parameters which may vary in the experiment. We hope that our results
will further stimulate experimental studies of vdW MTJs and pave the way for
their applications in spintronics.

different thermal management applications. Although physics-based methods, such
as effective medium theory and solving partial differential equation, dominate
the relevant research, there is significant interest to establish the
structure-property linkage through the machine learning method. The performance
of general machine learning methods is highly dependent on features selected to
represent the microstructures. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can
directly extract geometric features of composites, which have been demonstrated
to establish structure-property linkages with high accuracy. However, to obtain
the 3D microstructure in composite is generally challenging in reality. In this
work, we attempt to use 2D cross-section images which can be easier to obtain
in real applications as input of 2D CNNs to predict effective thermal
conductivity of 3D composites. The results show that by using multiple
cross-section images along or perpendicular to the preferred directionality of
the fillers, the prediction accuracy of 2D CNNs can be as good as 3D CNNs. Such
a result is demonstrated with the particle filled composite and a stochastic
complex composite. The prediction accuracy is dependent on the
representativeness of cross-section images used. Multiple cross-section images
can fully determine the shape and distribution of fillers. The average over
multiple images and the use of large-size images can reduce the uncertainty and
increase the prediction accuracy. Besides, since cross-section images along the
heat flow direction can distinguish between serial structures and parallel
structures, they are more representative than cross-section images
perpendicular to the heat flow direction.

Logic of V\""a\""an\""anen from 2007. We study a propositional variant of this
logic (PDL) and investigate a variety of parametrisations with respect to the
central decision problems. The model checking problem (MC) of PDL is
NP-complete. The subject of this research is to identify a list of
parametrisations (formula-size, treewidth, treedepth, team-size, number of
variables) under which MC becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we
show that the number of disjunctions or the arity of dependence atoms
(dep-arity) as a parameter both yield a paraNP-completeness result. Then, we
consider the satisfiability problem (SAT) showing a different picture: under
team-size, or dep-arity SAT is paraNP-complete whereas under all other
mentioned parameters the problem is in FPT. Finally, we introduce a variant of
the satisfiability problem, asking for teams of a given size, and show for this
problem an almost complete picture.

image-based photorealistic 3D face reconstruction. However, face images are
often corrupted by serious occlusion by non-face objects including eyeglasses,

shading information. Therefore, the reconstructed 3D face model is hardly
reusable. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to restore de-occluded face
images based on inverse use of 3DMM and generative adversarial network. We
utilize the 3DMM prior to the proposed adversarial network and combine a global

model. The 3DMM serves not only as geometric prior but also proposes the face
region for the local discriminator. Experiment results confirm the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in removing challenging
types of occlusions with various head poses and illumination. Furthermore, the
proposed method reconstructs the correct 3D face model with de-occluded

superconductivity and spiral magnetism. Neel order is included as a special
case. Close to half-filling, where the pairing gap is much smaller than the
magnetic gap, a simple formula for the phase stiffness in terms of magnetic
quasi-particle bands is derived. The phase stiffness is determined by charge
carriers in small electron or hole pockets in this regime. The general analysis
is complemented by a numerical calculation for the two-dimensional Hubbard
model with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes at a
moderate interaction strength. The resulting phase stiffness exhibits a
striking electron-hole asymmetry. In the ground state, it is larger than the
pairing gap on the hole-doped side, and smaller for electron doping. Hence, in
the hole-doped regime near half-filling the ground state pairing gap sets the
scale for the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature T_c^{KT}, while in the slightly
electron-doped regime T_c^{KT} is determined essentially by the ground state
phase stiffness.

increasing success at learning many computer vision tasks including dense

well-known problems in scene flow estimation. PWOC-3D employs specialized
design decisions to explicitly model these challenges. In this regard, we
propose a novel self-supervised strategy to predict occlusions from images

black hole in orbit around the AGN. Using {\it Chandra} ACIS observations from

separation of 0.42 arcsec means that Cygnus A-2 can not be spatially resolved,
but by comparing the data with simulated \texttt{marx} data, we put an upper
limit to the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of Cygnus A-2 of $1 \times 10^{43}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. Using the Fundamental Plane for accreting black holes, we find that
our upper limit to the X-ray flux of Cygnus A-2 in 2015-2017 disfavours the
interpretation of Cygnus A-2 as a steadily accreting black hole. We suggest
instead that Cygnus A-2 is the radio afterglow of a tidal disruption event
(TDE), and that a peak in the 2-10 keV luminosity of the nuclear region in
2013, when it was observed by {\it Swift} and {\it NuSTAR}, is X-ray emission
from the TDE. A TDE could naturally explain the X-ray light curve of the
nuclear region, as well as the appearance of a short-lived, fast, and ionized
outflow previously detected in the 2013 {\it NuSTAR} spectrum. Both the radio

superstring is determined for background fields satisfying the generalized
supergravity equations (GSE). For this purpose, we revisit the derivation of
the GSE based upon the requirement of kappa-symmetry of the superstring action.
Lifting the constraint of vanishing bosonic torsion components, we are able to
make contact to several different torsion constraints used in the literature.
It is argued that a natural geometric interpretation of the GSE vector field
that generalizes the dilaton is as the torsion vector, which can combine with
the dilatino spinor into the torsion supervector. To find the counterterm, we
use old results for the one-loop effective action of the heterotic sigma model.
The counterterm is covariant and involves the worldsheet torsion for vanishing
curvature, but cannot be constructed as a local functional in terms of the
worldsheet metric. It is shown that the Weyl anomaly cancels without imposing
any further constraints on the background fields. In the case of ordinary
supergravity, it reduces to the Fradkin-Tseytlin counterterm modulo an
additional constraint.

been studied using binary population synthesis. In this work, we take an
alternative approach by focusing only on the second supernova (SN) forming the
DNS and the subsequent orbital decay and merger due to gravitational wave
radiation. Using analytic and numerical methods, we explore how different NS
natal kick velocity distributions, pre-SN orbital separations, and progenitor
He-star masses affect the post-SN orbital periods, eccentricities, merger
times, systemic velocities, and distances traveled by the system before
merging. Comparison with the set of 17 known DNSs in the Milky Way shows that
DNSs have pre-SN orbital separations ranging between 1 and 44 $R_{\odot}$.
Those DNSs with pre-SN separations $\sim$1 $R_{\odot}$ have merger time
distributions that peak $\sim$10-100 Myr after formation, regardless of the
kick velocity received by the NS. These DNSs are typically formed with systemic
velocities $\sim$10$^2$ km s$^{-1}$ and may travel $\sim$1-10 kpc before
merging. Depending on progenitor mass of the second-born NS, the short merger
time can account for the $r$-process enrichment observed in compact stellar
systems such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. For Milky Way-mass galaxies only
DNSs with the tightest pre-SN orbits and large kick velocities ($\gtrsim$10$^2$
km s$^{-1}$) can escape. However, those DNSs that do escape may travel as far
as $\sim$Mpc before merging, which as previous studies have pointed out has
implications for identifying the host galaxies to short gamma ray bursts and
gravitational wave events.

of the IFF phase shows that the former strongly competes with the intersubband

path to the original Wheeler-de Witt (WdW) quantum cosmology, based on a
different representation the commutation relations of the canonical variables.
This polymer representation allows to capture the lattice like structure of the
quantum geometry and leads to a radically different quantum cosmology compared
to the WdW construction. This new quantization scheme has attracted
considerable attention due to the singularity resolution it allows in a wide
class of symmetry reduced gravitational systems, in particular where the WdW
scheme fails. However, as any canonical quantization scheme, ambiguities in the
construction of the quantum theory, being regularization or factor-ordering
ones, can drastically modify the resulting quantum dynamics. In this work, we
propose a new criteria to restrict the quantization ambiguities in the simplest
model of polymer quantum cosmology, for homogeneous and isotropic General
Relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field. This new criteria is
based on an underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ structure present in the
phase space of this simple cosmological model. By preserving the symmetry of
this cosmological system under this 1d conformal group, we derive a new
regularization of the phase space. We perform both its polymer quantization and
a quantization scheme directly providing a representation of the
SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ group action. The resulting quantum cosmology can be viewed
as a lattice-like quantum mechanics with an SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariance. This
provides a new version of Loop Quantum Cosmology consistent with the conformal
symmetry. This alternative construction opens new directions, among which a
possible mapping with the conformal quantum mechanics as well as with recent
matrix or tensor models constructions for quantum cosmological space-time.

machines. Our objective is to maximize the total processing time of accepted
jobs. As soon as a job has been submitted, the commitment constraint forces us
to decide immediately whether we accept or reject the job. Upon acceptance of a
job, we must complete it before its deadline $d$ that satisfies $d \geq
(1+\epsilon)\cdot p + r$, with $p$ and $r$ being the processing time and the
submission time of the job, respectively while $\epsilon>0$ is the slack of the
system. Since the hard case typically arises for near-tight deadlines, we
consider $\varepsilon\leq 1$. We use competitive analysis to evaluate our
algorithms. Our first main contribution is a deterministic preemptive online
algorithm with an almost tight competitive ratio on any number of machines. For
a single machine, the competitive factor matches the optimal bound
$\frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy. Then the
competitive ratio improves with an increasing number of machines and approaches
$(1+\epsilon)\cdot\ln \frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}$ as the number of machines
converges to infinity. This is an exponential improvement over the greedy
acceptance policy for small $\epsilon$. In the non-preemptive case, we present
a deterministic algorithm on $m$ machines with a competitive ratio of $1+m\cdot
\left(\frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}}$. This matches the
optimal bound of $2+\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy for a
single machine while it again guarantees an exponential improvement over the
greedy acceptance policy for small $\epsilon$ and large $m$. In addition, we
determine an almost tight lower bound that approaches $m\cdot

distillation, denoted the neural couplings algorithm (NCA). The NCA yields a

fundamental DAE-based models in music source separation; one with single-layer

one using skip-filtering connections (SF) with a single-layer encoding and

optimized models and test spectral data as input to the NCA. Our experimental
findings show that approaches based on the DAE model learn scalar filtering

Small Magellanic Cloud. It was first detected in 2013, and later that year, SXP
5.05 underwent a massive optical and X-ray outburst. This outburst dwarfs any
other optical event that has been observed for this system during the last 5
years. The large increase in optical brightness of the system implies an
increase in the size and density of the Be star's circumstellar disc. The X-ray
data show two occultations of the neutron star per orbit and is not consistent
with a neutron star passing behind the Be star, and hence the disc is
responsible for these occultations. In this paper, we model the outburst of
Be/neutron star binary SXP 5.05 as being due to a large increase in mass
ejection by the Be star. The neutron star passes directly through the growing
disc, and it is shown that the resulting obscuration can qualitatively explain
the observed X-ray behaviour of the system. We find the only way to reproduce
the timescales of the observed optical behaviour of the system is to increase
the mass ejection substantially for a short time (<2 orbits) and to decrease
the viscosity during the event. The general behaviour of the observed X-ray and
Ha line emission are also reproduced by the model. However, the inferred mass
ejection and viscosity needed to produce a sufficiently rapid increase of disc
size are both higher than suggested by previous works.

relying on application of Bayesian inference that can be used to determine
systematic, unknown phase shifts of multi-qubit states. This method offers
important advantages as compared to Ramsey-type protocols. First, application
of Bayesian inference allows the selection of an adaptive basis for the
measurements which yields the optimal amount of information about the phase
shifts of the state. Secondly, this method can process the outcomes of
different observables at the same time. This leads to a substantial decrease in
the resources needed for the estimation of phases, speeding up the state
characterisation and optimisation in experimental implementations. The proposed
Bayesian inference method can be applied in various physical platforms that are

Specifically, we consider the case where a source (S) transmits confidential

shares its spectrum with S, where S adopts the underlay strategy to control its

After some mathematical manipulations, an exact analytical expression for the

issue for traffic management in an intelligent transportation system. The key
challenge of traffic prediction is to capture spatial and temporal relations
between future traffic flows and historical traffic due to highly dynamical
patterns of human activities. Most existing methods explore such relations by
fusing spatial and temporal features extracted from multi-source data. However,
they neglect position information which helps distinguish patterns on different
positions. In this paper, we propose a position-aware neural network that
integrates data features and position information. Our approach employs the
inception backbone network to capture rich features of traffic distribution on

position embedding technique used in neural language processing to represent
position information as embedding vectors which are learned during the
training. With these embedding vectors, we design position-aware convolution
which allows different kernels to process features of different positions.

spectrometers, which allows to disentangle time-focusing from beam divergence.
The core of this approach is a double rotating-crystal monochromator that can
be used to extract a larger wavelength band from a white beam, thus providing a
higher flux at the sample compared to standard time-of-flight instruments, yet
preserving energy resolution and beam collimation. The performances of a
spectrometer based on this approach are quantitatively discussed in terms of
possible incident wavelengths, flux at the sample and $(Q,E)$-resolution.
Analytical estimates suggest flux gains of about one order of magnitude at
comparable resolutions in comparison to conventional time-of-flight
spectrometers. Moreover, the double monochromator configuration natively shifts
the sample away from the source line-of-sight, thus significantly improving the
signal-to-noise ratio. The latter, in combination with a system that does not
increase the beam divergence, brings the further advantage of a cleaner access
to the low-$Q$ region, which is recognized to be of fundamental interest for
magnetism and for disordered materials, from glasses to biological systems.

challenging problem toward the establishment of an optimized scheme in training

representation indeed sets up a faithful and efficient mapping between input

a dramatically reduced number of parameters. Our method greatly simplifies the

establishing a framework of modern neural networks which might be simpler and

considering non-linear optical detection schemes, which have shown resilience
to extreme amounts of noise. A theoretical model is developed which shows that,

Solar outflows are a considerable source of free energy which
accumulates in multiple forms like beaming (or drifting) components and/or
temperature anisotropies. However, kinetic anisotropies of plasma particles do
not grow indefinitely and particle-particle collisions are not efficient enough
to explain the observed limits of these anisotropies. Instead, the
self-generated wave instabilities can efficiently act to constrain kinetic
anisotropies, but the existing approaches are simplified and do not provide
satisfactory explanations. Thus, small deviations from isotropy shown by the
electron temperature ($T$) in fast solar winds are not explained yet.
  Aims. This paper provides an advanced quasilinear description of the whistler
instability driven by the anisotropic electrons in conditions typical for the
fast solar winds. The enhanced whistler-like fluctuations may constrain the
upper limits of temperature anisotropy $A \equiv T_\perp /T_\parallel > 1$,
where $\perp, \parallel$ are defined with respect to the magnetic field
direction.
  Methods. Studied are the self-generated whistler instabilities, cumulatively
driven by the temperature anisotropy and the relative (counter)drift of the
electron populations, e.g., core and halo electrons. Recent studies have shown
that quasi-stable states are not bounded by the linear instability thresholds
but an extended quasilinear approach is necessary to describe them in this
case.
  Results. Marginal conditions of stability are obtained from a quasilinear
theory of the cumulative whistler instability, and approach the quasi-stable
states of electron populations reported by the observations.The instability
saturation is determined by the relaxation of both the temperature anisotropy
and the relative drift of electron populations.

vertical stacks held together by relatively weak van der Waals forces, allowing
for coupling between monolayer crystals with incommensurate lattices and
arbitrary mutual rotation. A profound consequence of using these degrees of
freedom is the emergence of an overarching periodicity in the local atomic
registry of the constituent crystal structures, known as a moir\'e
superlattice. Its presence in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) structures
led to the observation of electronic minibands, whereas its effect enhanced by
interlayer resonant conditions in twisted graphene bilayers culminated in the
observation of the superconductor-insulator transition at magic twist angles.
Here, we demonstrate that, in semiconducting heterostructures built of
incommensurate MoSe2 and WS2 monolayers, excitonic bands can hybridise,
resulting in the resonant enhancement of the moir\'e superlattice effects.
MoSe2 and WS2 are specifically chosen for the near degeneracy of their
conduction band edges to promote the hybridisation of intra- and interlayer
excitons, which manifests itself through a pronounced exciton energy shift as a
periodic function of the interlayer rotation angle. This occurs as hybridised
excitons (hX) are formed by holes residing in MoSe2 bound to a twist-dependent
superposition of electron states in the adjacent monolayers. For
heterostructures with almost aligned pairs of monolayer crystals, resonant
mixing of the electron states leads to pronounced effects of the
heterostructure's geometrical moir\'e pattern on the hX dispersion and optical
spectrum. Our findings underpin novel strategies for band-structure engineering
in semiconductor devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.

modulations of target musical qualities and continuously mix into new styles.
To this extent we train AEs on an orchestral database of individual note
samples, along with their intrinsic attributes: note class, timbre domain and
extended playing techniques. We condition the decoder for control over the
rendered note attributes and use latent adversarial training for learning
expressive style parameters that can ultimately be mixed. We evaluate both
generative performances and latent representation. Our ablation study
demonstrates the effectiveness of the musical conditioning mechanisms. The
proposed model generates notes as magnitude spectrograms from any probabilistic
latent code samples, with expressive control of orchestral timbres and playing
styles. Its training data subsets can directly be visualized in the 3D latent
representation. Waveform rendering can be done offline with GLA. In order to
allow real-time interactions, we fine-tune the decoder with a pretrained MCNN

encoder could be used to process new input samples, after manipulating their
latent attribute representation, the decoder can generate sample variations as
an audio effect would. Our solution remains rather fast to train, it can
directly be applied to other sound domains, including an user's libraries with

However, mean temperatures are highly degenerate with the timing of

subsequent cooling rates. We post-process a suite of semi-analytic galaxy
formation models to characterise how different thermal statistics of the
intergalactic medium can be used to constrain reionisation. Temperature is
highly correlated with redshift of reionisation for a period of time after the
gas is heated. However as the gas cools, thermal memory of reionisation is
lost, and a power-law temperature-density relation is formed, $T =
T_0(1+\delta)^{1-\gamma}$ with $\gamma \approx 1.5$. Constraining our model
against observations of electron optical depth and temperature at mean density,
we find that reionisation likely finished at $z_{\rm{reion}} = 6.8 ^{+ 0.5}

restricting spectral slope to the range $[0.5,2.5]$ motivated by population II

Fermi systems is an attempt to describe the effect of the band curvature beyond
the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid paradigm. It relies on the observation that the
dynamical structure factor of the interacting electron gas shows a logarithmic
threshold singularity when evaluated to first order perturbation theory in the
two-particle interaction. This term was interpreted as the linear one in an
expansion which was conjectured to resum to a power law. A field theory, the
mobile impurity model, which is constructed such that it provides the power law
in the structure factor, was suggested to be the proper effective model and
used to compute the single-particle spectral function. This forms the basis of
the nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology. Surprisingly, the second order
perturbative contribution to the structure factor was so far not studied. We
first close this gap and show that it is consistent with the conjectured power
law. Secondly, we critically assess the steps leading to the mobile impurity
Hamiltonian. We show that the model does not allow to include the effect of the
momentum dependence of the (bulk) two-particle potential. This dependence was
recently shown to spoil power laws in the single-particle spectral function
which previously were believed to be part of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
universality. Although our second order results for the structure factor are
consistent with power-law scaling, this raises doubts that the conjectured
nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology can be considered as universal. We
conclude that more work is required to clarify this.

This saves a round-trip time for the address validation. Furthermore, we
propose distribution mechanisms for these tokens using DNS resolvers and QUIC

find noticable deviations from a propose strengthening of a bound for the

frameworks of economic complexity and urban scaling into a consistent mechanism

dimensions. Essentially, we propose the use of urban scaling as the basis to
construct and populate a bipartite city-outcome matrix, whose entries are the
deviations from scaling law for a given set of urban outcomes. This matrix
forms the input into the economic complexity methodology, which iterates over a
pair of coupled non-linear maps, computing fitness of cities and complexity of
outcomes. We test our algorithm with data from American cities and find that
the emergent city fitness measure is consistent with desired behavior across
the set of outcomes studied. We also find temporal evolution of city fitness

Overall, these findings suggest that the city complexity mechanism proposed

isotropic and uniform turbulence described by a universal Kolmogorov
power-spectrum with random amplitudes and phases in an optically thin medium.
Following a simple prescription for the 4-term correlation of Fourier
coefficients, we derive generic expressions for the sample mean and variance of
line centroid shift, line broadening and projected velocity structure function.
We perform a numerical validation based on Monte-Carlo simulations for two
popular models of gas emissivity based on the beta-model. Generic expressions
for the sample variance of line centroid shifts and broadening in arbitrary
apertures are derived and match the simulations within their range of
applicability. Generic expressions for the mean and variance of the structure
function are provided and verified against simulations. An application to the
Athena/X-IFU and XRISM/Resolve instruments forecasts the potential of
sensitive, spatially-resolved spectroscopy to probe the inertial range of
turbulent velocity cascades in a Coma-like galaxy cluster.

wealth of information on the dynamics of clusters of galaxies. The global
equilibrium of the ICM is believed to be partially ensured by non-thermal
pressure support, notably the dissipation of energy through turbulent motions.
Accurate mapping of turbulence using X-ray emission lines is challenging due to
the lack of spatially-resolved spectroscopy. Only future instruments such as
the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on Athena will have the spatial and
spectral resolution to quantitatively investigate the ICM turbulence at all
scales. Powerful diagnostics for these studies are line shift and the line
broadening maps, and the second-order structure function. When estimating these
quantities, instruments will be limited by uncertainties of their measurements,
and by the sample variance (aka cosmic variance) of the observation. We extend
here the formalism started in our companion paper I to include the effect of
statistical uncertainties in the estimation of these line diagnostics, in
particular for structure functions. We demonstrate that statistics contribute
to the total variance through different terms, which depend on the geometry of
the detector, the spatial binning and the nature of the turbulent field. These
terms are important when probing the small scales of the turbulence. An
application of these equations is performed for the X-IFU, using synthetic
turbulent velocity maps of a Coma-like cluster of galaxies. Results are in
excellent agreement with the formulas both for the structure function
estimation (<3%) and its variance (<10%). The expressions derived here and in
paper I are generic, and ensure an estimation of the total errors in any X-ray
measurement of turbulent structure functions. They also open the way for
optimisations in the upcoming instrumentation and in observational strategies.

we find that fluctuations close to the mean value of the work exhibit a marked

annihilation generally assume a cross-section which is dominated by a term
independent of velocity ($s$-wave annihilation). However, in many DM models an
$s$-wave annihilation cross-section is absent or helicity suppressed. To
reproduce the correct DM relic density in these models, the leading term in the
cross section is proportional to the DM velocity squared ($p$-wave
annihilation). Indirect detection of such $p$-wave DM is difficult because the
average velocities of DM in galaxies today are orders of magnitude slower than
the DM velocity at the time of decoupling from the primordial thermal plasma,
suppressing the annihilation cross-section today by some five orders of
magnitude relative to its value at freeze out. Thus $p$-wave DM is out of reach
of traditional searches for DM annihilations in the Galactic halo. Near the
region of influence of a central supermassive black hole, such as Sgr A$^*$,
however, DM can form a localized over-density known as a `spike'. In such
spikes the DM is predicted to be both concentrated in space and accelerated to
higher velocities, allowing the $\gamma$-ray signature from its annihilation to
potentially be detectable above the background. We use the $Fermi$ Large Area
Telescope to search for the $\gamma$-ray signature of $p$-wave annihilating DM
from a spike around Sgr A$^*$ in the energy range 10 GeV-600 GeV. Such a signal
would appear as a point source and would have a sharp line or box-like spectral
features difficult to mimic with standard astrophysical processes, indicating a
DM origin. We find no significant excess of $\gamma$ rays in this range, and we
place upper limits on the flux in $\gamma$-ray boxes originating from the

tested on the same data distributions. However, neural classifiers are often
extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input
distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic
segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over the time. By
aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source
domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE
synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This
stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs
well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments,
we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen
domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously
observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to
standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also
experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning.
Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when adapting to a
number of tasks.

hard problem that often requires a considerable amount of chemical intuition
and a component of luck. Experiments struggle in observing short-life
metastable intermediates, while computer simulations often rely upon a good
initial guess. In this work, we propose a method that, from the simulations of
a reactant and a product state, searches for reaction mechanisms connecting the
two by exploring the configuration space through metadynamics, a well known
enhanced molecular dynamics method. The key quantity underlying this search is
based on the use of an approach called Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis
which allows a systematic construction of collective variables.
  Given the reactant and product states, we choose a set of descriptors capable
of discriminating between the two states. In order not to prejudge the results,
generic descriptors are introduced. The fluctuations of the descriptors in the
two states are used to construct collective variables. We use metadynamics in
an exploratory mode to discover the intermediates and the transition states
that lead from reactant to product. The search is at first conducted at a low
theory level. The calculation is then refined and the energy of the
intermediates and transition states discovered during metadynamics is computed
again using a higher level of theory.
  The method's aim is to offer a simple reaction mechanism search procedure
that helps in saving time and is able to find unexpected mechanisms that defy
well established chemical paradigms. We apply it to two reactions, showing that
a high level of complexity can be hidden even in seemingly trivial and small
systems. The method can be applied to larger systems, such as reactions in
solution or catalysis.

across logical isolation boundaries. Even Spectre and Meltdown rely on the
cache side channel, as it provides great resolution and is widely available on
all major CPU platforms. As a consequence, several methods to stop cache
attacks by detecting them have been proposed. Detection is strongly aided by
the fact that observing cache activity of co-resident processes is not possible
without altering the cache state and thereby forcing evictions on the observed
processes. In this work, we show that this widely held assumption is incorrect.
Through clever usage of the cache replacement policy it is possible to track a
victims process cache accesses without forcing evictions on the victim's data.
Hence, online detection mechanisms that rely on these evictions can be
circumvented as they do not detect be the introduced RELOAD+REFRESH attack. The
attack requires a profound understanding of the cache replacement policy. We
present a methodology to recover the replacement policy and apply it to the
last five generations of Intel processors. We further show empirically that the
performance of RELOAD+REFRESH on cryptographic implementations is comparable to
that of other widely used cache attacks, while its detectability becomes
extremely difficult, due to the negligible effect on the victims cache access

understanding of the nature of interaction between nanomaterials and cell
membranes, tissues, and organs, has become increasingly important. Active
penetration of nanoparticles through cell membranes is a fascinating phenomenon
that may have important implications in various biomedical and clinical
applications. Using a fully analytical theory supplemented by particle-based
computer simulations, the penetration process of an active particle through a
planar two-dimensional elastic membrane is studied. The membrane is modeled as
a self-assembled sheet of particles, uniformly arranged on a square lattice. A
coarse-grained model is introduced to describe the mutual interactions between
the membrane particles. The active penetrating particle is assumed to interact
sterically with the membrane particles. State diagrams are presented to fully
characterize the system behavior as functions of the relevant control
parameters governing the transition between different dynamical states. Three
distinct scenarios are identified. These compromise trapping of the active
particle, penetration through the membrane with subsequent self-healing, in
addition to penetration with permanent disruption of the membrane. The latter
scenario is accompanied by a partial fragmentation of the membrane and creation
of a hole of a size exceeding the interaction range of the membrane components.
Our analytical theory is based on a combination of a perturbative expansion
technique and a discrete-to-continuum formulation. Our approach might be
helpful for the prediction of the transition threshold between the trapping and
penetration in real-space experiments involving motile swimming bacteria or
artificial active particles.

system operators for the control of electricity flows in real-time. The
presented game has an aggregative equilibrium which can be attained in a
semi-distributed manner, driving prosumers towards a final exchange of energy
with the grid that benefits both households and operators, favoring the
enforcement of prosumers' local market commitments while respecting the
constraints defined by the operator. The proposed mechanism requires only
one-to-all broadcast of price signals, which do not depend either on the amount
of players or their local objective function and constraints, making the
approach highly scalable. Its impact on distribution grid quality of supply was
evaluated through load flow analysis and realistic load profiles, demonstrating
the capacity of the mechanism ensure that voltage deviation and thermal limit

Bandres et al. (2018) introduced a rollout version of the Iterated Width

the pixel setting of the Atari games suite. In this setting, planning is done
on-line using the ""screen"" states and selecting actions by looking ahead into
the future. However, this algorithm is purely exploratory and does not leverage
past reward information. Furthermore, it requires the state to be factored into
features that need to be pre-defined for the particular task, e.g., the B-PROST
pixel features. In this work, we extend width-based planning by incorporating
an explicit policy in the action selection mechanism. Our method, called
$\pi$-IW, interleaves width-based planning and policy learning using the
state-actions visited by the planner. The policy estimate takes the form of a
neural network and is in turn used to guide the planning step, thus reinforcing
promising paths. Surprisingly, we observe that the representation learned by
the neural network can be used as a feature space for the width-based planner
without degrading its performance, thus removing the requirement of pre-defined
features for the planner. We compare $\pi$-IW with previous width-based methods

filtering of image phase estimates and inversion of the phase to susceptibility
relationship. A wide variety of quantification errors, robustness limitations,
and artifacts plague QSM algorithms. To overcome these limitations, a robust
deep-learning-based single-step QSM reconstruction approach is proposed and
demonstrated. This neural network was trained using magnetostatic physics
simulations based on in-vivo data sources. Random perturbations were added to
the physics simulations to provide sufficient input-label pairs for the
training purposes. The network was quantitatively tested using gold-standard
in-silico labeled datasets against established QSM total field inversion
approaches. In addition, the algorithm was applied to susceptibility-weighted
imaging (SWI) data collected on a cohort of clinical subjects with brain
hemmhorage. When quantitatively compared against gold-standard in-silico

High quality QSM were consistently estimated from clinical
susceptibility-weighted data on 100 subjects without any noticeable inversion
failures. The proposed approach was able to robustly generate high quality QSM
with improved accuracy in in-silico gold-standard experiments. QSM produced by
the proposed method can be generated in real-time on existing MRI scanner

regarding prior claims for the features that we referred to as the Galactic
Center Chimneys (2019, Nature, 567, 347), we point out the following:
  1) The Nakashima et al. 2019 paper appeared in the arXiv on March 8th
(1903.02571), after our paper was in the final stage of printing (accepted on
January 30th). It is however interesting to see that the morphology of the
brightest portions of the two results are in broad agreement (compare their
Fig. 1 to our Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2).
  2) Nakashima et al. 2013 ApJ 773, 20 claim the discovery of a blob of
recombining plasma ~1deg south of Sgr A*, implying peculiar abundances. Again,
their image (Fig. 1) agrees with the brightest portions of our images, although
it does not show any direct connection between the plasma blob and the central
parsec (e.g., such as the quasi-continuous chimney that we reported), nor
evidence for an outflow from the center. We apologize for overlooking an
appropriate citation to this contribution by Nakashima et al.
  3) We fitted the XMM-Newton and Chandra data at the same position of the
claimed recombining plasma and we did not find any clear-cut evidence for the
presence of either an over-ionised plasma or peculiar abundances. Future X-ray
calorimetric observations will presumably clarify this disagreement.
  4) The continuity of the Chimney features, their quasi-symmetrical placement
relative to Sgr A*, and their relatively sharp and well-defined edges are the
essential features of our data that have led us to propose that the Chimneys
are a unified columnar structure that represents a channel for the outflow of
energy from the central region, possibly contributing to the stocking of the
relativistic particle population manifested in the Fermi Bubbles.

here the general link between spacetime thermodynamics and Weyl transformations
from two other angles. We first examine the conformal behaviour of the horizon

Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's field equations, the starting point of
which is precisely built on the fundamental dichotomy between matter and

to yield the right Einstein field equations in the conformal frame, a specific
conformal behavior of the horizon temperature and its entropy $-$ different
from what Wald's approach implies $-$ is required. The two approaches to

adjust the deep network to multi-task learning problem, we propose to learn a
low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be
explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of
one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which
is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer,
and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize
another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty, so that the useful features
learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by
an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation
algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark data sets of
multiple face attribute prediction, multi-task natural language processing, and
joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of
the low-rank deep CNN model over multi-task problems.

apparently unrelated systems or quantities in virtually every branch of
physics. Systems that are mapped onto themselves by a duality transformation
are called self-dual and they often exhibit remarkable properties, as
exemplified by an Ising magnet at the critical point. In this Letter, we unveil
the role of dualities in mechanics by considering a family of so-called twisted
Kagome lattices. These are reconfigurable structures that can change shape
thanks to a collapse mechanism easily illustrated using LEGO. Surprisingly,
pairs of distinct configurations along the mechanism exhibit the same spectrum
of vibrational modes. We show that this puzzling property arises from the
existence of a duality transformation between pairs of configurations on either
side of a mechanical critical point. This critical point corresponds to a
self-dual structure whose vibrational spectrum is two-fold degenerate over the
entire Brillouin zone. The two-fold degeneracy originates from a general
version of Kramers theorem that applies to classical waves in addition to
quantum systems with fermionic time-reversal invariance. We show that the
vibrational modes of the self-dual mechanical systems exhibit non-Abelian
geometric phases that affect the semi-classical propagation of wave packets.
Our results apply to linear systems beyond mechanics and illustrate how
dualities can be harnessed to design metamaterials with anomalous symmetries
and non-commuting responses.

down-sample the points regardless of their importance for the output. As a
result, some important points in the point cloud may be removed, while less

down-sampling methods sample the points by taking into account the importance

points. Unlike most graph-based point cloud down-sampling methods that use
$k$-NN search algorithm to find the neighbouring points, CPL is a global

users (or items) from the corresponding one-mode projection category network.
Moreover, considering the dependency on parameter settings and information loss
problem in clustering methods, we use a novel spectral clustering method, which
is based on dynamic nearest-neighbors (DNN) and a novel automatically
determining cluster number (ADCN) method that determines the cluster centers
based on the normal distribution method, to cluster the users and items
separately. After clustering, we propose the two-phase personalized
recommendation to realize the personalized recommendation of items for each
user. A series of experiments validate the outstanding performance of our
N2VSCDNNR over several advanced embedding and side information based
recommendation algorithms. Meanwhile, N2VSCDNNR seems to have lower time
complexity than the baseline methods in online recommendations, indicating its
potential to be widely applied in large-scale systems.

  Relation Inference",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider advancing web-scale knowledge extraction and
alignment by integrating OpenIE extractions in the form of (subject, predicate,
object) triples with Knowledge Bases (KB). Traditional techniques from
universal schema and from schema mapping fall in two extremes: either they
perform instance-level inference relying on embedding for (subject, object)
pairs, thus cannot handle pairs absent in any existing triples; or they perform
predicate-level mapping and completely ignore background evidence from
individual entities, thus cannot achieve satisfying quality. We propose OpenKI
to handle sparsity of OpenIE extractions by performing instance-level
inference: for each entity, we encode the rich information in its neighborhood
in both KB and OpenIE extractions, and leverage this information in relation
inference by exploring different methods of aggregation and attention. In order
to handle unseen entities, our model is designed without creating
entity-specific parameters. Extensive experiments show that this method not
only significantly improves state-of-the-art for conventional OpenIE
extractions like ReVerb, but also boosts the performance on OpenIE from
semi-structured data, where new entity pairs are abundant and data are fairly
sparse.

ratings and reviews. Research and recently also tool vendors have proposed
analytics and data mining solutions to leverage this feedback to developers and
analysts, e.g., for supporting release decisions. Research also showed that
positive feedback improves apps' downloads and sales figures and thus their
success. As a side effect, a market for fake, incentivized app reviews emerged
with yet unclear consequences for developers, app users, and app store
operators. This paper studies fake reviews, their providers, characteristics,
and how well they can be automatically detected. We conducted disguised
questionnaires with 43 fake review providers and studied their review policies
to understand their strategies and offers. By comparing 60,000 fake reviews
with 62 million reviews from the Apple App Store we found significant
differences, e.g., between the corresponding apps, reviewers, rating
distribution, and frequency. This inspired the development of a simple
classifier to automatically detect fake reviews in app stores. On a labelled
and imbalanced dataset including one-tenth of fake reviews, as reported in
other domains, our classifier achieved a recall of 91% and an AUC/ROC value of
98%. We discuss our findings and their impact on software engineering, app
users, and app store operators.

  Taxonomy",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic health record (EHR) systems are used extensively throughout the
healthcare domain. However, data interchangeability between EHR systems is
limited due to the use of different coding standards across systems. Existing
methods of mapping coding standards based on manual human experts mapping,
dictionary mapping, symbolic NLP and classification are unscalable and cannot
accommodate large scale EHR datasets.
  In this work, we present Text2Node, a cross-domain mapping system capable of
mapping medical phrases to concepts in a large taxonomy (such as SNOMED CT).
The system is designed to generalize from a limited set of training samples and
map phrases to elements of the taxonomy that are not covered by training data.
As a result, our system is scalable, robust to wording variants between coding
systems and can output highly relevant concepts when no exact concept exists in
the target taxonomy. Text2Node operates in three main stages: first, the
lexicon is mapped to word embeddings; second, the taxonomy is vectorized using
node embeddings; and finally, the mapping function is trained to connect the
two embedding spaces. We compared multiple algorithms and architectures for
each stage of the training, including GloVe and FastText word embeddings, CNN
and Bi-LSTM mapping functions, and node2vec for node embeddings. We confirmed
the robustness and generalisation properties of Text2Node by mapping ICD-9-CM
Diagnosis phrases to SNOMED CT and by zero-shot training at comparable
accuracy.
  This system is a novel methodological contribution to the task of normalizing
and linking phrases to a taxonomy, advancing data interchangeability in
healthcare. When applied, the system can use electronic health records to
generate an embedding that incorporates taxonomical medical knowledge to
improve clinical predictive models.
