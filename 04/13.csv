  Review of Defenses Against Attacks",,"Proceedings of the IEEE, March. 2020",,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is great potential for damage from adversarial learning (AL) attacks on
machine-learning based systems. In this paper, we provide a contemporary survey
of AL, focused particularly on defenses against attacks on statistical
classifiers. After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of
possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on
test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), and reverse engineering (RE)
attacks and particularly defenses against same. In so doing, we distinguish
robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from
supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not
have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis; we identify the hyperparameters a
particular method requires, its computational complexity, as well as the
performance measures on which it was evaluated and the obtained quality. We
then dig deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom
and that target unresolved issues, including: 1) robust classification versus
AD as a defense strategy; 2) the belief that attack success increases with
attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; 3) small perturbations for
test-time evasion attacks: a fallacy or a requirement?; 4) validity of the
universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the
example to be attacked; 5) black, grey, or white box attacks as the standard
for defense evaluation; 6) susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense.
We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present
benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP
attacks on images. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work.

causing the quasistatic approximation to break down. Finally, we focus on our

twisted bilayers have been mostly discussed so far in terms of strong electron
correlation, with little or no attention to phonons and electron-phonon
effects. We found that, among the 33492 phonons of a fully relaxed
$\theta=1.08^\circ$ twisted bilayer, there are few special, hard and nearly
dispersionless modes that resemble global vibrations of the moir\'e supercell,
as if it were a single, ultralarge molecule. One of them, doubly degenerate at
$\Gamma$ with symmetry $A_1+B_1$, couples very strongly with the valley degrees
of freedom, also doubly degenerate, realizing a so-called
$\text{E}\otimes\text{e}$ Jahn-Teller (JT) coupling. The JT coupling lifts very
efficiently all degeneracies which arise from the valley symmetry, and may
lead, for an average atomic displacement as small as $0.5~$mA, to an insulating
state at charge neutrality. This insulator possesses a non-trivial topology
testified by the odd winding of the Wilson loop. In addition, freezing the same
phonon at a zone boundary point brings about insulating states at most integer
occupancies of the four ultra-flat electronic bands. Following that line, we
further study the properties of the superconducting state that might be
stabilized by these modes. Since the JT coupling modulates the hopping between
AB and BA stacked regions, pairing occurs in the spin-singlet Cooper channel at
the inter-(AB-BA) scale, which may condense a superconducting order parameter
in the extended $s$-wave and/or $d\pm id$-wave symmetry.

computational assumptions. In this contribution we define a simpler (basic)

constructed based on known trapdoor one-way functions, resulting to the

inflationary scenario with an intermediate break stage. Because of the
transitions, the power spectrum deviates from the vacuum one and there will
appear oscillatory behavior. In the case of a scalar-type curvature
perturbation, it is known that the amplitude of these oscillations may be
enhanced to result in the power spectrum larger than the one for the vacuum
case. One might expect the similar enhancement for the tensor perturbation as
well. Unfortunately, it is found that when the equation of state (EOS)
parameter $w=p/\rho$ of the break stage is a constant with $w>-1/3$, the
amplitude of oscillations is never large enough to enhance the power spectrum.
On the contrary, the power spectrum is found to be suppressed even on those
scales that leave the horizon at the first inflationary stage and remain
superhorizon throughout the entire stage. We identify the cause of this
suppression with the correction terms in additional to the leading order
constant solution on superhorizon scales. We argue that our result is general
in the sense that any intermediate break stage during inflation cannot yield an
enhancement of the tensor spectrum as long as the Hubble expansion rate is
non-increasing in time.

different subfields and pinpoint which areas are more likely to attract or
donate researchers to the other ones. Overall, our results depict a very

field in the solar atmosphere is fundamental for understanding its dynamics.
Volume information on the magnetic field mostly relies on coupling 3D
reconstruction methods with photospheric and/or chromospheric surface vector
magnetic fields. Infrared coronal polarimetry could provide additional
information to better constrain magnetic field reconstructions. However,
combining such data with reconstruction methods is challenging, e.g., because
of the optical-thinness of the solar corona and the lack and limitations of
stereoscopic polarimetry. To address these issues, we introduce the
Data-Optimized Coronal Field Model (DOCFM) framework, a model-data fitting
approach that combines a parametrized 3D generative model, e.g., a magnetic
field extrapolation or a magnetohydrodynamic model, with forward modeling of
coronal data. We test it with a parametrized flux rope insertion method and
infrared coronal polarimetry where synthetic observations are created from a
known ""ground truth"" physical state. We show that this framework allows us to
accurately retrieve the ground truth 3D magnetic field of a set of force-free
field solutions from the flux rope insertion method. In observational studies,
the DOCFM will provide a means to force the solutions derived with different
reconstruction methods to satisfy additional, common, coronal constraints. The
DOCFM framework therefore opens new perspectives for the exploitation of
coronal polarimetry in magnetic field reconstructions and for developing new
techniques to more reliably infer the 3D magnetic fields that trigger solar
flares and coronal mass ejections.

a greedy algorithm, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in the context of
continuous parametric dictionaries. Here, the continuous setting means that the
dictionary is made up of an infinite uncountable number of atoms. In this work,
we rely on the Hilbert structure of the observation space to express our
recovery results as a property of the kernel defined by the inner product
between two atoms. Using a continuous extension of Tropp's Exact Recovery
Condition, we identify key assumptions allowing to analyze OMP in the
continuous setting. Under these assumptions, OMP unambiguously identifies in
exactly $k$ steps the atom parameters from any observed linear combination of
$k$ atoms. These parameters play the role of the so-called support of a sparse
representation in traditional sparse recovery. In our paper, any kernel and set
of parameters that satisfy these conditions are said to be admissible. In the
one-dimensional setting, we exhibit a family of kernels relying on completely
monotone functions for which admissibility holds for any set of atom
parameters. For higher dimensional parameter spaces, the analysis turns out to
be more subtle. An additional assumption, so-called axis admissibility, is
imposed to ensure a form of delayed recovery (in at most $k^D$ steps, where $D$
is the dimension of the parameter space). Furthermore, guarantees for recovery
in exactly $k$ steps are derived under an additional algebraic condition
involving a finite subset of atoms (built as an extension of the set of atoms
to be recovered). We show that the latter technical conditions simplify in the
case of Laplacian kernels, allowing us to derive simple conditions for $k$-step
exact recovery, and to carry out a coherence-based analysis in terms of a
minimum separation assumption between the atoms to be recovered.

few exact inference approaches, they do not work on large data sets. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for inferring a decision tree of a minimum
depth based on the incremental generation of Boolean formula. The experimental
results indicate that it scales sufficiently well and the time it takes to run
grows slowly with the size of dataset.

$(X-Y)/\sqrt{2}$; the prover receives a uniformly random eigenstate of the

moreover, the verifier can check with high confidence whether the preparation

elementary building block in many quantum cryptographic protocols. We expect
our implementation of ""random remote state preparation with verification"", a
functionality first defined in (Dunjko and Kashefi 2014), to be useful for
removing the need for quantum communication in such protocols while keeping

properties. Direct measurement of stellar angular diameters is difficult: at
interstellar distances stars are generally too small to resolve by any
individual imaging telescope. This fundamental limitation can be overcome by
studying the diffraction pattern in the shadow cast when an asteroid occults a
star, but only when the photometric uncertainty is smaller than the noise added
by atmospheric scintillation. Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes used for
particle astrophysics observations have not generally been exploited for
optical astronomy due to the modest optical quality of the mirror surface.
However, their large mirror area makes them well suited for such
high-time-resolution precision photometry measurements. Here we report two
occultations of stars observed by the VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes with
millisecond sampling, from which we are able to provide a direct measurement of
the occulted stars' angular diameter at the $\leq0.1$ milliarcsecond scale.
This is a resolution never achieved before with optical measurements and
represents an order of magnitude improvement over the equivalent lunar
occultation method. We compare the resulting stellar radius with empirically
derived estimates from temperature and brightness measurements, confirming the
latter can be biased for stars with ambiguous stellar classifications.

Monte-Carlo simulations to constrain the ranges of binary orbital parameters

source node needs to disseminate a message to all other $n-1$ nodes. An
adversary called Eve, which captures environmental noise and potentially
malicious interference, aims to disrupt this process via jamming. Assume
sending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot costs unit
energy. The question is, if Eve spends $T$ units of energy on jamming, can we
devise broadcast algorithms in which each node's cost is $o(T)$? Previous
results show such resource competitive algorithms do exist in the
single-channel setting: each node can receive the message within
$\tilde{O}(T+n)$ time slots while spending only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n}+1)$
energy.
  In this paper, we show that when Eve is oblivious, the existence of multiple
channels allows even faster message dissemination, while preserving resource
competitiveness. Specifically, we have identified an efficient ""epidemic
broadcast"" scheme in the multi-channel setting that is robust again jamming.
Extending this scheme leads to a randomized algorithm called MultiCast which
uses $n/2$ channels, and accomplishes broadcast in $\tilde{O}(T/n+1)$ time
slots while costing each node only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n}+1)$ energy. When the
value of $n$ is unknown, we further propose MultiCastAdv, in which each node's
running time is $\tilde{O}(T/(n^{1-2\alpha})+n^{2\alpha})$, and each node's
cost is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/(n^{1-2\alpha})}+n^{2\alpha})$. Here, $0<\alpha<1/4$
is a tunable parameter affecting the constant hiding behind the big-$O$
notation.
  To handle the issue of limited channel availability, we have also devised
variants for both MultiCast and MultiCastAdv that can work in networks in which
only $C$ channels are available, for any $C\geq 1$. These variants remain to be
resource competitive, and have (near) optimal time complexity in many cases.

Here, we present a framework to compute reliable errors in prediction for
Neural Networks using Test-Time Dropout and Conformal Prediction. Specifically,
the algorithm consists of training a single Neural Network using dropout, and
then applying it N times to both the validation and test sets, also employing
dropout in this step. Therefore, for each instance in the validation and test
sets an ensemble of predictions were generated. The residuals and absolute
errors in prediction for the validation set were then used to compute
prediction errors for test set instances using Conformal Prediction. We show
using 24 bioactivity data sets from ChEMBL 23 that dropout Conformal Predictors
are valid (i.e., the fraction of instances whose true value lies within the
predicted interval strongly correlates with the confidence level) and
efficient, as the predicted confidence intervals span a narrower set of values
than those computed with Conformal Predictors generated using Random Forest
(RF) models. Lastly, we show in retrospective virtual screening experiments
that dropout and RF-based Conformal Predictors lead to comparable retrieval
rates of active compounds. Overall, we propose a computationally efficient
framework (as only N extra forward passes are required in addition to training
a single network) to harness Test-Time Dropout and the Conformal Prediction
framework, and to thereby generate reliable prediction errors for deep Neural
Networks.

derive sizes and albedos using radiometric techniques. We determine the
power-law slope of ejection velocity as a function of effective diameter. The
detected Haumea family members have a diversity of geometric albedos $\sim$
0.3-0.8, which are higher than geometric albedos of dynamically similar objects
without water ice. The median geometric albedo for accepted family members is
$p_V=0.48_{-0.18}^{+0.28}$, compared to 0.08$_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$ for the
dynamical interlopers. In the size range $D=175-300$ km, the slope of the
cumulative size distribution is $q$=3.2$_{-0.4}^{+0.7}$ for accepted family
members, steeper than the $q$=2.0$\pm$0.6 slope for the dynamical interlopers
with D$< $500 km. The total mass of Haumea's moons and family members is 2.4%
of Haumea's mass. The ejection velocities required to emplace them on their
current orbits show a dependence on diameter, with a power-law slope of
0.21-0.50.

many years. Recent measurements of the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts by
NuSTAR and Swift-BAT are unable to be simultaneously described by existing XRB
synthesis models, indicating a fundamental breakdown in our understanding of
AGN evolution. Here we show that the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts can be
successfully modeled with an XRB synthesis model in which the reflection
strength ($R$) in the spectral model increases with redshift. We show that an
increase in reflection strength with redshift is a natural outcome of (1)
connecting $R$ to the incidence of high column density gas around AGNs, and (2)
the growth in the AGN obscured fraction to higher redshifts. In addition to the
redshift evolution of $R$, we also find tentative evidence that an increasing
Compton-thick fraction with $z$ is necessary to describe the $8$--$24$ keV AGN
number counts determined by NuSTAR. These results show that, in contrast to the
traditional orientation-based AGN unification model, the nature and covering
factor of the absorbing gas and dust around AGNs evolve over time and must be
connected to physical processes in the AGN environment. Future XRB synthesis
models must allow for the redshift evolution of AGN spectral parameters. This
approach may reveal fundamental connections between AGNs and their host
galaxies.

$O_{p}(1)$, exact recovery of true change-points can be achieved in the

the change-point estimator under the infill asymptotics framework where the
time domain is increasing while the spatial sampling domain is fixed. A
computationally efficient pruned dynamic programming algorithm is developed for
the challenging criterion optimization problem. Extensive simulation studies

group-theoretical approach to construct the order N Taylor series of a
d-dimensional crystal purely in terms of space group irreducible derivatives
(ID), which guarantees symmetry by construction and allows for a practical
means of communicating and storing phonons and their interactions. Second, we
prove that the smallest possible supercell which accommodates N given
wavevectors in a d-dimensional crystal is determined using the Smith Normal
Form of the matrix formed from the corresponding wavevectors; resulting in
negligible computational cost to find said supercell, in addition to providing
the maximum required multiplicity for uniform supercells at arbitrary N and d.
Third, we develop a series of finite displacement methodologies to compute
phonons and their interactions which exploit the first two developments: lone
and bundled irreducible derivative (LID and BID) approaches. LID computes a
single ID, or as few as possible, at a time in the smallest supercell possible,
while BID exploits perturbative derivatives for some order less than N (e.g.
Hellman-Feynman forces) in order to extract all ID in the smallest possible
supercells using the fewest possible computations. Finally, we derive an
equation for the order N-2 volume derivatives of the phonons in terms of the
order N ID. Given that the former are easily computed, they can be used as a
stringent, infinite ranged test of the ID. Our general framework is illustrated
on graphene, yielding irreducible phonon interactions to fifth order.
Additionally, we provide a cost analysis for the rock-salt structure at N=3,

we perform a series of three dimensional hydrodynamics simulations in a
controlled manner. We insert a point particle mimicking a fragment in a
self-gravitating disk, where the initial mass and position are free parameters,
and follow the orbital evolution for several tens of orbits. The results show
great diversity even with such simple experiments. Some particles shortly merge
away after migrating inward, but others survive as the migration stalls with
the gap-opening in the disk. We find that our results are well interpreted
postulating that the orbital angular momentum is extracted by (i) the
gravitational torque from the disk spiral structure, and (ii) tidal disruption
of a gravitationally-bound envelope around the particle. Our analytic
evaluations show the processes (i) and (ii) are effective in an outer and inner

AGNs is to use X-ray observations, only sources that are widely separated
relative to the instrument PSF are easy to identify. It becomes increasingly
difficult to distinguish dual AGNs from single AGNs when the separation is on
the order of Chandra's angular resolution (<1''). Using likelihood models for

of an AGN for a given source. Specifically, we present results from BAYMAX
analyzing the lowest-mass dual AGN candidate to date, SDSS J0914+0853, where
archival Chandra data shows a possible secondary AGN ~0.3'' from the primary.
Analyzing a new 50 ks Chandra observation, results from BAYMAX shows that SDSS
J0914+0853 is most likely a single AGN with a Bayes factor of 13.5 in favor of
a single point source model. Further, posterior distributions from the dual
point source model are consistent with emission from a single AGN. We find the
probability of SDSS J0914+0853 being a dual AGN system with a flux ratio f>0.3

This paper alleviates this issue by proposing a novel framework to replace the

the Average-Precision loss (AP-loss) for the ranking problem. Due to its
non-differentiability and non-convexity, the AP-loss cannot be optimized
directly. For this purpose, we develop a novel optimization algorithm, which
seamlessly combines the error-driven update scheme in perceptron learning and
backpropagation algorithm in deep networks. We verify good convergence property
of the proposed algorithm theoretically and empirically. Experimental results
demonstrate notable performance improvement in state-of-the-art one-stage

resolution observations of AGB stars at (sub)millimetre wavelengths can now
directly determine the morphology, activity, density, and temperature close to
the stellar photosphere. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) high angular resolution observations to resolve the extended
atmospheres of four of the nearest AGB stars: W Hya, Mira A, R Dor and R Leo.
We interpreted the observations using a parameterised atmosphere model. We
resolve all four AGB stars and determine the brightness temperature structure
between $1$ and $2$ stellar radii. For W Hya and R Dor we confirm the existence
of hotspots with brightness temperatures $>3000$ to $10000$~K. All four stars
show deviations from spherical symmetry. We find variations on a timescale of
days to weeks, and for R Leo we directly measure an outward motion of the
millimetre wavelength surface with a velocity of at least
$10.6\pm1.4$~km~s$^{-1}$. For all objects but W Hya we find that the
temperature-radius and size-frequency relations require the existence of a
(likely inhomogeneous) layer of enhanced opacity. The ALMA observations provide
a unique probe of the structure of the extended AGB atmosphere. We find highly
variable structures of hotspots and likely convective cells. In the future,
these observations can be directly compared to multi-dimensional chromosphere
and atmosphere models that determine the temperature, density, velocity, and
ionisation structure between the stellar photosphere and the dust formation
region. However, our results show that for the best interpretation, both very
accurate flux calibration and near-simultaneous observations are essential.

long-term on prenatal and postnatal neurodevelopmental trajectories. These
events impact many information molecules, including both vitamin D and
cortisol. Both have been linked to low birth premature babies. Cortisol tends
to be further elevated in women, while vitamin D tends to be decreased from
their normal levels during pregnancy. One facilitates labor in part by
elevating placental CRH, the other by limiting CRH in placental tissue. Both
are linked to managing adversity. Studies in large animal models with high
resemblance to human physiology are sparse to model the changes induced by such
stress exposure. Using an established pregnant sheep model of stress during
human development, here we focused on measuring the changes in maternal Vitamin
D and cortisol responses due to chronic inescapable stress mimicking daily
challenges in the last trimester of human pregnancy. The present pilot data
show that chronic maternal stress during pregnancy results in endocrine and

challenges. Chronic stress appears to disrupt a physiological relationship
between oscillations of vitamin D and cortisol. These speculations need to be
explored in future studies.

shows near-wall and centerline maxima compatible with a turbophoretic drift
down the gradient of turbulence intensity; the particles travel at similar
speed as the unladen flow except in the near-wall region; and their velocity
fluctuations generally follow the unladen flow level over the channel core,
exceeding it in the near-wall region. The denser regime presents substantial
differences in all measured statistics: the near-wall concentration peak is
much more pronounced, while the centerline maximum is absent; the mean particle
velocity decreases over the logarithmic and buffer layers; and particle
velocity fluctuations and deposition velocities are enhanced. Analysis of the
spatial distributions of particle positions and velocities reveals dense,
elongated clusters forming in the core, which tend to be preferentially aligned
with the streamwise direction, and travel faster than the less concentrated
particles. In the near-wall region, the particles arrange in highly elongated
streaks associated to negative streamwise velocity fluctuations, several
channel heights in length and spaced by $O(100)$ wall units, supporting the
view that these are coupled to fluid low-speed streaks typical of wall

requiring higher-order derivatives of the approximated fields and limited to
simply connected surfaces, or represent tangential tensor fields as tensor

the tensor fields. The main idea is to construct maps between the element
parametrizations and a local Monge parametrization around each node. We test
the LMP method by approximating in a least-squares sense different vector and
tensor fields on simply connected and genus-1 surfaces. Furthermore, we apply
the LMP method to two physical models on surfaces, involving a tension-driven
flow (vector-valued PDE) and nematic ordering (tensor-valued PDE). The LMP
method thus solves the long-standing problem of the interpolation of tensors on
general surfaces with an optimal number of degrees of freedom.

devoted to the problem of lossy compression, to shed light on an important
problem in latent variable modeling of data: is there room to improve the
model? One way to address this question is to find an upper bound on the
probability (equivalently a lower bound on the negative log likelihood) that
the model can assign to some data as one varies the prior and/or the likelihood
function in a latent variable model. The core of our contribution is to
formally show that the problem of optimizing priors in latent variable models
is exactly an instance of the variational optimization problem that information
theorists solve when computing rate-distortion functions, and then to use this
to derive a lower bound on negative log likelihood. Moreover, we will show that
if changing the prior can improve the log likelihood, then there is a way to
change the likelihood function instead and attain the same log likelihood, and
thus rate-distortion theory is of relevance to both optimizing priors as well
as optimizing likelihood functions. We will experimentally argue for the
usefulness of quantities derived from rate-distortion theory in latent variable
modeling by applying them to a problem in image modeling.

analysis is based on ALMA $^{12}$CO (2-1) line and 1.37 mm continuum
observations at an angular resolution of $\sim$0.4$^{\prime\prime}$. The
pseudo-disc is a bright feature in the CO position-velocity diagram (PVD),
elongated in a direction perpendicular to the jet axis, with a total (gas+dust)
mass of $\sim$0.02 M$_{\odot}$, size of 165-192 AU, and a velocity spread of
$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$. The large velocity gradient is a combination of infalling
and rotational motions, indicating a contribution from a pseudo-disc and an
unresolved inner Keplerian disc. There is weak emission detected in the
H$_{2}$CO (3-2) and N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ (3-2) lines. H$_{2}$CO emission likely
probes the inner Keplerian disc where CO is expected to be frozen, while
N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ possibly originates from an enhanced clump at the outer edge of
the pseudo-disc. We have considered various models (core collapse, disc
fragmentation, circum-binary disc) that can fit both the observed CO spectrum
and the position-velocity offsets. The observed morphology, velocity structure,
and the physical dimensions of the pseudo-disc are consistent with the
predictions from the core collapse simulations for brown dwarf formation. From
the best model fit, we can constrain the age of the proto-brown dwarf system to
be $\sim$30,000-40,000 yr. A comparison of the H$_{2}$ column density derived

At present, the widely used aqueous solution approaches suffer from poor

preferentially at the electron rich defect edges, which act as reducing agents

controlled synthesis of AuNPs on the basal plane of semiconducting molybdenum

eliminates problems of poor dispersion of AuNPs@2H-MoS2 NS hybrids, whereas at
the same time maintains the semiconducting crystalline quality of the pristine
2H-MoS2 NSs. In addition, the study establishes the important role of trisodium
citrate, on enhancing the nucleation and improving the hybridization of AuNPs
on 2H-MoS2 NSs as evidenced by the induced p-type doping. This organic solvent

detect either individual {\nu}+{\gamma} transient sources (durations {\delta}t

a statistical excess of {\nu}+{\gamma} transients of lower multiplicities.
Treating ANTARES track and cascade event types separately, we establish
detection thresholds by Monte Carlo scrambling of the neutrino data, and
determine our analysis sensitivity by signal injection against scrambled
datasets. We find our analysis is sensitive to {\nu}+{\gamma} transient
populations responsible for $>$5\% of the observed gamma-coincident neutrinos
in the track data at 90\% confidence. Applying our analysis to the unscrambled
data reveals no individual {\nu}+{\gamma} events of high significance; two
ANTARES track + Fermi {\gamma}-ray events are identified that exceed a once per
decade false alarm rate threshold ($p=17\%$). No evidence for subthreshold
{\nu}+{\gamma} source populations is found among the track ($p=39\%$) or
cascade ($p=60\%$) events. While TXS 0506+056, a blazar and variable

first source of high-energy neutrinos, the challenges in reconciling
observations of the Fermi {\gamma}-ray sky, the IceCube high-energy cosmic
neutrinos, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays using only blazars suggest a
significant contribution by other source populations. Searches for transient
sources of high-energy neutrinos remain interesting, with the potential for
neutrino clustering or multimessenger coincidence searches to lead to discovery
of the first {\nu}+{\gamma} transients.

orbit, the temporal coverage remains limited. Other limitations of the dataset
are its small size, the difficult distinction between ice clouds and frosts,
and the impact of surface albedo on data uncertainty. We could nevertheless
study the diurnal cloud life cycle by averaging the data over larger regions:
from specific topographic features (covering a few degrees in longitude and
latitude) up to large climatic bands (all longitudes). We found that in the
tropics around northern summer solstice, the diurnal thermal tide modulates the
abundance of clouds, which is reduced around noon. At northern midlatitudes,
clouds corresponding to the edge of the north polar hood are observed mainly in
the morning and around noon during northern winter (Ls=260-30{\deg}). Over

correlation between optical flux and the 15.8-day binary orbital period, with
blue flux peaks occurring close to most observed periastron passages. For the
first time, we find an even more consistent correlation between orbital period

precedes those in the optical by a few days, with the rise usually starting
near apastron orbital phase. We further obtained five epochs of spectroscopy
using IRTF SpeX, with a wavelength range of 0.8 to 5 microns, and derived

varies with time, with cooler and weaker characteristic dust emission (T ~
1100-1300 K) over most of the binary orbit, and stronger/warmer dust emission
(T ~ 1600 K, indicative of dust sublimation) just before periastron passage. We
suggest our results are broadly consistent with predictions of simulations of
disk structure and accretion flows around close binaries, with the varying dust
emission possibly tracing the evolution of accretion streams falling inwards
through a circumbinary disk cavity and feeding the accretion pulses traced by
the optical photometry and NIR emission lines. However, our results also show
more complicated behavior that is not fully explained by this simple picture,

However, to
achieve the required confinement, the magnetic geometry must be highly
optimized. This optimization requires navigating high-dimensional spaces, often
necessitating the use of gradient-based methods. The gradient of the
neoclassical fluxes is expensive to compute with classical methods, requiring
$O(N)$ flux computations, where $N$ is the number of parameters. To reduce the
cost of the gradient computation, we present an adjoint method for computing
the derivatives of moments of the neoclassical distribution function for
stellarator optimization. The linear adjoint method allows derivatives of
quantities which depend on solutions of a linear system, such as moments of the
distribution function, to be computed with respect to many parameters from the
solution of only two linear systems. This reduces the cost of computing the
gradient to the point that the finite-collisionality neoclassical fluxes can be
used within an optimization loop.
  With the neoclassical adjoint method, we compute solutions of the drift
kinetic equation and an adjoint drift kinetic equation to obtain derivatives of
neoclassical quantities with respect to geometric parameters. When the number
of parameters in the derivative is large ($\mathcal{O}(10^2)$), this adjoint
method provides up to a factor of 200 reduction in cost. We demonstrate
adjoint-based optimization of the field strength to obtain minimal bootstrap
current on a surface. With adjoint-based derivatives, we also compute the local
sensitivity to magnetic perturbations on a flux surface and identify regions
where tight tolerances on error fields are required for control of the
bootstrap current or radial transport. Furthermore, the solve for the ambipolar
electric field is accelerated using a Newton method with derivatives obtained
from the adjoint method.

$E_{app}^{R}$ can be obtained even if control shifts from one elementary
reaction to another. In fact, we show that $E_{app}^{R}$ is a weighted average
and the leading elementary reaction will change with temperature while the
actual energy contribution for every elementary reaction will contain, in
addition to the traditional energy barrier, a configurational term directly
related to the number of local configurations where that reaction can be
performed. For this purpose, we consider kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of
two-dimensional submonolayer growth at constant deposition flux, where the rate
of interest is the tracer diffusivity. In particular, we focus on the study of
the morphology, island density and diffusivity by including a large variety of
single-atom, multi-atom and complete-island diffusion events for two specific
metallic heteroepitaxial systems, namely, Cu on Ni(111) and Ni on Cu(111), as a
function of coverage and temperature.

whether wide-orbit giant planets form differently than close-in giant planets.
We aim to establish constraints on two key parameters that are relevant for
understanding the formation of wide-orbit planets: 1) the relative mass
function and 2) the fraction of systems hosting multiple companions. In this
study, we focus on systems with directly imaged substellar companions, and the
detection limits on lower-mass bodies within these systems. First, we uniformly
derive the mass probability distributions of known companions. We then combine
the information contained within the detections and detection limits into a
survival analysis statistical framework to estimate the underlying mass
function of the parent distribution. Finally, we calculate the probability that
each system may host multiple substellar companions. We find that 1) the
companion mass distribution is rising steeply toward smaller masses, with a
functional form of $N\propto M^{-1.3\pm0.3}$, and consequently, 2) many of
these systems likely host additional undetected sub-stellar companions.
Combined, these results strongly support the notion that wide-orbit giant
planets are formed predominantly via core accretion, similar to the better
studied close-in giant planets. Finally, given the steep rise in the relative
mass function with decreasing mass, these results suggest that future deep
observations should unveil a greater number of directly imaged planets.

transport properties of rhombohedral GeTe using first-principles modeling. The
room-temperature phase of GeTe has a layered structure, with cross-plane and
in-plane directions oriented parallel and perpendicular to [111], respectively.
Based on rigorous electron-phonon scattering, our transport calculations reveal
unusual anisotropic properties; n-type GeTe has a cross-plane electrical
conductivity that is roughly 3$\times$ larger than in-plane. p-type GeTe,
however, displays opposite anisotropy with in-plane conducting roughly
2$\times$ more than cross-plane, as is expected in quasi-2D materials. The
power factor shows the same anisotropy as the electrical conductivity, since
the Seebeck coefficient is relatively isotropic. Interestingly, cross-plane
n-GeTe shows the largest mobility and power factor approaching 500 cm$^2$/V-s
and 32 $\mu$W/cm-K$^2$, respectively. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit, $zT$,
is enhanced as a result of this unusual anisotropy in n-GeTe since the lattice
thermal conductivity is minimized along cross-plane. This decouples the
preferred transport directions of electrons and phonons, leading to a threefold
increase in $zT$ along cross-plane compared to in-plane. The n-type anisotropy
results from high-velocity electron states formed by Ge p-orbitals that span
across the interstitial region. This surprising behavior, that would allow the
preferential conduction direction to be controlled by doping, could be observed
in other quasi-2D materials and exploited to achieve higher-performance
thermoelectrics.

this paper is to describe the structure of $R^t(K, \mu)$. In the work of
Thomson on describing the closure in $L^t(\mu)$ of analytic polynomials,
$P^t(\mu)$, the existence of analytic bounded point evaluations plays critical
roles, while $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$ may be empty. We introduce the concept
of non-removable boundary $\mathcal F$ such that the removable set $\mathcal R

developments in analytic capacity and Cauchy transform provide us the necessary
tools to describe $\mathcal F$ and obtain structural results for $R^t(K, \mu)$.
  Assume that $R^t(K, \mu)$ does not have a direct $L^t$ summand. Let
$H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ be the weak$^*$ closure in
$L^\infty (\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ of the functions that are bounded
analytic off compact subsets of $\mathcal F$, where $\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R}$

the identity map ($r\rightarrow r$, $r$ is a rational function with poles off
$K$) extends an isometric isomorphism and a weak$^*$ homeomorphism from $R^t(K,
\mu)\cap L^\infty(\mu )$ onto $H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R

  Consequently, we show that a decomposition theorem (Main Theorem II) of
$R^t(K, \mu)$ holds for an arbitrary compact subset $K$ and a finite positive
measure $\mu$ supported on $K$, which extends the central results regarding
$P^t(\mu)$.

high-bias regime, with sequential electron tunneling and working in the damping
basis, allows us to obtain analytical results for both transport cumulants and
$g^{(2)}(t)$ functions. It is found that the photons emitted out of the
resonator are bunched and display a super-Poissonian statistics, for all system
parameters. However, the electron transport properties are found to be
unaffected by the coupling to the resonator, anti-bunched and with
sub-Poissonian statistics. From the joint distribution we identify regimes of
electron tunneling induced photon cascades and very large $g^{(2)}(t)$
functions. All $g^{(2)}(t)$-functions are found to be independent of $\lambda$.
We also identify conditions for and transport signatures of a thermal resonator

importance of accurately modeling the temporal information, most embedding

temporal walks for learning dynamic embeddings from temporal networks. Temporal
walks capture the temporally valid interactions (e.g., flow of information,
spread of disease) in the dynamic network in a lossless fashion. Based on the
notion of temporal walks, we describe a general class of embeddings called
continuous-time dynamic network embeddings (CTDNEs) that completely avoid the
issues and problems that arise when approximating the temporal network as a
sequence of static snapshot graphs. Unlike previous work, CTDNEs learn dynamic
node embeddings directly from the temporal network at the finest temporal
granularity and thus use only temporally valid information. As such CTDNEs
naturally support online learning of the node embeddings in a streaming
real-time fashion. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
this class of embedding methods that leverage temporal walks as it achieves an
average gain in AUC of 11.9% across all methods and graphs.

nanoparticle (NP) in sheared cellular blood flow is calculated over a wide
range of shear rate and haematocrit. In the short-time regime, NPs exhibit
anomalous dispersive behaviors under high shear and high haematocrit due to the
transient elongation and alignment of the red blood cells (RBCs). In the
long-time regime, the NP diffusion tensor features high anisotropy.
Particularly, there exists a critical shear rate ($\sim$100 $s^{-1}$) around
which the shear-rate dependence of the diffusivity tensor changes from linear
to nonlinear scale. Above the critical shear rate, the cross-stream diffusivity
terms vary sublinearly with shear rate, while the longitudinal term varies
superlinearly. The dependence on haematocrit is linear in general except at
high shear rates, where a sublinear scale is found for the vorticity term and a
quadratic scale for the longitudinal term. Through analysis of the suspension
microstructure and numerical experiments, the nonlinear hemorheological
dependence of the NP diffusion tensor is attributed to the streamwise
elongation and cross-stream contraction of RBCs under high shear, quantified by
a Capillary number. The RBC size is shown to be the characteristic length scale
affecting the RBC-enhanced shear-induced diffusion (RESID), while the NP size
at submicron exhibits negligible influence on the RESID. Based on the observed
scaling behaviors, empirical correlations are proposed to bridge the NP
diffusion tensor to specific shear rate and haematocrit. The characterized NP
diffusion tensor provides a constitutive relation that can lead to more
effective continuum models to tackle large-scale NP biotransport applications.

external light source but just due to the chemical reaction resulting in the
chemiluminescence effect. Since the chemiphores usually have low quantum
efficiency, chemiluminescence is a weak optical effect. We found that plasmonic
nanoparticles can efficiently enhance the peculiar effect of chemiluminescence
due to the acceleration of the radiative decay of the chemiphore excited state
which, in turn, enlarges the chemiluminescence yield. Correspondingly,
plasmonic nanoparticles are nanoparticles with sub-wavelength sizes
experiencing the absorption band in specific wavelength which are characterized
by unique optical properties, as well as high localization of electromagnetic
radiation. However, the broadband properties of plasmonic nanoparticles and
their implications in liquid light, the chemiluminescence effect, is
overlooked. Therefore, they can attract attention as novel materials for
photonics, sensing, and forensic science. Here, fabrication techniques of
broadband plasmonic nanoparticles are reported, and their interesting optical
properties together with their applications in chemiluminescence effect are
discussed, as well. We fabricated the nanoparticles with laser ablation in
liquids (LAL) technique and propose the physical vapor deposition (PVD)
synthesis with annealing-assisted treatment for further studies. Both
techniques are accessible and allow production of ensembles of nanoparticles
having shape and size distributions to exhibit broad plasmonic resonance which
fit the wide-band emission of a chemiphore. Our results, in particular, a
specific design for plasmonic nanoparticles placed on the dielectric material,
lead the way toward a new generation of chemiluminescence-based devices

half-quantized two-terminal conductance plateau as the presence of chiral
Majorana fermions in a millimeter-size QAH-Nb hybrid structure. However, there
are concerns about this interpretation because non-Majorana mechanisms can also
generate similar signatures, especially in a disordered QAH system. Here, we
fabricated QAH-Nb hybrid structures and studied the QAH-Nb contact transparency
and its effect on the corresponding two-terminal conductance. When the QAH film
is tuned to the metallic regime by electric gating, we observed a sharp
zero-bias enhancement in the differential conductance, up to 80% at zero
magnetic field. This large enhancement suggests high probability of Andreev
reflection and transparent interface between the magnetic topological insulator
(TI) and Nb layers. When the magnetic TI film is in the QAH state with
well-aligned magnetization, we found that the two-terminal conductance is
always half-quantized. Our experiment provides a comprehensive understanding of
the superconducting proximity effect observed in QAH-superconductor hybrid
structures and shows that the half-quantized conductance plateau is unlikely to
be induced by chiral Majorana fermions.

the $f$-$c$ mixing matrix elements of the Wannier model, the realistic
couplings for all 15 active multipole moments in $\Gamma_8$ quartet subspace
are obtained in the wavevector $q$-space and real-space. Both of the
$\Gamma_{5g}$ quadrupoles $(O_{yz},O_{zx},O_{xy})$ and the $\Gamma_{2u}$
octupole $T_{xyz}$ couplings are maximally enhanced with $q=(\pi,\pi,\pi)$
which naturally explains the phase II of the antiferro-quadrupolar ordering at
$T_{Q}=3.2$ K, and are also enhanced with $q=(0,0,0)$ corresponding to the
elastic softening of $C_{44}$. Also the couplings of the $\Gamma_{5u}$
octupoles $T_{x}^{\beta}$, $T_{y}^{\beta}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$ are quite large
for $q=(\pi,0,0)$, $(0,\pi,0)$ and $(0,0,\pi)$, which yields the
antiferro-octupolar ordering of a possible candidate for phase IV of
Ce$_{x}$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$. The intersite vector dependence of the RKKY couplings
exhibit different long-range, oscillating, isotropic and anisotropic behaviors
depending on the types of the multipole moments. The present approach enables
us to provide the information about the possible multipole ordering in an
unbiased way and is easily available for other localized $f$ electron materials

for an overall method of order $p$, the fast problems corresponding to internal

effectively utilize noisy data yet. Our proposed method first dynamically
constructs a similarity graph of different entity mentions; infer the labels of
noisy instances via label propagation. Based on the inferred labels, mention
embeddings are updated accordingly to encourage entity mentions with close
semantics to form a compact cluster in the embedding space,thus leading to
better classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
show that our CLSC model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distantly

chaotic and weakly interacting subsystems display two distinct phases in the
growth of OTOC.The first is dominated by intra-subsystem scrambling, when an
exponential growth with a positive Lyapunov exponent is observed till the
Ehrenfest time. This phase is essentially independent of the interaction, while
the second phase is an interaction dominated exponential approach to saturation
that is universal and described by a random matrix model. This simple random
matrix model of weakly interacting strongly chaotic bipartite systems,
previously employed for studying entanglement and spectral transitions, is
approximately analytically solvable for its OTOC. The example of two coupled
kicked rotors is used to demonstrate the two phases, and the extent to which
the random matrix model is applicable. That the two phases correspond to
delocalization in the subsystems followed by inter-subsystem mixing is seen via
the participation ratio in phase-space. We also point out that the second,
universal, phase alone exists when the observables are in a sense already
scrambled. Thus, while the post-Ehrenfest time OTOC growth is in general not
well-understood, the case of strongly chaotic and weakly coupled systems
presents an, perhaps important, exception.

probabilistic topic modeling. Topic Grouper creates a disjunctive partitioning
of the training vocabulary in a stepwise manner such that resulting partitions
represent topics. It is governed by a simple generative model, where the
likelihood to generate the training documents via topics is optimized. The
algorithm starts with one-word topics and joins two topics at every step. It
therefore generates a solution for every desired number of topics ranging
between the size of the training vocabulary and one. The process represents an
agglomerative clustering that corresponds to a binary tree of topics. A
resulting tree may act as a containment hierarchy, typically with more general
topics towards the root of tree and more specific topics towards the leaves.
Topic Grouper is not governed by a background distribution such as the
Dirichlet and avoids hyper parameter optimizations.
  We show that Topic Grouper has reasonable predictive power and also a
reasonable theoretical and practical complexity. Topic Grouper can deal well
with stop words and function words and tends to push them into their own
topics. Also, it can handle topic distributions, where some topics are more
frequent than others. We present typical examples of computed topics from
evaluation datasets, where topics appear conclusive and coherent. In this
context, the fact that each word belongs to exactly one topic is not a major
limitation; in some scenarios this can even be a genuine advantage, e.g.~a
related shopping basket analysis may aid in optimizing groupings of articles in
sales catalogs.

The pumped charge averaged over many cycles is quantized at a fraction of an
electron per cycle, determined by the ratio of Lamb shift to level-broadening;
this ratio is imposed by the reservoir band-structure. For uniform density of
states, half an electron is pumped per cycle. We call this ""adiabatic
almost-topological pumping"", because the pumping's Berry curvature is sharply
peaked in the parameter space. Hence, so long as the pumping contour does not
touch the peak, the pumped charge depends only on how many times the contour
winds around the peak (up to exponentially small corrections). However, the
topology does not protect against non-adiabatic corrections, which grow
linearly with pump speed. In one limit the peak becomes a delta-function, so
the adiabatic pumping of fractional charges becomes entirely topological. Our
results show that quantization of the adiabatic pumped charge at a fraction of
an electron does not require fractional particles or other exotic physics.

performance. For comprehensive alignment, we argue that the similarities across
different features in the source domain should be consistent with that of in
the target domain. Based on this assumption, we propose a new domain
discrepancy metric, i.e., Self-similarity Consistency (SSC), to enforce the
feature structure being consistent across domains. The renowned correlation
alignment (CORAL) is proven to be a special case, and a sub-optimal measure of
our proposed SSC. Furthermore, we also propose to mitigate the side effect of
the partial alignment and misalignment by incorporating the discriminative
information of the deep representations. Specifically, an embarrassingly simple
and effective feature norm constraint is exploited to enlarge the discrepancy
of inter-class samples. It relieves the requirements of strict alignment when
performing adaptation, therefore improving the adaptation performance
significantly. Extensive experiments on visual domain adaptation tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSC metric and feature

integrity constraints? Proper measures are important for various tasks, such as
progress indication and action prioritization in cleaning systems, and
reliability estimation for new datasets. To choose an appropriate inconsistency
measure, it is important to identify the desired properties in the application
and understand which of these is guaranteed or at least expected in practice.
For example, in some use cases the inconsistency should reduce if constraints
are eliminated; in others it should be stable and avoid jitters and jumps in
reaction to small changes in the database. We embark on a systematic
investigation of properties for database inconsistency measures. We investigate
a collection of basic measures that have been proposed in the past in both the
Knowledge Representation and Database communities, analyze their theoretical
properties, and empirically observe their behaviour in an experimental study.
We also demonstrate how the framework can lead to new inconsistency measures by
introducing a new measure that, in contrast to the rest, satisfies all of the
properties we consider and can be computed in polynomial time.

been widely used in R-CNN based detectors for classification and localization
tasks. However, there is a lack of understanding of how does these two head
structures work for these two tasks. To address this issue, we perform a
thorough analysis and find an interesting fact that the two head structures
have opposite preferences towards the two tasks. Specifically, the fully
connected head (fc-head) is more suitable for the classification task, while
the convolution head (conv-head) is more suitable for the localization task.
Furthermore, we examine the output feature maps of both heads and find that
fc-head has more spatial sensitivity than conv-head. Thus, fc-head has more
capability to distinguish a complete object from part of an object, but is not
robust to regress the whole object. Based upon these findings, we propose a
Double-Head method, which has a fully connected head focusing on classification
and a convolution head for bounding box regression. Without bells and whistles,
our method gains +3.5 and +2.8 AP on MS COCO dataset from Feature Pyramid

zeta-function regularization to solve the divergence problem, and obtain the
analytical expression of the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature for general

which the asymptotic energy spectrum of the system is used. Besides the general
case, for the systems with exact spectra, e.g., ideal gases in an infinite slab
or in a three-sphere, the sums of the spectra can be performed exactly and the
calculation of the corrections to the critical temperatures is more direct. For
the system confined in a bounded potential, the form of the heat kernel is
different from the usual heat kernel expansion. We show that, as long as the
asymptotic form of the global heat kernel can be found out, our method also
works. For Bose gases confined in three- and two-dimensional isotropic harmonic

black hole is in an analogy with the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, and the life

reconstruct a set of non-linear factors that make an optimal approximation of
the information on the trajectory accumulated by VIO. To obtain a globally
consistent map we combine these factors with loop-closing constraints using
bundle adjustment. The VIO factors make the roll and pitch angles of the global

biggest challenges in learning BIQA models is the conflict between the gigantic
image space (which is in the dimension of the number of image pixels) and the
extremely limited reliable ground truth data for training. Such data are
typically collected via subjective testing, which is cumbersome, slow, and
expensive. Here we first show that a vast amount of reliable training data in
the form of quality-discriminable image pairs (DIP) can be obtained
automatically at low cost by exploiting large-scale databases with diverse
image content. We then learn an opinion-unaware BIQA (OU-BIQA, meaning that no
subjective opinions are used for training) model using RankNet, a pairwise
learning-to-rank (L2R) algorithm, from millions of DIPs, each associated with a
perceptual uncertainty level, leading to a DIP inferred quality (dipIQ) index.
Extensive experiments on four benchmark IQA databases demonstrate that dipIQ
outperforms state-of-the-art OU-BIQA models. The robustness of dipIQ is also
significantly improved as confirmed by the group MAximum Differentiation (gMAD)

strongly-coupled regime. In recent years, this effect has found its
realizations beyond the bulk-metal paradigm in many other itinerant-electron

first experimental observation of the Kondo screening by chargeless

spinon excitations forming a Fermi surface take the role of conduction

transferring knowledge from a high-resource (source) language. Since the model
trained on source language cannot be directly applied to target language due to

evanescent modes at low Fermi energies when the disorder is low. At higher

nature and the propagation occurs via plane-waves. In this study, we report the
detection of such evanescent modes in the surface states of topological
insulator through 1/f noise. While signatures of pseudo-diffusive transport
have been seen experimentally in graphene, such behavior is yet to be observed
explicitly in any other system with a Dirac dispersion. To probe this, we have
studied 1/f noise in topological insulators as a function of gate-voltage, and
temperature. Our results show a non-monotonic behavior in 1=f noise as the
Fermi energy is varied, suggesting a crossover from pseudo-diffusive to

interference (ACI) in vehicular broadcast communication, using scheduling and
power control. Our objective is to maximize the number of connected vehicles.
First, we formulate the joint scheduling and power control problem as a mixed
Boolean linear programming (MBLP) problem. From this problem formulation, we
derive scheduling alone problem as Boolean linear programming (BLP) problem,
and power control alone problem as an MBLP problem. Due to the hardness in
solving joint scheduling and power control for multiple timeslots, we propose a
column generation method to reduce the computational complexity. We also
observe that the problem is highly numerically sensitive due to the high
dynamic range of channel parameters and adjacent channel interference ratio
(ACIR) values. Therefore, we propose a novel sensitivity reduction technique,
which can compute the optimal solution. Finally, we compare the results for
optimal scheduling, near-optimal joint scheduling and power control schemes,
and conclude that the effective scheduling and power control schemes indeed
significantly improve the performance.

offer a new order where the financial system is not governed by a centralized
entity, and where you have complete control over your account without the need
to trust strangers (governments and banks above all). However, cryptocurrency
systems face many challenges that prevent them from being used as an everyday
coin. In this paper we attempt to take one step forward by introducing a
cryptocurrency system that has many important properties. Perhaps the most
revolutionary property is its deterministic operation over a fully asynchronous
communication network, which has sometimes been mistakenly considered to be
impossible. By avoiding any temporal assumptions, we get a system that is
robust against arbitrary delays in the network, and whose latency is only a
function of the actual communication delay. The presented system is based on
familiar concepts $-$ banking and democracy. Our banks, just like normal banks,
keep their clients' money and perform their clients' requests. However, because
of the cryptographic scheme, your bank cannot do anything in your account
without your permission and its entire operation is transparent so you don't
have to trust it blindly. The democracy means that every operation performed by
the banks (e.g., committing a client transaction) has to be accepted by a
majority of the coin holders, in a way that resembles representative democracy
where the banks are the representatives and where each client implicitly
delegates his voting power (the sum of money in his account) to his bank. A
client can switch banks at any moment, by simply applying a corresponding
request to the new bank of his choice.

progressively perceives the entire long text by iterative refinement based on
the extracted feature blocks of preliminary proposals. Finally, a SEM is
introduced to reconstruct more precise representation of irregular text by
considering the geometry properties of text instance, including text region,

  While motivated by the well-known Guderley solutions to the full Euler system
for an ideal gas, the solutions we consider are of a different type. In
Guderley solutions an incoming shock propagates toward the origin by
penetrating a stationary and ""cold"" gas at zero pressure (there is no counter
pressure due to vanishing temperature near the origin), accompanied by blowup
of velocity and pressure, but not of density, at collapse. It is currently not
known whether the full system admits unbounded solutions in the absence of

radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Galactic SNR G5.9+3.1 obtained
with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Combining these new observations with
the surveys at other radio continuum frequencies, we discuss the integrated
radio continuum spectrum of this particular remnant. We have also analyzed an
archival XMM-Newton observation, which represents the first detection of X-ray
emission from this remnant. The SNR SED is very well explained by a simple
power-law relation. The synchrotron radio spectral index of G5.9+3.1, is
estimated to be 0.42$\pm$0.03 and the integrated flux density at 1GHz to be
around 2.7Jy. Furthermore, we propose that the identified point radio source,
located centrally inside the SNR shell, is most probably a compact remnant of
the supernova explosion. The shell-like X-ray morphology of G5.9+3.1 as
revealed by XMM-Newton broadly matches the spatial distribution of the radio
emission, where the radio-bright eastern and western rims are also readily
detected in the X-ray while the radio-weak northern and southern rims are weak
or absent in the X-ray. Extracted MOS1+MOS2+PN spectra from the whole SNR as
well as the north, east, and west rims of the SNR are fit successfully with an
optically thin thermal plasma model in collisional ionization equilibrium with
a column density N_H~0.80x$10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and fitted temperatures spanning
the range kT~0.14-0.23keV for all of the regions. The derived electron number
densities n_e for the whole SNR and the rims are also roughly comparable
(ranging from ~$0.20f^{-1/2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to ~$0.40f^{-1/2}$ cm$^{-3}$, where f
is the volume filling factor). We also estimate the swept-up mass of the X-ray
emitting plasma associated with G5.9+3.1 to be ~$46f^{-1/2}M_{\odot}$.

and annihilation of low resistance sp2 nanochannels within the amorphous sp3
matrix. The thinnest point of these graphitic nanochannels behaves like quantum
wire (QW) and limits current flow. Transport mechanism at these bottlenecks can
be described within the framework of quantum point contact (QPC) model. The
model applies mesoscopic Landauer formalism and correlates device resistance
state with the density of the nanochannels as well as lateral area of its
constriction. However, QPC model parameter extraction from macroscopic I-V
characteristic is not feasible due to multiple nonlinear and closely coupled
parameters, e.g. barrier height ({\Phi}), barrier curvature ({\alpha}) and
voltage drop ratio (\b{eta}). In this work, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)
based parameter extraction flow is proposed and is applied to extract
parameters from experimental result of carbon-based resistive memories. In this
proposed flow, the number of single subband channels for low resistance state
(NLRS) and barrier curvature parameter at high resistance state ({\alpha}HRS)
were first derived by exploring boundary conditions at low voltage. The four
remaining parameters ({\Phi}HRS, {\Phi}LRS, {\alpha}LRS, and \b{eta}) were then
extracted from experimental I-V characteristic by leveraging hybrid GA. Mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitted QPC models is only 3.7% and the
extracted parameters are within reasonable range. Hereby, we regard the QPC
model as a viable model to describe conduction mechanism of graphitic
nanochannels in carbon-based resistive memories.

studied extensively in the last years.
  This is motivated by the fact that the pure online model is often too
restrictive to model real-world applications, where some changes might be
allowed. A well-studied measure of the amount of decisions that can be revoked
is the migration factor $\beta$: When an object $o$ of size $s(o)$ arrives, the
decisions for objects of total size at most $\beta\cdot s(o)$ may be revoked.
Usually $\beta$ should be a constant. This means that a small object only leads
to small changes. This measure has been successfully investigated for
different, classic problems such as bin packing or makespan minimization. The
dual of makespan minimization - the Santa Claus or machine covering problem -
has also been studied, whereas the dual of bin packing - the bin covering
problem - has not been looked at from such a perspective.
  In this work, we extensively study the bin covering problem with migration in
different scenarios. We develop algorithms both for the static case - where
only insertions are allowed - and for the dynamic case, where items may also
depart. We also develop lower bounds for these scenarios both for amortized
migration and for worst-case migration showing that our algorithms have nearly
optimal migration factor and asymptotic competitive ratio (up to an arbitrary
small $\eps$). We therefore resolve the competitiveness of the bin covering
problem with migration.

$T$-periodic then any trajectory either leaves any compact set or converges to
an $(n-1)T$-periodic trajectory, that is, a subharmonic trajectory. These
results hold for any dimension $n$. The analysis of such systems requires
establishing that a line integral of the Jacobian of the nonlinear system is an

answer to this need: it will maintain the excellent performance of the inner

better reconstruction of secondary vertices. The technological challenge of the
CGEM is related in its spatial limitation and the needed cylindrical shape. At

friends could locate any person in the U.S. in a few steps. Later research
showed that social network topology enables a node aware of its full routing to
find an arbitrary target in even fewer steps. Yet, the success of people in
forwarding efficiently knowing only personal connections is still not fully
explained. To study this problem, we emulate it on a real location-based social
network, Gowalla. It provides explicit information about friends and temporal
locations of each user useful for studies of human mobility. Here, we use it to
conduct a massive computational experiment to establish new necessary and
sufficient conditions for achieving social search efficiency. The results
demonstrate that only the distribution of friendship edges and the partial
knowledge of friends of friends are essential and sufficient for the efficiency
of social search. Surprisingly, the efficiency of the search using the original
distribution of friendship edges is not dependent on how the nodes are
distributed into space. Moreover, the effect of using a limited knowledge that
each node possesses about friends of its friends is strongly nonlinear. We show
that gains of such use grow statistically significantly only when this
knowledge is limited to a small fraction of friends of friends.

environment arises from the underlying quantum many-body theory. We propose
that phenomena involved in the quantum-to-classical transition can be probed in
collisions of bright solitary waves in Bose- Einstein condensates, where
thousands of atoms form a large compound object at ultra cold temperatures. For
the experimentally most relevant quasi-1D regime, where integrability is broken
through effective three-body interactions, we find that ensembles of solitary
waves exhibit complex interplay between phase coherence and entanglement
generation in beyond mean-field simulations using the truncated Wigner method:
An initial state of two solitons with a well defined relative phase looses that
phase coherence in the ensemble, with its single particle two-mode density
matrix exhibiting similar dynamics as a decohering two mode superposition. This
apparent decoherence is a prerequisite for the formation of entangled
superpositions of different atom numbers in a subsequent soliton collision. The
necessity for the solitons to first decohere is explained based on the
underlying phase-space of the quintic mean field equation. We show elsewhere
that superpositions of different atom numbers later further evolve into
spatially entangled solitons. Loss of ensemble phase coherence followed by
system internal entanglement generation appear in an unusual order in this
closed system, compared to a typical open quantum system.

the minimum compliance formulation of the variable thickness sheet (VTS)

Polyak and later studied by Ben-Tal and Zibulevsky and others. The most
computationally expensive part of the algorithm is the solution of linear
systems arising from the Newton method used to minimize a generalized augmented
Lagrangian. We use a special structure of the Hessian of this Lagrangian to
reduce the size of the linear system and to convert it to a form suitable for a
standard multigrid method. This converted system is solved approximately by a
multigrid preconditioned MINRES method. The proposed PBM algorithm is compared
with the optimality criteria (OC) method and an interior point (IP) method,
both using a similar iterative solver setup. We apply all three methods to
different loading scenarios. In our experiments, the PBM method clearly
outperforms the other methods in terms of computation time required to achieve

two quantities derived from it: the renormalised stress-energy tensor (a
measure of how the field vacuum state affects the spacetime) and the effective
temperature function (a generalisation of Hawking temperature related to the
energy flux of the field vacuum). The subject of our study are spacetimes which
contain a spherical distribution of matter and an empty exterior Schwarzschild
region, separated by a surface which is moving in proximity to the
Schwarzschild radius $r_{\rm s}=2M$, with $M$ the total mass. In particular, we
analyse the consequences of three types of surface movement: an oscillation
just above $r_{\rm s}$, a monotonous approach towards $r_{\rm s}$ in infinite
time and a crossing of $r_{\rm s}$ at different velocities. For a collapsing
matter distribution which follows the expected dynamical evolution in general
relativity, we recover the standard picture of black-hole formation and its
tenuous semiclassical effects. In more general dynamical regimes, allowing
deviations from the standard classical evolution, we obtain a variety of
different effects: from the emission of Hawking-like radiation without the
formation of a horizon, to large values of the renormalised stress-energy
tensor, related to the Boulware vacuum divergence in static spacetimes.

assessment and control of geometric variation on system performance that is
applicable to any system of partial differential equations. In particular, we
parameterize the geometric domain of the system in terms of design parameters
and subsequently measure the effect of design parameter variation on system
performance. A surrogate model via a tensor representation is constructed to
map the design parameter variation to the system performance. A set of
optimization problems over this surrogate model restricted to nested
hyperrectangles represents the effect of prescribing design tolerances, where
the maximizer of this restricted function depicts the worst-case member, i.e.
the worst-case design. Moreover, the loci of these tolerance hyperrectangles
with maximizers attaining, but not surpassing, the performance constraint
represents the boundary to the feasible region of allocatable tolerances. Every
tolerance in this domain is measured through a user-specified, weighted norm
which is informed by design considerations such as cost and manufacturability.
The boundary of the feasible set is elucidated as an immersed manifold of
codimension one, over which a suite of optimization routines exist and are
employed to efficiently determine an optimal feasible tolerance with respect to
the specified measure. Examples of this algorithm are presented with
applications to a plate with a hole described by two design parameters, a plate
with a hole described by six design parameters, and an L-Bracket described by
seventeen design parameters.

multicast opportunities. This model is highly nontrivial and fundamentally
enables the optimization of view synthesis-based multicast opportunities. For
given video quality requirements of all users, we consider the optimization of

an optimal solution with reduced computational complexity by exploiting
optimality properties. For each problem, to reduce computational complexity, we
also propose a low-complexity algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution, using
Difference of Convex (DC) programming. Finally, numerical results show the

derivative sequence with length of l. The discrete Fourier transform of
original sequence can be calculated by the discrete Fourier transform of the
congruence derivative sequence. Based on the relation of discrete Fourier
transforms between the two sequences, the features of Fourier power spectra of
the integer and fractional periods for a real sequence have been investigated.
It has proved mathematically that after calculating the Fourier power spectrum
at an integer period, the Fourier power spectra of the fractional periods
associated this integer period can be easily represented by the computational
result of the Fourier power spectrum at the integer period for the sequence. A
computational experience using a protein sequence shows that some of the
computed results are a kind of Fourier power spectra corresponding to new
frequencies which can't be obtained from the traditional discrete Fourier
transform. Therefore, the algorithm would be a new realization method for
discrete Fourier transform of the real sequence.

  Description of Transient Systems",,,"10.1098/rspa.2019.0506",,"math.NA math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a variational principle for the extraction of a time-dependent
orthonormal basis from random realizations of transient systems. The optimality
condition of the variational principle leads to a closed-form evolution
equation for the orthonormal basis and its coefficients. The extracted modes
are associated with the most transient subspace of the system, and they provide
a reduced description of the transient dynamics that may be used for
reduced-order modeling, filtering and prediction. The presented method is
matrix-free and relies only on the observables of the system and ignores any
information about the underlying system. In that sense, the presented reduction
is purely observation-driven and may be applied to systems whose models are not
known. The presented method has linear computational complexity and memory
storage requirement with respect to the number of observables and the number of
random realizations. Therefore, it may be used for a large number of
observations and samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on
three examples: (i) stochastic advection equation, (ii) a reduced description
of transient instability of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and (iii) a transient
vertical jet governed by incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. In these
examples, we contrast the performance of the time-dependent basis versus static
basis such as proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition and
polynomial chaos expansion.

kingdom. Such functional models are, on the one hand, required in motor
control, for example solving the inverse kinematic or dynamic task in
goal-directed movements or a forward task in ballistic movements. On the other
hand, such models are recruited in cognitive tasks as are planning ahead or
observation of actions of a conspecific. Here, we present a functional internal
body model that is based on the Mean of Multiple Computations principle. For
the first time such a model is completely realized in a recurrent neural
network as necessary normalization steps are integrated into the neural model
itself. Secondly, a dynamic extension is applied to the model. It is shown how
the neural network solves a series of inverse tasks. Furthermore, emerging
representation in transformational layers are analyzed that show a form of
prototypical population-coding as found in place or direction cells.

Not only is the complexity of such FC network, measured in number of trainable
parameters and scalar multiplications, much lower than the reference FC and
residual models, its accuracy also outperforms both models for nearly all
tested SNR values (0 dB to 50dB). Such AE-trained networks are suited for
in-situ protocol inference performed by simple mobile devices based on noisy

energy conservation in routing to maximize lifetime of a network. We propose a
multi-level approach to maximize our gains with regards to energy conservation
i.e., i) Dynamic programming based intra-cluster optimization technique has
been proposed ii) Ant Colony Optimization is used for energy efficient cluster
head connection with sink node and iii) Voronoi Tessellation are employed for
efficient coverage planning i.e., dynamic formation of cluster boundaries. In
order to accommodate a more flexible adhoc network, hybrid (reactive and
proactive) event monitoring based on Deep Belief Network has been integrated in
distributed nodes to improve the latency of the system. The results show that
the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the current state of the art with

stress gradient. Such stress can be induced in battery electrode during
fabrication and under normal operation. In this paper, we develop a model for
stresses generated during lithiation in the thin plate electrode considering
the effects of external mechanical loading. It is found that diffusion-induced
stresses are asymmetrically distributed through the thickness of plate due to
the coupling effects of asymmetrically distributed external mechanical stress.
At the very early stage during Li-ions insertion, the effects of the external
mechanical loading is quite limited and unobvious. With the diffusion time
increasing, the external mechanical loading exerts a significant influence on
the evolution of stresses generated in the electrode. External compressed
electrode is inclined to increase the value of stresses generated during
lithiation, while external tensed electrode tends to decrease the value of
stresses, and as the diffusion time increases, the effects of the external
mechanical loading on the stresses generated during lithiation become more
obvious.
