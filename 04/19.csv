are the current standard for imaging large fields of view with an
interferometer and multi-frequency observations are now routinely carried out
with both types of telescopes to increase the continuum imaging sensitivity and
to probe spectral structure. This paper describes an algorithm to combine
wideband data from these two types of telescopes in a joint iterative

results demonstrate the ability to prevent instabilities and error that

be similar to the idea of generating artificial visibilities from single dish
data. However, our discussed implementation is simpler and more flexible in
terms of applying relative data weighting schemes to match noise levels while
preserving flux accuracy, fits within standard iterative image reconstruction
frameworks, is fully compatible with wide-field and joint mosaicing gridding
algorithms that apply corrections specific to the interferometer data and may
be configured to enable spectral cube and wideband multi-term deconvolution for

a spatio-temporal component, such as the presence of a bacterial outbreak and
the population density. In this context, density-based clustering algorithms
are flexible tools to analyse data by searching for group structures. The case
of Scotland presents an additional challenge due to the diversity of population
densities under the area of study. We present here a spatio-temporal clustering
approach for highlighting the behaviour of general practitioners (GPs) in
Scotland. Particularly, we consider the density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise algorithm (DBSCAN) due to its ability to include both
spatial and temporal data, as well as its flexibility to be extended with
further variables. We extend this approach into two directions. For the
temporal analysis, we use dynamic time warping to measure the dissimilarity
between warped and shifted time series. For the spatial component, we introduce
a new way of weighting spatial distances with continuous weights derived from a
KDE-based process. This makes our approach suitable for cases involving spatial
clusters with differing densities, which is a well-known issue for the original
DBSCAN. We show an improved performance compared to both the latter and the
popular k-means algorithm on simulated, as well as empirical data, presenting
evidence for the ability to cluster more elements correctly and deliver
actionable insights.

small-scale flavor structures can develop in a neutrino gas even if the
physical conditions are nearly homogeneous along the $x$ axis initially. The
power diffusion from the large-scale to small-scale structures increases with
the neutrino density and helps to establish a semi-exponential dependence of
the magnitudes of the Fourier moments on the corresponding wave numbers. The
overall flavor conversion probabilities in the neutrino gases with small
initial sinusoidal perturbations reach certain equilibrium values at large
distances which are mainly determined by the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry.
Similar phenomena also exist in a neutrino gas with a localized initial

is measured in proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV recorded by the
LHCb experiment. The charged-hadron structure of the jet is studied
longitudinally and transverse to the jet axis for jets with transverse momentum
$p_{\mathrm{T}}>20$ GeV and in the pseudorapidity range $2.5<\eta<4$. These are
the first measurements of jet hadronization at these forward rapidities and
also the first where the jet is produced in association with a $Z$ boson. In
contrast to previous hadronization measurements at the Large Hadron Collider,
which are dominated by gluon jets, these measurements probe predominantly
light-quark jets which are found to be more longitudinally and transversely
collimated with respect to the jet axis when compared to the previous gluon
dominated measurements. Therefore, these results provide valuable information
on differences between quarks and gluons regarding nonperturbative
hadronization dynamics.

  Contrast Enhancement","Draft version",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to measure the image
quality without reference image. However, contrast distortion has been
overlooked in the current research of NR-IQA. In this paper, we propose a very
simple but effective metric for predicting quality of contrast-altered images
based on the fact that a high-contrast image is often more similar to its
contrast enhanced image. Specifically, we first generate an enhanced image
through histogram equalization. We then calculate the similarity of the
original image and the enhanced one by using structural-similarity index (SSIM)
as the first feature. Further, we calculate the histogram based entropy and
cross entropy between the original image and the enhanced one respectively, to
gain a sum of 4 features. Finally, we learn a regression module to fuse the
aforementioned 5 features for inferring the quality score. Experiments on four
publicly available databases validate the superiority and efficiency of the
proposed technique.

structural material. Their vast degrees of freedom provide for extensive
opportunities to design alloys with tailored properties. However, the
compositional complexities of HEAs present great challenges for alloy design.
Current approaches have shown limited reliability in accounting for the
compositional regions of single solid solution and composite phases. We present
a phenomenological method, analyzing binary phase diagrams to predict HEA phase
formation on the hypothesis that the structural stability of HEAs is encoded
within. Accordingly, we introduce a small number of phase-diagram inspired
parameters and employ machine learning to partition the formation region of
500+ reported HEA compositions. The model achieved a single phase HEA
prediction rate >80 %. To validate our method, we demonstrated the capability
of this method in predicting HEA solid solution phases with and without
intermetallics in 30 randomly selected complex compositions, with a success
rate of 77 %. The presented efficient search approach with high predictive
capability can be exploited to complement computation-intense methods in
providing a powerful platform for the design of high entropy alloys.

shown that the scaling function of such a process may not take the form of a
power function $b(a)=a^H$. More precisely, its scaling function can belong to
one of three types, among which one type is degenerate, one type has a
continuous-time counterpart, while the other type is new and unique for the
discrete-time setting. We then focus on this last type of processes, construct
two classes of examples, and prove a special spectral representation result for
the processes of this type. We also derive basic properties of discrete-time
self-similar processes with stationary increments of different types.

subset of edges so as to maximize profit, after which one or multiple followers
choose a shortest path from their source to sink. We study the
counter-intuitive phenomenon that the use of negative prices by the leader may
in fact increase his profit. In doing so, we answer the following two
questions. First, how much more profit can the leader earn by setting negative
prices? Second, for which network topologies can the profit be increased by
using negative prices? Our main result shows that the profit with negative
prices can be a factor $\Theta(\log (m\cdot\bar k))$ larger than the maximum
profit with positive prices, where $m$ is the number of priceable edges in the
graph and $\bar k \leq 2^m$ the number of followers. In particular, this factor
cannot be bounded for the single follower case, and can even grow linearly in
$m$ if the number of followers is large. Our second result shows that
series-parallel graphs with a single follower and Stackelberg games with
matroid followers are immune to the negative price paradox.

the concept of co-orientational order parameters, which generalize the known
biaxial order parameters of the theory of liquid crystals. Applying these
concepts to three-dimensional reconstructions of single cells from
high-resolution imaging data of mouse liver tissue, we show that the axes of
nematic cell polarity of hepatocytes exhibit local coordination and are aligned
with the biaxially anisotropic sinusoidal network for blood transport. Our
study characterizes liver tissue as a biological example of a biaxial liquid
crystal. The general methodology developed here could be applied to other
tissues or in-vitro organoids.

conjectured by physicists and later proved that a sharp satisfiability
transition occurs. For random $k$-SAT and related models it happens at clause
density $\alpha$ around $2^k$. Just below the threshold, further results
suggest that the solution space has a ""1RSB"" structure of a large bounded
number of near-orthogonal clusters inside the space of variable assignments
$\{0,1\}^N$. In the unsatisfiable regime, it is natural to consider
max-satisfiability: violating the least number of constraints. For a simplified
variant, the strong refutation problem, there is strong evidence that an
algorithmic transition occurs around $\alpha = N^{k/2-1}$. For $\alpha$ bounded
in $N$, a very precise estimate of the max-sat value was obtained by
Achlioptas, Naor, and Peres (2007), but it is not sharp enough to indicate the
nature of the energy landscape. Later work (Sen, 2016; Panchenko, 2016) shows
that for $\alpha$ very large (roughly, above $64^k$) the max-sat value
approaches the mean-field (complete graph) limit: this is conjectured to have
an ""FRSB"" structure where near-optimal configurations form clusters within
clusters, in an ultrametric hierarchy of infinite depth inside $\{0,1\}^N$. A
stronger form of FRSB was shown in several recent works to have algorithmic
implications (again, in complete graphs). Consequently we find it of interest
to understand how the model transitions from 1RSB near the satisfiability
threshold, to (conjecturally) FRSB for large $\alpha$. In this paper we show
that in the random regular $k$-NAE-SAT model, the 1RSB description breaks down
already above $\alpha \asymp 4^k/k^3$. This is proved by an explicit
perturbation in the 2RSB parameter space, inspired by the ""bug proliferation""
mechanism proposed by physicists (Montanari and Ricci-Tersenghi, 2003;

We use Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to compute eigenfunctions of the

the case of the homogeneous slab, we compare the DMD modes to the analytic
normal modes of the system to evaluate the feasibility of DMD in collisionless
self gravitating systems. This is followed by the isothermal plane model, where
we focus on the effect of self gravity on phase mixing. We compute DMD modes of
the system for varying relative dominance of mutual interaction and external
potential, so as to study the corresponding variance in mode structure and
lifetime. We find that there is a regime of relative dominance, at
approximately $ 4:1 $ external potential to mutual interaction where the DMD
modes are spirals in the $ (z,v_z) $ plane, and are nearly un-damped. This
leads to the proposition that a system undergoing phase mixing in the presence
of weak to moderate self gravity can have persisting spiral structure in the
form of such modes. We then conclude with the conjecture that such a mechanism
may be at work in the phase space spirals observed in Gaia Data Release 2, and
that studying more complex simulations with DMD may aid in understanding both
the timing and form of the perturbation that lead to the observed spirals.

arms that cause orbital modulation of the Be disc structure. The aim of this
work is to identify observables in which this modulation is apparent. The
structure of a Be disc in a coplanar circular binary system is computed with a
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code, and a radiation transfer code calculates
the spectral energy distribution. Line depolarisation was confirmed, with
polarisation profiles nearly reverse to emission-line profiles. The continuum
flux maximizes for pole-on discs, but photometric variability maximizes for
edge-on discs. The linear polarisation exhibits one or two maxima per orbital
cycle. While polarisation variability in visible passbands is important only at
low inclinations, infrared bands may demonstrate high orbital variability even
at large inclinations. More evident is the modulation in the polarisation angle
(PA) for low inclinations. The latter can be used to track azimuthal
asymmetries for pole-on discs, where the spectroscopic variability in the
violet-to-red (V/R) emission-component ratio disappears. PA reversals coincide
with phases where V/R=1, tracking lines of sight directed towards regions where
the approaching and receding arms overlap. Continuum flux and polarisation are
mostly in phase for neighbouring wavelength regions. It is suggested that
studies of non-symmetric discs distorted by tidal forces from a secondary star
may be used to study disc variabilities of other origins.

Furthermore, ambipolar diffusion (AD) leads to highly preferential accretion at
midplane, followed by magnetic reconnection. This results a local zone of
decretion that drains of mass in the field reconnection area, which leaves a
gap and an adjacent ring just outside it. Overall, under the favorable

this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards
functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase
infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of
the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e.,

nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when
erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks.
Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to
safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to

we present a rigorous but practical Bayesian approach that can include diverse
evidence, such as nuclear data and the inferred masses, radii, tidal
deformabilities, moments of inertia, and gravitational binding energies of
neutron stars. We emphasize that the full posterior probability distributions
of measurements should be used rather than, as is common, imposing a cut on the
maximum mass or other quantities. Our method can be used with any
parameterization of the equation of state (EOS). We use both a spectral
parameterization and a piecewise polytropic parameterization with variable
transition densities to illustrate the implications of current measurements and
show how future measurements in many domains could improve our understanding of
cold catalyzed matter. We find that different types of measurements will play
distinct roles in constraining the EOS in different density ranges. For
example, better symmetry energy measurements will have a major influence on our
understanding of matter somewhat below nuclear saturation density but little
influence above that density. In contrast, precise radius measurements or
multiple tidal deformability measurements of the quality of those from GW170817
or better will improve our knowledge of the EOS over a broader density range.

negative integer exponents). Specifically, we resolve the complexity of
approximate counting, the problem of multiplicatively estimating the size of a
nonempty set $S \subseteq [N]$, in two natural generalizations of quantum query
complexity.
  Our first result holds in the standard Quantum Merlin--Arthur
($\mathsf{QMA}$) setting, in which a quantum algorithm receives an untrusted
quantum witness. We show that, if the algorithm makes $T$ quantum queries to
$S$, and also receives an (untrusted) $m$-qubit quantum witness, then either $m
= \Omega(|S|)$ or $T=\Omega \bigl(\sqrt{N/\left| S\right| } \bigr)$. This is
optimal, matching the straightforward protocols where the witness is either
empty, or specifies all the elements of $S$. As a corollary, this resolves the
open problem of giving an oracle separation between $\mathsf{SBP}$, the
complexity class that captures approximate counting, and $\mathsf{QMA}$.
  In our second result, we ask what if, in addition to a membership oracle for
$S$, a quantum algorithm is also given ""QSamples"" -- i.e., copies of the state
$\left| S\right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| S\right| }} \sum_{i\in
S}|i\rangle$ -- or even access to a unitary transformation that enables
QSampling? We show that, even then, the algorithm needs either $\Theta
\bigl(\sqrt{N/\left| S\right| }\bigr)$ queries or else $\Theta \bigl(\min
\bigl\{\left| S\right| ^{1/3}, \sqrt{N/\left| S\right| }\bigr\}\bigr)$ QSamples
or accesses to the unitary.
  Our lower bounds in both settings make essential use of Laurent polynomials,
but in different ways.

intermediate, and high-rigidity ranges that can be related to both features in
the data and peculiar microphysics mechanisms resulting in spectral breaks. We
single out a scenario which yields excellent fits to the data and includes all
the presumably relevant complexity, the BIG model. This model has two limiting
regimes: (i) the SLIM model, a minimal diffusion-only setup, and (ii) the
QUAINT model, a convection-reacceleration model where transport is tuned by
non-relativistic effects. All models lead to robust predictions in the
high-energy regime ($\gtrsim10$GV), i.e. independent of the propagation
scenario: at $1\sigma$, the diffusion slope $\delta$ is $[0.43-0.53]$, whereas
$K_{10}$, the diffusion coefficient at 10GV, is $[0.26-0.36]$kpc$^2$Myr$^{-1}$;
we confirm the robustness of the high-energy break, with a typical value
$\Delta_h\sim 0.2$. We also find a hint for a similar (reversed) feature at low

constant and negative, the proper notion of curvature being -- as called in the
mathematics literature -- the fractional Q-curvature. The equation for
$\gamma(x)$ is found to be the Fractional Yamabe Equation (to be solved in
$\Omega$) that, in absence of anomalous dimension, reduces to the usual Yamabe
Equation in the same domain. From the scale factor $\gamma(x)$ we obtain novel
predictions for the scaling form of one-point correlation functions. A
(necessary) virtue of the proposed approach is that it encodes and allows to
naturally retrieve the purely geometric content of two-dimensional boundary
conformal field theory. From the critical magnetization profile in presence of
boundaries one can extract the scaling dimension of the order parameter,
$\Delta_\phi$. For the 3D Ising model we find $\Delta_\phi=0.518142(8)$ which
favorably compares (at the fifth decimal place) with the state-of-the-art
estimate. A nontrivial prediction is the structure of two-point correlators at
criticality. They should depend on the fractional Q-hyperbolic distance
calculated from the metric, in turn depending only on the shape of the bounded

be sharp to first order for an odd-dimensional Euclidean ball shrinking to a

study the problem of quantifying the irreversibility of nonequilibrium
macroscopic systems. In a random billiard model, a point particle evolves by
free motion through the interior of a spatial domain, and reflects according to
a reflection operator, specified in the model by a Markov transition kernel,
upon collision with the boundary of the domain. We derive a formula for entropy
production rate that applies to a general class of random billiard systems.
This formula establishes a relation between the purely mathematical concept of
entropy production rate and textbook thermodynamic entropy, recovering in
particular Clausius' formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. We also
study an explicit class of examples whose reflection operator, referred to as
the Maxwell-Smolukowski thermostat, models systems with boundary thermostats
kept at possibly different temperatures. We prove that, under certain mild
regularity conditions, the class of models are uniformly ergodic Markov chains
and derive formulas for the stationary distribution and entropy production rate
in terms of geometric and thermodynamic parameters.

densities inside these objects are high enough to allow stars to form. An
estimate of the luminosity of the first star clusters formed within these SIGOs

observations. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that SIGOs lie in a
distinct place in the luminosity-radius parameter space, which can be used
observationally to distinguish SIGOs from dark-matter hosting gas systems.
Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we model star formation before reionization and
evolve these systems to current times. We find that SIGOs occupy a similar part
of the magnitude-radius parameter space as globular clusters. These results
suggest that SIGOs may be linked with present-day metal-poor local globular
clusters. Since the relative velocity between the baryons and dark matter is
coherent over a few Mpc scales, we predict that if this is the dominant
mechanism for the formation of globular clusters, their abundance should vary
significantly over these scales.

angular resolution at X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths, yielding an
unprecedented view of the core of the Phoenix cluster. We find that the
one-dimensional temperature and entropy profiles are consistent with
expectations for pure-cooling hydrodynamic simulations and analytic
descriptions of homogeneous, steady-state cooling flow models. In the inner ~10
kpc, the cooling time is shorter by an order of magnitude than any other known
cluster, while the ratio of the cooling time to freefall time approaches unity,
signaling that the ICM is unable to resist multiphase condensation on kpc
scales. When we consider the thermodynamic profiles in two dimensions, we find
that the cooling is highly asymmetric. The bulk of the cooling in the inner ~20
kpc is confined to a low-entropy filament extending northward from the central
galaxy. We detect a substantial reservoir of cool (10^4 K) gas (as traced by
the [OII] doublet), which is coincident with the low-entropy filament. The bulk
of this cool gas is draped around and behind a pair of X-ray cavities,
presumably bubbles that have been inflated by radio jets, which are detected
for the first time on kpc scales. These data support a picture in which AGN
feedback is promoting the formation of a multiphase medium via a combination of
ordered buoyant uplift and locally enhanced turbulence. These processes ought
to counteract the tendency for buoyancy to suppress condensation, leading to
rapid cooling along the jet axis. The recent mechanical outburst has sufficient
energy to offset cooling, and appears to be coupling to the ICM via a cocoon
shock, raising the entropy in the direction orthogonal to the radio jets.

combining radio flux densities measured at three frequencies, we can move
beyond simple linear fits to the radio spectra of high-redshift star-forming
galaxies, and search for spectral curvature, which has been observed in local
starburst galaxies. At least a quarter (10/41) of our sample show evidence of a
spectral break, with a median $\langle\alpha^{1.4\,{\rm GHz}}_{610\,{\rm

that a combination of weak magnetic fields ($B\sim35\,\mu$G) and young ages

observed spectral break. Assuming these represent evolved (but ongoing)

that the innermost radius of the dust torus in Mrk 590 decreased rapidly after
the AGN ultraviolet-optical luminosity drop, and that the replenishment time
scale of the innermost dust distribution is less than 4 years, which is much
shorter than the free fall time scale of BLR gas or dust clouds. We suggest
that rapid replenishment of the innermost dust distribution can be accomplished
either by new dust formation in radiatively-cooled BLR gas clouds or by new
dust formation in the disk atmosphere and subsequent vertical wind from the
dusty disk as a result of radiation pressure.

Recent papers have suggested that experiments using a nitrogen medium held at

fronts. We present a suite of one-dimensional numerical simulations using the

of varying the atomic kinetics and radiative transfer model on the
hydrodynamics and ionization state of the nitrogen gas, finding that more
sophisticated physics, in particular a multi-angle long characteristic
radiative transfer model and a collisional-radiative atomics model,
dramatically changes the atomic kinetic evolution of the gas. A photoionization
front is identified by computing the ratios between the photoionization rate,
the electron impact ionization rate, and the total recombination rate. We find
that due to the increased electron temperatures found using more advanced
physics that photoionization fronts are likely to form in our nominal model. We
report results of several parameter studies. In one of these, the nitrogen
pressure is fixed at ten atmospheres and varies the source radiation
temperature while another fixes the temperature at 100 eV and varied the
nitrogen pressure. Lower nitrogen pressures increase the likelihood of
generating a photoionization front while varying the peak source temperature
has little effect.

platform for processing large data sets. MapReduce offers a streamlined
computational framework by interleaving sequential and parallel computation
while hiding underlying system issues from the programmer. Due to the
popularity of MapReduce, there have been attempts in the theoretical computer
science community to understand the power and limitations of the MapReduce
framework. In the most widely studied MapReduce models each machine has memory
sub-linear in the input size to the problem, hence cannot see the entire input.
This restriction places many limitations on algorithms that can be developed
for the model; however, the current understanding of these restrictions is
still limited.
  In this paper, our goal is to work towards understanding problems which do
not admit efficient algorithms in the MapReduce model. We study the basic
question of determining if a graph is connected or not. We concentrate on
instances of this problem where an algorithm is to determine if a graph
consists of a single cycle or two disconnected cycles. In this problem, locally
every part of the graph is similar and the goal is to determine the global
structure of the graph. We consider a natural class of algorithms that can
store/process/transfer the information only in the form of paths and show that
no randomized algorithm cannot answer the decision question in a
sub-logarithmic number of rounds. Currently, there are no absolute super
constant lower bounds on the number of rounds known for any problem in
MapReduce. We introduce some of the first lower bounds for a natural graph
problem, albeit for a restricted class of algorithms. We believe our result
makes progress towards understanding the limitations of MapReduce.

calculate a universal number called $\kappa$, which arises when a quantum
critical system is embedded on a two-dimensional torus and bipartitioned into
two cylinders. In the limit when one of the cylinders is a thin slice through
the torus, $\kappa$ parameterizes a divergence that occurs in the entanglement
entropy sub-leading to the area law. Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations
of an Ising model in 2+1 dimensions, we access the second Renyi entropy, and
determine that, at the Wilson-Fisher (WF) fixed point, $\kappa_{2,\text{WF}} =
0.0174(5)$. This result is significantly different from its value for the
Gaussian fixed point, known to be $\kappa_{2,\text{Gaussian}} \approx
0.0227998$.

  Resistance within a Nanoslot-Patterned Thin Film",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At micro- to nano-scales, classical size effects in heat conduction play an
important role in suppressing the thermal transport process. Such effects occur
when the characteristic lengths become commensurate to the mean free paths

Beyond existing experimental efforts on thin films using laser-induced thermal
gratings, this work provides the complete theoretical analysis for a new
approach to extract the effective phonon MFP distribution for the in-plane heat
conduction within a thin film or flake-like sample. In this approach, nanoslots
are patterned on a suspended thin film. Phonons will transport ballistically
through the neck region between adjacent nanoslots if the phonon MFPs are much
longer than the neck width. The associated ""ballistic thermal resistance"" for
varied neck dimensions can then be used to reconstruct the phonon MFP
distribution within the film. The technique can be further extended to
two-dimensional materials when the relaxation time approximation is reasonably
accurate.

(CRMAB). The constraints are in the form of time varying set of actions (set of
available arms). This variation can be either stochastic or semi-deterministic.
Given a set of arms, a fixed number of them can be chosen to be played in each
decision interval. The play of each arm yields a state dependent reward. The
current states of arms are partially observable through binary feedback signals
from arms that are played. The current availability of arms is fully
observable. The objective is to maximize long term cumulative reward. The
uncertainty about future availability of arms along with partial state
information makes this objective challenging. Applications for CRMAB can be
found in resource allocation in cyber-physical systems involving components
with time varying availability.
  First, this optimization problem is analyzed using Whittle's index policy. To
this end, a constrained restless single-armed bandit is studied. It is shown to
admit a threshold-type optimal policy and is also indexable. An algorithm to
compute Whittle's index is presented. An alternate solution method with lower
complexity is also presented in the form of an online rollout policy. A
detailed discussion on the complexity of both these schemes is also presented,
which suggests that online rollout policy with short look ahead is simpler to
implement than Whittle's index computation. Further, upper bounds on the value
function are derived in order to estimate the degree of sub-optimality of
various solutions. The simulation study compares the performance of Whittle's
index, online rollout, myopic and modified Whittle's index policies.

are then fused via plurality voting. Experiments on 3D brain MRI data show that
by selecting a good initial atlas set MAS with VoteNet significantly
outperforms a number of other label fusion strategies as well as a direct DL
segmentation approach. We also provide an experimental analysis of the upper
performance bound achievable by our method. While unlikely achievable in
practice, this bound suggests room for further performance improvements.
Lastly, to address the runtime disadvantage of standard MAS, all our results
make use of a fast DL registration approach.

availability. However, these systems typically exhibit a hard tradeoff between
consistency and performance. Ensuring consistency introduces coordination
overhead, and as a result the system throughput does not scale with the number
of replicas. We present Harmonia, a replicated storage architecture that
exploits the capability of new-generation programmable switches to obviate this
tradeoff by providing near-linear scalability without sacrificing consistency.
To achieve this goal, Harmonia detects read-write conflicts in the network,
which enables any replica to serve reads for objects with no pending writes.
Harmonia implements this functionality at line rate, thus imposing no
performance overhead. We have implemented a prototype of Harmonia on a cluster
of commodity servers connected by a Barefoot Tofino switch, and have integrated
it with Redis. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by supporting a
variety of replication protocols, including primary-backup, chain replication,
Viewstamped Replication, and NOPaxos. Experimental results show that Harmonia
improves the throughput of these protocols by up to 10X for a replication
factor of 10, providing near-linear scalability up to the limit of our testbed.

and Polyakov-loop transitions and their difference in temperature as seen in
lattice QCD calculations could be realized with a critical scale of the
Polyakov-loop potential that is larger than the one in pure gauge theory. The
comparison of the results for the Polyakov-loop susceptibility obtained using
the self-consistent medium-dependent quark mass with those obtained while
keeping these masses at a fixed value allows to disentangle chiral-symmetry
restoration and center-symmetry breaking effects. Furthermore, a confined
chirally restored phase is identified by a plateau in the quark contribution to
thermodynamics and by sigma and pion spectral functions that coincide but have
a small width. We also discuss that, for some large chemical potential values,
the explicit center-symmetry breaking is so strong that statistical
deconfinement is realized at infinitely small temperatures. Both the missing
sensitivity of the Polyakov loop to the quark mass, except at close to the
chiral transition, and the Polyakov loop being zero at zero temperature at all
chemical potentials, can be interpreted as indications of a missing mechanism
which accounts for the quark back-reaction on the Polyakov loop.

integrating out the electron box diagram. Starting from the Schwinger

work out the probability of conversion when the background fields are

the mixing induced by background fields can lead to corrections to the

ultracompact objects in data obtained during Advanced LIGO's second observing
run. In contrast to a previous search of Advanced LIGO data from the first
observing run, this search includes the effects of component spin on the
gravitational waveform. We identify no viable gravitational wave candidates
consistent with sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries with at least one
component between 0.2 - 1.0 solar masses. We use the null result to constrain
the binary merger rate of (0.2 solar mass, 0.2 solar mass) binaries to be less
than 3.7 x 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and the binary merger rate of (1.0 solar mass, 1.0
solar mass) binaries to be less than 5.2 x 10^3 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Sub-solar mass
ultracompact objects are not expected to form via known stellar evolution
channels, though it has been suggested that primordial density fluctuations or
particle dark matter with cooling mechanisms and/or nuclear interactions could
form black holes with sub-solar masses. Assuming a particular primordial black
hole formation model, we constrain a population of merging 0.2 solar mass black
holes to account for less than 16% of the dark matter density and a population
of merging 1.0 solar mass black holes to account for less than 2% of the dark
matter density. We discuss how constraints on the merger rate and dark matter
fraction may be extended to arbitrary black hole population models that predict
sub-solar mass binaries.

misconfigurations, faults or attacks can introduce inconsistencies that
undermine correct operation. Previous work in this area, however, lacks a
holistic methodology to tackle this problem and thus, addresses only certain
parts of the problem. Yet, the consistency of the overall system is only as
good as its least consistent part. Motivated by an analogy of network
consistency checking with program testing, we propose to add active probe-based
network state fuzzing to our consistency check repertoire. Hereby, our system,
PAZZ, combines production traffic with active probes to periodically test if
the actual forwarding path and decision elements (on the data plane) correspond
to the expected ones (on the control plane). Our insight is that active traffic
covers the inconsistency cases beyond the ones identified by passive traffic.
PAZZ prototype was built and evaluated on topologies of varying scale and
complexity. Our results show that PAZZ requires minimal network resources to
detect persistent data plane faults through fuzzing and localize them quickly
while outperforming baseline approaches.

  model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At the initial design stage engineers often rely on low-fidelity models that
have high epistemic uncertainty. Traditional safety-margin-based deterministic
design resorts to testing (e.g. prototype experiment, evaluation of
high-fidelity simulation, etc.) to reduce epistemic uncertainty and achieve
targeted levels of safety. Testing is used to calibrate models and prescribe
redesign when tests are not passed. After calibration, reduced epistemic model
uncertainty can be leveraged through redesign to restore safety or improve
design performance; however, redesign may be associated with substantial costs
or delays. In this paper, a methodology is described for optimizing the
safety-margin-based design, testing, and redesign process to allow the designer
to tradeoff between the risk of future redesign and the possible performance
and reliability benefits. The proposed methodology represents the epistemic
model uncertainty with a Kriging surrogate and is applicable in a wide range of
design problems. The method is illustrated on a cantilever beam bending example
and then a sounding rocket example. It is shown that redesign acts as a type of
quality control measure to prevent an undesirable initial design from being
accepted as the final design. It is found that the optimal design/redesign
strategy for maximizing expected design performance includes not only redesign
to correct an initial design that is later revealed to be unsafe, but also
redesign to improve performance when an initial design is later revealed to be
too conservative (e.g. too heavy).

target nuclei. LUX acquired data from April 2013 to May 2016 at SURF in South
Dakota, which led to publications of many world-leading exclusion limits that
probe much of the unexplored DM parameter space. This manuscript describes two
novel direct detection methods that used the first LUX dataset to place limits
on sub-GeV DM. The Bremsstrahlung and Migdal effects consider electron recoils
that accompany the standard DM-nucleus scattering, thereby extending the reach
of the LUX detector to lower DM masses. The spin-independent DM-nucleon
scattering was constrained for four different classes of mediators for DM
particles with masses of 0.4-5 GeV/c$^{2}$. The detector conditions changed
significantly before its final 332 live-days of data acquisition. The electric
fields varied in a non-trivial non-symmetric manner, which triggered a need for
a fully 3D model of the electric fields inside the LUX detector. The successful
modeling of these electric fields, described herein, enabled a thorough
understanding of the detector throughout its scientific program and
strengthened its sensitivity to DM. The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is a
next-generation xenon detector soon to start searching for DM. However,
increasingly large noble liquid detectors like LZ are facing challenges with
applications of high voltage (HV). The Xenon Breakdown Apparatus (XeBrA) at the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was built to characterize the HV behavior
of liquid xenon and liquid argon. Results from XeBrA will serve not only to
improve our understanding of the physical processes involved in the breakdown

Majorana bound states based on Josephson junctions can appear in a wide class

appear only for phase differences $\phi\neq\pi$ as the topological gap
protecting the Majorana bound states vanishes at $\phi=\pi$. Our results show
that the ratio between Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling or the choice

and falls to the surface. Coronal rain appears frequently in active region
coronal loops and is very common in post-flare loops. This Letter presents
discovery observations, which show that coronal rain is ubiquitous in the
embedded bipole very near a coronal hole boundary. Our observed structures
formed when the photospheric decay of active region leading sunspots resulted
in a large parasitic polarity embedded in a background unipolar region. We
observe coronal rain to appear within the legs of closed loops well under the
fan surface, as well as preferentially near separatrices of the resulting
coronal topology: the spine lines, null point, and fan surface. We analyze 3
events using SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations in the 304,
171, and 211 {/AA} channels, as well as SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) magnetograms. The frequency of rain formation and the ease with which it
is observed strongly suggests that this phenomenon is generally present in
null-point topologies of this size scale. We argue that these rain events could
be explained by the classic process of thermal nonequilibrium or via
interchange reconnection at the null; it is also possible that both mechanisms
are present. Further studies with higher spatial resolution data and MHD

solving the tasks, the learner enters an unsupervised playing stage where it
creates its own tasks to solve, tries to solve them, and saves any solutions
(programs) to the background knowledge. After the playing stage is finished,
the learner enters the supervised building stage where it tries to solve the
user-supplied tasks and can reuse solutions learnt whilst playing. The idea is
that playing allows the learner to discover reusable general programs on its
own which can then help solve the user-supplied tasks. We claim that playing
can improve learning performance. We show that playing can reduce the textual
complexity of target concepts which in turn reduces the sample complexity of a
learner. We implement our idea in Playgol, a new inductive logic programming
system. We experimentally test our claim on two domains: robot planning and

well-known trends that have emerged from the limited existing data in recent

ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this work, we leverage the

developed a landmark proportional subdistribution hazards (PSH) model and a

analysis of data from a multicenter clinical trial for breast cancer patients.
Our proposed models have appealing advantages over other dynamic prediction
models for data with competing risks. First, our models are robust against
violations of the PSH assumption and can directly predict the conditional CIFs
bypassing the estimation of overall survival and greatly simplify the

to make predictions at a set of landmark points in one step. Third, the

observations were taken in spectroscopic mode with the goal of obtaining
precise astrometry and spectroscopy of faint companions to bright stars. We
find a clear correlation between residual wavefront error measured by the AO

of the same source, taken on different dates. We find a typical 5-$\sigma$

decentralized convex optimization problems. Both for primal and dual oracles,
the proposed methods are optimal in terms of the number of communication steps.
However, for all classes of the objective, the optimality in terms of the
number of oracle calls per node takes place only up to a logarithmic factor and
the notion of smoothness. By using mini-batching technique, we show that the
proposed methods with stochastic oracle can be additionally parallelized at
each node. The considered algorithms can be applied to many data science

solve a wide range class of constrained composite convex optimization problems.
Our method relies on four techniques: Lagrangian dual decomposition,
self-concordant barrier smoothing, path-following, and proximal-Newton
technique. It also allows one to approximately compute the solution of the
primal subproblems (called the slave problems), which leads to inexact oracles
(i.e., inexact gradients and Hessians) of the smoothed dual problem (called the
master problem). The smoothed dual problem is nonsmooth, we propose to use an
inexact proximal-Newton method to solve it. By appropriately controlling the
inexact computation at both levels: the slave and master problems, we still
estimate a polynomial-time iteration-complexity of our algorithm as in standard
short-step interior-point methods. We also provide a strategy to recover primal
solutions and establish complexity to achieve an approximate primal solution.
We illustrate our method through two numerical examples on well-known models

expanded what can be expressed using predictions, and developed applications

predictions as knowledge in reinforcement learning is as yet underdeveloped:
some work explicitly refers to predictions as knowledge, what the requirements
are for considering a prediction to be knowledge have yet to be well explored.
This specification of the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge is
important; even if claims about the nature of knowledge are left implicit in
technical proposals, the underlying assumptions of such claims have
consequences for the systems we design. These consequences manifest in both the
way we choose to structure predictive knowledge architectures, and how we
evaluate them. In this paper, we take a first step to formalizing predictive

methods to existing theories of knowledge in epistemology. Specifically, we
explore the relationships between Generalized Value Functions and epistemic

decade. However, in the NISQ era pointed out by John Preskill in 2018, quantum
noise and decoherence, which affect the accuracy and execution effect of
quantum programs, cannot be ignored and corrected by the near future NISQ
computers. In order to let users more easily write quantum programs, the
compiler and runtime system should consider underlying quantum hardware
features such as decoherence. To address the challenges posed by decoherence,
in this paper, we propose and prototype QLifeReducer to minimize the qubit
lifetime in the input OpenQASM program by delaying qubits into quantum
superposition. QLifeReducer includes three core modules, i.e.,the parser,
parallelism analyzer and transformer. It introduces the layered bundle format
to express the quantum program, where a set of parallelizable quantum
operations is packaged into a bundle. We evaluate quantum programs before and
after transformed by QLifeReducer on both real IBM Q 5 Tenerife and the
self-developed simulator. The experimental results show that QLifeReducer
reduces the error rate of a quantum program when executed on IBMQ 5 Tenerife by
11%; and can reduce the longest qubit lifetime as well as average qubit
lifetime by more than 20% on most quantum workloads.

flow laden with inertial particles for two different volume concentrations
($\Phi_{V} = 3 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\Phi_{V} = 5 \times 10^{-5}$) at a Stokes
number of $St^{+} = 58.6$ based on viscous units. Two independent direct
numerical simulation models utilizing the point-particle approach are compared
to recent experimental measurements, where all relevant nondimensional
parameters are directly matched. While both numerical models are built on the
same general approach, details of the implementations are different,
particularly regarding how two-way coupling is represented. At low volume
loading, both numerical models are in general agreement with the experimental
measurements, with certain exceptions near the walls for the wall-normal
particle velocity fluctuations. At high loading, these discrepancies are
increased, and it is found that particle clustering is overpredicted in the
simulations as compared to the experimental observations. Potential reasons for
the discrepancies are discussed. As this study is among the first to perform
one-to-one comparisons of particle-laden flow statistics between numerical
models and experiments, it suggests that continued efforts are required to
reconcile differences between the observed behavior and numerical predictions.

simulation input parameters which need to be analyzed and properly calibrated
before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a
visual analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of

designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by
modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted

a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis
framework. Surrogate models are widely used in the field of simulation sciences
to efficiently analyze computationally expensive simulation models. In this
work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models
for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field
of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural
network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive
parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation at multiple
levels-of-detail as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using
the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate
detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the

been recent interest in analytic or numerically efficient methods for computing
worst-case performance bounds for such algorithms, for example over the class
of strongly convex loss functions. A popular approach is to assume the
algorithm has a fixed size (fixed dimension, or memory) and that its structure
is parameterized by one or two hyperparameters, for example a learning rate and
a momentum parameter. Then, a Lyapunov function is sought to certify robust
stability and subsequent optimization can be performed to find optimal
hyperparameter tunings. In the present work, we instead fix the constraints
that characterize the loss function and apply techniques from robust control
synthesis to directly search over algorithms. This approach yields stronger
results than those previously available, since the bounds produced hold over
algorithms with an arbitrary, but finite, amount of memory rather than just
holding for algorithms with a prescribed structure.

strategies to efficiently register local maps in geographical coordinate

lidar and aerial image sensing, and constrain the spatial uncertainties of
remaining lidar points that cannot be directly measured and identified. We
achieved 15-75cm absolute average global accuracy using precisely
geo-referenced aerial imagery as ground truth. This is valuable in enabling the
fusion of ground vehicle on-board sensor features with features extracted from
aerial images such as traffic and lane markings. It is also useful for
cooperative sensing to have an unbiased and accurate global reference.

investigates the ability of E2E ASR from standard close-talk to far-field
applications by encompassing entire multichannel speech enhancement and ASR
components within the S2S model. There have been previous studies on jointly
optimizing neural beamforming alongside E2E ASR for denoising. It is clear from
both recent challenge outcomes and successful products that far-field systems
would be incomplete without solving both denoising and dereverberation
simultaneously. This report uses a recently developed architecture for
far-field ASR by composing neural extensions of dereverberation and beamforming
modules with the S2S ASR module as a single differentiable neural network and
also clearly defining the role of each subnetwork. The original implementation
of this architecture was successfully applied to the noisy speech recognition
task (CHiME-4), while we applied this implementation to noisy reverberant tasks
(DIRHA and REVERB). Our investigation shows that the method achieves better
performance than conventional pipeline methods on the DIRHA English dataset and
comparable performance on the REVERB dataset. It also has additional advantages
of being neither iterative nor requiring parallel noisy and clean speech data.

between electrides and magnetism is not well understood due to the lack of
stable magnetic electrides, particularly the lack of inorganic magnetic
electrides. Here, based on the mechanism of Stoner-type magnetic instability,
we propose that in certain electrides the low-dimensionality can facilitate the
formation of magnetic ground state because of the enhanced density of states
near the Fermi level. To be specific, A5B3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; B = As, Sb, Bi)
(1D), Sr11Mg2Si10 (0D), Ba7Al10 (0D) and Ba4Al5 (0D) have been identified as
stable magnetic electrides with spin-polarization energies of tens to hundreds
of meV per formula unit. Especially for Ba5As3, the spin-polarization energy
can reach up to 220 meV. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnetic moment
and spin density mainly derive from the interstitial anionic electrons near the
Fermi level. Our work paves a way to the searching of stable magnetic
electrides and further exploration of the magnetic properties and related
applications in electrides.

modifies the associated metric structure and hence the expansion as well as its
rate of change deviates from standard expectations. This holds true for any

Interestingly, this construction works with generic spacetime geometry without
any need of invoking any particular symmetry. In particular, inclusion of a
zero-point length results into a non-vanishing cross-sectional area for the
geodesic congruences even in the coincidence limit, thus avoiding formation of

specific microbial clades within species, a framework of support vector machine
(SVM) based microbial species classification with N-best algorithm is
constructed to classify the centroid marker genome fragments randomly generated
from marker genome sequences on MetaRef. A time series feature extraction
method is proposed by segmenting the centroid gene sequences and mapping into
different dimensional spaces. Two ways of data splitting are investigated
according to random splitting fragments along genome sequence (DI) , or
separating genome sequences into two parts (DII).Two strategies of fragments
recognition tasks, dimension-by-dimension and sequence--by--sequence, are
investigated. The k-mer size selection, overlap of segmentation and effects of
random split percents are also discussed. Experiments on 12390 maker genome
sequences belonging to marker families of 17 species from MetaRef show that,
both for DI and DII in dimension-by-dimension and sequence-by-sequence

modeling a complex relationship between text and image. For example, a caption
might evoke an ironic contrast with the image, so neither caption nor image is
a mere transcript of the other. Instead they combine -- via what has been
called meaning multiplication -- to create a new meaning that has a more
complex relation to the literal meanings of text and image. Here we introduce a
multimodal dataset of 1299 Instagram posts labeled for three orthogonal
taxonomies: the authorial intent behind the image-caption pair, the contextual
relationship between the literal meanings of the image and caption, and the
semiotic relationship between the signified meanings of the image and caption.
We build a baseline deep multimodal classifier to validate the taxonomy,
showing that employing both text and image improves intent detection by 9.6%
compared to using only the image modality, demonstrating the commonality of
non-intersective meaning multiplication. The gain with multimodality is
greatest when the image and caption diverge semiotically. Our dataset offers a

VNb$_3$S$_6$, prototypical of class (a), is half-metallic with only two bands

a loop connecting the Weyl nodes. This quasi-nodal-line degeneracy is explained
in terms of the quasi-mirror symmetry of the lattice, induced by the in-plane

and application tasks share the same out-put structure. To obtain a meta model
applicable to the tasks with new structures, it is required to collect new
training data and repeat the time-consuming meta training procedure. This makes
them inefficient or even inapplicable in learning to solve heterogeneous
few-shot learning tasks. We thus develop a novel and principled
HierarchicalMeta Learning (HML) method. Different from existing methods that
only focus on optimizing the adaptability of a meta model to similar tasks, HML
also explicitly optimizes its generalizability across heterogeneous tasks. To
this end, HML first factorizes a set of similar training tasks into
heterogeneous ones and trains the meta model over them at two levels to
maximize adaptation and generalization performance respectively. The resultant
model can then directly generalize to new tasks. Extensive experiments on
few-shot classification and regression problems clearly demonstrate the
superiority of HML over fine-tuning and state-of-the-art meta learning
approaches in terms of generalization across heterogeneous tasks.

subsequent fast relaxation towards the attractor. In equilibrium, on the other
hand, the dynamics evolves on a slower time scale on a lower dimensional
attractor. The reconstruction error of a dynamic mode decomposition is used to
monitor the inability of the time series to resolve the fast relaxation towards
the attractor as well as the effective dimension of the dynamics. We illustrate
our method by detecting transient dynamics in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation. We further apply our method to atmospheric reanalysis data; our

for autonomous vehicles, particularly for those vehicles operating at higher
levels (L4-L5) of autonomy. Recent work has demonstrated the promise of
deep-learning approaches for LiDAR-based detection. However, deep-learning
algorithms are extremely data hungry, requiring large amounts of labeled
point-cloud data for training and evaluation. Annotating LiDAR point cloud data
is challenging due to the following issues: 1) A LiDAR point cloud is usually
sparse and has low resolution, making it difficult for human annotators to
recognize objects. 2) Compared to annotation on 2D images, the operation of
drawing 3D bounding boxes or even point-wise labels on LiDAR point clouds is
more complex and time-consuming. 3) LiDAR data are usually collected in
sequences, so consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to repeated
annotations. To tackle these challenges, we propose LATTE, an open-sourced
annotation tool for LiDAR point clouds. LATTE features the following
innovations: 1) Sensor fusion: We utilize image-based detection algorithms to
automatically pre-label a calibrated image, and transfer the labels to the
point cloud. 2) One-click annotation: Instead of drawing 3D bounding boxes or
point-wise labels, we simplify the annotation to just one click on the target
object, and automatically generate the bounding box for the target. 3)
Tracking: we integrate tracking into sequence annotation such that we can
transfer labels from one frame to subsequent ones and therefore significantly
reduce repeated labeling. Experiments show the proposed features accelerate the
annotation speed by 6.2x and significantly improve label quality with 23.6% and
2.2% higher instance-level precision and recall, and 2.0% higher bounding box
IoU. LATTE is open-sourced at https://github.com/bernwang/latte.

artificial intelligence (AI) research. An important problem with implementing a

architecture is obtained manually by exploring its hyperparameter space and
kept fixed during training. This approach is time-consuming and inefficient.
Another issue is that modern neural networks often contain millions of
parameters, whereas many applications and devices require small inference
models. However, efforts to migrate DNNs to such devices typically entail a
significant loss of classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-step neural network synthesis methodology, called DR+SCANN, that
combines two complementary approaches to design compact and accurate DNNs. At
the core of our framework is the SCANN methodology that uses three basic
architecture-changing operations, namely connection growth, neuron growth, and
connection pruning, to synthesize feed-forward architectures with arbitrary
structure. SCANN encapsulates three synthesis methodologies that apply a
repeated grow-and-prune paradigm to three architectural starting points.
DR+SCANN combines the SCANN methodology with dataset dimensionality reduction
to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the efficacy of SCANN
and DR+SCANN on various image and non-image datasets. We evaluate SCANN on
MNIST and ImageNet benchmarks. In addition, we also evaluate the efficacy of
using dimensionality reduction alongside SCANN (DR+SCANN) on nine small to
medium-size datasets. We also show that our synthesis methodology yields neural
networks that are much better at navigating the accuracy vs. energy efficiency

subjects in the main study. We used a naturalistic driving study as opposed to
a virtual reality driving simulator to perform the distracted driving
maneuvers, consisting of over 100 short duration trials (three to five seconds)
for a subject. We overcame a big challenge in EEG analysis - reducing the
number of electrodes by isolating one electrode (FC5) from 14 electrode
locations to identify certain distractions. Our machine learning methods
achieved a mean accuracy (averaged over the subjects and tasks) of 91.54 +/-
5.23% to detect a distracted driving event and 76.99 +/- 8.63% to distinguish
between the five distraction cases in our study (read, text, call, and
snapshot) using a single electrode. The quantification of distracted driving
detailed in this paper is necessary to guide future policies in road safety.
Our system addresses the safety concerns resulting from driver distraction and
aims to bring about behavioral changes in drivers.

Accepted to ICRA 2019",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much current study of legged locomotion has rightly focused on foot traction
forces, including on granular media. Future legged millirobots will need to go
through terrain, such as brush or other vegetation, where the body contact
forces significantly affect locomotion. In this work, a (previously developed)
low-cost 6-axis force/torque sensing shell is used to measure the interaction
forces between a hexapedal millirobot and a set of compliant beams, which act
as a surrogate for a densely cluttered environment. Experiments with a
VelociRoACH robotic platform are used to measure lift and drag forces on the
tactile shell, where negative lift forces can increase traction, even while
drag forces increase. The drag energy and specific resistance required to pass
through dense terrains can be measured. Furthermore, some contact between the
robot and the compliant beams can lower specific resistance of locomotion. For
small, light-weight legged robots in the beam environment, the body motion
depends on both leg-ground and body-beam forces. A shell-shape which reduces
drag but increases negative lift, such as the half-ellipsoid used, is suggested
to be advantageous for robot locomotion in this type of environment.

coherently, especially at low temperatures where scattering is suppressed. One
very important parameter influencing this effect is the period of the

nanofabricated PnCs with identical hole filling factors, but three different
periodicities, 4, 8, and 16 $\mu$m, using superconducting tunnel junction
thermometry. We found that all the measured samples can suppress thermal
conductance by an order of magnitude, and have a lower thermal conductance than
the previously measured smaller period, 1 $\mu$m and 2.4 $\mu$m structures. The
8 $\mu$m period PnC gives the lowest thermal conductance of all the samples
above, and has the lowest specific conductance/unit heater length observed to
date in PnCs. In contrast, coherent transport theory predicts that the longest
period should have the lowest thermal conductance. Comparison to incoherent
simulations suggests that diffusive boundary scattering is likely the mechanism
behind the partial breakdown of the coherent theory.

anisotropic features from pancreas. The DQN based model learns a
context-adaptive localization policy to produce a visually tightened and

multilingual word embeddings that share a common vector space across various

promising results: We can successfully train a model on annotated data of a

of up to 77% of a model trained on target language data. Furthermore, we can
increase this performance up to 87% of a baseline model trained on target

attacks can bypass bad data detection schemes typically built on static

this article, we depart from the existing static viewpoint to develop a
diagnosis filter that captures the dynamics signatures of such a multivariate
intrusion. To this end, we introduce a dynamic residual generator approach
formulated as robust optimization programs in order to detect a class of
disruptive multivariate attacks that potentially remain stealthy in view of a
static bad data detector. We investigate two possible desired features: (i) a
non-zero transient and (ii) a non-zero steady-state behavior of the residual
generator in the presence of an attack. In case (i), the problem is
reformulated as a finite, but possibly non-convex, optimization program. We
further develop a linear programming relaxation that improves the scalability,
and as such practicality, of the diagnosis filter design. In case (ii), it
turns out that the resulting robust program admits an exact convex
reformulation, yielding a Nash equilibrium between the attacker and the
residual generator. This assertion has an interesting implication: the proposed
approach is not conservative in the sense that the additional knowledge of the
worst-case attack does not improve the diagnosis performance. To illustrate our
theoretical results, we implement the proposed diagnosis filter to detect
multivariate attacks on the system measurements deployed to generate the
so-called Automatic Generation Control signals in a three-area IEEE 39-bus

undeformed ones. The effect of this perturbation on the quantum spectrum is
non-perturbatively described by an inhomogeneous Burgers equation. In this
paper, we point out that there exist infinite families of models where the
geometry couples instead to generic combinations of local conserved currents
labelled by the Lorentz spin. In spirit, these generalisations are similar to
the $\text{J}\bar{\text{T}}$ model as the resulting theories and the
corresponding scattering phase factors are not Lorentz invariant. The link with
the $\text{J}\bar{\text{T}}$ model is discussed in detail. While the classical
setup described here is very general, we shall use the sine-Gordon model and
its CFT limit as explanatory quantum examples. Most of the final equations and
considerations are, however, of broader validity or easily generalisable to
more complicated systems.

informative representation of the environment they are in contact with, or of
the data they are presented. It has recently been suggested that these systems
are characterised by an exponential distribution of energy levels. In order to
understand the peculiar properties of OLM within a broader framework, I
consider an ensemble of optimisation problems over functions of many variables,
part of which describe a sub-system and the rest account for its interaction
with a random environment. The number of states of the sub-system with a given
value of the objective function obeys a stretched exponential distribution,
with exponent $\gamma$, and the interaction part is drawn at random from the
same distribution, independently for each configuration of the whole system.
Systems with $\gamma=1$ then correspond to OLM, and we find that they sit at
the boundary between two regions with markedly different properties. For all
$\gamma>0$ the system exhibits a freezing phase transition. The transition is
discontinuous for $\gamma<1$ and it is continuous for $\gamma>1$. The region
$\gamma>1$ corresponds to learnable energy landscapes and the behaviour of the
sub-system becomes predictable as the size of the environment exceeds a
critical threshold. For $\gamma<1$, instead, the energy landscape is
unlearnable and the behaviour of the system becomes more and more unpredictable
as the size of the environment increases. Sub-systems with $\gamma=1$ (OLM)
feature a behaviour which is independent of the relative size of the
environment. This is consistent with the expectation that efficient
representations should be largely independent of the level of detail of the
description of the environment.

They are a natural non-monotone stochastic version of the family of cellular
automata with random initial state known as $\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap
percolation. KCM have an interest in their own right, owing to their use for
modelling the liquid-glass transition in condensed matter physics.
  In two dimensions there are three classes of models with qualitatively
different scaling of the infection time of the origin as the density of
infected sites vanishes. Here we study in full generality the class termed
`critical'. Together with the companion paper by Martinelli and two of the
authors we establish the universality classes of critical KCM and determine
within each class the critical exponent of the infection time as well as of the
spectral gap. In this work we prove that for critical models with an infinite
number of stable directions this exponent is twice the one of their bootstrap
percolation counterpart. This is due to the occurrence of `energy barriers',
which determine the dominant behaviour for these KCM but which do not matter
for the monotone bootstrap dynamics. Our result confirms the conjecture of
Martinelli, Morris and the last author, who proved a matching upper bound.

inspired by curriculum learning we consider the knowledge distillation from the
perspective of curriculum learning by routing. Instead of supervising the
student model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor
points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed
by, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally
demonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence
loss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning. On close-set

distillation by 2.14% and 1.5% respectively. For the sake of evaluating the

integrate HTR models into an OCR system. These constitute a solution to bring

spectrum at 850 nm versus only the Ca II 8542 A spectral line. We found a
better match of the input atmosphere for the former case, mainly at lower
heights. However, the results at higher layers were not accurate. After several
tests, we determined that we need to weight more the chromospheric lines than
the photospheric ones in the computation of the goodness of the fit. The new
inversion configuration allows us to obtain better fits and consequently more
accurate physical parameters. Therefore, to extract the most from multi-line
inversions, a proper set of weights needs to be estimated. Besides that, we
conclude again that the lines at 850 nm, or a similar arrangement with Ca II
8542 A plus Zeeman sensitive photospheric lines, poses the best observing
configuration for examining the thermal and magnetic properties of the lower

possible to perform the multiplication of the value of the input OAM state by
splitting and mapping the phase onto complementary circular sectors.

sectors of the input beam into an equal number of circular phase gradients. The
optical elements have been fabricated in the form of phase-only diffractive
optics with high-resolution electron-beam lithography. Optical tests confirm
the capability of the multiplier optics to perform integer multiplication of
the input OAM, while the designed dividers are demonstrated to correctly split

phenomenon only partly match with observations. They all rely on a static model
for the chromosphere model and on the assumption that radiation and matter are
decoupled. Aims. We explore the effects on the structure and on the dynamics of
the accretion flow of both a shock-heated chromosphere and of the coupling
between radiation and hydrodynamics. Methods. We simulate accretion columns
falling onto a stellar chromosphere using the 1D ALE code AstroLabE. This code
solves the hydrodynamics equations along with the two first momenta equations
for radiation transfer, with the help of a dedicated opacity table for the
coupling between matter and radiation. We derive the total electron and ions
densities from collisional-radiative NLTE ionisation equilibrium. Results. The
chromospheric acoustic heating has an impact on the duration of the cycle and
on the structure of the heated slab. In addition, the coupling between
radiation and hydrodynamics leads to a heating of the accretion flow and the
chromosphere, inducing a possible unburial of the whole column. These two last
conclusions are in agreement with the computed monochromatic intensity. Both
effects (acoustic heating and radiation coupling) have an influence on the
amplitude and temporal variations of the net X-ray luminosity, which varies
between 30 and 94% of the incoming mechanical energy flux, depending on the

helically-shaped turbulent patches coexisting with laminar flow, as in planar
shear flows. The moderate-$\eta$ regime does not feature any marked

are surprisingly short-ranged. Implications are discussed in terms of phase

are limited, we show that interesting trends are already becoming apparent in
the existing data. A clear anti-correlation is seen between the D/H ratio and
the active fraction, defined as the ratio of the active surface area to the
total nucleus surface. Comets with an active fraction above 0.5 typically have
D/H ratios in water consistent with the terrestrial value. These hyperactive
comets, such as 46P/Wirtanen, require an additional source of water vapor in
their coma, explained by the presence of subliming icy grains expelled from the
nucleus. The observed correlation may suggest that hyperactive comets belong to
a population of ice-rich objects that formed just outside the snow line, or in
the outermost regions of the solar nebula, from water thermally reprocessed in
the inner disk that was transported outward during the early disk evolution.
The observed anti-correlation between the active fraction and the nucleus size
seems to argue against the first interpretation, as planetesimals near the snow
line are expected to undergo rapid growth. Alternatively, isotopic properties
of water outgassed from the nucleus and icy grains may be different due to
fractionation effects at sublimation. In this case, all comets may share the
same Earth-like D/H ratio in water, with profound implications for the early
solar system and the origin of Earth's oceans.

differential equations that contain nonlinear advection and stiff linear
operators, combining exponential integration techniques and semi-Lagrangian
methods.
  The general formulation is built from the solution of an integration factor
problem with respect to the problem written with a material derivative, so that
the exponential integration scheme naturally incorporates the nonlinear
advection. Semi-Lagrangian techniques are used to treat the dependence of the
exponential integrator on the flow trajectories. The formulation is general, as
many exponential integration techniques could be combined with different
semi-Lagrangian methods. This formulation allows an accurate solution of the
linear stiff operator, a property inherited by the exponential integration
technique. It also provides a sufficiently accurate representation of the
nonlinear advection, even with large time-step sizes, a property inherited by
the semi-Lagrangian method.
  Aiming for application in weather and climate modeling, we discuss possible
combinations of well established exponential integration techniques and
state-of-the-art semi-Lagrangian methods used operationally in the application.
We show experiments for the planar rotating shallow water equations. When
compared to traditional exponential integration techniques, the experiments
reveal that the coupling with semi-Lagrangian allows stabler integration with
larger time-step sizes. From the application perspective, which already uses
semi-Lagrangian methods, the exponential treatment could improve the solution
of wave-dispersion when compared to semi-implicit schemes.

were conducted with either ultra-filtrates or ultra-concentrates [4]. The

to the presence of an adsorption layer formed at the gas/liquid interface and
its properties [3]. Thus surface properties of Champagne were analysed by
ellipsometry and tensiometry. Measurements conducted on base wine, on
ultra-filtered base wines and degassed champagne samples showed the presence of
an adsorption layer formed at the air/champagne wine interface [6] and that

to the number of transducers in the composition. As main technical result it is
proved that any such composition can be realized as a linear bounded
composition, which means that the sizes of the intermediate results can be
chosen to be at most linear in the size of the output tree. This has
consequences for the expressiveness and complexity of the translations in the
hierarchy. First, if the computed translation is a function of linear size
increase, i.e., the size of the output tree is at most linear in the size of
the input tree, then it can be realized by just one, deterministic,
tree-walking tree transducer. For compositions of deterministic transducers it
is decidable whether or not the translation is of linear size increase. Second,
every composition of deterministic transducers can be computed in deterministic
linear time on a RAM and in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine,
measured in the sum of the sizes of the input and output tree. Similarly, every
composition of nondeterministic transducers can be computed in simultaneous
polynomial time and linear space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. Their
output tree languages are deterministic context-sensitive, i.e., can be

problem for compositions of nondeterministic translations is nondeterministic
polynomial time and deterministic linear space. The membership problem for the

wakefield accelerator are typically three orders of magnitude greater than
those produced by a conventional accelerator, and hence plasma accelerators can
open a route to a new generation of very compact machines. In addition,
plasma-based accelerators can generate beams with unique properties, such as
tens of kiloamp peak currents, attosecond bunch duration, ultrahigh brightness
and intrinsic particle beam-laser pulse synchronization.
  In this roadmap we review the status of plasma accelerator research in the
UK. We outline potential applications, describe the research and development
required to enable those applications, and discuss synergies with related areas
of research. We also set-out the resources required to realise these ambitions
and provide a timeline for advances in the key areas.

were coupled with crystal plasticity-based finite element modelling (CP-FEM) to
study the micro-mechanisms of plastic anisotropy in lamellar TiAl alloys. The
consideration of microstructure in both simulation and in-situ experiments
enables in-depth understanding of micro-mechanisms responsible for the highly
anisotropic deformation response of TiAl on the intra-lamella and inter-lamella
scales. This study focuses on two specific configurations of
{\gamma}/{\alpha}_2 lamellar microstructure with the {\gamma}/{\alpha}_2
interfaces being aligned {25}^o and {55}^o to the loading direction.
Microstructure-based CP-FEM shows that longituginal slip of super and ordinary
dislocations are most responsible for the plastic anisotropy in the {25}^o
micropillar while the anisotropy of the {55}^o micropillar is due to
longitudinal superdislocations and longitudinal twins. In addition, transversal
superdislocations were more active, making the deformation in the {25}^o
micropillar less localised than that in the {55}^o micropillar. Moreover, the
CP-FEM model successfully predicted substantial build-up of internal stresses
at {\gamma}/{\alpha}_2 interfaces, which is believed to be detrimental to the
ductility in TiAl. However, as evidenced by the model, the detrimental internal
stresses can be significantly relieved by the activation of transverse
deformation twinning, suggesting that the ductility of TiAl can be improved by
promoting transverse twins.

convergent kinetic equation that provides a rigorous extension of plasma
kinetic theory into the regime of strong Coulomb coupling. The approach is
based on a single expansion parameter which enforces that the exact equilibrium
limit is maintained at all orders. Because the expansion parameter does not
explicitly depend on the range or the strength of the interaction potential,
the resulting kinetic theory does not suffer from the typical divergences at
short and long length scales encountered when applying the standard kinetic
equations to Coulomb interactions. The approach demonstrates that particles
effectively interact via the potential of mean force and that the range of this
force determines the size of the collision volume. When applied to a plasma,
the collision operator is shown to be related to the effective potential theory
[Baalrud and Daligault, Phys. Rev. Lett 110, 235001 (2013)]. The relationship
between this and previous kinetic theories is discussed.

many domains, the machine learning algorithms, and in particular the deep

themselves. Some algorithms do allow for some scaling of large computations by
leveraging data parallelism. However, they often require a large amount of data
to be exchanged in order to ensure the shared knowledge throughout the compute
nodes is accurate.
  In this work, the effect of different levels of communications between deep
learning models is studied, in particular how it affects performance. The first
approach studied looks at decentralizing the numerous computations that are
done in parallel in training procedures such as synchronous and asynchronous
stochastic gradient descent. In this setting, a simplified communication that
consists of exchanging low bandwidth outputs between compute nodes can be
beneficial. In the following chapter, the communication protocol is slightly
modified to further include training instructions. Indeed, this is studied in a
simplified setup where a pre-trained model, analogous to a teacher, can
customize a randomly initialized model's training procedure to accelerate
learning. Finally, a communication channel where two deep learning models can
exchange a purposefully crafted language is explored while allowing for
different ways of optimizing that language.

modified technique is obtained by accounting for the bias in the regression
problem resulting in the old kernel ridge regression but with \emph{centered}
kernels. The analysis is carried out under the assumption that the data is
drawn from a Gaussian distribution and heavily relies on tools from random
matrix theory (RMT). Under the regime in which the data dimension and the
training size grow infinitely large with fixed ratio and under some mild
assumptions controlling the data statistics, we show that both the empirical
and the prediction risks converge to a deterministic quantities that describe
in closed form fashion the performance of CKRR in terms of the data statistics
and dimensions. Inspired by this theoretical result, we subsequently build a
consistent estimator of the prediction risk based on the training data which
allows to optimally tune the design parameters. A key insight of the proposed
analysis is the fact that asymptotically a large class of kernels achieve the
same minimum prediction risk. This insight is validated with both synthetic and

for the skyrmion center-of-mass, which remain finite down to zero temperature
due to the quantum nature of the magnon bath. We show that the quantum version
of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem acquires a non-trivial temperature
dependence. As a consequence, the skyrmion mean square displacement is finite
at zero temperature and has a fast thermal activation that scales quadratically
with temperature, contrary to the linear increase predicted by the classical
phenomenological theory. The effects of an external oscillating drive which
couples directly on the magnon bath are investigated. We generalize the
standard quantum theory of dissipation and we show explicitly that additional
time-dependent dissipation terms are generated by the external drive. From
these we emphasize a friction and a topological charge renormalization term,
which are absent in the static limit. The skyrmion response function inherits
the time periodicity of the driving field and it is thus enhanced and lowered
over a driving cycle. Finally, we provide a generalized version of the
nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for weakly driven baths.

for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint.
This framework has a continuous optimization part and a rounding part. We
extend both parts to a wider array of problems. In particular, we make a
conceptual contribution by identifying a family of parameterized functions. As
a running example we focus on solving diversity problems $\max
f(S)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j\in A}A_{ij}:S\in\mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is
a matroid. These diversity functions have $A_{ij}\geq 0$ as a measure of
dissimilarity of $i,j$, and $A$ has $0$-diagonal. The multilinear framework
cannot be directly applied to the multilinear extension of such functions. We
introduce a new parameter for functions $F\in{\bf C}^2$ which measures the
approximability of the associated problem $\max\{F(x):x\in P\}$, for solvable
downwards-closed polytopes $P$. A function $F$ is called one-sided
$\sigma$-smooth if $\frac{1}{2}u^T\nabla^2 F(x)
u\leq\sigma\cdot\frac{||u||_1}{||x||_1}u^T\nabla F(x)$ for all $u,x\geq 0$,
$x\neq 0$.
  We give an $\Omega(1/\sigma)$-approximation for the maximization problem of
monotone, normalized one-sided $\sigma$-smooth $F$ with an additional property:
non-positive third order partial derivatives. Using the multilinear framework
and new matroid rounding techniques for quadratic objectives, we give an
$\Omega(1/\sigma^{3/2})$-approximation for maximizing a $\sigma$-semi-metric
diversity function subject to matroid constraint. This improves upon the
previous best bound of $\Omega(1/\sigma^2)$ and we give evidence that it may be
tight. For general one-sided smooth functions, we show the continuous process
gives an $\Omega(1/3^{2\sigma})$-approximation, independent of $n$. In this
setting, by discretizing, we present a poly-time algorithm for multilinear
one-sided $\sigma$-smooth functions.

cosmic-rays through Fermi acceleration at the shock interface. The accelerated

non-thermal emission observable in X-rays and gamma-rays. The supermassive

a high energy source near eta Carinae, but have been unable to conclusively

spatially coincident with the star within several arc-seconds. These
observations show that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital
phase of the binary, and that the photon index of the emission is similar to
that derived through analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum. This is conclusive
evidence that the high-energy emission indeed originates from non-thermal

dependence for every relevant problem parameter. A crucial component of our
lower bound proof is a decomposition lemma (see Lemmas 17 and 18) showing how
to assemble partially-adaptive bounds into a fully-adaptive bound, which may be
of independent interest: though we invoke it for the special case of Bernoulli
random variables (coins), it applies to general distributions. We present
simulation results to demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach for
realistic problem parameters for crowdsourcing applications, focusing on the
""rare events"" regime where $\rho$ is small. The fine-grained adaptive flavor of
both our algorithm and lower bound contrasts with much previous work in
distributional testing and learning.

It consists of two key contributions, a criss-cross attention based
segmentation network and radiorealistic chest X-ray image synthesis (i.e. a
synthesized radiograph that appears anatomically realistic) for data
augmentation. The criss-cross attention modules capture rich global contextual
information in both horizontal and vertical directions for all the pixels thus
facilitating accurate lung segmentation. To reduce the manual annotation burden
and to train a robust lung segmentor that can be adapted to pathological lungs
with hazy lung boundaries, an image-to-image translation module is employed to
synthesize radiorealistic abnormal CXRs from the source of normal ones for data
augmentation. The lung masks of synthetic abnormal CXRs are propagated from the
segmentation results of their normal counterparts, and then serve as pseudo
masks for robust segmentor training. In addition, we annotate 100 CXRs with
lung masks on a more challenging NIH Chest X-ray dataset containing both
posterioranterior and anteroposterior views for evaluation. Extensive
experiments validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed
framework. The code and data can be found from

simulations in circular geometry with toroidal limiter against realistic
diverted geometry at otherwise comparable parameters. Turbulence is found to be
intermittent with relative fluctuation levels of up to 40% showing that a
global description is indeed important. At the same time via direct comparison,
we find that the Boussinesq approximation has only a small quantitative impact
in a turbulent environment. In comparison to circular geometry the fluctuations
are reduced in diverted geometry, which is related to a different zonal flow
structure. Moreover, the fluctuation level has a more complex spatial
distribution in diverted geometry. Due to local magnetic shear, which differs
fundamentally in circular and diverted geometry, turbulent structures become
strongly distorted in the perpendicular direction and are eventually damped
away towards the X-point.

To examine the impact of media in online social networks, we generalize
bounded-confidence models of opinion dynamics by incorporating media accounts
as influencers in a network. We quantify partisanship of content with a
continuous parameter on an interval, and we formulate higher-dimensional
generalizations to incorporate content quality and increasingly nuanced
political positions. We simulate our model with one and two ideological

""entrainment"" of content from non-media accounts to the ideologies of media
accounts in a network. We maximize media impact in a social network by tuning
the number of media accounts that promote the content and the number of
followers of the accounts. Using numerical computations, we find that the
entrainment of the ideology of content spread by non-media accounts to media
ideology depends on a network's structural features, including its size, the
mean number of followers of its nodes, and the receptiveness of its nodes to
different opinions. We then introduce content quality --- a key novel

currently best known upper bound on the expected runtime is
$\mathcal{O}(n\lambda\log\lambda+n^2)$ (Dang and Lehre, GECCO 2015), while a
lower bound necessary to understand how the algorithm copes with variable

requires a $e^{\Omega(\mu)}$ runtime with high probability and in expectation
if the selective pressure is low; otherwise, we obtain a lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{n\lambda}{\log(\lambda-\mu)})$ on the expected runtime.
Furthermore, we for the first time consider the algorithm on the function under

stochastic volatility model where the instantaneous variance is modelled by a
lognormal process with drift and fractional diffusion. Since the DO process is
a semi-martingale, it can be represented as an \Ito diffusion. It turns out
that in this framework the process for the spot price $S_t$ is a geometric BM
with stochastic instantaneous volatility $\sigma_t$, the process for $\sigma_t$
is also a geometric BM with stochastic speed of mean reversion and
time-dependent colatility of volatility, and the supplementary process
$\calV_t$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with time-dependent coefficients,
and is also a function of the Hurst exponent. We also introduce an adjusted DO
process which provides a uniformly good approximation of the fractional BM for
all Hurst exponents $H \in [0,1]$ but requires a complex measure. Finally, the
characteristic function (CF) of $\log S_t$ in our model can be found in closed

swaps (by using a forward CF) can be done via FFT, which is much easier than in

We develop a new prediction model that can flexibly characterize a time-varying

problem as an optimization problem with unequal overestimation and
underestimation costs. Based on real option theories developed in finance, we
solve the optimization problem and obtain a predicted value, which can minimize
the expected prediction cost. We evaluate the proposed approach using multiple
datasets obtained from real-life applications including manufacturing, finance,

environmental changes and triggering adaptations that maintain homeostasis. The
general physical mechanism behind protein clamping action, however, is poorly
understood. Here, we explore the Davydov model for quantum transport of amide I
energy, which is self-trapped in soliton states that propagate along the
protein {\alpha}-helix spines and preserve their shape upon reflection from the
{\alpha}-helix ends. We study computationally whether the Davydov solitons are
able to reflect from massive barriers that model the presence of external
protein clamps acting on a portion of the {\alpha}-helix, and characterize the
range of barrier conditions for which the Davydov solitons are capable of
tunneling through the barrier. The simulations showed that the variability of
amino acid masses in proteins has a negligible effect on Davydov soliton
dynamics, but a massive barrier that is a hundred times the mass of a single
amino acid presents an obstacle for the soliton propagation. The greater width
of Davydov solitons stabilizes the soliton upon reflection from such a massive
barrier and increases the probability of tunneling through it, whereas the
greater isotropy of the exciton-lattice coupling suppresses the tunneling
efficiency by increasing the interaction time between the Davydov soliton and
the barrier, thereby prolonging the tunneling time through the barrier and
enhancing the probability for reflection from the latter. The results as
presented, demonstrate the feasibility of Davydov solitons reflecting from or
tunneling through massive barriers, and suggest a general physical mechanism
underlying the action of protein clamps through local enhancement of an
effective protein {\alpha}-helix mass.

jointly optimize the energy beamforming design, the transmit time allocation

general definition of Markov stability, based on the difference between the
probability fluxes of a Markov chain on the network at different time scales.
The specific implementation of the quality function and the resulting optimal
community structure thus become dependent both on the type of Markov process
and on the specific Markov times considered. For instance, if we use a natural
Markov chain dynamics and discount its stationary distribution -- that is, we
take as reference process the dynamics at infinite time -- we obtain the
standard formulation of the Markov stability. Notably, the possibility to use
finite-time transition probabilities to define the reference process naturally
allows detecting communities at different resolutions, without the need to
consider a continuous-time Markov chain in the small time limit. The main
advantage of our general formulation of Markov stability based on dynamical
flows is that we work with lumped Markov chains on network partitions, having
the same stationary distribution of the original process. In this way the form
of the quality function becomes invariant under partitioning, leading to a
self-consistent definition of community structures at different aggregation
scales.

beneficial alleles that lie on different chromosomes, which speeds up the time
that those beneficial alleles spread to the entire population. We consider a
population model of fixed size $N$, in which we will focus on two loci on a
chromosome. Each allele at each locus can mutate into a beneficial allele at
rate $\mu_N$. The individuals with 0, 1, and 2 beneficial alleles die at rates
$1, 1-s_N$ and $1-2s_N$ respectively. When an individual dies, with probability
$1-r_N$, the new individual inherits both alleles from one parent, chosen at
random from the population, while with probability $r_N$, recombination occurs,
and the new individual receives its two alleles from different parents. Under
certain assumptions on the parameters $N, \mu_N, s_N$ and $r_N$, we obtain an

field theory, also known as thermal field theory, and study the thermodynamic
behavior of both a local and a nonlocal scalar field theory. We compute
(primarily leading-order) thermal corrections to the partition function for in
low- and high- temperature expansions and calculate the thermal mass which is
acquired through continuous interactions with the heat bath. We prove that the
nonlocality does not contribute to the partition function of the free nonlocal

interactions and we conclude that the partition function of the local and the

detection and object tracking are considered to be the crucial modules. In
recent times, using the real time video one wants to narrate the scene captured
by the camera fitted in our vehicle. To effectively implement this task, deep
learning techniques and automatic video annotation tools are widely used. In
the present paper, we compare the various techniques that are available for
each module and choose the best algorithm among them by using appropriate
metrics. For object detection, YOLO and Retinanet-50 are considered and the
best one is chosen based on mean Average Precision (mAP). For object
classification, we consider VGG-19 and Resnet-50 and select the best algorithm
based on low error rate and good accuracy. For lane detection, Udacity's
'Finding Lane Line' and deep learning based LaneNet algorithms are compared and
the best one that can accurately identify the given lane is chosen for
implementation. As far as object tracking is concerned, we compare Udacity's
'Object Detection and Tracking' algorithm and deep learning based Deep Sort
algorithm. Based on the accuracy of tracking the same object in many frames and
predicting the movement of objects, the best algorithm is chosen. Our automatic
video annotation tool is found to be 83% accurate when compared with a human
annotator. We considered a video with 530 frames each of resolution 1035 x 1800
pixels. At an average each frame had about 15 objects. Our annotation tool
consumed 43 minutes in a CPU based system and 2.58 minutes in a mid-level GPU
based system to process all four modules. But the same video took nearly 3060
minutes for one human annotator to narrate the scene in the given video. Thus
we claim that our proposed automatic video annotation tool is reasonably fast
(about 1200 times in a GPU system) and accurate.

(MRFSWSnet) to achieve fast object detection. In MRFSWSnet, multiple receptive

small object detection, a small-object-focusing weakly-supervised segmentation
module which only focuses on small object instead of all objects is integrated
into the detection network for auxiliary training to improve the precision of
small object detection. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our
method on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO detection datasets. In particular, with a
lower resolution version of 300x300, MRFSWSnet achieves 80.9% mAP on VOC2007

Physicists' earliest understanding of naturalness, as an autonomy of scales
(AoS) requirement provides the most cogent definition of naturalness and I will
assert that i) this provides a uniform notion which undergirds a myriad
prominent naturalness conditions, ii) this is a reasonable criterion to impose
on EFTs and iii) the successes and violations of naturalness are best
understood when adhering to this notion of naturalness. I argue that this
principle is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced principle. I
contend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an
aesthetic/sociological principle when formal measures of naturalness and their
use in physics communities are conflated with the central dogma of naturalness
- the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced and somewhat
arbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less
successful than AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS
naturalness is well-defined and why it was reasonable for physicists to endorse
this naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical grounds.
  Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature
should generically decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A
decoupling of scales in the quantum realm is often claimed to be entailed by
the Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show that this
theorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum
field theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be
natural. Violations of naturalness would then have ontological import -
unnatural parameters would not be accurately described by EFTs but rather by
field theories exhibiting some kind of UV/IR interplay.
