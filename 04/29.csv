temperature gradient and vice versa hence they can be used to harvest waste
heat into electricity and in thermal management applications. However, finding
highly efficient thermoelectrics with high figures of merit, zT$\geq$1, is very
challenging because the combination of high power factor and low thermal
conductivity is rare in materials. Here, we use first-principles methods to
analyze the thermoelectric properties of Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ ($X$=S,Se), a recently
synthesized class of lithium fast-ion conductors presenting high thermal
stability. In p-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, we estimate highly flat electronic valence
bands that render high Seebeck coefficients exceeding 400 ${\mu}$VK$^{-1}$ at
700K. In n-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, the electronic conduction bands are slightly
dispersive however the accompanying weak electron-acoustic phonon scattering
induces high electrical conductivity. The combination of high Seebeck
coefficient and electrical conductivity gives rise to high power factors,
reaching a maximum of 4 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ and 8
mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at 300 K. Likewise, the thermal
conductivity in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ is low as compared to conventional thermoelectric
materials, 2-5 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature. As a result, we estimate
a maximum zT = 1.05 in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ at 700 K and an extraordinary 3.07
(1.5) in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at the same temperature (300 K). Our findings of
huge zT in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ suggest that lithium fast-ion conductors, typically
employed as electrolytes in solid-state batteries, hold exceptional promise as
thermoelectric materials.

statistical analysis of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) data with the goal of
enhancing the prediction accuracy of genomic selection (GS). Following the
Introduction in Section 1, Section 2 discusses field-based HTP, including the
use of unmanned aerial vehicles and light detection and ranging, as well as how
we can achieve increased genetic gain by utilizing image data derived from HTP.
Section 3 considers extending commonly used GS models to integrate HTP data as
covariates associated with the principal trait response, such as yield.
Particular focus is placed on single-trait, multi-trait, and genotype by
environment interaction models. One unique aspect of HTP data is that phenomics
platforms often produce large-scale data with high spatial and temporal
resolution for capturing dynamic growth, development, and stress responses.
Section 4 discusses the utility of a random regression model for performing
longitudinal GS. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some standing
issues.

to query zero-streaming cameras efficiently? Our response is a camera/cloud
runtime system called DIVA. It addresses two key challenges: to best use
limited camera resource during video capture; to rapidly explore massive videos
during query execution. DIVA contributes two unconventional techniques. (1)
When capturing videos, a camera builds sparse yet accurate landmark frames,
from which it learns reliable knowledge for accelerating future queries. (2)
When executing a query, a camera processes frames in multiple passes with
increasingly more expensive operators. As such, DIVA presents and keeps
refining inexact query results throughout the query's execution. On diverse
queries over 15 videos lasting 720 hours in total, DIVA runs at more than 100x

to utilize strong spin-orbit coupling present in transition metal

circularly polarized emission of the monolayer preferentially couples to one

  We previously published TiCoNE, an interactive clustering approach coupled
with de-novo network enrichment of identified clusters. However, in this first
version time-series and network analysis remained two separate steps in that
only time-series data was clustered, and identified clusters mapped to and
enriched within a network in a second separate step.
  In this work, we present TiCoNE 2: An extension that can now seamlessly
incorporate multiple data types within its composite clustering model.
Systematic evaluation on 50 random data sets, as well as on 2,400 data sets
containing enriched cluster structure and varying levels of noise, shows that
our approach is able to successfully recover cluster patterns embedded in
random data and that it is more robust towards noise than non-composite models
using only one data type, when applied to two data types simultaneously.
  Herein, each data set was clustered using five different similarity functions
into k=10/30 clusters, resulting to ~5,000 clusterings in total. We evaluated
the quality of each derived clustering with the Jaccard index and an internal
validity score. We used TiCoNE to calculate empirical p-values for all
generated clusters with different permutation functions, resulting in ~80,000
cluster p-values. We show, that derived p-values can be used to reliably
distinguish between foreground and background clusters.

patterns. Bandit algorithms, like EXP3, fail to provide good guarantees for
periodic behaviors. A major reason is that these algorithms compete against
fixed-action policies, which is ineffective in a periodic setting.
  In this paper, we define a periodic bandit setting, and periodic regret as a
better performance measure for this type of setting. Instead of comparing an
algorithm's performance to fixed-action policies, we aim to be competitive with
policies that play arms under some set of possible periodic patterns $F$ (for
example, all possible periodic functions with periods $1,2,\cdots,P$). We
propose Periodic EXP4, a computationally efficient variant of the EXP4
algorithm for periodic settings. With $K$ arms, $T$ time steps, and where each
periodic pattern in $F$ is of length at most $P$, we show that the periodic
regret obtained by Periodic EXP4 is at most $O\big(\sqrt{PKT \log K + KT \log

\frac{\log |F|}{\log K}} \big)$ for the periodic setting, showing that this is

visual quality; however, it requires well-defined, high-quality 3D content as
input. In this work, we explore the use of imperfect 3D content, for instance,
obtained from photo-metric reconstructions with noisy and incomplete surface
geometry, while still aiming to produce photo-realistic (re-)renderings. To
address this challenging problem, we introduce Deferred Neural Rendering, a new
paradigm for image synthesis that combines the traditional graphics pipeline
with learnable components. Specifically, we propose Neural Textures, which are
learned feature maps that are trained as part of the scene capture process.
Similar to traditional textures, neural textures are stored as maps on top of
3D mesh proxies; however, the high-dimensional feature maps contain
significantly more information, which can be interpreted by our new deferred
neural rendering pipeline. Both neural textures and deferred neural renderer
are trained end-to-end, enabling us to synthesize photo-realistic images even
when the original 3D content was imperfect. In contrast to traditional,
black-box 2D generative neural networks, our 3D representation gives us
explicit control over the generated output, and allows for a wide range of
application domains. For instance, we can synthesize temporally-consistent
video re-renderings of recorded 3D scenes as our representation is inherently
embedded in 3D space. This way, neural textures can be utilized to coherently
re-render or manipulate existing video content in both static and dynamic
environments at real-time rates. We show the effectiveness of our approach in
several experiments on novel view synthesis, scene editing, and facial
reenactment, and compare to state-of-the-art approaches that leverage the
standard graphics pipeline as well as conventional generative neural networks.

  Collaboration",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-robot collaboration (HRC) has emerged as a hot research area at the
intersection of control, robotics, and psychology in recent years. It is of
critical importance to obtain an expressive but meanwhile tractable model for
human beings in HRC. In this paper, we propose a model called Vector
Autoregressive POMDP (VAR-POMDP) model which is an extension of the traditional
POMDP model by considering the correlation among observations. The VAR-POMDP
model is more powerful in the expressiveness of features than the traditional
continuous observation POMDP since the traditional one is a special case of the
VAR-POMDP model. Meanwhile, the proposed VAR-POMDP model is also tractable, as
we show that it can be effectively learned from data and we can extend
point-based value iteration (PBVI) to VAR-POMDP planning. Particularly, in this
paper, we propose to use the Bayesian non-parametric learning to decide
potential human states and learn a VAR-POMDP model using data collected from
human demonstrations. Then, we consider planning with respect to PCTL which is
widely used as safety and reachability requirement in robotics. Finally, the
advantage of using the proposed model for HRC is validated by experimental
results using data collected from a driver-assistance test-bed.

datasets, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to learn features from
unlabeled point cloud ""3D object"" dataset by using part contrasting and object
clustering with deep graph neural networks (GNNs). In the contrast learning
step, all the samples in the 3D object dataset are cut into two parts and put
into a ""part"" dataset. Then a contrast learning GNN (ContrastNet) is trained to
verify whether two randomly sampled parts from the part dataset belong to the
same object. In the cluster learning step, the trained ContrastNet is applied
to all the samples in the original 3D object dataset to extract features, which
are used to group the samples into clusters. Then another GNN for clustering
learning (ClusterNet) is trained to predict the cluster ID of all the training
samples. The contrasting learning forces the ContrastNet to learn high-level
semantic features of objects but probably ignores low-level features, while the
ClusterNet improves the quality of learned features by being trained to
discover objects that probably belong to the same semantic categories by the
use of cluster IDs. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed framework on point cloud classification tasks. The proposed
unsupervised learning approach obtained comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods that used much more complicated

and conditional independence relations among variables by directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs). We propose a novel structure learning method, annealing on
regularized Cholesky score (ARCS), to search over topological sorts, or
permutations of nodes, for a high-scoring Bayesian network. Our scoring
function is derived from regularizing Gaussian DAG likelihood, and its
optimization gives an alternative formulation of the sparse Cholesky
factorization problem from a statistical viewpoint, which is of independent
interest. We combine global simulated annealing over permutations with a fast
proximal gradient algorithm, operating on triangular matrices of edge
coefficients, to compute the score of any permutation. Combined, the two
approaches allow us to quickly and effectively search over the space of DAGs
without the need to verify the acyclicity constraint or to enumerate possible
parent sets given a candidate topological sort. The annealing aspect of the
optimization is able to consistently improve the accuracy of DAGs learned by
local search algorithms. In addition, we develop several techniques to
facilitate the structure learning, including pre-annealing data-driven tuning
parameter selection and post-annealing constraint-based structure refinement.
Through extensive numerical comparisons, we show that ARCS achieves substantial
improvements over existing methods, demonstrating its great potential to learn
Bayesian networks from both observational and experimental data.

compressing ConvNets. Prior art in filter pruning requires users to specify a
target model complexity (e.g., model size or FLOP count) for the resulting
architecture. However, determining a target model complexity can be difficult
for optimizing various embodied AI applications such as autonomous robots,
drones, and user-facing applications. First, both the accuracy and the speed of
ConvNets can affect the performance of the application. Second, the performance
of the application can be hard to assess without evaluating ConvNets during
inference. As a consequence, finding a sweet-spot between the accuracy and
speed via filter pruning, which needs to be done in a trial-and-error fashion,
can be time-consuming. This work takes a first step toward making this process
more efficient by altering the goal of model compression to producing a set of
ConvNets with various accuracy and latency trade-offs instead of producing one
ConvNet targeting some pre-defined latency constraint. To this end, we propose
to learn a global ranking of the filters across different layers of the
ConvNet, which is used to obtain a set of ConvNet architectures that have
different accuracy/latency trade-offs by pruning the bottom-ranked filters. Our
proposed algorithm, LeGR, is shown to be 2x to 3x faster than prior work while

Burgers equation called a nonlinear diffusion wave and its optimal asymptotic
rate is obtained. In this paper, we focus on the case that the initial data
decay more slowly than previous works and derive the corresponding asymptotic
profiles. Moreover, we investigate how the change of the decay rate of the
initial values affect its asymptotic rate.

generalized method of lines. In such a method, the domain of the PDE in
question is discretized in lines and the equation solution is written on these
lines as functions of the boundary conditions and domain shape. The main
objective of introducing a proximal formulation is to minimize the solution
error as a typical parameter $\varepsilon>0$ is too small. In a second step we
present another procedure to minimize this same error, namely, the hyper-finite
differences approach. In this last method the domain is divided in sub-domains
on which the solution is obtained through the generalized method of lines
allowing the parameter $\varepsilon>0$ to be very small without increasing the
solution error. The solutions for the sub-domains are connected through the
boundary conditions and the solution of the partial differential equation in
question on the node lines which separate the sub-domains. In the last sections
of each text part we present the concerning softwares and perform numerical
examples.

completion time minimization in NOMA multiuser MEC networks, where multiple
users can offload their tasks simultaneously via the same frequency band. We
adopt the \emph{partial} offloading, in which each user can partition its
computation task into offloading computing and locally computing parts. We aim
to minimize the maximum task latency among users by optimizing their tasks
partition ratios and offloading transmit power. By considering the energy
consumption and transmitted power limitation of each user, the formulated
problem is quasi-convex. Thus, a bisection search (BSS) iterative algorithm is
proposed to obtain the minimum task completion time. To reduce the complexity
of the BSS algorithm and evaluate its optimality, we further derive the
closed-form expressions of the optimal task partition ratio and offloading
power for two-user NOMA MEC networks based on the analysed results. Simulation

of $P$ is a strong divisibility sequence in the sense that $\gcd(D_m, D_n) =

employ a discrete approximation framework that applies the same order of
interpolation for the displacement and phase-field variables. Most common is to
use linear finite elements to discretize the linear momentum and phase-field
equations. However the use of $P_1$ Lagrange shape functions to model the
phase-field is not optimal, since the latter develops cusps for fully developed
cracks that in turn occur at locations correspoding to Gauss points of the
associated FE model for the mechanics. Such feature is challenging to reproduce
accurately with low order elements, and consequently element sizes must be made
very small relative to the phase-field regularization parameter in order to
achieve convergence of results with respect to the mesh. In this paper, we
combine the standard $P_1$ FE discretization of stress equilibrium with a
cell-centered finite volume approximation of the phase-field evolution equation
based on the two-point flux approximation that is constructed on the same
simplex mesh. Compared to a pure FE formulation utilizing linear elements, the
proposed framework results in looser restrictions on mesh refinement with
respect to the phase-field length scale. Furthermore, initialization of the
history field is straightforward and accomplished through a local procedure.
The ability to employ a coarser mesh relative to the traditional implementation
is shown for several numerical examples, demonstrating savings in computational
cost on the order of 50 to 80 percent for the studied cases.

this model by identifying affiliates playing an important role in international

found in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, etc., and tended to be located
in jurisdictions favorable to treaty shopping. And it was found that such key
firms are concentrated on the IN component of the bow-tie structure that the
giant weakly connected component of the Global Ownership Network consist of.
Therefore, it clarifies that the key firms are geographically located in
specific jurisdictions, and concentrates on specific components in the Global
Ownership Network. The location of key firms are related with the ease of
treaty shopping, and there is a difference in the jurisdiction where key firms
are located depending on the location of the multinational corporations.

the ground truth. Unlike a naive linear combination of the two knowledge
sources, the conditional learning is exclusively engaged with the teacher model
when the teacher model's prediction is correct, and otherwise backs off to the
ground truth. Thus, the student model is able to learn effectively from the
teacher and even potentially surpass the teacher. We examine the proposed
learning scheme on two tasks: domain adaptation on CHiME-3 dataset and speaker
adaptation on Microsoft short message dictation dataset. The proposed method

suppressing the effects of domain variability in acoustic modeling and has led
to improved performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In ADIT, an
auxiliary domain classifier takes in equally-weighted deep features from a deep
neural network (DNN) acoustic model and is trained to improve their
domain-invariance by optimizing an adversarial loss function. In this work, we
propose an attentive ADIT (AADIT) in which we advance the domain classifier
with an attention mechanism to automatically weight the input deep features
according to their importance in domain classification. With this attentive
re-weighting, AADIT can focus on the domain normalization of phonetic
components that are more susceptible to domain variability and generates deep
features with improved domain-invariance and senone-discriminativity over ADIT.
Most importantly, the attention block serves only as an external component to
the DNN acoustic model and is not involved in ASR, so AADIT can be used to
improve the acoustic modeling with any DNN architectures. More generally, the
same methodology can improve any adversarial learning system with an auxiliary
discriminator. Evaluated on CHiME-3 dataset, the AADIT achieves 13.6% and 9.3%
relative WER improvements, respectively, over a multi-conditional model and a

  within the myofilament lattice","4 figs, 3 supplemental movies, 1 supplemental figure",,,,"q-bio.SC q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  During muscle contraction, myosin motors anchored to thick filaments bind to
and slide actin thin filaments. These motors rely on energy derived from ATP,
supplied, in part, by diffusion from the sarcoplasm to the interior of the
lattice of actin and myosin filaments. The radial spacing of filaments in this
lattice may change or remain constant during contraction. If the lattice is
isovolumetric, it must expand when the muscle shortens. If, however, the
spacing is constant or has a different pattern of axial and radial motion, then
the lattice changes volume during contraction, driving fluid motion and
assisting in the transport of molecules between the contractile lattice and the
surrounding intracellular space. We first create an
advective-diffusive-reaction flow model and show that the flow into and out of
the sarcomere lattice would be significant in the absence of lattice expansion.
Advective transport coupled to diffusion has the potential to substantially
enhance metabolite exchange within the crowded sarcomere. Using time-resolved
x-ray diffraction of contracting muscle, we next show that the contractile
lattice is neither isovolumetric nor constant in spacing. Instead, lattice
spacing is time-varying, depends on activation, and can manifest as an
effective time-varying Poisson ratio. The resulting fluid flow in the sarcomere
lattice of synchronous insect flight muscles is greater than expected for
constant lattice spacing conditions. Lattice spacing depends on a variety of
factors that produce radial force, including crossbridges, titin-like
molecules, and other structural proteins. Volume change and advective transport
varies with the phase of muscle stimulation but remains significant at all
conditions. Akin to ""breathing,"" advective-diffusive transport in sarcomeres is
sufficient to promote metabolite exchange and may play a role in the regulation
of contraction itself.

promising candidates for a number of observed types of stellar transients,

outcome has not yet emerged. We explore the conditions of helium ignition in
the white dwarf and the final fates of helium star-WD binaries as function of
their initial orbital periods and component masses. We compute 274 model binary
systems with the Binary Evolution Code (BEC), where both components are fully
resolved. Stellar and orbital evolution is computed simultaneously, including
mass and angular momentum transfer, tides, and gravitational wave emission, as
well as differential rotation and internal hydrodynamic and magnetic angular
momentum transport. We find that helium detonations are expected only in
systems with the shortest initial orbital periods, and for initially massive
white dwarfs (MWD > 1.0 MSun ) and lower mass donors (Mdonor < 0.8 MSun), with
accumulated helium layers mostly exceeding 0.1 MSun. Upon detonation, these
systems would release the donor as a hypervelocity pre-WD runaway star, for
which we predict the expected range of kinematic and stellar properties.
Systems with more massive donors or initial periods exceeding 1.5 h will likely
undergo helium deflagrations after accumulating 0.1 - 0.001 MSun of helium.
Helium ignition in the white dwarf is avoided in systems with helium donor
stars below - 0.6 MSun, and lead to three distinctly different groups of double
white dwarf systems. The size of the parameter space open to helium detonation
corresponds to only about 3 % of the galactic SN Ia rate, and to 10 % of the SN
Iax rate, while the predicted large amounts of helium (>0.1 MSun) in
progenitors cannot easily be reconciled with observations of archetypical SN
Ia. ...

graphs. Since the problem of computing an optimal coloring, or even
approximating it to within $n^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$, is NP-hard
in static graphs, there is no hope to achieve any meaningful computational
results for general graphs in the dynamic setting. It is therefore only natural
to consider the combinatorial aspects of dynamic coloring, or alternatively,
study restricted families of graphs.
  Towards understanding the combinatorial aspects of this problem, one may
assume a black-box access to a static algorithm for $C$-coloring any subgraph
of the dynamic graph, and investigate the trade-off between the number of
colors and the number of recolorings per update step. In WADS'17, Barba et al.
devised two complementary algorithms: For any $\beta > 0$ the first
(respectively, second) maintains an $O(C \beta n^{1/\beta})$ (resp., $O(C
\beta)$)-coloring while recoloring $O(\beta)$ (resp., $O(\beta n^{1/\beta})$)
vertices per update. Our contribution is two-fold:
  - We devise a new algorithm for general graphs that improves significantly
upon the first trade-off in a wide range of parameters: For any $\beta > 0$, we
get a $\tilde{O}(\frac{C}{\beta}\log^2 n)$-coloring with $O(\beta)$ recolorings
per update, where the $\tilde{O}$ notation supresses polyloglog$(n)$ factors.
In particular, for $\beta=O(1)$ we get constant recolorings with polylog$(n)$
colors; this is an exponential improvement over the previous bound.
  - For uniformly sparse graphs, we use low out-degree orientations to
strengthen the above result by bounding the update time of the algorithm rather
than the number of recolorings. Then, we further improve this result by
introducing a new data structure that refines bounded out-degree edge
orientations and is of independent interest.

different domains by using unpaired data, which has received increasing
research focus due to its practical usage. However, existing UIT schemes defect
in the need of supervised training, as well as the lack of encoding domain
information. In this paper, we propose an Attribute Guided UIT model termed
AGUIT to tackle these two challenges. AGUIT considers multi-modal and
multi-domain tasks of UIT jointly with a novel semi-supervised setting, which
also merits in representation disentanglement and fine control of outputs.
Especially, AGUIT benefits from two-fold: (1) It adopts a novel semi-supervised
learning process by translating attributes of labeled data to unlabeled data,
and then reconstructing the unlabeled data by a cycle consistency operation.
(2) It decomposes image representation into domain-invariant content code and
domain-specific style code. The redesigned style code embeds image style into
two variables drawn from standard Gaussian distribution and the distribution of
domain label, which facilitates the fine control of translation due to the
continuity of both variables. Finally, we introduce a new challenge, i.e.,
disentangled transfer, for UIT models, which adopts the disentangled
representation to translate data less related with the training set. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the capacity of AGUIT over existing state-of-the-art
models.

innovations proposed have outpaced researchers' ability to analyze, study and
adapt them. This is exacerbated by the complicated and sometimes
non-reproducible procedures for ML evaluation. A common practice of sharing ML
artifacts is through repositories where artifact authors post ad-hoc code and
some documentation, but often fail to reveal critical information for others to
reproduce their results. This results in users' inability to compare with
artifact authors' claims or adapt the model to his/her own use. This paper
discusses common challenges and pitfalls of ML evaluation and benchmarking,

Specifically, we relate the observed $EB$ correlation to the difference between
the $\mathit{observed}$ $E$- and $B$-mode spectra in the sky, and use different
multipole dependence of the CMB (given by theory) and foreground spectra (with

for large scale optimization problems. While classical theoretical analysis of
SGD for convex problems studies (suffix) \emph{averages} of iterates and
obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the
\emph{last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice. The
best known results for last point of SGD \cite{shamir2013stochastic} however,
are suboptimal compared to information theoretic lower bounds by a $\log T$
factor, where $T$ is the number of iterations. \cite{harvey2018tight} shows
that in fact, this additional $\log T$ factor is tight for standard step size
sequences of $\OTheta{\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}}$ and $\OTheta{\frac{1}{t}}$ for
non-strongly convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Similarly, even
for subgradient descent (GD) when applied to non-smooth, convex functions, the
best known step-size sequences still lead to $O(\log T)$-suboptimal convergence
rates (on the final iterate). The main contribution of this work is to design
new step size sequences that enjoy information theoretically optimal bounds on
the suboptimality of \emph{last point} of SGD as well as GD. We achieve this by
designing a modification scheme, that converts one sequence of step sizes to
another so that the last point of SGD/GD with modified sequence has the same
suboptimality guarantees as the average of SGD/GD with original sequence. We
also show that our result holds with high-probability. We validate our results
through simulations which demonstrate that the new step size sequence indeed
improves the final iterate significantly compared to the standard step size
sequences.

evolution because it can probe the ages of stars. Earlier attempts comparing
seismic data from the {\it Kepler} satellite with predictions from Galaxy
models found that the models predicted more low-mass stars compared to the
observed distribution of masses. It was unclear if the mismatch was due to
inaccuracies in the Galactic models, or the unknown aspects of the selection
function of the stars. Using new data from the K2 mission, which has a
well-defined selection function, we find that an old metal-poor thick disc, as
used in previous Galactic models, is incompatible with the asteroseismic
information. We show that spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] and
[$\alpha$/Fe] elemental abundances from the GALAH survey indicate a mean
metallicity of $\log (Z/Z_{\odot})=-0.16$ for the thick disc. Here $Z$ is the
effective solar-scaled metallicity, which is a function of [Fe/H] and
[$\alpha$/Fe]. With the revised disc metallicities, for the first time, the
theoretically predicted distribution of seismic masses show excellent agreement
with the observed distribution of masses. This provides an indirect
verification of the asteroseismic mass scaling relation is good to within five
percent. Using an importance-sampling framework that takes the selection
function into account, we fit a population synthesis model of the Galaxy to the
observed seismic and spectroscopic data. Assuming the asteroseismic scaling
relations are correct, we estimate the mean age of the thick disc to be about
10 Gyr, in agreement with the traditional idea of an old $\alpha$-enhanced
thick disc.

only ubiquitous in daily life and in industrial applications but they are also
crucial for the mechanical stability of cells or the transport of chemical and
biological agents in living organisms [1-3]. Despite the importance of these
systems, their microscopic structure is understood only on a rudimentary level,
thus in stark contrast to the case of gases and crystals [1,4]. Experimental
and theoretical investigations indicate that disordered systems have a
structural order on the length scale of a few particle diameters but which then
quickly vanishes at larger distances [5]. This conclusion is, however, based
mainly on the behavior of two-point correlation functions such as the static
structure factor or the radial distribution function [5.6]. Whether or not
disordered systems have an order that extents to larger length scales is
therefore a highly important question that is still open [7-10]. Here we use
computer simulations to show that liquids have an intricate structural order
given by alternating layers with icosahedral and dodecahedral symmetries and
which extends to surprisingly large distances. We show that the temperature
dependence of the corresponding length scale can be detected in the static
structure factor, making it directly accessible to scattering experiments.
These results, obtained by a novel type of four point correlation function that
probes directly the particle density in three dimensions, show that liquids are
far more ordered than envisaged so far but that this structural information is
encoded in non-standard correlation functions.

efficient stimulation method at the low amplitude ultra-high frequency signal.
In this method, we have tried to reduce the adaptation of the nerve system by
modulating the stimulation signal via a low frequency rectangular random wave.
By this method, we could reach the ""almost zero discharge"" with minimum
destructive effect in the experimental test on the fish nervous system.

the mean and variance of convolution of independent and identically distributed

recent years. To control a creature via a machine called cyborg method, three
stages are considerable: stimulation of neurons, neural response, and the
behavioral reaction of the subject. Our main concern was to know how electrical
stimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response.
Additionally, we were interested to explore which type of electrical
stimulation is optimal from different aspects such as maximum response with
minimum induction stimulus field, minimum damage of the tissue and the
electrode, reduction of the noxiousness of stimuli or pain in the living
creature. In this article, we proposed a new model for the induction of neural
activity led to locomotion responses through electrical stimulation.
Furthermore, based on this model, we developed a new approach of electrical
neural stimulation to provide a better locomotion control of living beings.
This approach was verified through the empirical data of fish cyborg. We
stimulated the fish brain by use of an ultra-high frequency signal which
careered by a random low frequency. According to our model, we could control
the locomotion of fish in a novel and innovative way. In this study, we
categorized the different cyborg methods based on the nervous system areas and
the stimulation signal properties to reach the better and optimal behavioral

entropy. Several rigorous results and phenomenological guiding principles have
been established, such as the no-faster-than-linear entanglement growth
generated by generic local Hamiltonians and the peculiar logarithmic growth for
many-body localized systems. However, little is known about the dynamical
behavior of the full entanglement spectrum, which is a refined character
closely related to the topological nature of the wave function. Here, we
establish a rigorous and universal result for the entanglement spectra of 1D
SPT systems evolving out of equilibrium. Our result is derived both for
free-fermion SPT systems and interacting ones. For free-fermion systems with AZ
symmetries, we prove that the single-particle entanglement gap after quenches
obeys essentially the same Lieb-Robinson bound as that on the equal-time
correlation, provided that there is no dynamical symmetry breaking. As a
notable byproduct, we obtain a new type of Lieb-Robinson velocity which is
related to the band dispersion with a complex wave number and reaches the
minimum as the maximal (relative) group velocity. Within the framework of
tensor networks, i.e., for SPT MPSs evolved by symmetric and trivial MPUs, we
also identify a Lieb-Robinson bound on the many-body entanglement gap for
general quenched interacting SPT systems. This result suggests high potential
of tensor-network approaches for exploring rigorous results on long-time
quantum dynamics. Influence of partial symmetry breaking, effects of disorder,
and the relaxation property in the long-time limit are also discussed. Our work
establishes a paradigm for exploring rigorous results of SPT systems out of

accuracy of results derived from HI spectral line stacking experiments. We
focus on the effects of spatial and spectral aperture sizes and redshift
uncertainties on co-added HI spectra, and by implication on the usefulness of
results from HI line spectral stacking experiments. Using large spatial
apertures to extract constituent galaxy spectra yields co-added spectra with
high levels of contamination and with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios.
These properties are also affected by the size of the spectral aperture as well
as HI redshift uncertainties of galaxies. When redshift uncertainties are high,
S/N decreases while the contamination level remains roughly constant. Using
small spectral apertures in the presence of large HI redshift uncertainties can
yield significant decreases in S/N without the expected decrease in amount of
contaminant flux. Our simulations show that a co-added spectrum rarely yields
an accurate measure of the total HI mass of a galaxy sample. Total mass is
generally over/under-estimated for large/small spatial apertures, regardless of
spectral aperture size. Our findings strongly suggest that any co-added HI
galaxy spectrum needs to be fully modelled in the ways presented in this paper
in order to apply accurate corrections for flux contamination and derive
realistic uncertainties in total HI galaxy mass. Failing to do so will result
in unreliable inferences of galaxy and cosmological parameters.

sensorial stimuli can be easily incorporated into people's dreams. The
objective of our project was to replicate this induction technique using
material less expensive and more portable. This material could simplify
experimental procedures. Participants could bring the material home, then have
a more ecological setting. First, we used the OpenBCI Cyton, a low-cost EEG
signal acquisition board in order to record and manually live-score sleep.
Then, we designed a mask containing two LEDs, connected to a microcontroller to
flash visual stimulation during sleep. We asked two volunteers to sleep for 2
hours in a dedicated room. One of the participants declared having a dream
during which the blue lights diffused by the mask were embedded into the dream
environment. The other participant woke up during the visual stimulation. These
results are congruent with previous studies. This work marked the first step of
a larger project. Our ongoing research includes the use of an online sleep

to the sleep stage. We will also investigate other types of stimulus induction
in the future such as vibro-tactile stimulation that showed great potentials.

analysis of complex data and significant computational load. In this work, we
use a shallow CapsNet architecture and compensates for the absence of a deeper

optical fiber sensors. Measurements are difficult due to the confinement of
light to the inner core of standard fibers. Over the last two years, new sensor
concepts have enabled the analysis of liquids outside the cladding boundary,
where light does not reach. Sensing is based on opto-mechanical, forward
stimulated Brillouin scattering interactions between guided light and sound
waves. In most previous works, however, the protective polymer coating of the
fiber had to be removed first. In this work, we report the opto-mechanical
analysis of liquids outside commercially available, standard single-mode fibers
with polyimide coating. The polyimide layer provides mechanical protection but
can also transmit acoustic waves from the fiber cladding towards outside media.
Comprehensive analysis of opto-mechanical coupling in coated fibers that are
immersed in liquid is provided. The model shows that forward stimulated
Brillouin scattering spectra in coated fibers are more complex than those of
bare fibers, and strongly depend on the exact coating diameter and the choice
of acoustic mode. Nevertheless, sensing outside coated fibers is demonstrated
experimentally. Integrated measurements over 100 meters of fiber clearly
distinguish between air, ethanol and water outside polyimide coating. Measured
spectra are in close quantitative agreement with the analytic predictions.
Further, distributed opto-mechanical time-domain reflectometry mapping of water
and ethanol outside coated fiber is reported, with a spatial resolution of 100
meters. The results represent a large step towards practical opto-mechanical
fiber sensors.

predicted to host various exotic electronic properties due to its unusual band
structure, i.e., Dirac cone intersected by a flat band (Dirac-flat bands).
Until now, although a few artificial Lieb lattices have been discovered in
experiments, the realization of a Lieb lattice in a real material is still
unachievable. In this article, based on tight-binding modeling and
first-principles calculations, we predict that the two covalent organic
frameworks (COFs), i.e., sp2C-COF and sp2N-COF, which have been synthesized in
the recent experiments, are actually the first two material realizations of
organic-ligand-based Lieb lattice. It is found that the lattice distortion can
govern the bandwidth of the Dirac-flat bands and in turn determine its
electronic instability against spontaneous spin-polarization during carrier
doping. The spin-orbit coupling effects could drive these Dirac-flat bands in a
distorted Lieb lattice presenting nontrivial topological properties, which
depend on the position of Fermi level. Interestingly, as the hole doping
concentration increases, the sp2C-COF can experience the phase transitions from
a paramagnetic state to a ferromagnetic one and then to a N\'eel
antiferromagnetic one. Our findings not only confirm the first material
realization of Lieb lattice in COFs, but also offer a possible way to achieve
tunable topology and magnetism in d- (f-) orbital-free organic lattices.

Most previous methods formulate face anti-spoofing as a supervised learning
problem to detect various predefined presentation attacks, which need large
scale training data to cover as many attacks as possible. However, the trained
model is easy to overfit several common attacks and is still vulnerable to
unseen attacks. To overcome this challenge, the detector should: 1) learn
discriminative features that can generalize to unseen spoofing types from
predefined presentation attacks; 2) quickly adapt to new spoofing types by
learning from both the predefined attacks and a few examples of the new
spoofing types. Therefore, we define face anti-spoofing as a zero- and few-shot
learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Inner-update Meta
Face Anti-Spoofing (AIM-FAS) method to tackle this problem through
meta-learning. Specifically, AIM-FAS trains a meta-learner focusing on the task
of detecting unseen spoofing types by learning from predefined living and
spoofing faces and a few examples of new attacks. To assess the proposed
approach, we propose several benchmarks for zero- and few-shot FAS. Experiments
show its superior performances on the presented benchmarks to existing methods

influenced by the heating torque, which was found to suppress inward migration
in protoplanetary disks with constant opacities.
  Aims. We investigate the differences of the heating torque between disks with
constant and temperature-dependent opacities.
  Methods. Interactions of a super-Earth-sized protoplanet with the gas disk
are explored using 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations.
  Results. Accretion heating of the protoplanet creates a hot underdense region
in the surrounding gas, leading to misalignment of the local density and
pressure gradients. As a result, the 3D gas flow is perturbed and some of the
streamlines form a retrograde spiral rising above the protoplanet. In the
constant-opacity disk, the perturbed flow reaches a steady state and the
underdense gas responsible for the heating torque remains distributed in
accordance with previous studies. If the opacity is non-uniform, however, the
differences in the disk structure can lead to more vigorous streamline
distortion and eventually to a flow instability. The underdense gas develops a
one-sided asymmetry which circulates around the protoplanet in a retrograde
fashion. The heating torque thus strongly oscillates in time and does not on
average counteract inward migration.
  Conclusions. The torque variations make the radial drift of the protoplanet
oscillatory, consisting of short intervals of alternating rapid inward and
outward migration. We speculate that transitions between the positive and
oscillatory heating torque may occur in specific disk regions susceptible to
vertical convection, resulting in the convergent migration of multiple
planetary embryos.

double electron occupation at local sites can be realized by either the
infinite Coulomb interaction or the correlated hopping interaction described by
the Hubbard operators, but they both render the conventional field theory
inapplicable. Relaxing such the constraint leads to a class of correlated
hopping models based on the deformed Hubbard operators which smoothly
interpolate the locally free and strong coupling limits by a tunable
interaction parameter $0\leq \lambda\leq 1$. Here we propose a coherent state
path integral approach appropriate to the deformed Hubbard operators for {\it
arbitrary} $\lambda$. It is shown that this model system exhibits the
correlated Fermi liquid behavior characterized by the enhanced Wilson ratio for
all $\lambda$. It is further found that in the presence of on-site Coulomb
interaction a finite Mott gap appears between the upper and lower Hubbard
bands, with the upper band spectral weight being heavily reduced by $\lambda$.
Our approach stands in general spatial dimensions and reveals an unexpected
interplay between the correlated hopping and the Coulomb repulsion.

ways: It is NP-complete to find an optimal solution and even NP-hard to find an
approximation with reasonable factors. In contrast, recent experiments suggest
that on many real-world networks the run time to solve VertexCover is way
smaller than even the best known FPT-approaches can explain. Similarly, greedy
algorithms deliver very good approximations to the optimal solution in
practice.
  We link these observations to two properties that are observed in many
real-world networks, namely a heterogeneous degree distribution and high
clustering. To formalize these properties and explain the observed behavior, we
analyze how a branch-and-reduce algorithm performs on hyperbolic random graphs,
which have become increasingly popular for modeling real-world networks. In
fact, we are able to show that the VertexCover problem on hyperbolic random
graphs can be solved in polynomial time, with high probability.
  The proof relies on interesting structural properties of hyperbolic random
graphs. Since these predictions of the model are interesting in their own
right, we conducted experiments on real-world networks showing that these
properties are also observed in practice. When utilizing the same structural
properties in an adaptive greedy algorithm, further experiments suggest that,
on real instances, this leads to better approximations than the standard greedy
approach within reasonable time.

presented. The wide area and deep radio and optical data of XXL-S have allowed
the construction of the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of the RL HERGs and
LERGs across a wide range in radio luminosity out to high redshift ($z = 1.3$).
The LERG RLFs display weak evolution: $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{0.67 \pm
0.17}$ in the pure density evolution (PDE) case and $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$
(1+$z$)$^{0.84 \pm 0.31}$ in the pure luminosity evolution (PLE) case. The RL
HERG RLFs demonstrate stronger evolution than the LERGs: $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$
(1+$z$)$^{1.81 \pm 0.15}$ for PDE and $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{3.19 \pm
0.29}$ for PLE. Converting $L_{\rm{1.4 GHz}}$ into kinetic luminosities, the
evolution of $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ was calculated for the RL HERGs and LERGs and
compared to the predictions from simulations. The prediction for the evolution
of radio mode feedback in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution model is
consistent with the $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ evolution for all XXL-S RL AGN,
indicating that RL AGN may be able to balance the radiative cooling of the hot
phase of the IGM. Simulations that predict the $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ evolution of
LERG equivalent populations show similar slopes to the XXL-S LERG evolution,
indicating that LERGs are well described by models of SMBHs that slowly accrete
hot gas. On the other hand, models of RL HERG equivalent populations differ in
their predictions. While LERGs dominate the kinetic luminosity output of RL AGN
at all redshifts, the evolution of the RL HERGs in XXL-S is weaker compared to
what other studies have found. This implies that radio mode feedback from RL
HERGs is more prominent at lower redshifts than was previously thought.

but their photoresponse scales sublinearly with the optical power. Here, we
present a study of single-nanowire photodetectors displaying a linear response
to ultraviolet illumination. Their structure consists of a GaN nanowire
incorporating an AlN/GaN/AlN heterostructure, which generates an internal
electric field. The activity of the heterostructure is confirmed by the
rectifying behavior of the current-voltage characteristics in the dark, as well
as by the asymmetry of the photoresponse in magnitude and linearity. Under
reverse bias (negative bias on the GaN cap segment), the detectors behave
linearly with the impinging optical power when the nanowire diameter is below a
certain threshold ($\approx$ 80 nm), which corresponds to the total depletion
of the nanowire stem due to the Fermi level pinning at the sidewalls. In the
case of nanowires that are only partially depleted, their nonlinearity is
explained by a nonlinear variation of the diameter of their central conducting
channel under illumination.

jet formation and heating in the solar atmosphere, and other astrophysical
systems. The atmospheric conditions in the solar chromosphere allow both
ionised and neutral particles to exist and interact. Under such conditions,
fine substructures exist within slow-mode shocks due to the decoupling and
recoupling of the plasma and neutral species. We study numerically the fine
substructure within slow-mode shocks in a partially ionised plasma, in
particular, analysing the formation of an intermediate transition within the
slow-mode shock. High-resolution 1D numerical simulations are performed using
the (P\underline{I}P) code using a two-fluid approach. We discover that
long-lived intermediate (Alfven) shocks can form within the slow-mode shock,
where there is a shock transition from above to below the Alfven speed and a
reversal of the magnetic field across the shock front. The collisional coupling
provides frictional heating to the neutral fluid, resulting in a
Sedov-Taylor-like expansion with overshoots in the neutral velocity and neutral
density. The increase in density results in a decrease of the Alfven speed and
with this the plasma inflow is accelerated to above the Alfven speed within the
finite width of the shock leading to the intermediate transition. This process
occurs for a wide range of physical parameters and an intermediate shock is
present for all investigated values of plasma-$\beta$, neutral fraction, and
magnetic angle. As time advances the magnitude of the magnetic field reversal
decreases since the neutral pressure cannot balance the Lorentz force. The
intermediate shock is long-lived enough to be considered a physical structure,
independent of the initial conditions.

implantation, and the energy of the incoming hydrogen ions as independent
variables. This global model is built step by step; an equilibrium between
atomic hydrogen within bulk tungsten and a molecular hydrogen gas phase is
first considered, and the calculated solubility is compared with experimental
results. Subsequently, a kinetic model is used to determine the chemical
potential for hydrogen in the sub-surface of tungsten. Combining both these
models, two regimes are established in which hydrogen is preferentially trapped
at either interstitial sites or in vacancies. We deduce from our model that the
existence of these two regimes is driven by the temperature of the implanted

interstitial regime, below is the vacancy regime in which super-saturated

for real-time processing of myelin water imaging (MWI). Methods: Three neural
networks, ANN-IMWF, ANN-IGMT2, and ANN-II, were developed to generate MWI.
ANN-IMWF and ANN-IGMT2 were designed to output myelin water fraction (MWF) and
geometric mean T2 (GMT2,IEW), respectively whereas ANN-II generates a T2
distribution. For the networks, gradient and spin echo data from 18 healthy
controls (HC) and 26 multiple sclerosis patients (MS) were utilized. Among
them, 10 HC and 12 MS had the same scan parameters and were used for training
(6 HC and 6 MS), validation (1 HC and 1 MS), and test sets (3 HC and 5 HC). The
remaining data had different scan parameters and were applied to exam the
effects of the scan parameters. The network results were compared with those of
conventional MWI in the white matter mask and regions of interest (ROI).
Results: The networks produced highly accurate results, showing averaged
normalized root-mean-squared error under 3% for MWF and 0.4% for GMT2,IEW in
the white matter mask of the test set. In the ROI analysis, the differences
between ANNs and conventional MWI were less than 0.1% in MWF and 0.1 ms in
GMT2,IEW (no statistical difference and R2 > 0.97). Datasets with different
scan parameters showed increased errors. The average processing time was 0.68
sec in ANNs, gaining 11,702 times acceleration in the computational speed
(conventional MWI: 7,958 sec). Conclusion: The proposed neural networks
demonstrate the feasibility of real-time processing for MWI with high accuracy.

66 countries from 1800 to 2014. Via the use of heatmap matrices we show that
several countries exhibit pairwise correlation, which means that banking crises
tend to occur in the same year. Clustering analysis suggests that developed
countries (for the most European ones) are highly similar in terms of the path
of events. An analysis of the events that followed the Great Depression and the
Great Recession shows that after the crisis of 2008, banking crises tend to
characterize countries tied by financial links whereas before 2008 contagion
seems to affect countries in the same geographical area. Clustering analysis
shows also that after financial liberalization, crises affected countries with
similar economic structures and growth. Further researches should enlighten the
origin of these linkages investigating how the process of contagion eventually

  Information Extraction",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.DB cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of open information extraction (OIE)
for extracting entity and relation level intermediate structures from sentences
in open-domain. We focus on four types of valuable intermediate structures
(Relation, Attribute, Description, and Concept), and propose a unified
knowledge expression form, SAOKE, to express them. We publicly release a data
set which contains more than forty thousand sentences and the corresponding
facts in the SAOKE format labeled by crowd-sourcing. To our knowledge, this is
the largest publicly available human labeled data set for open information
extraction tasks. Using this labeled SAOKE data set, we train an end-to-end
neural model using the sequenceto-sequence paradigm, called Logician, to
transform sentences into facts. For each sentence, different to existing
algorithms which generally focus on extracting each single fact without
concerning other possible facts, Logician performs a global optimization over
all possible involved facts, in which facts not only compete with each other to
attract the attention of words, but also cooperate to share words. An
experimental study on various types of open domain relation extraction tasks
reveals the consistent superiority of Logician to other states-of-the-art
algorithms. The experiments verify the reasonableness of SAOKE format, the
valuableness of SAOKE data set, the effectiveness of the proposed Logician
model, and the feasibility of the methodology to apply end-to-end learning
paradigm on supervised data sets for the challenging tasks of open information
extraction.

Essentially, a community is a group of vertices which are densely connected

efficiently find high-quality communities from big graphs is an important
research topic in the era of big data. Recently a large group of research

efficient solutions for searching high-quality communities from large networks
in real-time. Nevertheless, these works focus on different types of graphs and
formulate communities in different manners, and thus it is desirable to have a
comprehensive review of these works.
  In this survey, we conduct a thorough review of existing community search
works. Moreover, we analyze and compare the quality of communities under their

problems. However, studies into these topics have been limited. In this paper,
we focus on this kind of attacks whereby all the CAPTCHAs can be simply broken
because of its design purpose. After pursuing a comprehensive analysis of the
Typer phenomenon and the attacking mechanism of CAPTCHA, we present a new
CAPTCHA design principle to distinguish human (Typer) from human (user). The
core idea is that the challenge process of the CAPTCHA should contain the
unique information with a private attribute. The notion of our idea is based on
the information asymmetry between humans. Without this private information,
Typers will not be able to finish the attack even if they recognize all the
characters from the CAPTCHA.
  We formalize, design and implement two examples on our proposed principle, a
character-based, and a datagram-based case, according to a web interaction and
password handling program. We challenge the user to select the password from
the random characters that are not in the password sequence or to place the
randomly sorted sequences into the correct order. A novel generation algorithm
with a fuzzy matching method has been proposed to add the capability of human
error tolerance and the difficulty of random guess attack. Unlike other
solutions, our approach does not need to modify the primary authentication
protocol, user interface, and experience of the typical web service. The
several user studies' results indicate that our proposed method is both simple
(can be solved by humans accurately within less than 20 seconds) and efficient
(the Typer can only deploy a random guess attack with a very low success rate).

generalization (DG), where we need to build a classifier that is robust toward
domain shifts. However, previous domain-invariance-based methods overlooked the
underlying dependency of classes on domains, which is responsible for the
trade-off between classification accuracy and domain invariance. Because the
primary purpose of DG is to classify unseen domains rather than the invariance
itself, the improvement of the invariance can negatively affect DG performance
under this trade-off. To overcome the problem, this study first expands the
analysis of the trade-off by Xie et. al., and provides the notion of
accuracy-constrained domain invariance, which means the maximum domain
invariance within a range that does not interfere with accuracy. We then
propose a novel method adversarial feature learning with accuracy constraint
(AFLAC), which explicitly leads to that invariance on adversarial training.
Empirical validations show that the performance of AFLAC is superior to that of
domain-invariance-based methods on both synthetic and three real-world
datasets, supporting the importance of considering the dependency and the
efficacy of the proposed method.

length of convolutional filters is a key aspect when building a pre-trained

To achieve this, we incorporate filters of multiple lengths in all
convolutional layers of CTN to capture temporal features at multiple time
scales. We consider all 65 datasets with time series of lengths up to 512
points from the UCR TSC Benchmark for training and testing transferability of

equations are employed to capture the interface, and another LB equation is
used to solve the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations, where a new distribution
function for the total force is delicately designed to reduce the calculation
of the gradient term. The developed model is first validated by two classical
benchmark problems, including the tests of static droplets and the spreading of
a liquid lens, the simulation results show that the current LB model is
accurate and efficient for simulating incompressible $N$-phase fluid flows. To
further demonstrate the capability of the LB model, two numerical simulations,

  Access","10 pages, 10 figures, IEEE IoTJ (to be published)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, data-aided sensing as a cross-layer approach in
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications is studied, where multiple IoT nodes
collect measurements and transmit them to an Access Point (AP). It is assumed
that measurements have a sparse representation (due to spatial correlation) and
the notion of Compressive Sensing (CS) can be exploited for efficient data
collection. For data-aided sensing, a node selection criterion is proposed to
efficiently reconstruct a target signal through iterations with a small number
of measurements from selected nodes. Together with Compressive Random Access
(CRA) to collect measurements from nodes, compressive transmission request is
proposed to efficiently send a request signal to a group of selected nodes.
Error analysis on compressive transmission request is carried out and the
impact of errors on the performance of data-aided sensing is studied.
Simulation results show that data-aided sensing allows to reconstruct the
target information with a small number of active nodes and is robust to nodes'
decision errors on compressive transmission request.

three-body problems when solving the Faddeev equation for three-particle

the fact that the T-matrix elements themselves do not factor in the integral

complete Shallow water Equations called the Local Inertia Approximation (LInA),
which is obtained by neglecting the advection term in the momentum conservation
equation. In the present paper it is demonstrated that a shock is always
developed at moving wetting-drying frontiers, and this justifies the study of
the Riemann problem on even and uneven beds. In particular, the general exact
solution for the Riemann problem on horizontal frictionless bed is given,
together with the exact solution of the non-breaking wave propagating on
horizontal bed with friction, while some example solution is given for the
Riemann problem on discontinuous bed. From this analysis, it follows that
drying of the wet bed is forbidden in the LInA model, and that there are
initial conditions for which the Riemann problem has no solution on smoothly
varying bed. In addition, propagation of the flood on discontinuous sloping bed
is impossible if the bed drops height have the same order of magnitude of the
moving-frontier shock height. Finally, it is found that the conservation of the
mechanical energy is violated. It is evident that all these findings pose a
severe limit to the application of the model. The numerical analysis has proven
that LInA numerical models may produce numerical solutions, which are
unreliable because of mere algorithmic nature, also in the case that the LInA
mathematical solutions do not exist. The applicability limits of the LInA model
are discouragingly severe, even if the bed elevation varies continuously. More
important, the non-existence of the LInA solution in the case of discontinuous
topography and the non-existence of receding fronts radically question the
viability of the LInA model in realistic cases. It is evident that classic SWE
models should be preferred in the majority of the practical applications.

the diagrammatic expansion is performed only for one out of the two spin

anomalous, decorrelated behaviour relative to the far-UV continuum flux

for this campaign to infer a proxy for the all important, variable driving EUV
continuum incident upon BLR clouds. The inferred driving continuum provides a
crucial step towards the recovery of the broad emission line response functions
in this AGN. In particular, the ionising continuum seen by the BLR was weaker
and softer during the anomalous period than during the first third of the
campaign, and apparently less variable than exhibited by the far-UV continuum.
We also report the first evidence for anomalous behaviour in the longer
wavelength (relative to 1157A) continuum bands. This is corroborative evidence
that a significant contribution to the variable UV-optical continuum emission
arises from a diffuse continuum emanating from the same gas that emits the
broad emission lines.

Filter Semi-Qualitative (EnKF-SQ) is applied to a realistic coupled ice-ocean

The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness
measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect
to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or
assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ
are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness
threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential
appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties
prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice
data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables,
lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is
adjusted for best performance of the system at hand. The sensitivity tests
reveal that the results do not depend critically on the choice of this tuning

in terms of FPQ-trees. FPQ-trees are a variant of PQ-trees that includes
F-nodes in addition to P- and to Q-nodes. An F-node represents a permutation

whether $G$ admits a planar embedding such that, for each vertex $v$ of $G$,
the cyclic order of the edges incident to $v$ is described by at least one of
the FPQ-trees associated with~$v$. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter

Results: The availability of exome sequencing of two populations of
African-Americans and European-Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities study allowed us to investigate the effects of annotated
loss-of-function (LoF) mutations on 122 serum metabolites. To assess the
findings, we built metabolomic causal networks for each population separately
and utilized structural equation modeling. We then validated our findings with
a set of independent samples. By use of methods based on concepts of Mendelian
randomization of genetic variants, we showed that some of the affected
metabolites are risk predictors in the causal pathway of disease. For example,
LoF mutations in the gene KIAA1755 were identified to elevate the levels of
eicosapentaenoate (p-value=5E-14), an essential fatty acid clinically
identified to increase essential hypertension. We showed that this gene is in
the pathway to triglycerides, where both triglycerides and essential
hypertension are risk factors of metabolomic disorder and heart attack. We also
identified that the gene CLDN17, harboring loss-of-function mutations, had
pleiotropic actions on metabolites from amino acid and lipid pathways.
Conclusion: Using systems biology approaches for the analysis of metabolomics
and genetic data, we integrated several biological processes, which lead to
findings that may functionally connect genetic variants with complex diseases.

are autonomously selected by the vehicles. The former approach yields a
considerably higher resource utilization in case the network coverage is
uninterrupted. However, in case of intermittent or out-of-coverage, due to not
having input from centralized scheduler, vehicles need to revert to distributed
scheduling. Motivated by recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), we
investigate whether a centralized learning scheduler can be taught to
efficiently pre-assign the resources to vehicles for out-of-coverage V2V
communication. Specifically, we use the actor-critic RL algorithm to train the
centralized scheduler to provide non-interfering resources to vehicles before
they enter the out-of-coverage area. Our initial results show that a RL-based
scheduler can achieve performance as good as or better than the state-of-art

process completes within a reasonable time (ranging from a few hundred to a few

grounds, these two approaches attempt at going beyond the background field
method and treat black holes as fully quantum systems rather than considering
quantum field theory on the corresponding classical manifolds. They also lead
to the common prediction that the semiclassical description of black hole
evaporation should break down and the system be disrupted by internal quantum
pressure, but they both arrive at this conclusion neglecting the matter that
formed the black hole. We instead estimate this pressure from the bootstrapped
description of black holes, which allows us to express the total
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass in terms of the baryonic mass still present inside
the black hole. We conclude that, although these two scenarios provide
qualitatively similar predictions for the final stages, the corpuscular model
does not seem to suggest any sizeable deviation from the semiclassical time
scale at which the disruption should occur, unlike the black-to-white hole
bouncing scenario. This, in turn, makes the phenomenology of corpuscular black
holes more subtle from an astrophysical perspective.

the theory of singular numbers and majorisation in von Neumann algebras. As an
application of our result in the setting of $II_1$-factors, we show that the
entropy of the singular value distribution relative to the unique tracial state
is an entanglement monotone in the sense of Vidal, thus yielding a new way to
quantify entanglement in that context. Building on previous work in the
infinite-dimensional setting, we show that trace vectors play the role of
maximally entangled states for general $II_1$-factors. Examples are drawn from
infinite spin chains, quasi-free representations of the CAR, and discretised
versions of the CCR.

models, especially neural IR frameworks struggle with adequately capturing
infrequently observed words. While these terms are often removed from neural
models - mainly as a concession to efficiency demands - they traditionally play
an important role in the performance of IR models. In this paper, we analyze
the effects of low-frequency terms on the performance and robustness of neural
IR models. We conduct controlled experiments on three recent neural IR models,
trained on a large-scale passage retrieval collection. We evaluate the neural
IR models with various vocabulary sizes for their respective word embeddings,
considering different levels of constraints on the available GPU memory. We
observe that despite the significant benefits of using larger vocabularies, the
performance gap between the vocabularies can be, to a great extent, mitigated
by extensive tuning of a related parameter: the number of documents to re-rank.
We further investigate the use of subword-token embedding models, and in
particular FastText, for neural IR models. Our experiments show that using
FastText brings slight improvements to the overall performance of the neural IR
models in comparison to models trained on the full vocabulary, while the
improvement becomes much more pronounced for queries containing low-frequency

to establish eclipse-time ephemerides and to obtain initial estimates for the
transit depth and width. Radial velocity measurements were simultaneously
fitted with follow-up photometry to find the best-fitting orbital solution.
This solution was combined with measurements of atmospheric parameters to
interpolate evolutionary models and estimate the mass of the primary star, and
the mass and radius of the M-dwarf companion. We assess how the best fitting
orbital solution changes if an alternative limb-darkening law is used and
quantify the systematic effects of unresolved companions. We also gauge how the
best-fitting evolutionary model changes if different values are used for the
mixing length parameter and helium enhancement. We report the mass and radius
of five M-dwarfs and find little evidence of inflation with respect to
evolutionary models. The primary stars in two systems are near the ``blue
hook'' stage of their post sequence evolution, resulting in two possible
solutions for mass and age. We find that choices in helium enhancement and
mixing-length parameter can introduce an additional 3-5\,\% uncertainty in
measured M-dwarf mass. Unresolved companions can introduce an additional 3-8\%
uncertainty in the radius of an M-dwarf, while the choice of limb-darkening law
can introduce up to an additional 2\% uncertainty.

suggests that, when performing transfer learning, the performance of CNN
architectures on ImageNet correlates strongly with their performance on target
tasks. We evaluate that claim for melanoma classification, over 9 CNNs
architectures, in 5 sets of splits created on the ISIC Challenge 2017 dataset,
and 3 repeated measures, resulting in 135 models. The correlations we found
were, to begin with, much smaller than those reported by existing art, and
disappeared altogether when we considered only the top-performing networks:
uncontrolled nuisances (i.e., splits and randomness) overcome any of the
analyzed factors. Whenever possible, the best approach for melanoma
classification is still to create ensembles of multiple models. We compared two
choices for selecting which models to ensemble: picking them at random (among a
pool of high-quality ones) vs. using the validation set to determine which ones
to pick first. For small ensembles, we found a slight advantage on the second
approach but found that random choice was also competitive. Although our aim in
this paper was not to maximize performance, we easily reached AUCs comparable

However, temporal sharing of hardware resources exposes the processor to
various microarchitecture state attacks. State-of-the-art secure processors,
such as MI6 adopt Intel's SGX enclave execution model. MI6 architects strong
isolation by statically isolating shared memory state, and purging the
microarchitecture state of private core, cache, and TLB resources on every
enclave entry and exit. The purging overhead significantly impacts performance
as the interactivity across the secure and insecure processes increases. This
paper proposes IRONHIDE that implements strong isolation in the context of
multicores to form spatially isolated secure and insecure clusters of cores.
For an interactive application comprising of secure and insecure processes,
IRONHIDE pins the secure process(es) to the secure cluster, where they execute
and interact with the insecure process(es) without incurring the
microarchitecture state purging overheads on every interaction event. IRONHIDE
improves performance by 2.1x over the MI6 baseline for a set of user and OS

in the detector is 28.69$\pm$2.09 muons per day with a modulation amplitude of
2.66$\pm$ 1.0\% and a phase at Jul 22 $\pm$ 36.2 days. This annual modulation
is correlated with the variation of the effective atmospheric temperature in
the stratosphere. The correlation coefficient, $\alpha_{T}$, is determined to
be $0.898 \pm 0.025$. This can be interpreted as a measurement of the
atmospheric charged kaon to pion ($K$/$\pi$) ratio of 0.094$^{+0.044}_{-0.061}$

(IFCs) extracted at 0 K. In this paper, we explore the roles of four-phonon
scatterings and the temperature dependent IFCs on phonon transport in graphene
through our PBTE calculations. We demonstrate that the strength of four-phonon
scatterings would be severely overestimated by using the IFCs extracted at 0 K
compared with those corresponding to a finite temperature, and four-phonon
scatterings are found to significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of
graphene even at room temperature. In order to reproduce the prediction from
molecular dynamics simulations, phonon frequency broadening has to be taken
into account when determining the phonon scattering rates. Our study elucidates
the phonon transport properties of graphene at finite temperatures, and could
be extended to other crystalline materials.

Depending on whether intermediate cues are used, the relevant literature can be
roughly divided into two broad categories: direct methods and two stage
pipelines. For the latter, intermediate cues, such as 3D object coordinates,
semantic keypoints, or virtual control points instead of pose parameters are
regressed by CNN in the first stage. Object pose can then be solved by
correspondence constraints constructed with these intermediate cues. In this
paper, we focus on the postprocessing of a two-stage pipeline and propose to
combine two learning concepts for estimating object pose under challenging
scenes: projection grouping on one side, and correspondence learning on the
other. We firstly employ a local patch based method to predict projection
heatmaps which denote the confidence distribution of projection of 3D bounding
box's corners. A projection grouping module is then proposed to remove
redundant local maxima from each layer of heatmaps. Instead of directly feeding
2D-3D correspondences to the perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm, multiple
correspondence hypotheses are sampled from local maxima and its corresponding
neighborhood and ranked by a correspondence-evaluation network. Finally,
correspondences with higher confidence are selected to determine object pose.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms several state of the art methods.

short-period, low-eccentricity binaries; (ii) wide binaries; and (iii)
short-period, high-eccentricity binaries. These sub-populations also exhibit
distinct spin period and spindown rate properties. We focus on sub-population
(iii), which contains the Hulse-Taylor binary. Contrary to previous analysis,
we demonstrate that, if they are the product of primordial binary evolution,
the $P_{\rm orb}$ and $e$ distribution of these systems requires that the
second-born NSs must have been formed with small natal kicks ($\lesssim$25 km
s$^{-1}$) and have pre-SN masses narrowly distributed around 3.2 M$_{\odot}$.
These constraints challenge binary evolution theory and further predict closely
aligned spin and orbital axes, inconsistent with the Hulse-Taylor binary's
measured spin-orbit misalignment angle of $\approx$20$^{\circ}$. Motivated by
the similarity of these DNSs to B2127+11C, a DNS residing in the globular
cluster M15, we argue that this sub-population is consistent with being formed
in, and then ejected from, globular clusters. This scenario provides a pathway
for the formation and merger of DNSs in stellar environments without recent
star formation, as observed in the host galaxy population of short gamma ray
bursts and the recent detection by LIGO of a merging DNS in an old stellar

simulation (LES). We, therefore, propose and validate a new subgrid-scale (SGS)
model for such flows. The proposed SGS model consists of a dissipative eddy
viscosity term as well as a nondissipative term that is nonlinear in the
rate-of-strain and rate-of-rotation tensors. The two corresponding model
coefficients are a function of the vortex stretching magnitude. Therefore, the
model is consistent with many physical and mathematical properties of the
Navier-Stokes equations and turbulent stresses, and is easy to implement. We
determine the two model constants using a nondynamic procedure that takes into
account the interaction between the model terms. Using detailed direct
numerical simulations (DNSs) and LESs of rotating decaying turbulence and
spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow, we reveal that the two model terms
respectively account for dissipation and backscatter of energy, and that the
nonlinear term improves predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy near
solid walls. We also show that the new SGS model provides good predictions of
rotating decaying turbulence and leads to outstanding predictions of
spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow over a large range of rotation rates for
both fine and coarse grid resolutions. Moreover, the new nonlinear model
performs as well as the dynamic Smagorinsky and scaled anisotropic
minimum-dissipation models in LESs of rotating decaying turbulence and
outperforms these models in LESs of spanwise-rotating plane-channel flow,
without requiring (dynamic) adaptation or near-wall damping of the model
constants.

formed in the central region of the scales whereas the high-velocity streaks
originated in the overlapping region between the scales. Thus, those flow

assume that friction, self-propulsion and uctuations occur relative to a

to non-inertial frames. First, analytical solutions are presented for the
overdamped case, both for linear swimmers and circle swimmers. For a frame
rotating with constant angular velocity (""carousel""), the resulting noise-free
trajectories in the static laboratory frame trochoids if these are circles in
the rotating frame. For systems governed by inertia, such as vibrated
granulates or active complex plasmas, centrifugal and Coriolis forces become
relevant. For both linear and circling self-propulsion, these forces lead to
out-spiraling trajectories which for long times approach a spira mirabilis.
This implies that a self-propelled particle will typically leave a rotating
carousel. A navigation strategy is proposed to avoid this expulsion, by
adjusting the self-propulsion direction at wish. For a particle, initially
quiescent in the rotating frame, it is shown that this strategy only works if
the initial distance to the rotation centre is smaller than a critical radius
Rc which scales with the self-propulsion velocity. Possible experiments to
verify the theoretical predictions are discussed.

necessarily be planar, $3$-connected and strongly self-dual. We study the
question of when these conditions are sufficient.
  If $G$ is any such a graph with isomorphism $\tau : G \to G^*$ (where $G^*$
is the unique dual graph), a metric mapping is a map $\eta : V(G) \to \mathbb
R^3$ such that the diameter of $\eta(G)$ is $1$ and for every pair of vertices
$(u,v)$ such that $u\in \tau(v)$ we have dist$(\eta(u),\eta(v)) = 1$. If $\eta$
is injective, it is called a metric embedding. Note that a metric embedding
gives rise to a Reuleaux Polyhedra.
  Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any planar,
$3$-connected, strongly self-dual graph has a metric mapping by proving that
the chromatic number of the diameter graph (whose vertices are $V(G)$ and whose
edges are pairs $(u,v)$ such that $u\in \tau(v)$) is at most $4$, which means
there exists a metric mapping to the tetrahedron. Furthermore, we use the
Lov\'asz neighborhood-complex theorem in algebraic topology to prove that the
chromatic number of the diameter graph is exactly $4$.
  Secondly, we develop algorithms that allow us to obtain every such graph with
up to $14$ vertices. Furthermore, we numerically construct metric embeddings
for every such graph. From the theorem and this computational evidence we
conjecture that every such graph is realizable as a Reuleaux polyhedron in
$\mathbb R^3$.
  In previous work the first and last authors described a method to construct a
constant-width body from a Reuleaux polyhedron. So in essence, we also
construct hundreds of new examples of constant-width bodies.
  This is related to a problem of V\'azsonyi, and also to a problem of

measure total magnetic flux densities from the Zeeman broadening of spectral
lines and filling factors. We detect strong kG magnetic fields in all our
targets. In 16 stars the magnetic fields were measured for the first time. Our
measurements are consistent with the magnetic field saturation in stars with
rotation periods P<4d. The analysis of the magnetic filling factors reveal two
different patterns of either very smooth distribution or a more patchy one,
which can be connected to the dynamo state of the stars and/or stellar mass.
Our measurements extend the list of M dwarfs with strong surface magnetic
fields. They also allow us to better constrain the interplay between the
magnetic energy, stellar rotation, and underlying dynamo action. The high

with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause
sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use
domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and
checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise,

economy as a good in its own right. In many settings, data aggregators cannot
directly verify the quality of the data they purchase, nor the effort exerted
by data sources when creating the data. Recent work has explored mechanisms to
ensure that the data sources share high quality data with a single data
aggregator, addressing the issue of moral hazard. Oftentimes, there is a
unique, socially efficient solution.
  In this paper, we consider data markets where there is more than one data
aggregator. Since data can be cheaply reproduced and transmitted once created,
data sources may share the same data with more than one aggregator, leading to
free-riding between data aggregators. This coupling can lead to non-uniqueness
of equilibria and social inefficiency. We examine a particular class of
mechanisms that have received study recently in the literature, and we
characterize all the generalized Nash equilibria of the resulting data market.
We show that, in contrast to the single-aggregator case, there is either
infinitely many generalized Nash equilibria or none. We also provide necessary
and sufficient conditions for all equilibria to be socially inefficient. In our
analysis, we identify the components of these mechanisms which give rise to
these undesirable outcomes, showing the need for research into mechanisms for
competitive settings with multiple data purchasers and sellers.

It
vanishes in scale invariant fluids, while a nonzero value quantifies the

given exactly by the correlation function of the contact density of local
pairs. As a consequence, scale invariance is broken purely by pair
fluctuations. These fluctuations give rise also to logarithmic terms in the
bulk viscosity of the high-temperature nondegenerate gas. For the quantum
degenerate regime I report numerical Luttinger-Ward results for the contact
correlator and the dynamical bulk viscosity throughout the BEC-BCS crossover.
The ratio of bulk to shear viscosity $\zeta/\eta$ is found to exceed the

distinct cell of the grid. The set of all $n$ nodes forms initially a connected
shape $A$. Entities are equipped with a linear-strength pushing mechanism that
can push a whole line of entities, from 1 to $n$, in parallel in a single
time-step. A target connected shape $B$ is also provided and the goal is to
\emph{transform} $A$ into $B$ via a sequence of line movements. Existing models
based on local movement of individual nodes, such as rotating or sliding a
single node, can be shown to be special cases of the present model, therefore
their (inefficient, $\Theta(n^2)$) \emph{universal transformations} carry over.
Our main goal is to investigate whether the parallelism inherent in this new
type of movement can be exploited for efficient, i.e., sub-quadratic
worst-case, transformations. As a first step towards this, we restrict
attention solely to centralised transformations and leave the distributed case
as a direction for future research. Our results are positive. By focusing on
the apparently hard instance of transforming a diagonal $A$ into a straight
line $B$, we first obtain transformations of time $O(n\sqrt{n})$ without and
with preserving the connectivity of the shape throughout the transformation.
Then, we further improve by providing two $O(n\log n)$-time transformations for
this problem. By building upon these ideas, we first manage to develop an
$O(n\sqrt{n})$-time universal transformation. Our main result is then an $ O(n
\log n) $-time universal transformation. We leave as an interesting open
problem a suspected $\Omega(n\log n)$-time lower bound.

the single ion $T_K$, but as the filling $n_c$ is reduced to zero, $T*$ also
vanishes. The coherence temperature $T*$ is shown to play a role of effective

nature as a cohomological field theory. The well-known Donaldson-Witten theory
is a twisted version of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM and can also be constructed using the
Atiyah-Jeffrey construction. This theory is concerned with the moduli space of
anti-self-dual gauge connections, with a deformation theory controlled by an
elliptic complex. More generally, supersymmetry requires considering
configurations that look like either instantons or anti-instantons around fixed
points, which we call flipping instantons. The flipping instantons of our 4D
${\cal N}=2$ theory are derived from the 5D contact instantons. The novelty is
that their deformation theory is controlled by a transversally elliptic
complex, which we demonstrate here. We repeat the Atiyah-Jeffrey construction
in the equivariant setting and arrive at the Lagrangian (an equivariant Euler
class in the relevant field space) that was also obtained from our previous
work arXiv:1812.06473. We show that the transversal ellipticity of the

can be trained to produce embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables
efficient similarity reasoning. Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching
Network model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity
score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph
attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
models on different domains including the challenging problem of
control-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important
role in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental
analysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in
the context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific
baseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.

benefiting from the increase of the LHC instantaneous luminosity of
$\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions to $\mathcal{L} = 6 \cdot 10^{27} cm^{-2}

and the position resolution. The major setup modification is the substitution
of the current ITS with seven layers of silicon pixel detectors. The ALPIDE
chip, a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS), was developed for this
purpose and offers a spatial resolution of 5 $\mu$m. The use of MAPS together
with a stringent mechanical design allows for the reduction of the material

weighted graphs, which are probed by means of discrete-time quantum walks.
Directly probing complete graphs using discrete-time quantum walks is
intractable due to the cost of simulating the quantum walk. We overcome this
problem by extracting a commute-time minimum spanning tree from the complete
weighted graph. The spanning tree is probed by a discrete time quantum walk
which is initialised using a weighted version of the Perron-Frobenius operator.
This naturally encapsulates the edge weight information for the spanning tree
extracted from the original graph. For each pair of complete weighted graphs to
be compared, we simulate a discrete-time quantum walk on each of the
corresponding commute time minimum spanning trees, and then compute the
associated density matrices for the quantum walks. The probability of the walk
visiting each edge of the spanning tree is given by the diagonal elements of
the density matrices. The similarity between each pair of graphs is then
computed using either a) the inner product or b) the negative exponential of
the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the probability distributions. We show
that in both cases the resulting similarity measure is positive definite and
therefore corresponds to a kernel on the graphs. We perform a series of
experiments on publicly available graph datasets from a variety of different
domains, together with time-varying financial networks extracted from data for
the New York Stock Exchange. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed similarity measures.

accomplished by the use of a convergence criterion related to the correlation

universe is the so-called consistency condition. According to the condition, in
the squeezed limit wherein the wavenumber of one of the three modes
(constituting the triangular configuration of wavevectors) is much smaller than
the other two, the three-point functions can be completely expressed in terms
of the two-point functions. It is found that, while the consistency condition
is mostly satisfied by the primordial perturbations generated in the
inflationary scenario, it is often violated in the bouncing models. The
validity of the consistency condition in the context of inflation can be
attributed to the fact that the amplitude of the scalar and tensor
perturbations freeze on super-Hubble scales. Whereas, in the bouncing
scenarios, the amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations often grow
rapidly as one approaches the bounce, leading to a violation of the condition.
In this work, with the help of a specific example involving the tensor
perturbations, we explicitly show that suitable non-minimal couplings can
restore the consistency condition even in the bouncing models. We briefly
discuss the implications of the result.

capitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named
federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT
algorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this
end, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes.
In FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific
messages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we
analyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum
slices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT
algorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the
Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we
investigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of
quorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two
metrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show
that the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine
how the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system,
we study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e.,
validators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP
if only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and
controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.

air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to be exploited as demand response (DR)
resources. Optimal DR of HVAC units is challenging, particularly for multi-zone
buildings, because this requires detailed physics-based models of zonal
temperature variations for HVAC system operation and building thermal
conditions. This paper proposes a new strategy for optimal DR of an HVAC system
in a multi-zone building, based on supervised learning (SL). Artificial neural
networks (ANNs) are trained with data obtained under normal building operating
conditions. The ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which are
explicitly integrated into an optimal scheduling problem for price-based DR.
The optimization problem is solved for various electricity prices and building
thermal conditions. The solutions are further used to train a deep neural
network (DNN) to directly determine the optimal DR schedule, referred to here
as supervised-learning-aided meta-prediction (SLAMP). Case studies are
performed using three different methods: explicit ANN replication (EAR), SLAMP,
and physics-based modeling. The case study results verify the effectiveness of
the proposed SL-based strategy, in terms of both practical applicability and
computational time, while also ensuring the thermal comfort of occupants and
cost-effective operation of the HVAC system.

  A comparison of $L^2$ and $H$(div) methods","24 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1002/fld.4763",,"physics.comp-ph math.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The accurate numerical simulation of turbulent incompressible flows is a
challenging topic in computational fluid dynamics. For discretisation methods
to be robust in the under-resolved regime, mass conservation as well as energy
stability are key ingredients to obtain robust and accurate discretisations.
Recently, two approaches have been proposed in the context of high-order
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations that address these aspects
differently. On the one hand, standard $L^2$-based DG discretisations enforce
mass conservation and energy stability weakly by the use of additional
stabilisation terms. On the other hand, pointwise divergence-free
$H(\operatorname{div})$-conforming approaches ensure exact mass conservation
and energy stability by the use of tailored finite element function spaces. The
present work raises the question whether and to which extent these two
approaches are equivalent when applied to under-resolved turbulent flows. This
comparative study highlights similarities and differences of these two
approaches. The numerical results emphasise that both discretisation strategies
are promising for under-resolved simulations of turbulent flows due to their
inherent dissipation mechanisms.

expected that these numerical simulations will significantly benefit from the
future Exascale computing infrastructures, that will perform 10^18 FLOP/s. The
performance of the SPH codes is, in general, adversely impacted by several
factors, such as multiple time-stepping, long-range interactions, and/or
boundary conditions. In this work an extensive study of three SPH
implementations SPHYNX, ChaNGa, and XXX is performed, to gain insights and to
expose any limitations and characteristics of the codes. These codes are the
starting point of an interdisciplinary co-design project, SPH-EXA, for the
development of an Exascale-ready SPH mini-app. We implemented a rotating square
patch as a joint test simulation for the three SPH codes and analyzed their
performance on a modern HPC system, Piz Daint. The performance profiling and
scalability analysis conducted on the three parent codes allowed to expose
their performance issues, such as load imbalance, both in MPI and OpenMP.
Two-level load balancing has been successfully applied to SPHYNX to overcome
its load imbalance. The performance analysis shapes and drives the design of
the SPH-EXA mini-app towards the use of efficient parallelization methods,
fault-tolerance mechanisms, and load balancing approaches.

deployment of Neural Networks for many applications. A promising approach to
address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model
to ultra low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel
solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the
network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there
is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute
force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for
mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a
similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when
quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare
Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these
problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization
precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ
provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers, based on
second-order information. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using
ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models.
Comparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better
accuracy with $8\times$ activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared
to DNAS~\cite{wu2018mixed}, and up to $1\%$ higher accuracy with up to $14\%$
smaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed
methods of RVQuant~\cite{park2018value} and HAQ~\cite{wang2018haq}.
Furthermore, we show that we can quantize SqueezeNext to just 1MB model size
while achieving above $68\%$ top1 accuracy on ImageNet.

paper, we propose a novel gated RNN structure, which contains only one gate.
Hidden states in the proposed grouped distributor unit (GDU) are partitioned
into groups. For each group, the proportion of memory to be overwritten in each
state transition is limited to a constant and is adaptively distributed to each
group member. In other word, every separate group has a fixed overall update
rate, yet all units are allowed to have different paces. Information is
therefore forced to be latched in a flexible way, which helps the model to
capture long-term dependencies in data. Besides having a simpler structure, GDU
is demonstrated experimentally to outperform LSTM and GRU on tasks including
both pathological problems and natural data set.
