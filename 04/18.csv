transport in star-forming clouds, thereby controlling circumstellar disc
formation and even binary star formation efficiency. The coupling between the
magnetic field and gas is determined by the ionization degree in the gas. Here,
we calculate the thermal and chemical evolution of the primordial gas by
solving chemical reaction network where all the reactions are reversed. We find
that at ~ 10^14-10^18 /cm^3, the ionization degree becomes 100-1000 times
higher than the previous results due to the lithium ionization by thermal
photons trapped in the cloud, which has been omitted so far. We construct the
minimal chemical network which can reproduce correctly the ionization degree as
well as the thermal evolution by extracting 36 reactions among 13 species.
Using the obtained ionization degree, we evaluate the magnetic field
diffusivity. We find that the field dissipation can be neglected for global
fields coherent over > a tenth of the cloud size as long as the field is not so
strong as to prohibit the collapse. With magnetic fields strong enough for
ambipolar diffusion heating to be significant, the magnetic pressure effects to
slow down the collapse and to reduce the compressional heating become more
important, and the temperature actually becomes lower than in the no-field
case.

models where choices are non-deterministic. Resolving non-deterministic choices
into deterministic choices (e.g., conditional statements) is necessary to
correctly characterise the relationship between choreographies and their
implementations with concrete programming languages. We introduce a notion of
realisability for choreographies - called whole-spectrum implementation - where
choices are still non-deterministic in choreographies, but are deterministic in
their implementations. Our notion of whole spectrum implementation rules out
deterministic implementations of roles that, no matter which context they are

of superradiant instabilities of axion bound states in neutron star
magnetospheres. The instability arises from the mixing of axion and photon
modes in the magnetic field of the neutron star which extract energy from the
rotating magnetosphere. Unlike for black holes, where the dissipation required
for superradiance is provided by an absorbative horizon, the non-hermitian
dynamics in this paper come from the resistivity in the stellar magnetosphere
arising from a finite bulk conductivity. The axion field mixes with photon
modes which superradiantly scatter off the magnetosphere, extracting rotational
energy which is then deposited back into the axion sector leading to an
instability. We derive the superradiant eigenfrequencies for the axion-photon
system using quantum mechanical perturbation theory on the axion boundstate,
drawing an analogy with atomic selection rules. We then compare the
characteristic time scale of the instability to the spin-down measurements of
pulsars which limit the allowed rate of angular momentum extraction from
neutron stars.

of the downstream roads, but vehicles on other lanes can enter one of several
downstream roads. Counterintuitively, these bifurcating lanes, rather than
relieving congestion (by acting as a versatile resource that can serve either
downstream road as the demand changes), often cause enormous congestion due to
lane changing. We develop an aggregate lane--changing model for this situation
that is expressive enough to model drivers' choices and the resultant
congestion, but simple enough to easily analyze. We use a game-theoretic
framework to model the aggregate lane choice behavior of selfish vehicles as a
Wardrop equilibrium (an aggregate type of Nash equilibrium). We then establish
the existence and uniqueness of this equilibrium. We explain how our model can
be easily calibrated using simulation data or real data, and we present results
showing that our model successfully predicts the aggregate behavior that
emerges from widely-used behavioral lane-changing models. Our model's
expressiveness, ease of calibration, and accuracy may make it a useful tool for
mitigating congestion at these complex diverges.

In one of the observation sessions, we observed enhancements with opposite

nonlinear stochastic dynamical system with continuous state space, continuous
action space and unknown dynamics. This class of problems are typically
addressed in stochastic adaptive control and reinforcement learning literature
using model-based and model-free approaches respectively. Both methods rely on
solving a dynamic programming problem, either directly or indirectly, for
finding the optimal closed loop control policy. The inherent `curse of
dimensionality' associated with dynamic programming method makes these
approaches also computationally difficult.
  This paper proposes a novel decoupled data-based control (D2C) algorithm that
addresses this problem using a decoupled, `open loop - closed loop', approach.
First, an open-loop deterministic trajectory optimization problem is solved
using a black-box simulation model of the dynamical system. Then, a closed loop
control is developed around this open loop trajectory by linearization of the
dynamics about this nominal trajectory. By virtue of linearization, a linear
quadratic regulator based algorithm can be used for this closed loop control.
We show that the performance of D2C algorithm is approximately optimal.
Moreover, simulation performance suggests significant reduction in training
time compared to other state of the art algorithms.

demonstrates, in substantial generality, that (1) the presence of a noisy

little to no effect on capacity. Finally, all of our positive (achievability)

completes each view separately, our novel network, multi-view completion net
(MVCN), leverages information from all views of a 3D shape to help the
completion of each single view. This enables MVCN to leverage more information
from different depth views to achieve high accuracy in single depth view
completion and keep the consistency among the completed depth images in
different views. Benefited by the multi-view representation and the novel

elements, skirting around the major sunspot (1), with two chains of magnetic

signals is most commonly performed using time-frequency (TF) masks. Typically,
the mask is estimated with a deep neural network (DNN), and element-wise
applied to the complex mixture short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
representation to perform the extraction. Ideal mask magnitudes are zero for
solely undesired signals in a TF bin and undefined for total destructive
interference. Usually, masks have an upper bound to provide well-defined DNN
outputs at the cost of limited extraction capabilities. We propose to estimate
with a DNN a complex TF filter for each mixture TF bin which maps an STFT area
in the respective mixture to the desired TF bin to address destructive
interference in mixture TF bins. The DNN is optimized by minimizing the error
between the extracted and the ground-truth desired signal allowing to learn the
TF filters without having to specify ground-truth TF filters. We compare our
approach with complex and real-valued TF masks by separating speech from a
variety of different sound and noise classes from the Google AudioSet corpus.
We also process the mixture STFT with notch-filters and zero whole time-frames,
to simulate packet-loss during transmission, to demonstrate the reconstruction
capabilities of our approach. The proposed method outperformed the baselines,

$S_A$. The method applies to subsystems defined by a subalgebra of observables
with a center. In the case of a trivial center, we reobtain the well-known
result for the average entropy and the formula for the variance. In the
presence of a nontrivial center, the Hilbert space does not have a tensor
product structure and the well-known formula does not apply. We present the
exact formula for the average entanglement entropy and its variance in the
presence of a center. We show that for large systems the variance is small,
$\Delta S_A/\langle{S_{A}}\rangle\ll 1$, and therefore the average entanglement
entropy is typical. We compare exact and numerical results for the probability
distribution and comment on the relation to previous results on concentration
of measure bounds. We discuss the application to physical systems where a

achieved some success in vision-based autonomous driving. The basic idea behind
behavioral cloning is to have the neural network learn from observing a human
expert's behavior. Typically, a convolutional neural network learns to predict
the steering commands from raw driver-view images by mimicking the behaviors of
human drivers. However, there are other cues, such as gaze behavior, available
from human drivers that have yet to be exploited. Previous researches have
shown that novice human learners can benefit from observing experts' gaze
patterns. We present here that deep neural networks can also profit from this.
We propose a method, gaze-modulated dropout, for integrating this gaze
information into a deep driving network implicitly rather than as an additional
input. Our experimental results demonstrate that gaze-modulated dropout
enhances the generalization capability of the network to unseen scenes.
Prediction error in steering commands is reduced by 23.5% compared to uniform
dropout. Running closed loop in the simulator, the gaze-modulated dropout net
increased the average distance travelled between infractions by 58.5%.
Consistent with these results, the gaze-modulated dropout net shows lower model
uncertainty.

  conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), 2019",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the dynamic nature of real-world graphs, there has been a growing
interest in the graph-streaming setting where a continuous stream of graph
updates is mixed with arbitrary graph queries. In principle, purely-functional
trees are an ideal choice for this setting due as they enable safe parallelism,
lightweight snapshots, and strict serializability for queries. However,
directly using them for graph processing would lead to significant space
overhead and poor cache locality.
  This paper presents C-trees, a compressed purely-functional search tree data
structure that significantly improves on the space usage and locality of
purely-functional trees. The key idea is to use a chunking technique over trees
in order to store multiple entries per tree-node. We design
theoretically-efficient and practical algorithms for performing batch updates
to C-trees, and also show that we can store massive dynamic real-world graphs
using only a few bytes per edge, thereby achieving space usage close to that of
the best static graph processing frameworks.
  To study the efficiency and applicability of our data structure, we designed
Aspen, a graph-streaming framework that extends the interface of Ligra with
operations for updating graphs. We show that Aspen is faster than two
state-of-the-art graph-streaming systems, Stinger and LLAMA, while requiring
less memory, and is competitive in performance with the state-of-the-art static
graph frameworks, Galois, GAP, and Ligra+. With Aspen, we are able to
efficiently process the largest publicly-available graph with over two hundred
billion edges in the graph-streaming setting using a single commodity multicore
server with 1TB of memory.

are given a starting vertex $s$ and need to detect whether there is a cut with
at most $k$ edges crossing the cut such that the side of the cut containing $s$
has at most $\Delta$ interior edges. If we are given query access to the input
graph, then this problem can in principle be solved in sublinear time without
reading the whole graph and with query complexity depending on $k$ and
$\Delta$. We design an elegant randomized procedure that solves a slack variant
of this problem with $O(k^2 \Delta)$ queries, improving in particular a
previous bound of $O((2(k+1))^{k+2} \Delta)$ by Chechik et al. [SODA 2017]. In
this slack variant, the procedure must successfully detect a component
containing $s$ with at most $k$ outgoing edges and $\Delta$ interior edges if
such a component exists, but the component it actually detects may have up to
$O(k \Delta)$ interior edges.
  Besides being of interest on its own, such cut-detection procedures have been
used in many algorithmic applications for higher-connectivity problems. Our new
cut-detection procedure therefore almost readily implies (1) a faster vertex
connectivity algorithm which in particular has nearly linear running time for
polylogarithmic value of the vertex connectivity, (2) a faster algorithm for
computing the maximal $k$-edge connected subgraphs, and (3) faster property
testing algorithms for higher edge and vertex connectivity, which resolves two

of 55 short descriptions of imaginary cities. Calvino has provided a
classification of these cities into eleven thematic groups, but literary
scholars disagree as to how trustworthy his categorization is. Due to the
unique structure of this novel, we can computationally weigh in on this debate:
we leverage pretrained contextualized representations to embed each city's
description and use unsupervised methods to cluster these embeddings.
Additionally, we compare results of our computational approach to similarity
judgments generated by human readers. Our work is a first step towards
incorporating natural language processing into literary criticism.

asked for explicit constructions. In this work, we give the first explicit

KL-extractors are stronger than both standard extractors and subgaussian

grains is central to the investigation of microscale processes that control and
record tectonic events. These distortions are generally combinations of lattice
rotations and elastic strains, but a lack of suitable observational techniques
has prevented these components being mapped simultaneously and routinely in
earth science laboratories. However, the technique of high-angular resolution
electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) provides the opportunity to
simultaneously map lattice rotations and elastic strains with exceptional
precision, on the order of 0.01 degree for rotations and 10-4 in strain, using
a scanning electron microscope. Importantly, these rotations and lattice
strains relate to densities of geometrically necessary dislocations and
residual stresses. Recent works have begun to apply and adapt HR-EBSD to
geological minerals, highlighting the potential of the technique to provide new
insights into the microphysics of rock deformation. Therefore, the purpose of
this overview is to provide a summary of the technique, to identify caveats and
targets for further development, and to suggest areas where it offers potential
for major advances. In particular, HREBSD is well suited to characterising the
roles of different dislocation types during crystal plastic deformation and to
mapping heterogeneous internal stress fields associated with specific
deformation mechanisms/microstructures or changes in temperature, confining
pressure, or applied deviatoric stress. These capabilities make HR-EBSD a
particularly powerful new technique for analysing the microstructures of
deformed geological materials.

terms of cost and time. It is desirable to find near-optimal solutions with
very few function evaluations. Surrogate-assisted optimizers tend to reduce the
required number of function evaluations by replacing the real function with an
efficient mathematical model built on few evaluated points. Problems with a
high condition number are a challenge for many surrogate-assisted optimizers
including SACOBRA. To address such problems we propose a new online whitening
operating in the black-box optimization paradigm. We show on a set of
high-conditioning functions that online whitening tackles SACOBRA's early
stagnation issue and reduces the optimization error by a factor between 10 to
1e12 as compared to the plain SACOBRA, though it imposes many extra function
evaluations. Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has for
very high numbers of function evaluations even lower errors, whereas SACOBRA
performs better in the expensive setting (less than 1e03 function evaluations).
If we count all parallelizable function evaluations (population evaluation in
CMA-ES, online whitening in our approach) as one iteration, then both
algorithms have comparable strength even on the long run. This holds for
problems with dimension D <= 20.

profiles in strong gravitational lenses with extended images, using fluxes in
addition to positional information. We start in this paper with a circular
power-law profile and show that the slope $\gamma$ is uniquely determined by
only two observables: the flux ratio $f_1/f_2$ and the image position ratio
$\theta_1/\theta_2$ of the two images. We derive an analytic expression
relating these two observables to the slope, a result which does not depend on
the Einstein angle or the structure or brightness of the source. We then find
an expression for the uncertainty on the slope $\sigma_\gamma$ that depends
only on the position ratio $\theta_1/\theta_2$ and the total S/N in the images.
For example, in a system with position ratio $\theta_1/\theta_2=0.5$, S/N
$=100$ and $\gamma=2$ we find that $\gamma$ is constrained to a precision of
$\pm0.03$. We then test these results against a series of mock observations. We
invert the images and fit an 11 parameter model, including ellipticity and
position angle for both lens and source and measure the uncertainty on
$\gamma$. We find agreement with the theoretical estimate for all mock
observations. In future papers we will examine the radial range of the galaxy
over which the constraint on the slope applies, and extend the analysis to
elliptical lenses.

cross checks, and by comparison to measurement and simulation results from
other calibration studies. Evaluating calibration data indicates a strongly
asymmetric shielding of the detector modules. A preliminary analysis suggests
that this cannot be accounted for by the shadow of cables, but can be explained
by hole ice with a suitable scattering length, size, and position relative to

in boson-affected hopping models, encountered in the study of polaron systems

the creation or absorption of bosonic excitations. We show that boson-affected
hopping models can provide a natural realization of fractons, either
approximately or exactly, depending on the details of the system. We first
consider a generic one-dimensional boson-affected hopping model, in which we
show that single particles move only at sixth order in perturbation theory,
while motion of bound states occurs at second order, allowing for a broad
parameter regime exhibiting approximate fracton phenomenology. We explicitly
map the model onto a fracton Hamiltonian featuring conservation of dipole
moment via integrating out the mediating bosons. We then consider a special
type of boson-affected hopping models with mutual hard-core repulsion between
particles and bosons, accessible in hole-doped mixed-dimensional Ising
antiferromagnets, in which the hole motion is one dimensional in an otherwise
two-dimensional antiferromagnetic background. We show that this system, which
is within the current reach of ultracold-atom experiments, exhibits perfect
fracton behavior to all orders in perturbation theory, thereby enabling the
experimental study of dipole-conserving field theories. We further discuss
diagnostic signatures of fractonic behavior in these systems. In studying these

conjecture (WGC), addressing the hierarchy problem by violating the
expectations of effective field theory. Building on earlier work by Cheung and
Remmen, we construct models in which a super-extremal particle satisfying the
electric WGC for a new Abelian gauge group obtains some of its mass from the
Higgs, setting an upper bound on the weak scale as other UV-insensitive
parameters are held fixed. Avoiding undue sensitivity of the weak scale to the
parameters entering the bound implies that the super-extremal particle must lie
at or below the weak scale. While the magnetic version of the conjecture
implies additional physics entering around the same scale, we demonstrate that
this need not correspond to a cutoff for the Higgs potential or otherwise
trivialize the bound. We stress that linking the WGC to the weak scale
necessarily involves new light particles coupled to the Higgs, implying a
variety of experimentally accessible signatures including invisible Higgs
decays and radiative corrections in the electroweak sector. These models also
give rise to natural dark matter candidates, providing additional paths to
discovery. In particular, collective effects in the dark matter plasma may
provide a telltale sign of the Abelian gauge group responsible for bounding the

simulated with a one-dimensional, Lagrangian, Newtonian hydrodynamic code. We
put an emphasis on accurately treating the equation of state and the nuclear

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of very thin (h/r~0.015-0.05) accretion discs
around rapidly spinning (a~0.9) black holes and tilted by 45-65 degrees. We
show that the inner regions of the discs with h/r<0.03 align with the black
hole equator, though out to smaller radii than predicted by analytic work. The
inner aligned and outer misaligned disc regions are separated by a sharp break
in tilt angle accompanied by a sharp drop in density. We find that
frame-dragging by the spinning black hole overpowers the disc viscosity, which
is self-consistently produced by magnetized turbulence, tearing the disc apart
and forming a rapidly precessing inner sub-disc surrounded by a slowly
precessing outer sub-disc. We find that the system produces a pair of
relativistic jets for all initial tilt values. At small distances the black
hole launched jets precess rapidly together with the inner sub-disc, whereas at
large distances they partially align with the outer sub-disc and precess more
slowly. If the tearing radius can be modeled accurately in future work,
emission model independent measurements of black hole spin based on

identifying the true origin of the GCE using non-Poissonian template fitting

discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter

that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed

the onset of rapid black-hole growth. The preferred dark-halo mass of
~$10^{12}M_\odot$ is translated to a characteristic epoch, z~2, at which the
typical forming halos have a comparable mass. We put together a coherent
picture based on existing and new simple analytic modeling and cosmological
simulations. We describe how the golden mass arises from two physical
mechanisms that suppress gas supply and star formation below and above the
golden mass, supernova feedback and virial shock heating of the circum-galactic
medium (CGM), respectively. Cosmological simulations reveal that these
mechanisms are responsible for a similar favored mass for the dramatic events
of gaseous compaction into compact star-forming ""blue nuggets"", caused by
mergers, counter-rotating streams or other mechanisms. This triggers inside-out
quenching of star formation, to be maintained by the hot CGM, leading to
today's passive early-type galaxies. The blue-nugget phase is responsible for
transitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and compositional properties,
e.g., from dark-matter to baryon central dominance and from prolate to oblate
shape. The growth of the central black hole is suppressed by supernova feedback
below the critical mass, and is free to grow once the halo is massive enough to
lock the supernova ejecta by its deep potential well and the hot CGM. A
compaction near the golden mass makes the black hole sink to the galactic
center and triggers a rapid black-hole growth. This ignites feedback by the
Active Galactic Nucleus that helps keeping the CGM hot and maintaining
long-term quenching.

long-time dynamics calls for the Lindblad master equations, in which the

the damping in a class of open quantum systems is algebraic under periodic

states. A great deal of progress has been made in the study of the relative
entropy between an excited state and the vacuum state of a conformal field
theory (CFT) reduced to a spherical region. For example, when the excited state
is a small perturbation of the vacuum state, the relative entropy is known to
have a universal expression for \textit{all} CFT's
\cite{Faulk-GR-entanglement}. Specifically, the perturbative relative entropy
can be written as the symplectic flux of a certain scalar field in an
\textit{auxiliary} AdS-Rindler spacetime \cite{Faulk-GR-entanglement}.
Moreover, if the CFT has a semi-classical holographic dual, the relative
entropy is known to be related to conserved charges in the bulk dual spacetime
\cite{lashkari2016gravitational}. In this paper, we introduce a one-parameter
generalization of the relative entropy which we call \textit{refined} R\'enyi

Interpretation of the observations in physical terms relies on careful modeling
of those properties. We have employed a multiphase approach to model the ISM
phases (HII region and photodissociation region) with the spectral synthesis
code Cloudy. Our goal is to characterize the physical conditions (gas
densities, radiation fields, etc.) in the ISM of the galaxies from the Herschel
Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We are particularly interested in correlations between
those physical conditions and metallicity or star-formation rate. Other key
issues we have addressed are the contribution of different ISM phases to the
total line emission, especially of the [CII]157um line, and the
characterization of the porosity of the ISM. We find that the lower-metallicity
galaxies of our sample tend to have higher ionization parameters and galaxies
with higher specific star-formation rates have higher gas densities. The [CII]
emission arises mainly from PDRs and the contribution from the ionized gas
phases is small, typically less than 30% of the observed emission. We also find
correlation - though with scatter - between metallicity and both the PDR
covering factor and the fraction of [CII] from the ionized gas. Overall, the
low metal abundances appear to be driving most of the changes in the ISM
structure and conditions of these galaxies, and not the high specific
star-formation rates. These results demonstrate in a quantitative way the
increase of ISM porosity at low metallicity. Such porosity may be typical of
galaxies in the young Universe.

poorly constrained, mainly by the small known population of Galactic binaries,
the properties of short gamma-ray burst host galaxies, and inferences from
$r$-process enrichment. In the new era of BNS merger detections through
gravitational waves (GW), a new route to the DTD is the demographics of the
host galaxies, localized through associated electromagnetic counterparts. This
approach takes advantage of the correlation between star formation history
(SFH) and galaxy mass, such that the convolution of the SFH and DTD impacts the
BNS merger rate as a function of galaxy mass. Here we quantify this approach
for a power law DTD governed by two parameters: the power law index ($\Gamma$)
and a minimum delay time ($t_{\rm min}$). Under the reasonable assumption that
EM counterparts are likely only detectable in the local universe, accessible by
the current generation of GW detectors, we study how many host galaxies at
$z\sim 0$ are required to constrain the DTD parameters. We find that the DTD is
mainly imprinted in the statistics of massive galaxies (stellar mass of
$M_*\gtrsim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$, comparable to the host galaxy of GW170817).
Taking account of relevant uncertainties we find that $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ host
galaxies are required to constrain the DTD; for a fixed value of $t_{\rm min}$,
as done in previous analyses of the DTD, $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ host galaxies will
suffice. Such a sample might become available within the next two decades,

further progress is difficult without knowing the masses of the central

line kinematics from millimeter interferometers (i.e., ALMA). Theoretical
investigations have predicted the protostellar mass function (PMF) for various
protostellar mass accretion models, and it is now imperative to observationally
constrain its functional form. While ALMA has enabled protostellar mass
measurements, samples approaching 100 sources are necessary to constrain the
functional form of the PMF, and upgrades to ALMA and/or a new mm/cm facility
will increase the feasibility of measuring such a large number of protostar
masses. The masses of protostars will enable their stellar structure (radius

understood. This is made more robust when effective temperatures and accretion
rates can be measured via ground/space-based near to mid-infrared spectroscopy.

inferior robustness comes from the error amplification effect, where the
quantization operation further enlarges the distance caused by amplified noise.
Then we propose a novel Defensive Quantization (DQ) method by controlling the
Lipschitz constant of the network during quantization, such that the magnitude
of the adversarial noise remains non-expansive during inference. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our new quantization
method can defend neural networks against adversarial examples, and even
achieves superior robustness than their full-precision counterparts while
maintaining the same hardware efficiency as vanilla quantization approaches. As
a by-product, DQ can also improve the accuracy of quantized models without

aquifers at low obliquities (< 25{\deg}). We developed a new technique using
the orientations of elliptical craters to constrain the true
late-Hesperian-onward obliquity PDF. To do so, we developed a forward model of
the effect of obliquity on elliptic crater orientations using ensembles of
simulated Mars impactors and ~3.5 Gyr-long Mars obliquity simulations. In our
model, the inclinations and speeds of Mars crossing objects bias the preferred
orientation of elliptic craters which are formed by low-angle impacts.
Comparison of our simulation predictions with a validated database of elliptic
crater orientations allowed us to invert for best-fitting obliquity history. We
found that since the onset of the late-Hesperian, Mars' mean obliquity was
likely low, between ~10{\deg} and ~30{\deg}, and the fraction of time spent at
high obliquities > 40{\deg} was likely < 20%.

adiabatic changes of the controlling parameters of a system. The shortcuts are
designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different
systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to quantum systems is
to manipulate them on timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus shortcuts
to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and
motional states in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics. Applications
range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog
paradigms to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for
the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and
perturbations or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a
widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to
optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and statistical physics.
Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in
particular, with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and
engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third law,
or determining process energy costs and efficiencies. Concepts, methods, and

operator theoretic perspective--and in particular--the effect of symmetry on

(constructed using independent Koopman eigenfunctions) such that its
observability is equivalent to the observability of the original nonlinear
system. Next, we derive an analytic relation between symmetry and nonlinear
observability; it is shown that symmetry in the nonlinear dynamics is reflected
in the symmetry of the corresponding Koopman eigenfunctions, as well as
presence of repeated Koopman eigenvalues. We then proceed to show that the loss
of observability in symmetric nonlinear systems can be traced back to the
presence of these repeated eigenvalues. In the case where we have a sufficient
number of measurements, the nonlinear system remains unobservable when these
functions have symmetries that mirror those of the dynamics. The proposed
observability framework provides insights into the minimum number of the
measurements needed to make an unobservable nonlinear system, observable. The
proposed results are then applied to a network of nano-electromechanical

the identification of small sets of initial spreaders in very large networks.
This setting makes the optimization problem computationally infeasible for
standard greedy optimization algorithms that account simultaneously for
information about network topology and spreading dynamics, leaving space only
to heuristic methods based on the drastic approximation of relying on the
geometry of the network alone. The literature on the subject is plenty of
purely topological methods for the identification of influential spreaders in

Here, we perform a systematic test of the performance of a multitude of
heuristic methods for the identification of influential spreaders. We quantify
the performance of the various methods on a corpus of 100 real-world networks;
the corpus consists of networks small enough for the application of greedy
optimization so that results from this algorithm are used as the baseline
needed for the analysis of the performance of the other methods on the same

adaptive degree or closeness centralities, are able to achieve performances
very close to the baseline value, thus providing good support for the use of

transport by comparing ODT results to available reference data for the bulk
Reynolds numbers $Re=20\,000$ and $40\,000$. Various pointwise statistical
quantities are computed and compared to the available reference data. We show
that these quantities can be captured well, or at least to a reasonable extent,
by the stand-alone model formulation and for fixed model parameters. Only the
root-mean-square velocity fluctuations remain systematically underestimated in
the ODT results (by an approximate factor of $1.5$). Afterwards, the turbulent
transport of a passive scalar is addressed for the Schmidt numbers $Sc=1$ and
$1250$. For the high Schmidt number and in contrast to the velocity
fluctuations, it is shown that the scalar fluctuation variance is up to ten
times larger in the ODT simulations resolving the Batchelor scale. The
fluctuation variance is notably smaller for the lower Schmidt number, but
exhibits better agreement with the references at a nominally higher Schmidt
number. We suggest that this is due to implicit filtering in the references,
which barely resolve the Kolmogorov scale. ODT turbulence spectra support this
interpretation since a Batchelor-like scalar turbulence spectrum is only
observed for the higher Schmidt number. With the aid of these spectra and the
fluctuation statistics we conclude that implicit filtering has a similar effect

segmentation network training benefits from the registration, which essentially
provides a realistic form of data augmentation. Experiments on knee and brain

investigated by detecting hyperbolic and elliptic Lagrangian coherent

forward/backward finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE). The Lagrangian centre of
a supergranular cell is given by the local maximum of the forward FTLE; the
Lagrangian boundaries of supergranular cells are given by the ridges of the

Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation, and false vortices are filtered by
applying a criterion given by the displacement vector. The Lagrangian centres
of neighboring supergranular cells are interconnected by ridges of the
repelling LCS, which provide the transport barriers that allow the formation of
vortices and the concentration of strong magnetic fields in the valleys of the
repelling LCS. The repelling LCS also reveal the most likely sites for magnetic

and b) they disregard decision making processes. The contribution of this work
is to propose a modeling framework, in which, human pilot reactions are modeled
using reinforcement learning and a game theoretical concept called level-k
reasoning to fill this gap. The level-k reasoning concept is based on the
assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. Reinforcement
learning is a mathematical learning method that is rooted in human learning. In
this work, a classical and an approximate reinforcement learning (Neural Fitted

chains are often employed as agents to reduce drag. These are polymers which
are floating in the solvent and attach (either by adsorption or through
irreversible chemical binding) at one of their chain ends to the substrate
(wall). We propose a PDE model to study this setup in the simple setting where
the solvent is a viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid occupying the bulk
of a smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, and the wall-grafted polymer
is in the so-called mushroom regime (inter-polymer spacing on the order of the
typical polymer length). The microscopic description of the polymer enters into
the macroscopic description of the fluid motion through a dynamical boundary
condition on the wall-tangential stress of the fluid, something akin to (but
distinct from) a history-dependent slip-length. We establish global
well-posedness of strong solutions in two-spatial dimensions and prove that the
inviscid limit to the strong Euler solution holds with a rate. Moreover, the

$\langle \varepsilon\rangle$ vanish inversely proportional to the Reynolds
number $Re$. This scaling corresponds to Poiseuille's law for the friction

only target microphones in a particular direction. We overcome this limitation
by building a circular transducer array as a wearable bracelet. It emits
ultrasonic signals simultaneously from many directions, targeting surrounding

  ICUs",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the
top challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are
often caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or
different sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals
from different monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of
high-level features based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order
to effectively capture the characteristics of different arrhythmia in
electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and differentiate them from irregularity in
signals due to different sources of signal disturbances. This unsupervised
feature learning technique, first extracts a set of low-level features from all
existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters these segments for each
individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level features. The
objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification method to
differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and
abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of
distortions in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted
from abnormal portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm. The
performance of this method is evaluated using the 2015 PhysioNet/Computing in
Cardiology Challenge dataset for reducing false arrhythmia alarms in the ICUs.
As confirmed by the experimental results, the proposed method offers a
considerable performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of
alarm detection only using a few high-level features that are extracted from
one single lead ECG signal.

imply that the photosphere emission indeed contributes to the prompt emission
of many GRBs. But whether the observed spectra empirically fitted by the Band
function or cutoff power law, especially the spectral and peak energy ($E_{p}$)
evolutions can be explained by the photosphere emission model alone needs
further discussion. In this work, we investigate in detail the time-resolved
spectra and $E_{p}$ evolutions of photospheric emission from a structured jet,
with an inner-constant and outer-decreasing angular Lorentz factor profile.
Also, a continuous wind with a time-dependent wind luminosity has been
considered. We show that the photosphere spectrum near the peak luminosity is
similar to the cutoff power-law spectrum. The spectrum can have the observed
average low-energy spectral index $\alpha $ $ \sim -1$, and the distribution of
the low-energy spectral index in our photosphere model is similar to that
observed ($-2\lesssim $ $\alpha \lesssim 0$). Furthermore, the two kinds of
spectral evolutions during the decay phase, separated by the width of the core
($\theta _{c}$), are consistent with the time-resolved spectral analysis
results of several Fermi multi-pulse GRBs and single-pulse GRBs, respectively.
Also, for this photosphere model we can reproduce the two kinds of observed
$E_{p}$ evolution patterns rather well. Thus, by considering the photospheric
emission from a structured jet, we reproduce the observations well for the GRBs
best fitted by the cutoff power-law model for the peak-flux spectrum or the
time-integrated spectrum.

a novel data-driven Bayesian algorithm to constructing Plausibility sets for

computes policies with tighter optimistic estimates for exploration by
introducing two new ideas. First, it is based on Bayesian posterior
distributions rather than distribution-free bounds. Second, OFVF does not
construct plausibility sets as simple confidence intervals. Confidence
intervals as plausibility sets are a sufficient but not a necessary condition.
OFVF uses the structure of the value function to optimize the location and
shape of the plausibility set to guarantee upper bounds directly without
necessarily enforcing the requirement for the set to be a confidence interval.
OFVF proceeds in an episodic manner, where the duration of the episode is fixed

this effect is general, common to both absorption and transparency resonances,

enhancement of transitions for different low-lying orbitals in rubidium atoms

calculations predict a dramatic enhancement of up to 20-fold increase in
absorption, even in the presence of large homogeneous broadening. More general

\emph{stable point separation}. In its simplest form, stable point separation
implies that if $f$ is ""far away"" from $0$, and one is given a random sample
$(f(Z_i))_{i=1}^m$ where a proportional number of the sample points may be
corrupted by noise, that information is still enough to exhibit that $f$ is far
from $0$.
  Stable point separation is well understood in the context of iid sampling,
and to explore it for general sampling methods we introduce a new notion---the
\emph{coordinate small-ball} of a random vector $X$. Roughly put, this feature
captures the number of ""relatively large coordinates"" of
$(|<TX,u_i>|)_{i=1}^m$, where $T:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is an arbitrary
linear operator and $(u_i)_{i=1}^m$ is any fixed orthonormal basis of
$\mathbb{R}^m$.
  We show that under the bare-minimum assumptions on $X$, and with high
probability, many of the values $|<TX,u_i>|$ are at least of the order
$\|T\|_{S_2}/\sqrt{m}$. As a result, the ""coordinate structure"" of $TX$
exhibits the typical Euclidean norm of $TX$ and does so in a stable way.
  One outcome of our analysis is that random sub-sampled convolutions satisfy
stable point separation under minimal assumptions on the generating random
vector---a fact that was known previously only in a highly restrictive setup,
namely, for random vectors with iid subgaussian coordinates.

incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called metamodel,

examples $(a_1,b_1), (a_2,b_2)\ldots,$ with $a_i$ drawn independently from a
$d$-dimensional isotropic Gaussian, and where $b_i = \langle a_i, x\rangle +
\eta_i,$ for a fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with $\|x\|_2 = 1$ and with
independent noise $\eta_i$ drawn uniformly from the interval
$[-2^{-d/5},2^{-d/5}].$ We show that any algorithm with at most $d^2/4$ bits of
memory requires at least $\Omega(d \log \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ samples to
approximate $x$ to $\ell_2$ error $\epsilon$ with probability of success at
least $2/3$, for $\epsilon$ sufficiently small as a function of $d$. In
contrast, for such $\epsilon$, $x$ can be recovered to error $\epsilon$ with
probability $1-o(1)$ with memory $O\left(d^2 \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ using $d$
examples. This represents the first nontrivial lower bounds for regression with
super-linear memory, and may open the door for strong memory/sample tradeoffs
for continuous optimization.

thickness, have shown promise to scale down transistors for modern integrated
circuitry. However, the electrical contacts that connect these materials with
external bulky metals are usually unsatisfactory, which limits the transistor
performance. Recently, contacting 2D semiconductors using coplanar 2D
conductors has shown promise in reducing the problematic high resistance
contacts. However, many of these methods are not ideal for scaled production.
Here, we report on the large-scale, spatially controlled chemical assembly of
the integrated 2H-MoTe2 field-effect transistors (FETs) with coplanar metallic
1T' MoTe2 contacts via phase engineered approaches. We demonstrate that the
heterophase FETs exhibit ohmic contact behavior with low contact resistance,
resulting from the coplanar seamless contact between 2H and 1T' MoTe2 confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy characterizations. The average mobility of
the heterophase FETs was measured to be as high as 23 cm2 V-1 s-1 (comparable
with those of exfoliated single crystals), due to the large 2H MoTe2
single-crystalline domain (486{\mu}m). By developing a patterned growth method,
we realize the 1T' MoTe2 gated heterophase FET array whose components of
channel, gate, and contacts are all 2D materials. Finally, we transfer the
heterophase device array onto a flexible substrate and demonstrate the
near-infrared photoresponse with high photoresponsivity (~1.02 A/W). Our study
provides a basis for the large-scale application of phase-engineered coplanar
MoTe2 semiconductors-meter structure in advanced electronics and

demonstrated that a correction term to various deterministic numerical schemes,

spatially varying advection velocities to show that, for the same time step
sizes, the introduction of the generalized It\^o correction helps to
substantially reduce time integration error and significantly improve the

the structure of real-world networks. It seeks to identify natural divisions
that may exist in the input networks that partition the vertices into coherent
modules (or communities). While this problem space is rich with efficient
algorithms and software, most of this literature caters to the static use-case
where the underlying network does not change. However, many emerging real-world
use-cases give rise to a need to incorporate dynamic graphs as inputs.
  In this paper, we present a fast and efficient incremental approach toward
dynamic community detection. The key contribution is a generic technique called
$\Delta-screening$, which examines the most recent batch of changes made to an
input graph and selects a subset of vertices to reevaluate for potential
community (re)assignment. This technique can be incorporated into any of the
community detection methods that use modularity as its objective function for
clustering. For demonstration purposes, we incorporated the technique into two
well-known community detection tools. Our experiments demonstrate that our new
incremental approach is able to generate performance speedups without
compromising on the output quality (despite its heuristic nature). For
instance, on a real-world network with 63M temporal edges (over 12 time steps),
our approach was able to complete in 1056 seconds, yielding a 3x speedup over a
baseline implementation. In addition to demonstrating the performance benefits,
we also show how to use our approach to delineate appropriate intervals of
temporal resolutions at which to analyze an input network.

Numerous efforts either try to patch weaknesses in trained models, or try to

In our work, we explore a new ""honeypot"" approach to protect DNN models. We
intentionally inject trapdoors, honeypot weaknesses in the classification
manifold that attract attackers searching for adversarial examples. Attackers'
optimization algorithms gravitate towards trapdoors, leading them to produce
attacks similar to trapdoors in the feature space. Our defense then identifies
attacks by comparing neuron activation signatures of inputs to those of
trapdoors. In this paper, we introduce trapdoors and describe an implementation
of a trapdoor-enabled defense. First, we analytically prove that trapdoors
shape the computation of adversarial attacks so that attack inputs will have
feature representations very similar to those of trapdoors. Second, we
experimentally show that trapdoor-protected models can detect, with high
accuracy, adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art attacks (PGD,
optimization-based CW, Elastic Net, BPDA), with negligible impact on normal
classification. These results generalize across classification domains,
including image, facial, and traffic-sign recognition. We also present
significant results measuring trapdoors' robustness against customized adaptive

induce high levels of nuclear spin polarization in surrounding solids or fluids

Here, we theoretically study the spin dynamics of interacting nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) and substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond to show that outside
protons spin-polarize efficiently upon a magnetic field sweep across the NV-P1
level anti-crossing. The process can be interpreted in terms of an NV-P1 spin
ratchet, whose handedness - and hence the sign of the resulting nuclear
polarization - depends on the relative timing of the optical excitation pulse.
Further, we find that the polarization transfer mechanism is robust to NV
misalignment relative to the external magnetic field, and efficient over a
broad range of electron-electron and electron-nuclear spin couplings, even if
proxy spins feature short coherence or spin-lattice relaxation times.
Therefore, these results pave the route towards the dynamic nuclear

OVI absorbers from the ""Multiphase Galaxy Halos"" Survey as a function of halo
mass, redshift, inclination, and azimuthal angle. The galaxies are isolated at
$0.12<z_{\rm gal}<0.66$ and are probed by a background quasar within $D\approx
200$ kpc. Each absorber-galaxy pair has Hubble Space Telescope images and COS
quasar spectra, and most galaxy redshifts have been accurately measured from
Keck/ESI spectra. Using the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function
(TPCF) method, we find that OVI absorber kinematics have a strong halo mass
dependence. Absorbers hosted by $\sim L^{\ast}$ galaxies have the largest
velocity dispersions, which we interpret to be that the halo virial temperature
closely matches the temperature at which the collisionally ionized OVI fraction
peaks. Lower mass galaxies and group environments have smaller velocity
dispersions. Total column densities follow the same behavior, consistent with
theoretical findings. After normalizing out the observed mass dependence, we
studied absorber-galaxy kinematics with a modified TPCF and found
non-virialized motions due to outflowing gas. Edge-on minor axis gas has large
optical depths concentrated near the galaxy systemic velocity as expected for
bipolar outflows, while face-on minor axis gas has a smoothly decreasing
optical depth distribution out to large normalized absorber-galaxy velocities,
suggestive of decelerating outflowing gas. Accreting gas signatures are not
observed due to ""kinematic blurring"" in which multiple line-of-sight structures
are observed. These results indicate that galaxy mass dominates OVI properties
over baryon cycle processes.

using the Wigner representation. In the standard instanton formalism, one
usually approximates the initial false vacuum state by an eigenstate of the
field operator, imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions on the initial field

physical interpretation. However, an alternative approach does have a physical
interpretation: in quantum field theory, tunneling can happen via classical
dynamics, seeded by initial quantum fluctuations in both the field and its
momentum conjugate, which was recently implemented in Ref. [1]. We show that
the Wigner representation is a useful framework to calculate and understand the
relationship between these two approaches. We find there are two, related,
saddle point approximations for the path integral of the tunneling process: one
corresponds to the instanton solution in imaginary time and the other one
corresponds to classical dynamics from initial quantum fluctuations in real
time. The classical approximation for the dynamics of the latter process is
justified only in a system with many degrees of freedom, as can appear in field
theory due to high occupancy of nucleated bubbles, while it is not justified in
single particle quantum mechanics, as we explain. We mention possible
applications of the real time formalism, including tunneling when the instanton
vanishes, or when the imaginary time contour deformation is not possible, which

user in real-world web services, is crucial for personalization and
recommendations. However, traditional user stitching approaches, such as
grouping or blocking, require quadratic pairwise comparisons between a massive

challenges. Recent works, which are often application-specific, heuristically
seek to reduce the amount of comparisons, but they suffer from low precision

feature-based temporal walks to encapsulate short- and long-term interactions
between nodes in heterogeneous web networks, and adopts SimHash to obtain
compact, binary representations and avoid the quadratic complexity for
similarity search. Extensive experiments on large-scale real networks show that
node2bits outperforms traditional techniques and existing works that generate

for haze images and regularized optimization. Specifically, we convert the
non-convex, bilinear problem concerning the unknown haze-free image and light
transmission distribution to a convex, linear optimization problem by
estimating the atmosphere light constant. Our method is further accelerated by
introducing a multilevel Haar wavelet transform. The optimization, instead, is
applied to the low frequency sub-band decomposition of the original image. This
dimension reduction significantly improves the processing speed of our method
and exhibits the potential for real-time applications. Experimental results

particles. In this paper, we investigate the energy-diffusion efficiency of
relativistic particles in a temporally evolving wave ensemble that consists of
a single mode (Alfv\'en, fast or slow) of linear magnetohydrodynamic waves. In
addition to the gyroresonance with waves, the transit-time damping (TTD) also
contributes to the energy-diffusion for fast and slow-mode waves. While the
resonance condition with the TTD has been considered to be fulfilled by a very
small fraction of particles, our simulations show that a significant fraction
of particles are in the TTD resonance owing to the resonance broadening by the
mirror force, which non-resonantly diffuses the pitch angle of particles. When
the cutoff scale in the turbulence spectrum is smaller than the Larmor radius
of a particle, the gyroresonance is the main acceleration mechanism for all the
three wave modes. For the fast-mode, the coexistence of the gyroresonance and
TTD resonance leads to anomalous energy-diffusion. For a particle with its
Larmor radius smaller than the cutoff scale, the gyroresonance is negligible,
and the TTD becomes the dominant mechanism to diffuse its energy. The
energy-diffusion by the TTD-only resonance with fast-mode waves agrees with the
hard-sphere-like acceleration suggested in some high-energy astronomical

contribution to the average macroscopic spatial curvature of the Universe. In
order to cancel this contribution to match the observation, the usually defined
effective cosmological constant $\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}=\lambda_B+8\pi

sourced by this large negative $\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ would be similar to the
cyclic model of the universe in the sense that at small scales every point in
space is a ""micro-cyclic universe"" which is following an eternal series of
oscillations between expansions and contractions. Moreover, if the bare
cosmological constant $\lambda_B$ is dominant, the size of each
""micro-universe"" would increase a tiny bit at a slowly accelerating rate during
each micro-cycle of the oscillation due to the weak parametric resonance effect
produced by the fluctuations of the quantum vacuum stress energy tensor. In
this way, the large cosmological constant generated at small scales is hidden
at observable scale and no fine-tuning of $\lambda_B$ to the accuracy of
$10^{-122}$ is needed. This at least resolves the old cosmological constant

two-particle angular correlations in $p$-Pb collisions at
$\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02}$ TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at
$\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 2.76}$ TeV. For $p$-Pb collisions, a near side
depression in the angular correlation is observed for low $p_T$ proton pairs
and $\Lambda$ pairs but not for pion pairs or kaon pairs, similar to our
earlier finding for $pp$ collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s}= 7}$ TeV. This is also
the case for very low multiplicity Pb-Pb and Au-Au collisions. We also find
that parton interactions and the improved quark coalescence are mainly
responsible for the depression feature in baryon pair angular correlations.
However, no such baryon-baryon anti-correlations are observed in Pb-Pb and
Au-Au collisions at higher multiplicities. Therefore our results suggest that
low $p_T$ baryon-baryon angular anti-correlations have a strong multiplicity
dependence.

characteristics, and operations need to coordinate decision-making between
nodes across a network. We introduce the RuleSet-based communication protocol
for supporting quantum operations over distant nodes to minimize classical
packet transmissions for guaranteeing synchronicity. RuleSets are distributed
to nodes along a path at connection set up time, and hold lists of operations
that need to be performed in real time. We simulate the RuleSet-based quantum
link bootstrapping protocol, which consists of recurrent purifications and
link-level tomography, to quantify the quantum link fidelity and its
throughput. Our Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo simulation includes various error
sources, such as the memory error, gate error and channel error, modeled on
currently available hardware. We found that when two quantum nodes, each with
100 memory qubits capable of emitting photons ideally to the optical fiber, are
physically connected with a 10km MeetInTheMiddle link, the Recurrent Single
selection - Single error purification (RSs-Sp) protocol is capable of bringing
up the fidelity from an average input $F_{r}=0.675$ to around $F_{r}=0.865$
with a generation rate of 1106 Bell pairs per second, as determined by
simulated tomography. The system gets noisier with longer channels, in which
case errors may develop faster than the purification gain. In such a situation,
a stronger purification method, such as the double selection-based
purification, shows an advantage for improving the fidelity. The knowledge
acquired from bootstrapping can later be distributed to nodes within the same
network, and used for other purposes such as route selection.

various sources supported a logical and important classification of generic
turbulent boundary layers (TBL), namely Type-A, -B and -C TBL, based on
distribution patterns of time-averaged wall-shear stress. Among these types,
Type-A TBL and its related law, as represented by the DNS data of turbulence on
a zero-pressure-gradient semi-infinite flat-plate, was investigated in terms of
analytical formulations of velocity independent on Reynolds ( ) number. With
reference to the analysis from von Karman in developing the conventional
law-of-the-wall, the current study first physically distinguished the
time-averaged local scale used by von Karman from the ensemble-averaged scale
defined in the paper, and then derived the governing equations with the
-independency under the ensemble-averaged scales. Based on indicator function
(IDF) and TBL thickness, the sublayer partitions were rigorously defined. The
analytical formulations for entire TBL, namely the complete law-of-the-wall,
were established, including the formula in inner, buffer, semi-logarithmic
(semi-log) and wake layer. The researches were featured by introducing the
general damping and enhancing functions (GDF and GEF) and applying these
functions to both linear and logarithmic coordinates. These law formulations
were proved uniform and consistent in time-averaged local and ensemble-averaged
scales, which were validated by the existing DNS and experiment data. Based on
the similarity of relevant properly-scaled governing equations, the law
formulations were logically reasoned being applicable to the temperature in
Type-A thermal TBL. The findings advance the current understandings of the
conventional TBL theory and its well-known foundations of law-of-the-wall.

of each modality for answering the current question, and (3) belief correction

pattern like \textsc{sth do sth at someplace} and then fill in the detailed

human-like reasoning, we propose a novel framework: learning to Collocate
Neural Modules (CNM), to generate the `inner pattern' connecting visual encoder
and language decoder. Unlike the widely-used neural module networks in visual
Q\&A, where the language (ie, question) is fully observable, CNM for captioning
is more challenging as the language is being generated and thus is partially
observable. To this end, we make the following technical contributions for CNM
training: 1) compact module design --- one for function words and three for
visual content words (eg, noun, adjective, and verb), 2) soft module fusion and
multi-step module execution, robustifying the visual reasoning in partial
observation, 3) a linguistic loss for module controller being faithful to
part-of-speech collocations (eg, adjective is before noun). Extensive
experiments on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark validate the
effectiveness of our CNM image captioner. In particular, CNM achieves a new
state-of-the-art 127.9 CIDEr-D on Karpathy split and a single-model 126.0 c40
on the official server. CNM is also robust to few training samples, eg, by
training only one sentence per image, CNM can halve the performance loss

software supporting manual segmentation is rich in features and delivers
accurate results, the necessary time to set it up and get comfortable using it
can pose a hurdle for the collection of large datasets. This work introduces a
client/server based online environment, referred to as Studierfenster

in a web browser. The aim of providing this functionality in the form of a web
application is to ease the collection of ground truth segmentation datasets.
Providing a tool that is quickly accessible and usable on a broad range of
devices, offers the potential to accelerate this process. The manual
segmentation workflow of Studierfenster consists of dragging and dropping the
input file into the browser window and slice-by-slice outlining the object
under consideration. The final segmentation can then be exported as a file
storing its contours and as a binary segmentation mask. In order to evaluate
the usability of Studierfenster, a user study was performed. The user study
resulted in a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points given by users, when asked
about their overall impression of the tool. The evaluation also provides
insights into the results achievable with the tool in practice, by presenting
two ground truth segmentations performed by physicians.

weighting is introduced to alleviate the quantization loss by simultaneously
exploiting the quality of hash functions and their complement for nearest
neighbor search. From the tablewise aspect, multiple hash tables are built for
different data views as a joint index, over which a query-specific rank fusion
is proposed to rerank all results from the bitwise ranking by diffusing in a
graph. Comprehensive experiments on image search over three well-known
benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves up to 17.11% and 20.28%
performance gains on single and multiple table search over state-of-the-art
methods.

viewer in it can see a unique colour. The goal is to minimise the number of
colours used. This is also known as the conflict-free chromatic guarding
problem with vertex guards, and is motivated, e.g., by the problem of radio
frequency assignment to sensors placed at the polygon vertices. We first study
the scenario in which viewers can be all points of the polygon (such as a
mobile robot which moves in the interior of the polygon). We efficiently solve
the related problem of minimising the number of guards and approximate (up to
only an additive error) the number of colours required in the special case of
polygons called funnels. Then we give an upper bound of O(log^2 n) colours on
n-vertex weak visibility polygons, by decomposing the problem into sub-funnels.
This bound generalises to all simple polygons. We briefly look also at the
second scenario, in which the viewers are only the vertices of the polygon. We
show a lower bound of 3 colours in the general case of simple polygons and
conjecture that this is tight. We also prove that already deciding whether 1 or
2 colours are enough is NP-complete.

  14th International Conference on Semantic Systems",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Big data solutions are designed to cope with data of huge Volume and wide
Variety, that need to be ingested at high Velocity and have potential Veracity
issues, challenging characteristics that are usually referred to as the ""4Vs of
Big Data"". In order to evaluate possibly complex big data solutions, stress
tests require to assess a large number of combinations of sub-components
jointly with the possible big data variations. A formalization of the Design of
Experiments (DoE) on big data solutions is aimed at ensuring the
reproducibility of the experiments, facilitating their partitioning in
sub-experiments and guaranteeing the consistency of their outcomes in a global
assessment. In this paper, an ontology-based approach is proposed to support
the evaluation of a big data system in two ways. Firstly, the approach
formalizes a decomposition and recombination of the big data solution, allowing
for the aggregation of component evaluation results at inter-component level.
Secondly, existing work on DoE is translated into an ontology for supporting
the selection of experiments. The proposed ontology-based approach offers the
possibility to combine knowledge from the evaluation domain and the application
domain. It exploits domain and inter-domain specific restrictions on the factor
combinations in order to reduce the number of experiments. Contrary to existing
approaches, the proposed use of ontologies is not limited to the assertional
description and exploitation of past experiments but offers richer
terminological descriptions for the development of a DoE from scratch. As an
application example, a maritime big data solution to the problem of detecting
and predicting vessel suspicious behaviour through mobility analysis is
selected. The article is concluded with a sketch of future works.

vertical polarization present new device opportunities. These materials differ
from ordinary ferroelectrics in that they are able to maintain polarization
normal to a surface even with an unscreened depolarization field. Identifying
phases that exhibit intrinsic 2D vertical polarization is an ongoing challenge.
Here we report via computational material design the discovery of a new
promising phase, specifically 2D LiAlTe$_2$. The design idea is developed from
the physical understanding of three-dimensional hyperferroelectric covalent
polar semiconductors. We used the structure determination method combining
swarm intelligence algorithm and first-principles calculations to identify
energetically stable structures. In addition to the expected layered version of
bulk LiAlTe$_2$, $\beta$-LiAlTe$_2$, we find a novel 2D structure,
$\gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$. In this phase, the vertical dipole can be switched between
0.07 and -0.11 e$\cdot$angstrom. This switching is triggered by the movement of
Li atom between two local energy minima. The associated asymmetric double-well
energy profile can be continuously tuned by the applied electric field as well
as strain. There is, therefore, a reversible transition between two polar
states. This discovered off-plane switchability provides an opportunity for the
2D $\gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$ based interfacial phase change memory device for example
by growing $\gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$/GeTe heterostructures.

discrepancy, which becomes even harder to bridge when a large number of unknown

CNN (GCN) may be distracted by unknown categories and lack generalization
capability. To measure the domain discrepancy for asymmetric label space
between S and T, we propose Semantic-Guided Matching Discrepancy (SGMD), which
first employs instance matching between S and T, and then the discrepancy is
measured by a weighted feature distance between matched instances. We further
design a limited balance constraint to achieve a more balanced classification

(IQA) and enhancement via machine learning. This issue has long attracted a
wide range of attention in computational intelligence and image processing
communities, since, for many practical applications, e.g. object detection and
recognition, raw images are usually needed to be appropriately enhanced to
raise the visual quality (e.g. visibility and contrast). In fact, proper
enhancement can noticeably improve the quality of input images, even better
than originally captured images which are generally thought to be of the best
quality. In this work, we present two most important contributions. The first
contribution is to develop a new no-reference (NR) IQA model. Given an image,
our quality measure first extracts 17 features through analysis of contrast,
sharpness, brightness and more, and then yields a measre of visual quality
using a regression module, which is learned with big-data training samples that
are much bigger than the size of relevant image datasets. Results of
experiments on nine datasets validate the superiority and efficiency of our
blind metric compared with typical state-of-the-art full-, reduced- and
no-reference IQA methods. The second contribution is that a robust image
enhancement framework is established based on quality optimization. For an
input image, by the guidance of the proposed NR-IQA measure, we conduct
histogram modification to successively rectify image brightness and contrast to
a proper level. Thorough tests demonstrate that our framework can well enhance
natural images, low-contrast images, low-light images and dehazed images. The

frame-rates. Results feature details even on parts that are occluded in the
input image. Our main idea is to turn shape regression into an aligned
image-to-image translation problem. The input to our method is a partial
texture map of the visible region obtained from off-the-shelf methods. From a
partial texture, we estimate detailed normal and vector displacement maps,
which can be applied to a low-resolution smooth body model to add detail and
clothing. Despite being trained purely with synthetic data, our model
generalizes well to real-world photographs. Numerous results demonstrate the
versatility and robustness of our method.

a completely different result. The first attacks did this by changing pixel
values of an input image slightly to fool a classifier to output the wrong
class. Other approaches have tried to learn ""patches"" that can be applied to an
object to fool detectors and classifiers. Some of these approaches have also
shown that these attacks are feasible in the real-world, i.e. by modifying an
object and filming it with a video camera. However, all of these approaches
target classes that contain almost no intra-class variety (e.g. stop signs).
The known structure of the object is then used to generate an adversarial patch
on top of it.
  In this paper, we present an approach to generate adversarial patches to
targets with lots of intra-class variety, namely persons. The goal is to
generate a patch that is able successfully hide a person from a person
detector. An attack that could for instance be used maliciously to circumvent
surveillance systems, intruders can sneak around undetected by holding a small
cardboard plate in front of their body aimed towards the surveillance camera.
  From our results we can see that our system is able significantly lower the
accuracy of a person detector. Our approach also functions well in real-life
scenarios where the patch is filmed by a camera. To the best of our knowledge
we are the first to attempt this kind of attack on targets with a high level of

trends as a function of cluster-centric radius. We find a different behavior
for the bright dwarfs (-18.5 mag < M$_r$ < -16 mag) as compared to the fainter
ones (M$_r$ > -16 mag): While considering galaxies in the same magnitude-bins,
we find that, while for fainter dwarfs the g'-r' color is redder for lower
surface brightness objects (as expected from fading stellar populations), for
brighter dwarfs the color is redder for the higher surface brightness and
higher S\'ersic n objects. The trend of the bright dwarfs might be explained by
those galaxies being affected by harassment and by slower quenching of star
formation in their inner parts. As the fraction of early-type dwarfs with
respect to late-types increases toward the central parts of the cluster, the
color-surface brightness trends are also manifested in the cluster-centric
trends, confirming that it is indeed the environment that changes the galaxies.
We also estimate the strengths of the ram-pressure stripping, tidal disruption,
and harassment in the Fornax cluster, and find that our observations are
consistent with the theoretically expected ranges of galaxy properties where
each of those mechanisms dominate. We furthermore find that the luminosity
function, color-magnitude relation, and axis-ratio distribution of the dwarfs

approaches. However, most existing blind deconvolution methods cannot generate
satisfactory results due to their dependence on strong edges, which are
sufficient in natural images but not in facial images. In this paper, we
represent point spread functions (PSFs) by the linear combination of a set of
pre-defined orthogonal PSFs, and similarly, an estimated intrinsic (EI) sharp
face image is represented by the linear combination of a set of pre-defined
orthogonal face images. In doing so, PSF and EI estimation is simplified to
discovering two sets of linear combination coefficients, which are
simultaneously found by our proposed coupled learning algorithm. To make our
method robust to different types of blurry face images, we generate several
candidate PSFs and EIs for a test image, and then, a non-blind deconvolution
method is adopted to generate more EIs by those candidate PSFs. Finally, we
deploy a blind image quality assessment metric to automatically select the
optimal EI. Thorough experiments on the facial recognition technology database,
extended Yale face database B, CMU pose, illumination, and expression (PIE)
database, and face recognition grand challenge database version 2.0 demonstrate
that the proposed approach effectively restores intrinsic sharp face images

  insufficiently stratified life tables","to appear in Biostatistics",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cancer epidemiology using population-based data, regression models for the
excess mortality hazard is a useful method to estimate cancer survival and to
describe the association between prognosis factors and excess mortality. This
method requires expected mortality rates from general population life tables:
each cancer patient is assigned an expected (background) mortality rate
obtained from the life tables, typically at least according to their age and
sex, from the population they belong to. However, those life tables may be
insufficiently stratified, as some characteristics such as deprivation,
ethnicity, and comorbidities, are not available in the life tables for a number
of countries. This may affect the background mortality rate allocated to each
patient, and it has been shown that not including relevant information for
assigning an expected mortality rate to each patient induces a bias in the
estimation of the regression parameters of the excess hazard model. We propose
two parametric corrections in excess hazard regression models, including a
single-parameter or a random effect (frailty), to account for possible
mismatches in the life table and thus misspecification of the background
mortality rate. In an extensive simulation study, the good statistical
performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated, and we illustrate their
use on real population-based data of lung cancer patients. We present
conditions and limitations of these methods, and provide some recommendations
for their use in practice.

saddle equilibria: each one is unstable to the next in turn, and connections
from one to the next occur within invariant subspaces. Such a situation can be
described by a third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), and typical
trajectories approach each equilibrium point in turn, spending progressively
longer to cycle around the three points but never stopping. This cycle has been
invoked as a model of cyclic competition between populations adopting three
strategies, characterised as Rock, Paper and Scissors. When spatial
distribution and mobility of the populations is taken into account, waves of
Rock can invade regions of Scissors, only to be invaded by Paper in turn. The
dynamics is described by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that
has travelling wave (in one dimension) and spiral (in two dimensions)
solutions. In this paper, we explore how the robust heteroclinic cycle in the
ODE manifests itself in the PDEs. Taking the wavespeed as a parameter, and
moving into a travelling frame, the PDEs reduce to a sixth-order set of ODEs,
in which travelling waves are created in a Hopf bifurcation and are destroyed
in three different heteroclinic bifurcations, depending on parameters, as the
travelling wave approaches the heteroclinic cycle. We explore the three
different heteroclinic bifurcations, none of which have been observed in the
context of robust heteroclinic cycles previously. These results are an
important step towards a full understanding of the spiral patterns found in two
dimensions, with possible application to travelling waves and spirals in other
population dynamics models.

existence of fixed points in the infinite hierarchy of equations satisfied by
the moments. These fixed points are already present in the two-moment
truncations and are only moderately affected by the coupling to higher moments.
Collisions contribute to a damping of all the non trivial moments. At late
time, when the hydrodynamic regime is entered, only the monopole and quadrupole
moments are significant and remain strongly coupled, the decay of the
quadrupole moment being delayed by the expansion, causing in turn a delay in
the full isotropization of the system. The two-moment truncation contains

dependent dynamic conductivity of the drifting electrons can be negative under
stationary electric fields of moderate amplitudes, $2..5$ kV/cm. This effect is
realized in a set of frequency windows. The low-frequency window with negative
dynamic conductivity is due to the Cherenkov mechanism. For this case the
time-dependent field induces a {\it traveling wave} of the electron
concentration in real space and a {\it standing wave} in the energy/momentum
space. The higher frequency windows of negative dynamic conductivity are
associated with the optical phonon transient time resonances. For this case the
time-dependent field is accompanied by oscillations of the electron
distribution in the form of the {\it traveling} waves in both the real space
and the energy/momentum space. We discuss the optimal conditions for the
observation of these effects. We suggest that the studied negative dynamic

a certain scenario is often not known and, in addition, depends heavily on the
used HPC platform. From a simulation software perspective, this places a
premium on the ability to adapt easily to different numerical methods and
hardware architectures. One solution to this problem is to apply code
generation techniques and to express methods and specific hardware-dependent
implementations on different levels of abstraction. This allows for a
separation of concerns and makes it possible, e.g., to exchange the
discretization scheme without having to rewrite all low-level optimized
routines manually. In this paper, we show how code for an advanced

to the discrete scheme, spells out the numerical algorithms, and, finally, maps
to a representation that can be transformed to a distributed memory parallel
implementation by our in-house Scala-based source-to-source compiler. Our

present Exquisitor, a highly scalable interactive learning approach, capable of
intelligent exploration of the large-scale YFCC100M image collection with
extremely efficient responses from the interactive classifier. Based on
relevance feedback from the user on previously suggested items, Exquisitor uses
semantic features, extracted from both visual and text attributes, to suggest
relevant media items to the user. Exquisitor builds upon the state of the art
in large-scale data representation, compression and indexing, introducing a
cluster-based retrieval mechanism that facilitates the efficient suggestions.
With Exquisitor, each interaction round over the full YFCC100M collection is
completed in less than 0.3 seconds using a single CPU core. That is 4x less
time using 16x smaller computational resources than the most efficient
state-of-the-art method, with a positive impact on result quality. These
results open up many interesting research avenues, both for exploration of
industry-scale media collections and for media exploration on mobile devices.

to their poor information rate in the low degree regime. This lead the
community to design codes with similar local properties but larger dimension,

  However, a second practical barrier appears when one requires that the PIR

  In order to improve the dimension of the codes, we then introduce an analogue

Preliminary version, comments welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-classicality of single quantum systems can be formalised using the
notion of contextuality. But can contextuality be convincingly demonstrated in
an experiment, without reference to the quantum formalism? The operational
approach to contextuality due to Spekkens requires finding operationally
equivalent preparation procedures. Previously these have been obtained by
demanding indistinguishability under a set of measurements taken to be
tomographically complete. In the language of generalised probability theories,
this requires the ability to explore all the dimensions of the system's state
space. However, if the true tomographically complete set is larger than the set
assumed, the extra measurements could break the operational equivalences and
hence eliminate the putative contextuality. Such extra dimensions could arise
in post-quantum theories, but even if quantum theory is exact there can be
unexpected degrees of freedoms due to imperfections in an experiment. Here we
design tests of contextuality that are immune to this effect for a given number
of extra measurements in the tomographically complete set, even if nothing is
known about their statistics. This allows contextuality to be demonstrated with
weaker assumptions.

power to each user's data stream on each of its allocated subchannels. We first
employ a many-to-many matching model under the assumption of uniform power
loading in order to obtain the solution of the first subproblem with reasonable
performance. Once the the subchannel-user mapping information is known from the

We found that at low lattice temperatures and low impurity concentrations,
electric-field dependencies of the transverse-to-current components of the

processes are greatly controlled by the magnetic field. With an increase of the
lattice temperature or the impurity concentration, the behaviour of the

basis of a wide-coverage vocabulary of concepts such as the one provided by
Wikipedia, and cast gist detection as a concept-ranking problem with
image-caption pairs as queries. To enable a thorough investigation of the
problem of gist understanding, we produce a gold standard of over 300
image-caption pairs and over 8,000 gist annotations covering a wide variety of
topics at different levels of abstraction. We use this dataset to
experimentally benchmark the contribution of signals from heterogeneous
sources, namely image and text. The best result with a Mean Average Precision
(MAP) of 0.69 indicate that by combining both dimensions we are able to better
understand the meaning of our image-caption pairs than when using language or
vision information alone. We test the robustness of our gist detection approach
when receiving automatically generated input, i.e., using automatically
generated image tags or generated captions, and prove the feasibility of an
end-to-end automated process.

$X\in\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ defines a bounded Killing vector field, we
find some crucial algebraic properties of the decomposition $X=X_r+X_s$

$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})+\mathfrak{s}$, where
$\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the radical, and

Furthermore, when $M=G/H$ is a Riemannian homogeneous space, we can completely
determine all bounded Killing vector fields induced by vectors in

stars. Recently, it has been observed to show intriguing behaviour by analysing
long-term photometry: during 2003--2009, a coherent spot structure migrating in
the rotational frame has been reported by various authors, but since that time
the star has entered a chaotic state where coherent structures seem to have
disappeared and rapid phase jumps of the photometric minima occur irregularly
over time. Aims. LQ Hya is one of the stars included in the SOFIN/FIES
long-term monitoring campaign extending over 25 years. Here we publish new
temperature maps for the star during 2006--2017, covering the chaotic state of
the star. Methods. We use a Doppler imaging technique to derive surface
temperature maps from high-resolution spectra. Results. From the mean
temperatures of the Doppler maps we see a weak but systematic increase in the
surface temperature of the star. This is consistent with the simultaneously
increasing photometric magnitude. During nearly all observing seasons we see a
high-latitude spot structure which is clearly nonaxisymmetric. The phase
behaviour of this structure is very chaotic but agrees reasonably well with the
photometry. Equatorial spots are also frequently seen, but many of them we
interpret to be artefacts due to the poor to moderate phase coverage.
Conclusions. Even during the chaotic phase of the star, the spot topology has
remained very similar to the higher activity epochs with more coherent and
long-lived spot structures: we see high-latitude and equatorial spot activity,
the mid latitude range still being most often void of spots. We interpret the
erratic jumps and drifts in phase of the photometric minima to be caused by
changes in the high-latitude spot structure rather than the equatorial spots.

(DFT)-based method for accurate, reliable treatment of various resonances in
atoms. Many of these are known to be notorious for their strong correlation,
proximity to more than one thresholds, degeneracy with more than one minima.
Therefore these pose unusual challenges to both theoreticians and
experimentalists. Our method uses a work-function-based exchange potential in
conjunction with the popular gradient-corrected Lee-Yang-Parr correlation
functional. The resulting Kohn-Sham equation, in the non-relativistic
framework, is numerically solved accurately and efficiently by means of a
generalized pseudospectral method through a non-uniform, optimal spatial
discretization. This has been applied to a variety of excited states, such as
low and high states; single, double, triple as well as multiple excitations;
valence and core excitations; autoionizing states; satellites; hollow and
doubly-hollow states; very high-lying Rydberg resonances; etc., of atoms and
ions, with remarkable success. A thorough and systematic comparison with
literature data reveals that, for all these systems, the exchange-only results
are practically of Hartree-Fock quality; while with inclusion of correlation,
this offers excellent agreement with available experimental data as well as
those obtained from other sophisticated theoretical methods. Properties such as
individual state energies, excitation energies, radial densities as well as
various expectation values are studied. This helps us in predicting many states
for the first time.

leading to standard diagonalization of symmetric matrices. Its validity and
feasibility have been demonstrated for a wide range of important potentials
such as Hulth\'en, Yukawa, generalized spiked harmonic oscillators, Hellmann,
Coulomb potentials without/with various perturbations (for instance, linear and

distance metric learning based on the optimization of the triplet loss
function. One epoch of such training process based on a naive optimization of
the triplet loss function has a run-time complexity O(N^3), where N is the
number of training samples. Such optimization scales poorly, and the most
common approach proposed to address this high complexity issue is based on
sub-sampling the set of triplets needed for the training process. Another
approach explored in the field relies on an ad-hoc linearization (in terms of
N) of the triplet loss that introduces class centroids, which must be optimized
using the whole training set for each mini-batch - this means that a naive
implementation of this approach has run-time complexity O(N^2). This complexity
issue is usually mitigated with poor, but computationally cheap, approximate
centroid optimization methods. In this paper, we first propose a solid theory
on the linearization of the triplet loss with the use of class centroids, where
the main conclusion is that our new linear loss represents a tight upper-bound
to the triplet loss. Furthermore, based on the theory above, we propose a
training algorithm that no longer requires the centroid optimization step,
which means that our approach is the first in the field with a guaranteed
linear run-time complexity. We show that the training of deep distance metric
learning methods using the proposed upper-bound is substantially faster than
triplet-based methods, while producing competitive retrieval accuracy results
on benchmark datasets (CUB-200-2011 and CAR196).

instability. As a function of momentum, the onset of appearance and
disappearance of complex eigenvalues is an exceptional point (EP), which is a
point where the Hamiltonian is not diagonalizable and hence the Berry
connection and curvature are ill-defined, preventing defining topological
invariants. In this paper, we propose a systematic procedure to remove EPs from
the Brillouin zone by introducing an imaginary part of the momentum. We then
define the Berry phase for a one-dimensional bosonic Bogoliubov system.
Extending the argument for Hermitian systems, the Berry phase for an
inversion-symmetric system is shown to be $Z_2$. As concrete examples, we
numerically investigate two toy models and confirm the bulk-edge correspondence

Our starting point is Kirwan's method. We then follow by investigating the

lucrative approaches in electronic structure calculations of many-electron

variational DFT method for atoms and molecules \emph{completely} in a Cartesian
grid. The non-relativistic Kohn-Sham equation is solved by using an LCAO-MO
ansatz. Atom-centered localized basis set, electron density, molecular
orbitals, two-body potentials are directly constructed on the grid. We adopt a
Fourier convolution method for classical Coulomb potentials by making an
Ewald-type decomposition technique in terms of short- and long-range
interactions. It produces quite accurate and competitive results for various
properties of interest, such as component energy, total energy, ionization
energy, potential energy curve, atomization energy, etc. Both local and
non-local functionals are employed for pseudopotential as well as full
calculations. While most results are offered in a \emph{uniform} grid, initial
exploratory attempts are made in a \emph{non-uniform} grid, which can
significantly reduce the computational overhead. This offers a practical,
viable alternative to atom-centered grid-based implementations, currently
exploited by the majority of programs available world-wide.

conditioned on any outcome of the measurement. In both cases, we can achieve
the goal by techniques like deliberately adding noise to the outcome before
returning it. This paper proves a new and general connection between the two
subjects. Specifically, we show that on products of n quantum states, any
measurement that is alpha-gentle for small alpha is also O(alpha)-DP, and any
product measurement that is eps-DP is also O(eps*sqrt(n))-gentle. Illustrating
the power of this connection, we apply it to the recently studied problem of
shadow tomography. Given an unknown d-dimensional quantum state rho, as well as
known two-outcome measurements E_1,...,E_m, shadow tomography asks us to
estimate Pr[E_i accepts rho], for every i in [m], by measuring few copies of
rho. Using our connection theorem, together with a quantum analog of the
so-called private multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum, we
give a protocol to solve this problem using O((log m)^2 (log d)^2) copies of

protocol has the advantages of being online (that is, the E_i's are processed

connection include new lower bounds for shadow tomography from lower bounds on
DP, and a result on the safe use of estimation algorithms as subroutines inside

convolutional neural networks for spatio-temporal perception that can directly
process such 3D-videos using high-dimensional convolutions. For this, we adopt
sparse tensors and propose the generalized sparse convolution that encompasses
all discrete convolutions. To implement the generalized sparse convolution, we
create an open-source auto-differentiation library for sparse tensors that
provides extensive functions for high-dimensional convolutional neural
networks. We create 4D spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks using the
library and validate them on various 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks and
proposed 4D datasets for 3D-video perception. To overcome challenges in the 4D
space, we propose the hybrid kernel, a special case of the generalized sparse
convolution, and the trilateral-stationary conditional random field that
enforces spatio-temporal consistency in the 7D space-time-chroma space.
Experimentally, we show that convolutional neural networks with only
generalized 3D sparse convolutions can outperform 2D or 2D-3D hybrid methods by
a large margin. Also, we show that on 3D-videos, 4D spatio-temporal
convolutional neural networks are robust to noise, outperform 3D convolutional
neural networks and are faster than the 3D counterpart in some cases.

classification decisions of a trained machine learning system are typically
non-transparent, a major hindrance for clinical integration, error tracking or
knowledge discovery. In this study, we present a transparent deep learning
framework relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise
relevance propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is
commonly diagnosed utilizing a combination of clinical presentation and
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically the occurrence and
presentation of white matter lesions in T2-weighted images. We hypothesized
that using LRP in a naive predictive model would enable us to uncover relevant
image features that a trained CNN uses for decision-making. Since imaging
markers in MS are well-established this would enable us to validate the
respective CNN model. First, we pre-trained a CNN on MRI data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 921), afterwards specializing
the CNN to discriminate between MS patients and healthy controls (n = 147).
Using LRP, we then produced a heatmap for each subject in the holdout set
depicting the voxel-wise relevance for a particular classification decision.
The resulting CNN model resulted in a balanced accuracy of 87.04% and an area
under the curve of 96.08% in a receiver operating characteristic curve. The
subsequent LRP visualization revealed that the CNN model focuses indeed on
individual lesions, but also incorporates additional information such as lesion
location, non-lesional white matter or gray matter areas such as the thalamus,

translation equivariant representations on rectilinear grid from Cartesian

implementation of the detection mechanism for Distributed Denial of Service

other common classification algorithms used for detecting DDOS attacks on the

detection rate of the FRI-IDS is in pair with other methods. On the example
dataset it outperforms the detection rate of the support vector machine
algorithm, whereas other algorithms (neural network, random forest and decision
tree) recorded lightly higher detection rate. Consequently, the FRI inference
system could be a suitable approach to be implemented as a detection mechanism
for IDS; it effectively decreases the false positive rate value. Moreover,
because of its fuzzy rule base knowledge representation nature, it can easily
adapt expert knowledge, and also be-suitable for predicting the level of degree

anti-ferromagnetic (AF). Moreover, the spin-structure coupling plays and
important role in magnetic behavior of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. In this concern the
magnetization under zero applied field i.e. spontaneous magnetization would be
interesting to study and would give insight into the novel magnetic behavior of
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Sophisticated techniques like neutron diffraction, $\mu$
\textit{SR} etc has been used to understand the magnetic behavior of
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ under zero applied field. To understand the magnetic behavior we
have performed detail field and temperature dependent magnetization study, the
measured field and temperature dependent magnetic data is analyzed rigorously.
We have attempted the understand the temperature dependance of spontaneous
magnetization, remanent magnetization and coercive force. We observe that the
spontaneous magnetization extracted from Arrott plot shows that the
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is not an ideal ferromagnet. The temperature dependent coercive
field is found to follows Guant's model of strong domain wall pinning. Our
investigation explicit the temperature dependence of various magnetic
properties shows the magnetic transitions from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
phase with $T_c$ around 225 K and a low temperature evolution of magnetic
magnetic moment around $T_M$ $\sim$90 K.

described by a series of events or event sequences showing non-Poissonian,

be understood not only by heterogeneous interevent times (IETs) but also by
correlations between IETs. Modeling and simulating various dynamical processes
requires us to generate event sequences with a heavy-tailed IET distribution
and memory effects between IETs. For this, we propose a
Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula-based algorithm for generating event sequences
with correlated IETs when the IET distribution and the memory coefficient
between two consecutive IETs are given. We successfully apply our algorithm to
the cases with heavy-tailed IET distributions. We also compare our algorithm to
the existing shuffling method to find that our algorithm outperforms the
shuffling method for some cases. Our copula-based algorithm is expected to be
used for more realistic modeling of various dynamical processes.

perturb the minor bodies into crossing orbits, generating small dust grains
that are detected via remote sensing. Debris disks have been discovered around

stellar spectral types (from early A-type to M-type stars). As a result, they
serve as excellent laboratories for understanding whether the architecture and
the evolution of our Solar System is common or rare. This white paper addresses
two outstanding questions in debris disk science: (1) Are debris disk minor
bodies similar to asteroids and comets in our Solar System? (2) Do planets
separate circumstellar material into distinct reservoirs and/or mix material
during planet migration? We anticipate that SOFIA/HIRMES, JWST, and WFIRST/CGI
will greatly improve our understanding of debris disk composition, enabling the
astronomical community to answer these questions. However, we note that despite

when the ferromagnetic weak link had entirely in-plane anisotropy (N. Satchell

in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization components (canted magnetization). The
canted magnetization more closely matches theoretical predictions than our

includes the first systematic study of supercurrent dependence on Cu interlayer
thickness, a common additional layer used to buffer the growth of the

We report that the supercurrent in the [Co(0.4 nm)/Ni(0.4

two orders of magnitude by tuning the Cu interlayer thickness. This result has
important application in superconducting spintronics, where large critical

raw images by imitating an expert. However, such a policy is limited by the
expert it imitates and scaling to other environments and vehicle dynamics is
difficult. One approach to overcome the drawbacks of an end-to-end policy is to
train a network only on the perception task and handle control with a PID or
MPC controller. However, a single controller must be extensively tuned and
cannot usually cover the whole state space. In this paper, we propose learning
an optimized controller using a DNN that fuses multiple controllers. The
network learns a robust controller with online trajectory filtering, which
suppresses noisy trajectories and imperfections of individual controllers. The
result is a network that is able to learn a good fusion of filtered
trajectories from different controllers leading to significant improvements in
overall performance. We compare our trained network to controllers it has
learned from, end-to-end baselines and human pilots in a realistic simulation;
our network beats all baselines in extensive experiments and approaches the

diffusion cascades to perform model-independent influence maximization that
scales in real-world datasets. The first part of our methodology is a
multi-task neural network that learns embeddings of nodes that initiate
cascades (influencer vectors) and embeddings of nodes that participate in them
(susceptible vectors). The norm of an influencer vector captures the ability of
the node to create lengthy cascades and is used to estimate the expected
influence spread and reduce the number of candidate seeds. In addition, the
combination of influencer and susceptible vectors form the diffusion
probabilities between nodes. These are used to reformulate the network as a
bipartite graph and propose a greedy solution to influence maximization that
retains the theoretical guarantees.We a pply our method in three sizable
networks with diffusion cascades and evaluate it using cascades from future

competitive algorithms and metrics from the diverse landscape of influence
maximization in terms of efficiency and seed set quality.

connectivity by selectively acting on the brain's structure and parameters.
Functional connectivity, which measures the degree of correlation between
neural activities in different brain regions, can be used to distinguish
between healthy and certain diseased brain dynamics and, possibly, as a control
parameter to restore healthy functions. In this work, we use a collection of
interconnected Kuramoto oscillators to model oscillatory neural activity, and
show that functional connectivity is essentially regulated by the degree of
synchronization between different clusters of oscillators. Then, we propose a
minimally invasive method to correct the oscillators' interconnections and
frequencies to enforce arbitrary and stable synchronization patterns among the
oscillators and, consequently, a desired pattern of functional connectivity.
Additionally, we show that our synchronization-based framework is robust to
parameter mismatches and numerical inaccuracies, and validate it using a
realistic neurovascular model to simulate neural activity and functional
connectivity in the human brain.

for accurate, reliable prediction of many-electron systems. Background, need
for such a scheme, major difficulties encountered, as well as their potential
remedies are discussed at some length. Within the realm of non relativistic
Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham (HKS) DFT and making use of the familiar LCAO-MO principle,
relevant KS eigenvalue problem is solved numerically. Unlike the commonly used
atom-centered grid (ACG), here we employ a 3D cartesian coordinate grid (CCG)
to build atom-centered localized basis set, electron density, as well as all
the two-body potentials directly on grid. The Hartree potential is computed
through a Fourier convolution technique via a decomposition in terms of short-
and long-range interactions. Feasibility and viability of our proposed scheme
is demonstrated for a series of chemical systems; first with homogeneous,
local-density-approximated XC functionals followed by non-local, gradient- and
Laplacian-dependent functionals. A detailed, systematic analysis on obtained
results relevant to quantum chemistry, are made, \emph{for the first time},
using CCG, which clearly illustrates the significance of this alternative
method in the present context. Quantities such as component energies, total
energies, ionization energies, potential energy curve, atomization energies,
etc., are addressed for pseudopotential calculations, along with a thorough
comparison with literature data, wherever possible. Finally, some words on the
future and prospect of this method are mentioned. In summary, we have presented
a new CCG-based \emph{variational} DFT method for accurate, dependable
calculation of atoms and molecules.

During the formation of the heterojunctions at room temperature, both electrons
and holes diffuse in the same direction from n-type Bi2Te3 thin films to p-type
Sb2Te3 thin films rather than conventional bi-directional diffusion. Because
the strong intrinsic excitation generates a large number of intrinsic carriers

find that the branching ratios for the decay channels $p \rightarrow e^+\pi^0$

comparable between the known variables of the OGLE-III catalogue and the 59
individual objects classified as short period Type II Cepheids in the General
Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) we had in our sample. The derived Fourier
parameters were used to make the distinction between different classes of
variables. From the 59 stars we found 19 BLHs, 19 fundamental mode Anomalous
Cepheids (ACs) (8 of them were already known from the Catalina Sky Survey

Galactic Field, and separated the ACs, as well as other objects that were
misclassified. The number of true BLHs decreased in our sample by more than
50%. We gathered the metallicity from spectroscopic measurements published in
the literature. While the number of actual measurements is low, it is highly
suggestive that ACs are metal poor. The mean metallicity from 8 measurements in
4 stars (UY Eri having 5 different [Fe/H] data points) is -1.12 dex, but if the
higher value metallicity outliers of UY Eri are left out the mean metallicity
becomes -1.88 dex, regardless if the AC is in the Milky Way itself or in a
cluster. On the other hand, BLHs seem to have a Solar-like metallicity of 0 dex

signal has been investigated for many years. Recently, it is reported that the
capability of signal restoration is fundamentally limited by the
perception-distortion tradeoff, i.e. the distortion and the perceptual
difference between the restored signal and the ideal `original' signal cannot
be made both minimal simultaneously. Distortion corresponds to signal fidelity
and perceptual difference corresponds to perceptual naturalness, both of which
are important metrics in practice. Besides, there is another dimension worthy
of consideration, namely the semantic quality or the utility for recognition
purpose, of the restored signal. In this paper, we extend the previous
perception-distortion tradeoff to the case of
classification-distortion-perception (CDP) tradeoff, where we introduced the
classification error rate of the restored signal in addition to distortion and
perceptual difference. Two versions of the CDP tradeoff are considered, one
using a predefined classifier and the other dealing with the optimal classifier
for the restored signal. For both versions, we can rigorously prove the
existence of the CDP tradeoff, i.e. the distortion, perceptual difference, and
classification error rate cannot be made all minimal simultaneously. Our
findings can be useful especially for computer vision researches where some
low-level vision tasks (signal restoration) serve for high-level vision tasks

properties of the hole substituted (Sr2+) partially B-site disordered double

The study suggested the presence of mixed valence states of the B-site ions
(Co2+/Co3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+) with significant enhancement of the average oxidation
states due to hole doping. The mere absence of electronic states near the Fermi
level in the valence band (VB) spectra for both of the pure (x=0.0) and Sr
doped (x=0.5) systems indicated the insulating nature of the samples. Sr
substitution is observed to increase the spectral weight near the Fermi level
suggesting for an enhanced conductivity of the hole doped system. The
temperature variation of electrical resistivity measurements revealed the
insulating nature for both the systems, thus supporting the VB spectra results.
The dc magnetization data divulged a Griffiths like phase above the long range
ordering temperature. A typical re-entrant spin glass like phase driven by the
inherent anti-site disorder (ASD) has been maidenly recognized by ac
susceptibility study for both the pure and doped systems. Most interestingly,
the emergence of a new cluster glass like phase (immediately below the magnetic

study. The isothermal magnetization measurements further probed the exhibition

disturbingly, the machine-learning model learned over images where no

the degradation and the competing self-annealing proceeds through the merger
and annihilation of vacancies, respectively, which are triggered via itinerant
vacancy and adatom. A further increase in temperature beyond 650 K, the
structural degradation results through the emission of the undercoordinated
atoms from the defect and the concurrent pair-wise sublimation. The role of
inter-layer vacancy diffusion is discarded in the context of structural
degradation. The chemical degradation is routed through the dissociation of
oxygen molecule that is either activated at the room-temperature on the
pristine surface or spontaneous at the single-vacancy site. The present results
are in agreement with the few available experimental conjectures and will

  Pipeline Simulation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image reconstruction techniques such as denoising often need to be applied to
the RGB output of cameras and cellphones. Unfortunately, the commonly used
additive white noise (AWGN) models do not accurately reproduce the noise and
the degradation encountered on these inputs. This is particularly important for
learning-based techniques, because the mismatch between training and real world
data will hurt their generalization. This paper aims to accurately simulate the
degradation and noise transformation performed by camera pipelines. This allows
us to generate realistic degradation in RGB images that can be used to train
machine learning models. We use our simulation to study the importance of noise
modeling for learning-based denoising. Our study shows that a realistic noise
model is required for learning to denoise real JPEG images. A neural network
trained on realistic noise outperforms the one trained with AWGN by 3 dB. An
ablation study of our pipeline shows that simulating denoising and demosaicking
is important to this improvement and that realistic demosaicking algorithms,
which have been rarely considered, is needed. We believe this simulation will
also be useful for other image reconstruction tasks, and we will distribute our
code publicly.

alternating-minimization algorithm for dictionary learning as an approximate
Expectation-Maximization algorithm to develop autoencoders that enable the
simultaneous training of the dictionary and regularization parameter (ReLU
bias). The forward pass of the encoder approximates the sufficient statistics
of the E-step as the solution to a sparse coding problem, using an iterative
proximal gradient algorithm called FISTA. The encoder can be interpreted either
as a recurrent neural network or as a deep residual network, with two-sided
ReLU non-linearities in both cases. The M-step is implemented via a two-stage
back-propagation. The first stage relies on a linear decoder applied to the
encoder and a norm-squared loss. It parallels the dictionary update step in
dictionary learning. The second stage updates the regularization parameter by
applying a loss function to the encoder that includes a prior on the parameter
motivated by Bayesian statistics. We demonstrate in an image-denoising task
that CRsAE learns Gabor-like filters, and that the EM-inspired approach for
learning biases is superior to the conventional approach. In an application to
recordings of electrical activity from the brain, we demonstrate that CRsAE
learns realistic spike templates and speeds up the process of identifying spike

sensors (hence unknown), passivity allows us to have natural interaction. An
analysis shows that the behavior of the actual system mimics that of a nominal

approach is an admittance controller. However, because the control gain cannot
grow infinitely in practice, the performance limitation according to the
achievable control gain is also analyzed. The result of this analysis indicates
that the performance in the sense of infinite norm increases linearly with the

ubiquitous propagating kink waves were discovered in the corona. {It has long
been suggested that Alfv\'enic} waves play an important role in coronal heating
and the acceleration of the solar wind. To this effect, it is imperative to
understand the mechanisms that enable their energy to be transferred to the
plasma. Mode conversion via resonant absorption is believed to be one of the
main mechanisms for kink wave damping, and is considered to play a key role in
the process of energy transfer. This study examines the damping of propagating
kink waves in quiescent coronal loops using the Coronal Multi-channel
Polarimeter (CoMP). A coherence-based method is used to track the Doppler
velocity signal of the waves, enabling us to investigate the spatial evolution
of velocity perturbations. The power ratio of outward to inward propagating
waves is used to estimate the associated damping lengths and quality factors.
To enable accurate estimates of these quantities, {we provide the first
derivation of a likelihood function suitable for fitting models to the ratio of
two power spectra obtained from discrete Fourier transforms. Maximum likelihood
estimation is used to fit an exponential damping model to the observed
variation in power ratio as a function of frequency.} We confirm earlier
indications that propagating kink waves are undergoing frequency dependent
damping. Additionally, we find that the rate of damping decreases, or
equivalently the damping length increases, for longer coronal loops that reach
higher in the corona.

circuits because several optic and electronic functionalities can be added on

such quantum circuits and several approaches have been developed to interface
PICs with a host material containing SPEs. SPEs embedded in 2D transition metal
dichalcogenides have unique properties that make them particularly appealing as
PIC-integrated SPEs. They can be easily interfaced with PICs and stacked
together to create complex heterostructures. Since the emitters are embedded in
a monolayer there is no total internal reflection, enabling very high light
extraction efficiencies without the need of any additional processing to allow
efficient single photon transfer between the host and the underlying PIC.
Arrays of 2D-based SPEs can moreover be fabricated deterministically through
STEM patterning or strain engineering. Finally, 2D materials grown with high
wafer-scale uniformity are becoming more readily available, such that they can
be matched at the wafer level with underlying PICs. Here we report on the
integration of a WSe$_{2}$ monolayer onto a Silicon Nitride (SiN) chip. We
demonstrate the coupling of SPEs with the guided mode of a SiN waveguide and
study how the on-chip single photon extraction can be maximized by interfacing
the 2D-SPE with an integrated dielectric cavity. Our approach allows the use of
optimized PIC platforms without the need for additional processing in the host
material. In combination with improved wafer-scale CVD growth of 2D materials,
this approach provides a promising route towards scalable quantum photonic

fluctuations, which are estimated by comparing the observed tracer density
field to a selection function accounting for the survey density and geometry.
However, this survey selection function is commonly partly inferred from the
observed data itself, leading to so-called integral constraints, for which we
propose a complete derivation. We discuss the normalisation of the introduced
window functions, the shot noise contribution to the integral constraint
corrections and wide-angle effects. Using this formalism, we review the
well-known global integral constraint, arising when the expected mean galaxy
density is taken to be the measured one. Another, stronger, constraint is
imposed when the radial selection function itself is estimated from the data
redshift distribution, as is often the case in the literature. We find that the
impact of such a radial integral constraint can be as significant as the window
function effect at large scales, depending on the survey geometry. Equations
for this radial integral constraint are derived within our general formalism.
We assess the validity of our approach by performing a Redshift Space
Distortions (RSD) analysis on mock catalogues and emphasise that our results
may be even more useful for analyses focusing on larger scales. Finally, as a
further application, we show that unknown angular systematics can be mitigated
by nulling the density fluctuations on a chosen angular scale. The induced loss
of clustering is modelled by an angular integral constraint which can be
combined with the radial one.

air pollution exposure solely using measurements. In the last few years,
substantial research efforts have been placed in developing statistical methods
or machine learning techniques to generate estimates of air pollution at finer
spatial and temporal scales (daily, usually) with complete coverage. Some of
these methods include: geostatistical techniques, such as kriging; spatial
statistical models that use the information contained in air quality model
outputs (statistical downscaling models); linear regression modeling approaches
that leverage the information in GIS covariates (land use regression); or
machine learning methods that mine the information contained in relevant
variables (neural network and deep learning approaches). Although some of these
exposure modeling approaches have been used in several air pollution
epidemiological studies, it is not clear how much the predicted exposures
generated by these methods differ, and which method generates more reliable
estimates. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by evaluating a variety of
exposure modeling approaches, comparing their predictive performance and
computational difficulty. Using PM$_{2.5}$ in year 2011 over the continental

taxon in the microbiota induces a change in the number of sequenced counts
across all taxa. The data is typically sparse, with zero counts present either
due to biological variance or limited sequencing depth (technical zeros). For
low abundance taxa, the chance for technical zeros is non-negligible. We show

Understanding the collisionless mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer
from the turbulent fluctuations to the particles is a frontier in kinetic
turbulence research. Collisionless energy transfer from the turbulence to the
particles can take place reversibly, resulting in non-thermal energy in the
particle velocity distribution functions (VDFs) before eventual collisional
thermalization is realized. Exploiting the information contained in the
fluctuations in the VDFs is valuable. Here we apply a recently developed method
based on VDFs, the field-particle correlation technique, to a $\beta=1$,
solar-wind-like, low-frequency Alfv\'enic turbulence simulation with well
resolved phase space to identify the field-particle energy transfer in velocity
space. The field-particle correlations reveal that the energy transfer,
mediated by the parallel electric field, results in significant structuring of
the ion and electron VDFs in the direction parallel to the magnetic field.
Fourier modes representing the length scales between the ion and electron
gyroradii show that energy transfer is resonant in nature, localized in
velocity space to the Landau resonances for each Fourier mode. The energy
transfer closely follows the Landau resonant velocities with varying
perpendicular wavenumber $k_\perp$ and plasma $\beta$. This resonant signature,
consistent with Landau damping, is observed in all diagnosed Fourier modes that
cover the dissipation range of the simulation.

  We address these problems by proposing an advanced code recommendation tool

performance at around 2% error rate, it is interesting to investigate
alternative approaches. The approach detailed in this paper looks at using
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) to learn a latent space representation of
genuine signatures. This is then used to pass unlabelled signatures such that
only the genuine ones will successfully be reconstructed by the VAE. This
latent space representation and the reconstruction loss is subsequently used by
random forest and kNN classifiers for prediction. Subsequently, VAE
disentanglement and the possibility of posterior collapse are ascertained and
analysed. The final results suggest that while this method performs less well
than existing alternatives, further work may allow this to be used as part of
an ensemble for future models.

objective to basically simulate and understand the concept of visual attention
system in adults. Consequently, the impact of observer's age in scene viewing
behavior has rarely been considered. This study quantitatively analyzed the
age-related differences in gaze landings during scene viewing for three
different class of images: naturals, man-made, and fractals. Observer's of
different age-group have shown different scene viewing tendencies independent
to the class of the image viewed. Several interesting observations are drawn
from the results. First, gaze landings for man-made dataset showed that whereas
child observers focus more on the scene foreground, i.e., locations that are
near, elderly observers tend to explore the scene background, i.e., locations
farther in the scene. Considering this result a framework is proposed in this
paper to quantitatively measure the depth bias tendency across age groups.
Second, the quantitative analysis results showed that children exhibit the
lowest exploratory behavior level but the highest central bias tendency among
the age groups and across the different scene categories. Third,
inter-individual similarity metrics reveal that an adult had significantly
lower gaze consistency with children and elderly compared to other adults for
all the scene categories. Finally, these analysis results were consequently
leveraged to develop a more accurate age-adapted saliency model independent to
the image type. The prediction accuracy suggests that our model fits better to
the collected eye-gaze data of the observers belonging to different age groups
than the existing models do.

to crops and weeds to reduce their environmental impact and increase financial
returns. One way to improve efficacy is by enhancing foliar penetration. The
plant leaf cuticle is the most significant barrier to agrochemical diffusion
within the leaf. It has been noted that a comprehensive set of mechanisms for
ionic active ingredient penetration through plant leaves with surfactants is
not well defined and oils that enhance penetration have been given little
attention. The importance of a mechanistic mathematical model has been noted
previously in the literature. Two mechanistic mathematical models have been
previously developed by the authors, focusing on plant cuticle penetration of
calcium chloride through tomato fruit cuticles. The models included ion binding
and evaporation with hygroscopic water absorption, along with the ability to
vary the active ingredient concentration and type, relative humidity and plant
species. Here we further develop these models to include lipophilic adjuvant
effects, as well as the adsorption and desorption of compounds on the cuticle
surface with a novel Adaptive Competitive Langmuir model. These modifications
to a penetration model provide a novel addition to the literature. We validate
our theoretical model results against appropriate experimental data, discuss
key sensitivities and relate theoretical predictions to physical mechanisms.
The results indicate the addition of the desorption mechanism may be one way to
predict increased penetration at late times and the sensitivity of model
parameters compares wells to those present in the literature.

Language (OWL), of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard to
define business process models, and we demonstrate that any BPMN model can be
serialized as OWL file. Based on ontological analysis and a corresponding
definition of a modeling notation as ontology we show that business process
models can be transformed from one notation into another one as long as there
are common underlying concepts; this is demonstrated with the case of an actor
based, or subject-oriented, view on business processes. Furthermore, a
reference architecture for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) based on
microservices is discussed which is capable of executing actor based business
process models. As a transformation of BPMN models into the actor based view is
generally possible, also BPMN models could be enacted. As a result, we can
conclude that the actor system is a promising way to stimulate new ways to
design workflow management systems and to design business process modeling
languages which are more comfortable to use by non-experts without losing
necessary expressiveness. Another result is that an ontology is a productive
way to define a modeling notation as it can be used as knowledge base, it is a
formal conceptualization of the underlying notions, and can be semantically
enriched for further use.

featuring large-scale analyses, have produced deeper knowledge about this
phenomenon, showing that misleading information spreads faster, deeper and more
broadly than factual information on social media, where echo chambers,
algorithmic and human biases play an important role in diffusion networks.
Following these directions, we explore the possibility of classifying news
articles circulating on social media based exclusively on a topological
analysis of their diffusion networks. To this aim we collected a large dataset
of diffusion networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles published on two
distinct classes of sources, namely outlets that convey mainstream, reliable
and objective information and those that fabricate and disseminate various
kinds of misleading articles, including false news intended to harm, satire
intended to make people laugh, click-bait news that may be entirely factual or
rumors that are unproven. We carried out an extensive comparison of these
networks using several alignment-free approaches including basic network
properties, centrality measures distributions, and network distances. We
accordingly evaluated to what extent these techniques allow to discriminate
between the networks associated to the aforementioned news domains. Our results
highlight that the communities of users spreading mainstream news, compared to
those sharing misleading news, tend to shape diffusion networks with subtle yet
systematic differences which might be effectively employed to identify
misleading and harmful information.

world applications such as autonomous driving. As a newly-developed media
format which is characterized by complexity and irregularity, point cloud
creates a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing
codecs. Recently, autoencoders(AEs) have shown their effectiveness in many
visual analysis tasks as well as image compression, which inspires us to employ
it in point cloud compression. In this paper, we propose a general
autoencoder-based architecture for lossy geometry point cloud compression. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first autoencoder-based geometry
compression codec that directly takes point clouds as input rather than voxel
grids or collections of images. Compared with handcrafted codecs, this approach
adapts much more quickly to previously unseen media contents and media formats,
meanwhile achieving competitive performance. Our architecture consists of a
pointnet-based encoder, a uniform quantizer, an entropy estimation block and a
nonlinear synthesis transformation module. In lossy geometry compression of
point cloud, results show that the proposed method outperforms the test model
for categories 1 and 3 (TMC13) published by MPEG-3DG group on the 125th
