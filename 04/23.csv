quench dynamics near a quantum phase transition. Here, we demonstrate that the
decay and revival of the Loschmidt echo follows power-law scaling in the system
size and the distance from a critical point with equilibrium critical
exponents. We reveal such dynamical scaling laws by analyzing relevant
perturbations to the Loschmidt echo cast in a scaling invariant form. We
confirm the validity and the generality of the predicted dynamical scaling laws
with a diverse range of critical models such as Ising spin models with a short
and long range interaction, a finite-component system phase transition, and a
topological phase transition. Moreover, using the integrability of systems in
the thermodynamic limit, we derive such scaling laws analytically from a
microscopic analysis. Our finding promotes the Loschmidt echo to a quantitative
non-equilibrium probe of criticality and allows for quantitative predictions on
the role of criticality on various physical scenarios where the Loschmidt echo
is central to describing non-equilibrium dynamics.

  Unit Recognition","Accepted by AAAI2019 as oral presentation",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facial action unit (AU) recognition is a crucial task for facial expressions
analysis and has attracted extensive attention in the field of artificial
intelligence and computer vision. Existing works have either focused on
designing or learning complex regional feature representations, or delved into
various types of AU relationship modeling. Albeit with varying degrees of
progress, it is still arduous for existing methods to handle complex
situations. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate the semantic
relationship propagation between AUs in a deep neural network framework to
enhance the feature representation of facial regions, and propose an AU
semantic relationship embedded representation learning (SRERL) framework.
Specifically, by analyzing the symbiosis and mutual exclusion of AUs in various
facial expressions, we organize the facial AUs in the form of structured
knowledge-graph and integrate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) in a
multi-scale CNN framework to propagate node information through the graph for
generating enhanced AU representation. As the learned feature involves both the
appearance characteristics and the AU relationship reasoning, the proposed
model is more robust and can cope with more challenging cases, e.g.,
illumination change and partial occlusion. Extensive experiments on the two
public benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous work and
achieves state of the art performance.

on solid surfaces. From the emulation of 1-D quantum phases to the potential
realization of Majorana edge states, spin chains are unique systems to study.
The advent of scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) based techniques has
permitted us to engineer spin chains in an atom-by-atom fashion via atom
manipulation and to access their spin states on the ultimate atomic scale.
Here, we present the current state of research on spin correlations and
dynamics of atomic spin chains as studied by the STM. After a brief review of
the main properties of spin chains on solid surfaces, we classify spin chains
according to the coupling of their magnetic moments with the holding substrate.
This classification scheme takes into account that the nature and lifetimes of
the spin-chain excitation intrinsically depend on the holding substrate. We
first show the interest of using insulating layers on metals, which generally
results in an increase in the spin state's lifetimes such that their quantized
nature gets evident and they are individually accessible. Next, we show that
the use of semiconductor substrates promises additional control through the
tunable electron density via doping. When the coupling to the substrate is
increased for spin chains on metals, the substrate conduction electron mediated
interactions can lead to emergent exotic phases of the coupled spin
chain-substrate conduction electron system. A particularly interesting example
is furnished by superconductors. Magnetic impurities induce states in the
superconducting gap. Due to the extended nature of the spin chain, the in-gap
states develop into bands that can lead to the emergence of 1-D topological
superconductivity and, consequently to the appearance of Majorana edge states.

systems may inadvertently discriminate against members of underrepresented
populations have grown. With the goal of understanding fundamental principles
that underpin the growing number of approaches to mitigating algorithmic
discrimination, we investigate the role of information in fair prediction. A
common strategy for decision-making uses a predictor to assign individuals a
risk score; then, individuals are selected or rejected on the basis of this
score. In this work, we study a formal framework for measuring the information
content of predictors. Central to this framework is the notion of a refinement,
first studied by Degroot and Fienberg. Intuitively, a refinement of a predictor
$z$ increases the overall informativeness of the predictions without losing the
information already contained in $z$. We show that increasing information
content through refinements improves the downstream selection rules across a
wide range of fairness measures (e.g. true positive rates, false positive
rates, selection rates). In turn, refinements provide a simple but effective
tool for reducing disparity in treatment and impact without sacrificing the
utility of the predictions. Our results suggest that in many applications, the
perceived ""cost of fairness"" results from an information disparity across
populations, and thus, may be avoided with improved information.

the model features an interplay of thermal production along with sizeable
contribution through feeble decay of associated dark fermionic partner, which
finally freezes out to the right relic density for a wide range of masses and
couplings. Apart from the fermionic dark matter candidate, the model introduces
two charged partners, one fermionic and another scalar, which often have
delayed decays leading to distinct characteristics of such long-lived particles
(LLP) in the colliders like the LHC. Our analysis shows that within the present
scenario, LLP of decay length that could be probed at the LHC experiments are
compatible with dark matter masses ranging from a few GeV to close to a TeV, as
opposed to the requirement of keV-MeV dark matter in simple FIMP scenarios with
LLP. In addition, the model presents hitherto unexplored interesting
possibilities in the LLP searches, like (i) LLP to LLP to SM cascade decays,
which could be searched for within the LHC detectors and (ii) heavy neutral
particle decaying within MATHUSLA with two jets and large missing energy. A
supplementary aspect of the model is the presence of a heavy neutrino

may include choice points causing the protocol to continue along different
paths. In this paper we address the problem of representing choice in the
strand space model of cryptographic protocols, particularly as it is used in
the Maude-NPA cryptographic protocol analysis tool. To achieve this goal, we
develop and give formal semantics to a process algebra for cryptographic
protocols that supports a rich taxonomy of choice primitives for composing
strand spaces. In our taxonomy, deterministic and non-deterministic choices are
broken down further. Non-deterministic choice can be either explicit, i.e., one
of two paths is chosen, or implicit, i.e., the value of a variable is chosen
non-deterministically. Likewise, deterministic choice can be either an explicit
if-then-else choice, i.e., one path is chosen if a predicate is satisfied,
while the other is chosen if it is not, or implicit deterministic choice, i.e.,
execution continues only if a certain pattern is matched. We have identified a
class of choices which includes finite branching and some cases of infinite
branching, which we address in this paper. We provide a bisimulation result
between the expected forwards execution semantics of the new process algebra
and the original symbolic backwards semantics of Maude-NPA that preserves
attack reachability. We have fully integrated the process algebra syntax and
its transformation into strands in Maude-NPA. We illustrate its expressive
power and naturalness with various examples, and show how it can be effectively
used in formal analysis. This allows users to write protocols from now on using
the process syntax, which is more convenient for expressing choice than the
strand space syntax, in which choice can only be specified implicitly, via two
or more strands that are identical until the choice point.

contributions are made by a small called group of around 20% of the development
team. Most prior studies deprecate a reliance on such a small inner group of
""heroes"", arguing that it causes bottlenecks in development and communication.
Despite this, such projects are very common in open source projects. So what
exactly is the impact of ""heroes"" in code quality?
  Herbsleb argues that if code is strongly connected yet their developers are
not, then that code will be buggy. To test the Hersleb hypothesis, we develop
and apply two metrics of (a) ""social-ness'""and (b) ""hero-ness"" that measure (a)
how much one developer comments on the issues of another; and (b) how much one
developer changes another developer's code (and ""heroes"" are those that change
the most code, all around the system). In a result endorsing the Hersleb
hypothesis, in over 1000 open source projects, we find that ""social-ness"" is a
statistically stronger indicate for code quality (number of bugs) than
""hero-ness"".
  Hence we say that debates over the merits of ""hero-ness"" is subtly misguided.
Our results suggest that the real benefits of these so-called ""heroes"" is not
so much the code they generate but the pattern of communication required when
the interaction between a large community of programmers passes through a small
group of centralized developers. To say that another way, to build better code,
build better communication flows between core developers and the rest.

asymmetries produced at early times (in the relativistic regime) are relevant,
if they are protected from washout. This can occur for weak washout or when the
asymmetry is partly protected by being transferred to spectator fields. We thus
study the relevance of relativistic effects for leptogenesis in a minimal
seesaw model with two sterile neutrinos in the strongly hierarchical limit.
Starting from first principles, we derive a set of momentum-averaged fluid
equations to calculate the final $B-L$ asymmetry as a function of the washout
strength and for different initial conditions at order one accuracy. For this,
we take the leading fluid approximation for the relativistic $CP$-even and odd
rates. Assuming that spectator fields remain in chemical equilibrium, we find
that for weak washout, relativistic corrections lead to a sign flip and an
enhancement of the asymmetry for a vanishing initial abundance of sterile
neutrinos. As an example for the effect of partially equilibrated spectators,
we consider bottom-Yukawa and weak-sphaleron interactions in leptogenesis
driven by sterile neutrinos with masses $\gtrsim 5\times10^{12}$ GeV. For a
vanishing initial abundance of sterile neutrinos, this can give rise to another
flip and an absolute enhancement of the final asymmetry in the strong washout
regime by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the cases either without
spectators or with fully equilibrated ones. These effects are less pronounced
for thermal initial conditions for the sterile neutrinos. The $CP$-violating
source in the relativistic regime at early times is important as it is
proportional to the product of lepton-number violating and lepton-number
conserving rates, and therefore less suppressed than an extrapolation of the
nonrelativistic approximations may suggest.

robustness means that small perturbations to an input do not cause the network

verifying robustness properties of neural networks. Our method synergistically
combines gradient-based optimization methods for counterexample search with
abstraction-based proof search to obtain a sound and ({\delta}-)complete
decision procedure. Our method also employs a data-driven approach to learn a
verification policy that guides abstract interpretation during proof search. We
have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called Charon and
experimentally evaluated it on hundreds of benchmarks. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art

astrophysical environment with an extremely high neutron flux over a short
amount of time ($\sim$ seconds), creating very neutron-rich nuclei that are
subsequently transformed to stable nuclei via $\beta^-$ decay. One key
ingredient to large-scale $r$-process reaction networks is radiative
neutron-capture ($n,\gamma$) rates, for which there exist virtually no data for
extremely neutron-rich nuclei involved in the $r$ process. Due to the current
status of nuclear-reaction theory and our poor understanding of basic nuclear
properties such as level densities and average $\gamma$-decay strengths,
theoretically estimated ($n,\gamma$) rates may vary by orders of magnitude and
represent a major source of uncertainty in any nuclear-reaction network
calculation of $r$-process abundances. In this review, we discuss new
approaches to provide information on neutron-capture cross sections and
reaction rates relevant to the $r$ process. In particular, we focus on
indirect, experimental techniques to measure radiative neutron-capture rates.
While direct measurements are not available at present, but could possibly be

practical threat is the ADS-B spoofing attack that targets the ADS-B ground

is important for cloud service providers to optimize the expense for running
the infrastructure as well. Despite many technological advances in related
areas, however, it is still the case that the infrastructure providers must
decide hardware configuration before deploying a cloud infrastructure,
especially from the storage's perspective. This static nature of the storage
provisioning practice can cause many problems in meeting tenant requirements,
which often come later into the picture. In this paper, we propose a system
called IOArbiter that enables the dynamic creation of underlying storage
implementation in the cloud. IOArbiter defers storage provisioning to the time
at which a tenant actually requests a storage space. As a result, an underlying

satisfy a number of different tenant demands, which may not be possible with a

common in the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets. In this study, using the
photochemical, microphysical, and transmission spectrum models for close-in
warm ($\lesssim$ 1000 K) exoplanet atmospheres that we newly developed in our
preceding paper (Kawashima & Ikoma 2018), we investigate the vertical
distributions of haze particles and gaseous species and the resultant
transmission spectra over wide ranges of the model parameters including UV
irradiation intensity, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O), eddy
diffusion coefficient, and temperature. The sensitivity to metallicity is of
particular interest. We find that a rise in metallicity leads basically to
reducing the photodissociation rates of the hydrocarbons and therefore the haze
monomer production rates. This is due to an enhanced photon-shielding effect by
the major photon absorbers such as $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$,
$\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$, existing at higher altitudes than the
hydrocarbons. We also find that at relatively short wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 2-3
$\mu$m), the absorption features in transmission spectra are most pronounced
for moderate metallicities such as 100 times the solar metallicity, whereas the
lower the metallicity the stronger the absorption features at relatively long
wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 2-3 $\mu$m), where the contribution of haze is small.
These are because of the two competing effects of reduced haze production rate
and atmospheric scale height for higher metallicities. For the other model
parameters, we show that stronger absorption features appear in transmission
spectra of the atmospheres with lower UV irradiation, lower C/O ratio, higher
eddy diffusion coefficient, and higher temperature.

low-luminosity galaxies (ULLGs) at high redshift, where the most metal-poor GCs

have too low masses to form GCs with initial masses $M_{\rm i}\gtrsim10^5~{\rm

mass-metallicity relation into a maximum initial cluster mass-metallicity
relation for $[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]\lesssim-1.8$, which naturally leads to the
observed colour-magnitude relation of metal-poor GCs at $z=0$ (the `blue
tilt'). Its strength traces the slope of the gas phase mass-metallicity
relation of ULLGs. Based on the observed blue tilt of GCs in the Virgo and
Fornax Clusters, the galaxy mass-metallicity relation is predicted to have a
slope of $\alpha=0.4\pm0.1$ for $10^5\lesssim M_\star/{\rm

more massive than the Milky Way, whereas GCs in low-mass galaxies such as the

Illustris simulation, we compare these systematic biases with the statistical
error budget from a forecasted weak gravitational lensing measurement. If the
redshift-dependent galaxy-dark matter bias model is mis-specified, redshift
inference can be biased. This can propagate into relative biases in the weak
lensing convergence power spectrum on the 10% - 30% level. We, therefore,
showcase a methodology to detect these sources of error using Bayesian model
selection techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the improvements that can be
gained from incorporating prior information from Bayesian template fitting into
the model, both in redshift prediction accuracy and in the detection of
systematic modeling biases.

years in connection with integrable string worldsheet theories. At the level of
the worldsheet, the algebraic structure underpinning these connections is made
manifest with the $\mathcal{E}$-model, a first order Hamiltonian description of
the string. The $\mathcal{E}$-model shares many similarities with Double Field
Theory (DFT). We report on recent progress in establishing a precise linkage
with DFT as the target space description of the $\mathcal{E}$-model. There are
three important outcomes of this endeavor:
  1) PL symmetry is made manifest at the level of (generalized) supergravity in
DFT.
  2) PL symmetric target spaces are described by a set of generalized frame
fields that encode consistent truncations of supergravity.
  3) PL dualisation rules are made explicit and are readily extended to include
the R/R sector of the type II theory.
  These general results are put into context with their application to the the
integrable Yang-Baxter model ($\eta$-deformation). This extended proceedings

Dark matter $\chi_1$ that scatters inelastically off elements in the Earth is

sidereal-daily modulation due to the daily rotation of the Earth and
anisotropies in the problem: the dark matter wind comes from the direction of
Cygnus due to the Sun's motion relative to the galaxy, and the rock overburden
is anisotropic, as is the dark matter scattering angle. This allows outstanding
separation of signal from backgrounds. We investigate the sensitivity of two
classes of large underground detectors to this modulating photon line signal:
large liquid scintillator neutrino experiments, including Borexino and JUNO,
and the proposed large gaseous scintillator directional detection experiment
CYGNUS. Borexino's (JUNO's) sensitivity exceeds the bounds from xenon

massive star evolution. As is well known from observations of SN1987A,
neutrinos provide information on the physical conditions responsible for
neutron star formation and on the supernova explosion mechanism. However, there
is still no complete understanding of the long-term evolution of neutrino
emission in supernova explosions, although there are a number of modern
simulations of neutrino radiation hydrodynamics, which study neutrino emission
at times less than one second after the bounce. In the present work we
systematically calculate the number of neutrinos that can be observed in
Super-Kamiokande over periods longer than ten seconds using the database of
Nakazato et al. (2013) anticipating that neutrinos from a Galactic supernova
can be detected for several tens of seconds. We find that for a supernova at a
distance of 10 kpc, neutrinos remain observable for longer than 30 s for a
low-mass neutron star ($1.20M_\odot$ gravitational mass) and even longer than
100 s for a high-mass neutron star ($2.05M_\odot$). These scenarios are much
longer than the observations of SN1987A and longer than the duration of
existing numerical simulations. We propose a new analysis method based on the
cumulative neutrino event distribution as a function of reverse time from the
last observed event, as a useful probe of the neutron star mass. Our result
demonstrates the importance of complete modeling of neutrino light curves in
order to extract physical quantities essential for understanding supernova
explosion mechanisms, such as the mass and radius of the resulting neutron
star.

horizon, scalarised black holes (SBHs) in extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet

illustrative choice of non-minimal coupling, we scan the domain of existence.
For each value of spin, SBHs exist in an interval between two critical masses,
with the lowest one vanishing in the static limit. Non-uniqueness with Kerr BHs
of equal global charges is observed; the SBHs are entropically favoured. This
suggests SBHs form dynamically from the spontaneous scalarisation of Kerr BHs,
which are prone to a scalar-triggered tachyonic instability, below the largest
critical mass. Phenomenologically, the introduction of BH spin damps the
maximal observable difference between comparable scalarised and vacuum BHs. In
the static limit, (perturbatively stable) SBHs can store over 20% of the
spacetime energy outside the event horizon; in comparison with Schwarzschild
BHs, their geodesic frequency at the ISCO can differ by a factor of 2.5 and
deviations in the shadow areal radius may top 40%. As the BH spin grows, low
mass SBHs are excluded, and the maximal relative differences decrease, becoming
of order $\sim$ few % for dimensionless spin $j\gtrsim 0.5$. This reveals a
spin selection effect: non-GR effects are only significant for low spin. We
discuss if and how the recently measured shadow size of the M87 supermassive
BH, constrains the length scale of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.

confirmed, this large diversity in the MW satellite population poses a serious
test for the structure formation theory with possible implications for the DM

the combined effects of subhalo tidal disruption by the MW disk and strong

a novel solution to explain the diversity of MW satellites based on the
gravothermal collapse of SIDM haloes. This solution requires a
velocity-dependent cross section that predicts a bimodal distribution of cuspy
dense (collapsed) subhaloes consistent with the ultra-faint satellites, and
cored lower density subhaloes consistent with the brighter satellites.

first derive analytic upper limits on the velocity-independent DM-baryon

achieved for a resolution of a few km. Using Eulerian and Lagrangian codes we
show that a converged and resolved ignition is obtained for pure CO in this

codes agree to within 1% and convergence is obtained at resolutions of several
km. We calculate the case that includes He and obtain a similar slow
convergence, but find that it is due to a boundary numerical artifact that can

with resolution of $\sim10\,\textrm{km}$ in an agreement with the claims of
K13. It is likely that the slow convergence obtained by KZ19 in this case is
because of a similar boundary numerical artifact, but we are unable to verify
this. KZ19 further recommended to avoid the use of the burning limiter
introduced by K13. We show that their recommendation is not justified.

elemental Bismuth become unstable toward superconducting pairing formation when
coupled to the charge or magnetic fluctuations. The latter gives rise to
pairing instability in chiral channels $d_{xy}\pm i d_{x^2-y^2}$, as has been
observed recently in epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer system at relatively high
temperature, while the former favors a pairing with zero total angular
momentum. Motivated by this observation we study the vortex bound states in
these superconducting states. We consider a minimal model describing the
superconductivity in the presence of a vortex in the superconducting order
parameter. We show that zero-energy states appear in the spectrum of the vortex
core for all pairing symmetries. Our findings may facilitate the observation of
Majorana modes bounded to the vortices in heterostructures with no need for a
proximity-induced superconductivity and relatively large value of $\Delta/E_F$.

$k$-DLA the model where the particles move only in $k$ possible directions. We
study the biased DLA model from the perspective of Computational Complexity,
defining two decision problems The first problem is Prediction, whose input is
a site of the grid $c$ and a sequence $S$ of walks, representing the
trajectories of a set of particles. The question is whether a particle stops at
site $c$ when sequence $S$ is realized. The second problem is Realization,
where the input is a set of positions of the grid, $P$. The question is whether
there exists a sequence $S$ that realizes $P$, i.e. all particles of $S$
exactly occupy the positions in $P$. Our aim is to classify the Prediciton and

Prediction is P-Complete for 2-DLA (thus for 3-DLA). Later, we show that
Prediction can be solved much more efficiently for 1-DLA. In fact, we show that
in that case the problem is NL-Complete. With respect to Realization, we show
that restricted to 2-DLA the problem is in P, while in the 1-DLA case, the

mechanism provides a simple alternative to the standard thermal WIMP scenario.
In this work, we consider a popular $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard
model (SM) in the context of inverse seesaw mechanism which has at least one
(fermionic) FIMP DM candidate. Due to the added $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry, a SM
gauge singlet fermion, with mass of order keV, is stable and can be a warm DM
candidate. Also, the same $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry helps the lightest
right-handed neutrino, with mass of order GeV, to be a stable or long-lived
particle by making a corresponding Yukawa coupling very small. This provides a
possibility of a two component DM scenario as well. Firstly, in the absence of
a GeV DM component (i.e., without tuning its corresponding Yukawa coupling to
be very small), we consider only a keV DM as a single component DM, which is
produced by the freeze-in mechanism via the decay of the extra $Z'$ gauge boson
associated to $U(1)_{B-L}$ and can consistently explain the DM relic density
measurements. In contrast with most of the existing literature, we have found a
reasonable DM production from the annihilation processes. After numerically
studying the DM production, we show the dependence of the DM relic density as a
function of its relevant free parameters. We use these results to obtain the
parameter space regions that are compatible with the DM relic density bound.
Secondly, we study a two component DM scenario and emphasize that the current
DM relic density bound can be satisfied for a wide range of parameter space.

prominent gamma-ray emission. Given a variety of possible emission components
contributing to the gamma-ray emission, we employ a Bayesian inference to build
the most probable fitting model. The analysis confidently revealed
contributions from nuclear deexcitation lines, electron-positron annihilation
line at 511 keV, and a neutron capture line at 2.223 MeV along with two
components of the bremsstrahlung continuum. The revealed time evolution of the
spectral components is particularly interesting. The low-energy bremsstrahlung
continuum shows a soft-hard-soft pattern typical for impulsive flares, while
the high-energy one shows a persistent hardening at the course of the flare.
The neutron capture line emission shows an unusually short time delay relative
to the nuclear deexcitation line component, which implies that the production
of neutrons was significantly reduced soon after the event onset. This in turn
may imply a prominent softening of the accelerated proton spectrum at the
course of the flare, similar to the observed softening of the low-energy
component of the accelerated electrons responsible for the low-energy
bremsstrahlung continuum. We discuss possible physical scenarios, which might

  Seismic Data Acquired in Iraq","22 pages and 17 Figures with 5 Tables",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Noises are common events in seismic reflection data that have very striking
features in seismograms, affecting seismic data processing and interpretation.
Noise attenuation is an essential phase in seismic processing data, usually
resulting in seismic interpretation improvement that enhances the signal to
noise ratio. Groundroll presence is the major fashion of significant noise in
the land seismic survey. It is a type of coherent noise present in seismograms
that appears as linear events, in most cases overlapping the reflections and
probably making it challenging to recognize. There are several domains used in
noise attenuation, Domain transformations is a complex algorithms standard tool
used commonly used during processing of seismic data and imaging processing, So
a large number methods have been developed to attenuate these types of noise.
In the time-offset domain, the noise wave such as Groundroll and random noises,
overlap each other over time; a different domain makes it easier to
successfully isolate coherent, random noise and reflection events. Five steps
are introduced to attenuate coherent and random noise, these steps are FDNAT,
AGORA, RADMX, SCFIL, DDMED as well as Time-Variant band-pass Filter. The
results indicate that the different domains can actually reveal features and
geological structures that have been masked by the noises present in current
data. because encourage significant improvements in the final image quality in
2-D seismic section, so, these filtering techniques possibly give advantage to
the interpreter in particularly in structural and stratigraphic interpretation
during the work of interpretation, especially in the exploration and
characterizing possible traps.

Mergers between clusters produce gas compression and motions which can increase
the magnetic field strength. In this work, we perform high-resolution
non-radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of binary galaxy cluster mergers
with magnetic fields, to examine the effects of these motions on the magnetic
field configuration and strength, as well as the effect of the field on the gas
itself. Our simulations sample a parameter space of initial mass ratios and
impact parameters. During the first core passage of mergers, the magnetic
energy increases via gas compression. After this, shear flows produce
temporary, Mpc-scale, strong-field ""filament"" structures. Lastly, magnetic
fields grow stronger by turbulence. Field amplification is most effective for
low mass ratio mergers, but mergers with a large impact parameter can increase
the magnetic energy more via shearing motions. The amplification of the
magnetic field is most effective in between the first two core passages of each
cluster merger. After the second core passage, the magnetic energy in this
region gradually decreases. In general, the transfer of energy from gas motions
to the magnetic field is not significant enough to have a substantial effect on
gas mixing and the subsequent increase in entropy which occurs in cluster cores
as a result. In the absence of radiative cooling, this results in an overall
decrease of the magnetic field strength in cluster cores. In these regions, the
final magnetic field is isotropic, while it can be significantly tangential at
larger radii.

star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-N field at 1.5<z<3. We revisit here this

between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is preserved when taking into
account the wide range of attenuation parameters. However, an additional
degeneracy, regarding the effective attenuation law, is added to the standard
loci of star-forming galaxies in the UVJ diagram. A simple phenomenological
model with an age-dependent extinction (at fixed dust composition) is
compatible with the observed trend between Rv and B, whereby the opacity
decreases with the age of the populations, resulting in a weaker NUV bump when
the overall attenuation is shallower (greyer). In addition, we compare the
constraints obtained by the SHARDS sample with dust models from the literature,
supporting a scenario where geometry could potentially drive the correlation

segmentation methods. However, existing segmentation methods do not attempt to
reduce HD directly. In this paper, we present novel loss functions for training
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation methods with the goal of
reducing HD directly. We propose three methods to estimate HD from the
segmentation probability map produced by a CNN. One method makes use of the
distance transform of the segmentation boundary. Another method is based on
applying morphological erosion on the difference between the true and estimated
segmentation maps. The third method works by applying circular/spherical
convolution kernels of different radii on the segmentation probability maps.
Based on these three methods for estimating HD, we suggest three loss functions
that can be used for training to reduce HD. We use these loss functions to
train CNNs for segmentation of the prostate, liver, and pancreas in ultrasound,
magnetic resonance, and computed tomography images and compare the results with
commonly-used loss functions. Our results show that the proposed loss functions
can lead to approximately 18-45 % reduction in HD without degrading other
segmentation performance criteria such as the Dice similarity coefficient. The
proposed loss functions can be used for training medical image segmentation
methods in order to reduce the large segmentation errors.

safety of people, however, it is a challenging task owing to the wide
variations in shape, size, and appearance of firearms. Also, most of the
generic object detectors process axis-aligned rectangular areas though, a thin
and long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the
rest may contain irrelevant details suppressing the required object signatures.
To handle these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised Orientation Aware
Object Detection (OAOD) algorithm which learns to detect oriented object
bounding boxes (OBB) while using AxisAligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for
training. The proposed OAOD is different from the existing oriented object
detectors which strictly require OBB during training which may not always be
present. The goal of training on AABB and detection of OBB is achieved by
employing a multistage scheme, with Stage-1 predicting the AABB and Stage-2
predicting OBB. In-between the two stages, the oriented proposal generation
module along with the object aligned RoI pooling is designed to extract
features based on the predicted orientation and to make these features
orientation invariant. A diverse and challenging dataset consisting of eleven
thousand images is also proposed for firearm detection which is manually
annotated for firearm classification and localization. The proposed ITU Firearm
dataset (ITUF) contains a wide range of guns and rifles. The OAOD algorithm is
evaluated on the ITUF dataset and compared with current state-of-the-art object
detectors, including fully supervised oriented object detectors. OAOD has
outperformed both types of object detectors with a significant margin. The
experimental results (mAP: 88.3 on AABB & mAP: 77.5 on OBB) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for firearm detection.

technique of kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography these new probes can
be combined to reconstruct the remote dipole field, the CMB dipole as observed
from different vantage points in our Universe. The volume accessible to future
galaxy surveys is large enough that general relativistic corrections to the
observed distribution of galaxies must be taken into account. These corrections
are interesting probes of gravity in their own right, but can also obscure
potential signatures of primordial non-Gaussianity. In this paper, we
demonstrate that correlations between the reconstructed remote dipole field and
the observed galaxy number counts can in principle be used to detect general
relativistic corrections. We show that neglecting general relativistic
corrections leads to an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ bias on the inferred amplitude of
primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$. In addition, we demonstrate that the
reconstructed remote dipole field can provide useful constraining power on
various bias parameters appearing in the galaxy number counts, and can
significantly mitigate the effects of alignment bias.

reveals both a significant amount of dust at the SN location, as well as
residual star formation and a high proportion of old stellar populations in the

problems, and if the solution of the SDP obeys certain rank constraints, the
relaxation will be tight. Decomposition methods based on chordal sparsity have
already been applied to speed up the solution of sparse SDPs, but methods for
dealing with rank constraints are underdeveloped. This paper leverages a
minimum rank completion result to decompose the rank constraint on a single
large matrix into multiple rank constraints on a set of smaller matrices. The
re-weighted heuristic is used as a proxy for rank, and the specific form of the
heuristic preserves the sparsity pattern between iterations. Implementations of
rank-minimized SDPs through interior-point and first-order algorithms are
discussed. The problem of subspace clustering is used to demonstrate the
computational improvement of the proposed method.

state-of-the-art performance, but they require ground truth disparity data to
train. As far as I know, this is the first time an unsupervised disparity
fusion not using ground truth disparity data has been proposed. In this paper,
a mathematical model for disparity fusion is proposed to guide an adversarial
network to train effectively without ground truth disparity data. The initial
disparity maps are inputted from the left view along with auxiliary information
(gradient, left & right intensity image) into the refiner and the refiner is
trained to output the refined disparity map registered on the left view. The
refined left disparity map and left intensity image are used to reconstruct a
fake right intensity image. Finally, the fake and real right intensity images
(from the right stereo vision camera) are fed into the discriminator. In the
model, the refiner is trained to output a refined disparity value close to the
weighted sum of the disparity inputs for global initialisation. Then, three
refinement principles are adopted to refine the results further. (1) The
reconstructed intensity error between the fake and real right intensity image
is minimised. (2) The similarities between the fake and real right image in
different receptive fields are maximised. (3) The refined disparity map is
smoothed based on the corresponding intensity image. The adversarial networks'
architectures are effective for the fusion task. The fusion time using the
proposed network is small. The network can achieve 90 fps using Nvidia Geforce
GTX 1080Ti on the Kitti2015 dataset when the input resolution is 1242 * 375
(Width * Height) without downsampling and cropping. The accuracy of this work
is equal to (or better than) the state-of-the-art supervised methods.

overall diagnostic accuracy. For binary classification, maximization of the
empirical estimate of the area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve is widely adopted to produce the optimal linear combination of
multiple biomarkers. In the presence of large number of biomarkers, this method
proves to be computationally expensive and difficult to implement since it
involves maximization of a discontinuous, non-smooth function for which
gradient-based methods cannot be used directly. Complexity of this problem
increases when the classification problem becomes multi-category. In this
article, we develop a linear combination method that maximizes a smooth
approximation of the empirical Hypervolume Under Manifolds (HUM) for
multi-category outcome. We approximate HUM by replacing the indicator function
with the sigmoid function or normal cumulative distribution function (CDF).
With the above smooth approximations, efficient gradient-based algorithms can
be employed to obtain better solution with less computing time. We show that
under some regularity conditions, the proposed method yields consistent
estimates of the coefficient parameters. We also derive the asymptotic
normality of the coefficient estimates. We conduct extensive simulations to
examine our methods. Under different simulation scenarios, the proposed methods
are compared with other existing methods and are shown to outperform them in
terms of diagnostic accuracy. The proposed method is illustrated using two real
medical data sets.

  drawdown of L\'evy insurance risk process",,,,,"q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper discusses the valuation of credit default swaps, where default is
announced when the reference asset price has gone below certain level from the
last record maximum, also known as the high-water mark or drawdown. We assume
that the protection buyer pays premium at fixed rate when the asset price is
above a pre-specified level and continuously pays whenever the price increases.
This payment scheme is in favour of the buyer as she only pays the premium when
the market is in good condition for the protection against financial downturn.
Under this framework, we look at an embedded option which gives the issuer an
opportunity to call back the contract to a new one with reduced premium payment
rate and slightly lower default coverage subject to paying a certain cost. We
assume that the buyer is risk neutral investor trying to maximize the expected
monetary value of the option over a class of stopping time. We discuss optimal
solution to the stopping problem when the source of uncertainty of the asset
price is modelled by L\'evy process with only downward jumps. Using recent
development in excursion theory of L\'evy process, the results are given
explicitly in terms of scale function of the L\'evy process. Furthermore, the
value function of the stopping problem is shown to satisfy continuous and
smooth pasting conditions regardless of regularity of the sample paths of the
L\'evy process. Optimality and uniqueness of the solution are established using
martingale approach for drawdown process and convexity of the scale function
under Esscher transform of measure. Some numerical examples are discussed to
illustrate the main results.

that is difficult to automate. Polynomial fitting requires a reasonably high
order model to follow the steep slope of the blaze function. However, in the
presence of deep spectral lines, a high order polynomial fit can result in
ripples in the normalized continuum that increase errors in spectral analysis.
Here, we present two algorithms for flattening the spectrum continuum. The
Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (AFS) is completely data-driven,
using an alpha shape to obtain an initial estimate of the blaze function. The
Alpha-shape and Lab Source Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (ALSFS) incorporates a
continuum constraint from a lab source reference spectrum for the blaze
function estimation. These algorithms are tested on a simulated spectrum, where
we demonstrate improved normalization compared to polynomial regression for
continuum fitting. We show an additional application, using the algorithms for
mitigation of spatially correlated quantum efficiency variations and fringing
in the CCD detector of the EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES).

design revolving around two pillars, stronger resilience and diversity. The
first pillar, stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called
alive-but-corrupt faults. Alive-but-corrupt replicas may arbitrarily deviate
from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of the protocol. However, if
they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness of the
protocol. Combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, Flexible BFT is
resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault
model. The second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol
transcript is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs.
With this separation, the same Flexible BFT solution supports synchronous and
asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience threshold combinations of
Byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults.
  At a technical level, Flexible BFT achieves the above results using two new
ideas. First, it introduces a synchronous BFT protocol in which only the commit
step requires to know the network delay bound and thus replicas execute the
protocol without any synchrony assumption. Second, it introduces a notion
called Flexible Byzantine Quorums by dissecting the roles of different quorums
in existing consensus protocols.

is almost monotonic along the flow. Inspired by the work of Colding-Minicozzi
on the mean curvature flow, we define an entropy functional and after proving
an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, we show that low entropy initial data lead to
solutions of the flow which exist for all time and converge smoothly to a $G_2$

regular Cartesian grids, which makes it generally unsuitable to study flow
problems on curved surfaces. To alleviate this limitation, we use a vielbein
formalism to write down the Boltzmann equation on an arbitrary geometry, and
solve the evolution of the fluid distribution functions using a finite
difference method. Focussing on the torus geometry as an example of a curved
surface, we demonstrate drift motions of fluid droplets and stripes embedded on
the surface of a torus. Interestingly, they migrate in opposite directions:
fluid droplets to the outer side while fluid stripes to the inner side of the
torus. For the latter we demonstrate that the global minimum configuration is
unique for small stripe widths, but it becomes bistable for large stripe
widths. Our simulations are also in agreement with analytical predictions for
the Laplace pressure of the fluid stripes, and their damped oscillatory motion
as they approach equilibrium configurations, capturing the corresponding decay
timescale and oscillation frequency. Finally, we simulate the coarsening
dynamics of phase separating binary fluids in the hydrodynamics and diffusive
regimes for tori of various shapes, and compare the results against those for a
flat two-dimensional surface. Our lattice Boltzmann scheme can be extended to
other surfaces and coupled to other dynamical equations, opening up a vast
range of applications involving complex flows on curved geometries.

effect in the visible using a thin-film absorber system consisting of a
dielectric film on an absorbing substrate. Polarization by reflection is
realized for both p- and s- polarized light at different angles of incidence

hydrogen gas sensing using a single layer graphene film transferred on a

ultrahigh sensitivity stems from the strong phase sensitivity near point of

thin-films as mere interference optical coatings and highlight its many
potential applications including gas sensing and biosensing.

Resolution of these limitations requires new, sample-efficient methods. To
facilitate research in this direction, we introduce the MineRL Competition on
Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors.
  The primary goal of the competition is to foster the development of
algorithms which can efficiently leverage human demonstrations to drastically
reduce the number of samples needed to solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse
environments. To that end, we introduce: (1) the Minecraft ObtainDiamond task,
a sequential decision making environment requiring long-term planning,
hierarchical control, and efficient exploration methods; and (2) the MineRL-v0
dataset, a large-scale collection of over 60 million state-action pairs of
human demonstrations that can be resimulated into embodied trajectories with
arbitrary modifications to game state and visuals.
  Participants will compete to develop systems which solve the ObtainDiamond
task with a limited number of samples from the environment simulator, Malmo.
The competition is structured into two rounds in which competitors are provided
several paired versions of the dataset and environment with different game
textures. At the end of each round, competitors will submit containerized
versions of their learning algorithms and they will then be trained/evaluated
from scratch on a hold-out dataset-environment pair for a total of 4-days on a
prespecified hardware platform.

network (ORDSR) simplifies the SR task by taking advantage of image transform
domain while adapting the design of transform basis to the training image set.
Experimental results show ORDSR achieves state-of-the-art SR image quality with
fewer parameters than most of the deep CNN methods. A particular success of
ORDSR is in overcoming the artifacts introduced by bicubic interpolation. A key
burden of deep SR has been identified as the requirement of generous training
LR and HR image pairs; ORSDR exhibits a much more graceful degradation as
training size is reduced with significant benefits in the regime of limited
training. Analysis of memory and computation requirements confirms that ORDSR
can allow for a more efficient network with faster inference.

persistent, pointer-based data structures that can offer substantial
performance gains over conventional approaches to managing persistent state.
This programming model removes the file system from the critical path which
improves performance, but it also places these data structures out of reach of
file system-based fault tolerance mechanisms (e.g., block-based checksums or
erasure coding). Without fault-tolerance, using NVMM to hold critical data will
be much less attractive.
  This paper presents Pangolin, a fault-tolerant persistent object library
designed for NVMM. Pangolin uses a combination of checksums, parity, and
micro-buffering to protect an application's objects from both media errors and
corruption due to software bugs. It provides these protections for objects of
any size and supports automatic, online detection of data corruption and
recovery. The required storage overhead is small (1% for gigabyte-sized pools
of NVMM). Pangolin provides stronger protection, requires orders of magnitude
less storage overhead, and achieves comparable performance relative to the
current state-of-the-art fault-tolerant persistent object library.

involving social, financial, road, communication, and smart grid networks. In
many practical situations, the underlying topology might change randomly with
time, due to link failures such as changing friendships, road blocks or sensor
malfunctions. Thus, it leads to poorly controlled dynamics if randomness is not
properly accounted for. We consider the problem of controlling the network
state when the topology varies randomly with time. Our problem concerns target
states that are bandlimited over the graph; these are states that have nonzero
frequency content only on a specific graph frequency band. We thus leverage
graph signal processing and exploit the bandlimited model to drive the network
state from a fixed set of control nodes. When controlling the state from a few
nodes, we observe that spurious, out-of-band frequency content is created.
Therefore, we focus on controlling the network state over the desired frequency
band, and then use a graph filter to get rid of the unwanted frequency content.
To account for the topological randomness, we develop the concept of
controllability in the mean, which consists of driving the expected network
state towards the target state. A detailed mean squared error analysis is
performed to quantify the statistical deviation between the final controlled
state on a particular graph realization and the actual target state. Finally,
we propose different control strategies and evaluate their effectiveness on
synthetic network models and social networks.

It has important consequences for numerous dynamic phenomena in fermionic

assumptions on which the known solution is based---impurity potentials with
finite cross-section and non-interacting fermions---are both highly inaccurate

leaving it unsolved for the most relevant practical applications. In this work

Mathematically, the vortex axis lines are defined by points where the gradient
of Liutex magnitude is aligned with the direction of the Liutex vector, which

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has consequently received intensive attention in

representative work in SSL is Laplacian regularization (LR), which smoothes the
conditional distribution for classification along the manifold encoded in the
graph Laplacian, however, it has been observed that LR biases the
classification function towards a constant function which possibly results in
poor generalization. In addition, LR is developed to handle uniformly

color, shape and texture. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian
regularization (mHR) to address the above two problems in LR-based image
annotation. In particular, mHR optimally combines multiple Hessian
regularizations, each of which is obtained from a particular view of instances,
and steers the classification function which varies linearly along the data

items from a larger set of items based on tests on groups of items, and is
relevant in applications such as medical testing, communication protocols,
pattern matching, and many more. While rigorous group testing algorithms have
long been known with runtime at least linear in the number of items, a recent
line of works has sought to reduce the runtime to ${\rm poly}(k \log n)$, where
$n$ is the number of items and $k$ is the number of defectives. In this paper,
we present such an algorithm for non-adaptive probabilistic group testing
termed {\em bit mixing coding} (BMC), which builds on techniques that encode
item indices in the test matrix, while incorporating novel ideas based on
erasure-correction coding. We show that BMC achieves asymptotically vanishing
error probability with $O(k \log n)$ tests and $O(k^2 \cdot \log k \cdot \log
n)$ runtime, in the limit as $n \to \infty$ (with $k$ having an arbitrary
dependence on $n$). This closes a recently-proposed open problem of
simultaneously achieving ${\rm poly}(k \log n)$ decoding time using $O(k \log
n)$ tests without any assumptions on $k$. In addition, we show that the same
scaling laws can be attained in a commonly-considered noisy setting, in which
each test outcome is flipped with constant probability.

part of the program rather than as a separate resource. This means that
execution can be modelled by just rewriting source code terms, as in semantic
models for functional programs. Formally, this is achieved by the block
construct, introducing local variable declarations, which play the role of
memory when their initializing expressions have been evaluated. In this way, we
obtain a language semantics which directly represents at the syntactic level
constraints on aliasing, allowing simpler reasoning about related properties.
To illustrate this advantage, we consider the issue, widely studied in the
literature, of characterizing an isolated portion of memory, which cannot be
reached through external references. In the syntactic model, closed block
values, called ""capsules"", provide a simple representation of isolated portions
of memory, and capsules can be safely moved to another location in the memory,
without introducing sharing, by means of ""affine' variables. We prove that the
syntactic model can be encoded in the conventional one, hence efficiently
implemented.

extractor, as well as the density and structure of the nodule using a local
feature extractor. Methods: We propose to use Residual Blocks with a 3x3 kernel
size for local feature extraction, and Non-Local Blocks to extract the global
features. The Non-Local Block has the ability to extract global features
without using a huge number of parameters. The key idea behind the Non-Local
Block is to apply matrix multiplications between features on the same feature
maps. Results: We trained and validated the proposed method on the LIDC-IDRI

SATIN, for efficient tracking and accurate localization. Firstly, a new Siamese
lightweight hourglass network is specially designed for visual tracking. It
takes advantage of the benefits of the repeated bottom-up and top-down
inference to capture more global and local contextual information at multiple
scales. Secondly, a novel cross-attentional module is utilized to leverage both
channel-wise and spatial intermediate attentional information, which can
enhance both discriminative and localization capabilities of feature maps.
Thirdly, a keypoints detection approach is invented to trace any target object
by detecting the top-left corner point, the centroid point, and the
bottom-right corner point of its bounding box. Therefore, our SATIN tracker not
only has a strong capability to learn more effective object representations,

behavior, such as global existence in the space $H^1\times H^2$, existence of
super luminal solitons, and lack of a standard stability method to describe

we remove that condition on the power $p$ and prove decay to zero in terms of
the energy space norm $L^2\times H^1$, for any $p>1$, in two almost
complementary regimes: (i) outside the light cone for all small, bounded in

of attack of alpha = 0 (A0) and alpha = 10 (A10) are modelled using resolvent
analysis and limited experimental measurements obtained from particle image
velocimetry. The experimental mean velocity profiles are data-assimilated so
that they are solutions of the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations forced by Reynolds stress terms which are derived from experimental
data. Spectral proper orthogonal decompositions (SPOD) of the velocity
fluctuations and nonlinear forcing find low-rank behaviour at the shedding
frequency and its higher harmonics for the A0 case. In the A10 case, low-rank
behaviour is observed for the velocity fluctuations in two bands of
frequencies. Resolvent analysis of the data-assimilated means identifies
low-rank behaviour only in the vicinity of the shedding frequency for A0 and
none of its harmonics. The resolvent operator for the A10 case, on the other
hand, identifies two linear mechanisms whose frequencies are a close match with
those identified by SPOD. It is also shown that the second linear mechanism,
corresponding to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer, cannot be
identified just by considering the time-averaged experimental measurements as a
mean flow due to the fact that experimental data are missing near the leading
edge. The A0 case is classified as an oscillator where the flow is organised
around an intrinsic instability while the A10 case behaves like an amplifier
whose forcing is unstructured. For both cases, resolvent modes resemble those
from SPOD when the operator is low-rank. To model the higher harmonics where
this is not the case, we add parasitic resolvent modes, as opposed to classical
resolvent modes which are the most amplified, by approximating the nonlinear
forcing from limited triadic interactions of known resolvent modes.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and N2 sorption

slag is accompanied with a transformation of free water to bound water (from
QENS analysis), which directly signals formation of a sodium-containing
aluminum-substituted calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-(N)-A-S-H) gel, as confirmed
by FTIR. In contrast, the Na2SiO3-activated slag sample exhibits two distinct
reaction peaks in the ICC data, where the first reaction peak is associated
with conversion of constrained water to bound and free water, and the second
peak is accompanied with conversion of free water to bound and constrained
water (from QENS analysis). The second conversion is attributed to formation of
the main reaction product (i.e., C-(N)-A-S-H gel) as confirmed by FTIR and N2
sorption data. Analysis of the QENS, FTIR and N2 sorption data together with
thermodynamic information from the literature explicitly shows that the first
reaction peak is associated with the formation of an initial gel (similar to
C-(N)-A-S-H gel) that is governed by the Na+ ions and silicate species in
Na2SiO3 solution and the dissolved Ca/Al species from slag. Hence, this study
exemplifies the power of in situ QENS, when combined with laboratory-based

improving the coverage and rate of future wireless systems. These surfaces
comprise a massive number of nearly-passive elements that interact with the
incident signals, for example by reflecting them, in a smart way that improves
the wireless system performance. Prior work focused on the design of the LIS
reflection matrices assuming full knowledge of the channels. Estimating these
channels at the LIS, however, is a key challenging problem, and is associated
with large training overhead given the massive number of LIS elements. This
paper proposes efficient solutions for these problems by leveraging tools from
compressive sensing and deep learning. First, a novel LIS architecture based on
sparse channel sensors is proposed. In this architecture, all the LIS elements
are passive except for a few elements that are active (connected to the
baseband of the LIS controller). We then develop two solutions that design the
LIS reflection matrices with negligible training overhead. In the first
approach, we leverage compressive sensing tools to construct the channels at
all the LIS elements from the channels seen only at the active elements. These
full channels can then be used to design the LIS reflection matrices with no
training overhead. In the second approach, we develop a deep learning based
solution where the LIS learns how to optimally interact with the incident
signal given the channels at the active elements, which represent the current
state of the environment and transmitter/receiver locations. We show that the
achievable rates of the proposed compressive sensing and deep learning
solutions approach the upper bound, that assumes perfect channel knowledge,

  Technische Universit\""at Darmstadt (Germany)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-task learning has recently become a very active field in deep learning
research. In contrast to learning a single task in isolation, multiple tasks
are learned at the same time, thereby utilizing the training signal of related
tasks to improve the performance on the respective machine learning tasks.
Related work shows various successes in different domains when applying this
paradigm and this thesis extends the existing empirical results by evaluating
multi-task learning in four different scenarios: argumentation mining,
epistemic segmentation, argumentation component segmentation, and
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. We show that multi-task learning can, indeed,
improve the performance compared to single-task learning in all these
scenarios, but may also hurt the performance. Therefore, we investigate the
reasons for successful and less successful applications of this paradigm and
find that dataset properties such as entropy or the size of the label inventory
are good indicators for a potential multi-task learning success and that
multi-task learning is particularly useful if the task at hand suffers from
data sparsity, i.e. a lack of training data. Moreover, multi-task learning is
particularly effective for long input sequences in our experiments. We have
observed this trend in all evaluated scenarios. Finally, we develop a highly
configurable and extensible sequence tagging framework which supports
multi-task learning to conduct our empirical experiments and to aid future
research regarding the multi-task learning paradigm and natural language
processing.

cryptography, are meant to be broken. These cryptograms, generally called
puzzles, require the use of a certain amount of resources to be solved, hence
introducing a cost that is often regarded as a time delay---though it could
involve other metrics as well, such as bandwidth. These powerful features have
made puzzles the core of many security protocols, acquiring increasing
importance in the IT security landscape. The concept of a puzzle has
subsequently been extended to other types of schemes that do not use
cryptographic functions, such as CAPTCHAs, which are used to discriminate
humans from machines. Overall, puzzles have experienced a renewed interest with
the advent of Bitcoin, which uses a CPU-intensive puzzle as proof of work. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of the most important puzzle
construction schemes available in the literature, categorizing them according
to several attributes, such as resource type, verification type, and
applications. We have redefined the term puzzle by collecting and integrating
the scattered notions used in different works, to cover all the existing

to approximate the tensor rank with the $\ell_1-$norm of singular values based
on its Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD). Besides, the sparsity of a

analyze its theoretical properties. Finally, the experiments on natural and

This manuscript proposes a novel framework for predicting forthcoming or

networks is how to predict links in one of the layers, taking into account the
structural information of other layers. The proposed link prediction framework
is based on interlayer similarity and proximity-based features extracted from
the layer for which the link prediction is considered. To this end, commonly
used proximity-based features such as Adamic-Adar and Jaccard Coefficient are
considered. These features that have been originally proposed to predict
missing links in monolayer networks, do not require learning, and thus are
simple to compute. The proposed method introduces a systematic approach to take
into account interlayer similarity for the link prediction purpose.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real multiplex networks reveal the
effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superior performance than
state-of-the-art algorithms proposed for the link prediction problem in
multiplex networks.

theories in the metric-affine (Palatini) formalism of gravity, which we call
scalar-metric-affine theories for short, where the metric and the connection
are independent. We show that the projective symmetry, a local symmetry under a
shift of the connection, can provide a ghost-free structure of

derivative of the scalar is absorbed into the projective gauge mode when the
unitary gauge can be imposed. Incidentally, the connection does not have the
kinetic term in these theories and then it is just an auxiliary field. We can
thus (at least in principle) integrate the connection out and obtain a form of
scalar-tensor theories in the Riemannian geometry. The projective symmetry then
hides in the ghost-free scalar-tensor theories. As an explicit example, we show
the relationship between the quadratic order scalar-metric-affine theory and

be able to identify objects in front of them, but also to be able to estimate
the risk level of the object in front of the vehicle automatically. It is
obvious that different objects have different levels of danger to autonomous
vehicles. An evaluation system is needed to automatically determine the danger
level of the object for the autonomous vehicle. It would be too subjective and
incomplete if the system were completely defined by humans. Based on this, we
propose a framework based on nonparametric Bayesian learning method -- a sticky
hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model(sticky HDP-HMM), and
discover the relationship between driving scenarios and driving styles. We use
the analysis of driving styles of autonomous vehicles to reflect the risk
levels of driving scenarios to the vehicles. In this framework, we firstly use
sticky HDP-HMM to extract driving styles from the dataset and get different
clusters, then an evaluation system is proposed to evaluate and rank the
urgency levels of the clusters. Finally, we map the driving scenarios to the
ranking results and thus get clusters of driving scenarios in different risk
levels. More importantly, we find the relationship between driving scenarios
and driving styles. The experiment shows that our framework can cluster and
rank driving styles of different urgency levels and find the relationship
between driving scenarios and driving styles and the conclusions also fit
people's common sense when driving. Furthermore, this framework can be used for
autonomous vehicles to estimate risk levels of driving scenarios and help them
make precise and safe decisions.

structure of two delocalized wake packets. The single-peaked wave function with
one coherent-squeezed state works well even around the critical regime,

In this work, we overcome these practical and technical challenges with RLC

break reciprocity, by pairing nodal knots with their mirror image partners in a
fully reciprocal setting. Our nodal knot circuits can be characterized with
impedance measurements that resolve their drumhead states and image their 3D

hence knot topological invariants like the Alexander polynomial. We illustrate
our approach with large-scale simulations of various nodal knots and an

respect to the Guillemin-Stenzel K\""{a}hler metric canonically associated with
the Poincar\'e metric on closed hyperbolic real-analytic surfaces, has nowhere
vanishing Cartan CR-curvature. This result provides a wealth of examples of
compact $3$-dimensional Levi nondegenerate CR manifolds having no CR-umbilical
point.
  We provide two proofs utilizing two recent formulas for determining the
Cartan CR-curvature of any local $\mathcal{C}^6$-smooth hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{C}^2$. One was obtained in 2012 by the second named author joint with
Sabzevari, and it is an expanded explicit formula, valid for locally graphed
hypersurfaces, containing millions of terms. The other formula, which we
published in 2018 when studying Webster's ellipsoidal hypersurfaces, is not
expanded, but more suitable for calculations with a hypersurface in
$\mathbb{C}^2$ that is represented as the zero locus of some implicit (but
simple in some sense, e.g. quadratic) defining function.
  We also discuss Grauert tubes constructed with respect to extrinsic metrics
depending on embeddings in complex surfaces, together with a certain
combinatorics of product metrics.

the solutions of linear differential systems and points and derivatives on the

algorithm for dynamic evaluation of exponential polynomial curves and surfaces.
Based on properties that spaces spanned by general exponential polynomials are
translation invariant and polynomial spaces are invariant with respect to a
linear transform of the parameter, the transformation matrices between bases
with or without translated or linearly transformed parameters are explicitly
computed. Points on curves or surfaces with equal or changing parameter steps
can then be evaluated dynamically from a start point using a pre-computed
matrix. Like former dynamic evaluation algorithms, the newly proposed approach
needs only arithmetic operations for evaluating exponential polynomial curves
and surfaces. Unlike conventional numerical methods that solve a linear
differential system, the new method can give robust and accurate evaluation
results for any chosen parameter steps. Basis transformation technique also
enables dynamic evaluation of polynomial curves with changing parameter steps
using a constant matrix, which reduces time costs significantly than computing
each point individually by classical algorithms.

regions with different surface attributes, such as color or material.
Manufacturing such objects in a single piece is often challenging or even
impossible. The alternative is to partition them into single-attribute
volumetric parts that can be fabricated separately and then assembled to form
the target object. Facilitating this approach requires partitioning the input
model into parts that conform to the surface segmentation and that can be moved
apart with no collisions. We propose Surface2Volume, a partition algorithm
capable of producing such assemblable parts, each of which is affiliated with a
single attribute, the outer surface of whose assembly conforms to the input
surface geometry and segmentation. In computing the partition we strictly
enforce conformity with surface segmentation and assemblability, and optimize
for ease of fabrication by minimizing part count, promoting part simplicity,
and simplifying assembly sequencing. We note that computing the desired
partition requires solving for three types of variables: per-part assembly
trajectories, partition topology, i.e. the connectivity of the interface
surfaces separating the different parts, and the geometry, or location, of
these interfaces. We efficiently produce the desired partitions by addressing
one type of variables at a time: first computing the assembly trajectories,
then determining interface topology, and finally computing interface locations
that allow parts assemblability. We algorithmically identify inputs that
necessitate sequential assembly, and partition these inputs gradually by
computing and disassembling a subset of assemblable parts at a time. We
demonstrate our method....

the problem of finding the largest number of multicast communication requests

heterogeneous capacity constraints. This problem generalizes the following two
problems studied in the literature: a) the problem of finding a largest induced
$k$-colorable subgraph of a chordal graph, b) the maximum multi-commodity flow
problem in tree networks.
  The problem is already known to be NP-hard and to admit a $c$-approximation
($c \approx 1.58$) in the case of homogeneous capacity constraints. We first
show that the problem is much harder to approximate in the heterogeneous case.
We then use a generalization of a classical algorithm to obtain an
$M$-approximation where $M$ is the maximum number of leaves of the subtrees
representing the multicast communications. Surprisingly, the same algorithm,
though in various disguises, is used in the literature at least four times to
solve related problems (though the analysis is different).
  The special case of the problem where instances are restricted to unicast
communications in a star topology network is known to be polynomial-time

to the spectra of primary and secondary nuclei requires (1) a break in the
energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient at energies $\sim 300$ GV; (2)
an injection spectrum that is the same for all nuclei heavier than helium, and
different injections for both protons and helium. Moreover, if to force the
injection spectrum of helium to be the same as for heavier nuclei, the fit to
oxygen substantially worsens. Accounting for a small, $X_{s}\sim 0.4~\rm

fit to the B/C ratio but makes the difference between He and other elements

uncertainties in the cross sections of production of secondary nuclei are taken
into account. In order to make this point more quantitative, we present a novel

scientific applications on large scale computing systems. Selective particle
replication (SPR) is proposed herein as the first particle-based replication
method for detecting SDCs in Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations.
SPH is a mesh-free Lagrangian method commonly used to perform hydrodynamical
simulations in astrophysics and computational fluid dynamics. SPH performs
interpolation of physical properties over neighboring discretization points
(called SPH particles) that dynamically adapt their distribution to the mass
density field of the fluid. When a fault (e.g., a bit-flip) strikes the
computation or the data associated with a particle, the resulting error is
silently propagated to all nearest neighbors through such interpolation steps.
SPR replicates the computation and data of a few carefully selected SPH
particles. SDCs are detected when the data of a particle differs, due to
corruption, from its replicated counterpart. SPR is able to detect many DRAM
SDCs as they propagate by ensuring that all particles have at least one
neighbor that is replicated. The detection capabilities of SPR were assessed
through a set of error-injection and detection experiments and the overhead of
SPR was evaluated via a set of strong-scaling experiments conducted on an HPC
system. The results show that SPR achieves detection rates of 91-99.9%, no
false-positives, at an overhead of 1-10%.

based on deeply nested convolutional networks that leverage stereo image pairs
or monocular sequences during a training phase. However, they often exhibit
inaccurate results around occluded regions and depth boundaries. In this paper,
we present a simple yet effective approach for monocular depth estimation using
stereo image pairs. The study aims to propose a student-teacher strategy in
which a shallow student network is trained with the auxiliary information
obtained from a deeper and more accurate teacher network. Specifically, we
first train the stereo teacher network by fully utilizing the binocular
perception of 3-D geometry and then use the depth predictions of the teacher
network to train the student network for monocular depth inference. This
enables us to exploit all available depth data from massive unlabeled stereo
pairs. We propose a strategy that involves the use of a data ensemble to merge
the multiple depth predictions of the teacher network to improve the training
samples by collecting non-trivial knowledge beyond a single prediction. To
refine the inaccurate depth estimation that is used when training the student
network, we further propose stereo confidence-guided regression loss that
handles the unreliable pseudo depth values in occlusion, texture-less region,
and repetitive pattern. To complement the existing dataset comprising outdoor
driving scenes, we built a novel large-scale dataset consisting of one million
outdoor stereo images taken using hand-held stereo cameras. Finally, we
demonstrate that the monocular depth estimation network provides feature
representations that are suitable for high-level vision tasks. The experimental
results for various outdoor scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

highly desirable. The currently available bulk-damage models are not able to
describe simultaneously the measurements of dark current (I-V),

investigated with the Gd-LS sample stored in the passivated stainless steel
bottle in two independent methods. The direct comparison of the neutron capture
time measurement showed that there is no significant degradation of the capture
time after 602 days aging. Titration was performed to measure Gd concentration,
and the result after 466 days aging is consistent with the result before aging
within the uncertainty of the measurement. The upper limit of degradation of Gd

formulated with a gauge theory on loop spaces which is equivalent to the

use the fact that the state space is defined by a projective bundle over the
parametrizing manifold which induces a gerbe which represents the geometry
obstruction to lift this bundle to a vector bundle. This is equivalent to
saying that a phase is determined up to a complex number of module $1$. When
this uncertainty occurs, we cannot locate precisely the position of a particle,

novel upper bounds of algorithmic randomness for elementary cellular automata.
I will discuss how the practice of science consists in conceiving a model that
starts from certain initial values, running a computable instantiation, and
awaiting a result in order to determine where the system may be in a future
state--in a shorter time than the time taken by the actual unfolding of the
phenomenon in question. If a model does not comply with all or some of these
requirements it is traditionally considered useless or even unscientific, so
the more precise and faster the better. A model is thus better if it can
explain more with less, which is at the core of Chaitin's ""compression is
comprehension"". I will pursue these questions related to the random versus
possibly algorithmic nature of the world in two directions, drawing heavily on
the work of Chaitin. I will also discuss how the algorithmic approach is
related to the success of science at producing models of the world, allowing

there is an unresolved hot spot near the outer edge of the southern lobe.
Combining our e-MERLIN data with new VLA A-Array data and archival

complex radio morphology. We conclude that this radio source is most likely
powered by a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) but with a possible important
contribution from nuclear star formation. We also investigate the origin of a
putative X-ray jet in NGC 6217, previously suggested in the literature. This

coincident with the `jet'. An additional compact radio source, aligned with the
knots but without an X-ray counterpart is detected. We detect IR/optical
sources falling within the X-ray extraction regions of the `knots', but note
that these sources could be chance associations due to high source density

testing symmetries of nature, and Paul traps feature an ideal experimental
platform for performing high precision quantum logic spectroscopy. Loading of
stable or long-lived isotopes is well-established and relies on ionization from
an atomic beam. A different approach allows trapping short-lived isotopes
available as alpha-decay daughters, which recoil from a thin sample of the
precursor nuclide. A prominent example is the short-lived $^{229\text{m}}$Th,
populated in a decay of long-lived $^{233}$U. Here, ions are provided by an
external source and are decelerated to be available for trapping. Such setups
offer the option to trap various isotopes and charge states of thorium.
Investigating this complex procedure, we demonstrate the observation of single
$^{232}$Th$^+$ ions trapped, embedded into and sympathetically cooled via
Coulomb interactions by co-trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Furthermore, we discuss
different options for a non-destructive identification of the sympathetically
cooled thorium ions in the trap, and describe in detail our chosen experimental
method, identifying mass and charge of thorium ions from the positions of
calcium ions, as their fluorescence is imaged on a CCD camera. These findings
are verified by means of a time-of-flight signal when extracting ions of
different mass-to-charge ratio from the Paul trap and steering them into a
detector.

part, there are two candidates for the mechanism. One is magnetic reconnection,

X-ray jet that occurred between 10:50 - 11:10 UT on February 18, 2011 by using
the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and the X-ray
Telescope, Solar Optical Telescope, and EUV Imaging Spectrometer aboard Hinode.
Our results are as follows: 1) The EUV and X-ray observations show the general
characteristics of X-ray jets, such as an arch structure straddling a polarity
inversion line, a jet bright point shown at one side of the arch leg, and a
spire above the arch. 2) The multi-wavelength observations and Ca II H-band
image show the existence of a low-temperature (~10 000K) plasma (i.e.,
filament) at the center of the jet. 3) In the magnetogram and Ca II H-band
image, the filament exists over the polarity inversion line and arch structure
is also straddling it. In addition, magnetic cancellation occurs around the jet
a few hours before and after the jet is observed. 4) The temperature
distribution of the accelerated plasma, which was estimated from Doppler
velocity maps, the calculated differential emission measure, and synthetic
spectra show that there is no clear dependence between the plasma velocity and
its temperature. For the third result above, observational results suggest that
magnetic cancellation is probably related to the occurrence of the jet and
filament formation. This result suggests that the trigger of the jet is
magnetic cancellation rather than an emerging magnetic arch flux. The fourth
result indicates that acceleration of the plasma accompanied by an X-ray jet
seems to be caused by magnetic reconnection rather than chromospheric
evaporation.

between offline AUC and online CPM. AUC can only reflect the order on CTR, but
it does not reflect the order of CTR*Bid. Moreover, the bids of different

from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Although there have been many interesting
clusters discovered with the RASS data, the broad point spread function (PSF)
of the ROSAT satellite limits the amount of spatial information of the detected
objects. This leads to the discovery of new cluster features when a
re-observation is performed with higher resolution X-ray satellites. Here we
present the results from XMM-Newton observations of three clusters:
RXCJ2306.6-1319, ZwCl1665 and RXCJ0034.6-0208, for which the observations
reveal a double or triple system of extended components. These clusters belong
to the extremely expanded HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample
(eeHIFLUGCS), which is a flux-limited cluster sample ($f_\textrm{X,500}\geq
5\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the $0.1-2.4$ keV energy band). For
each structure in each cluster, we determine the redshift with the X-ray
spectrum and find that the components are not part of the same cluster. This is
confirmed by an optical spectroscopic analysis of the galaxy members.
Therefore, the total number of clusters is actually 7 and not 3. We derive
global cluster properties of each extended component. We compare the measured
properties to lower-redshift group samples, and find a good agreement. Our flux
measurements reveal that only one component of the ZwCl1665 cluster has a flux
above the eeHIFLUGCS limit, while the other clusters will no longer be part of

bias X-ray cluster catalogues and that with high-resolution X-ray follow-up

in practical implementation of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems due to the low power
consumption with respect to its fully digital baseband counterpart. The
implementation cost, performance, and power efficiency of HDA beamforming
depends on the level of connectivity and reconfigurability of the analog
beamforming network. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two
typical architectures that can be regarded as extreme cases, namely, the
fully-connected (FC) and the one-stream-per-subarray (OSPS) architectures. In
the FC architecture each RF antenna port is connected to all antenna elements
of the array, while in the OSPS architecture the RF antenna ports are connected
to disjoint subarrays. We jointly consider the initial beam acquisition and
data communication phases, such that the latter takes place by using the beam
direction information obtained by the former. We use the state-of-the-art beam
alignment (BA) scheme previously proposed by the authors and consider a family
of MU-MIMO precoding schemes well adapted to the beam information extracted
from the BA phase. We also evaluate the power efficiency of the two HDA
architectures taking into account the power dissipation at different hardware
components as well as the power backoff under typical power amplifier
constraints. Numerical results show that the two architectures achieve similar
sum spectral efficiency, while the OSPS architecture is advantageous with
respect to the FC case in terms of hardware complexity and power efficiency, at
the sole cost of a slightly longer BA time-to-acquisition due to its reduced
beam angle resolution.

challenge in high dynamic range (HDR) imaging for dynamic scenes. Previous

very recent work tries to bypass optical flows via a deep network with
skip-connections, however, which still suffers from ghosting artifacts for
severe movement. To avoid the ghosting from the source, we propose a novel
attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce
high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Unlike previous methods directly stacking
the LDR images or features for merging, we use attention modules to guide the
merging according to the reference image. The attention modules automatically
suppress undesired components caused by misalignments and saturation and
enhance desirable fine details in the non-reference images. In addition to the
attention model, we use dilated residual dense block (DRDB) to make full use of
the hierarchical features and increase the receptive field for hallucinating
the missing details. The proposed AHDRNet is a non-flow-based method, which can
also avoid the artifacts generated by optical-flow estimation error.
Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed AHDRNet can achieve
state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results.

In overcoming the key chal-lenges of the conventional metal deposition process

resistance, notable advances were recently made by transferring atomically flat
metal thin films or thermally evapo-rating indium/gold alloy. However, the
realization of an ideal vdW contact be-tween an elemental metal and TMDC
through the evaporation process is yet to be demonstrated, and particularly the
evidence of an Ohmic contact between three-dimensional metallic electrodes and
TMDCs is still unavailable. Herein, we report the fabrication of atomically
clean metal/TMDC contacts by evaporating metals at a relatively low thermal
energy and subsequently cooling the substrate holder down to 100 K by liquid
nitrogen, achieving for the indium (In)/molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) case an
accumulation-type Ohmic contact with a metal-induced electron doping density of
10$^{12}$/cm$^2$. We find that the transport at the In/MoS2 contact is
dominated by the field-emission mechanism over a wide temperature range from
2.4 to 300 K, and the contact resistance reaches 600 Ohm um and 1,000 Ohm um at
cryogenic temperatures for the few-layer and monolayer MoS2 cases,
respectively. Based on first-principles calculations, we find that the na-ture
of the ideal In/MoS2 vdW contact is characterized by the formation of in-gap
states within TMDC together with the abrupt and rigid shift of the TMDC band.

experimental data on lipids with full contrast and tail contrast matched
samples, reveals highly confined lipid tail motion. A comparison of their
dynamics demonstrates the statistical independ-ence of tail-motion and
height-height correlation of the membrane. A more detailed analysis indi-cates
that lipid tails are subject to relaxations in a potential with cylindrical

finding and analyzing `good' routing policies of arriving jobs to the servers.
It is well known that, if full information regarding the workload process is
available to a central dispatcher, then the {\em join the shortest workload}
(JSW) policy, which assigns jobs to the server with the least workload, is the
optimal assignment policy, in that it maximizes server utilization, and thus
minimizes sojourn times. The {\em join the shortest queue} (JSQ) policy is an
efficient dispatching policy when information is available only on the number
of jobs with each of the servers, but not on their service requirements. If
information on the state of the system is not available, other dispatching
policies need to be employed, such as the power-of-$d$ routing policy, in which
each arriving job joins the shortest among $d \ge 1$ queues sampled uniformly
at random. (Under this latter policy, the system is known as {\em the
supermarket model}.) In this paper we study the stability question of parallel
server systems assuming that routing errors occur, so that arrivals may be
routed to the `wrong' (not to the smallest) queue with a positive probability.
We show that, even if a `non-idling' dispatching policy is employed, under
which new arrivals are always routed to an idle server, if any is available,
the performance of the system can be much worse than under the policy that
chooses one of the servers uniformly at random. More specifically, we prove
that the usual traffic intensity $\rho < 1$ does not guarantee that the system
is stable.

renormalization group (RG) equations has been solved in the local potential
approximation. Critical temperatures of the $n=1-3$ vector spin models on cubic
lattices have been calculated in excellent agreement with the best known
estimates. Several critical amplitudes and the magnetisation curve of the Ising
model on the simple cubic lattice calculated within the approach compared well
with the values from literature sources. It has been argued that unification of

realistic lattice models with multi-spin interactions and describe in a unified
framework the phase transitions of any kind. Besides the RG equations the
layer-cake technique can be used in the exact partial renormalization of the

reduces the strength of the interactions which in some cases can make them

movable objects, i.e., finding a sequence of actions to move a set of objects
from an initial arrangement to a desired one, while relying on visual inputs
coming from an RGB camera. To do so, we introduce a complete pipeline relying
on two key contributions. First, we introduce an efficient and scalable
rearrangement planning method, based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search exploration
strategy. We demonstrate that because of its good trade-off between exploration
and exploitation our method (i) scales well with the number of objects while
(ii) finding solutions which require a smaller number of moves compared to the
other state-of-the-art approaches. Note that on the contrary to many
approaches, we do not require any buffer space to be available. Second, to
precisely localize movable objects in the scene, we develop an integrated
approach for robust multi-object workspace state estimation from a single
uncalibrated RGB camera using a deep neural network trained only with synthetic
data. We validate our multi-object visually guided manipulation pipeline with
several experiments on a real UR-5 robotic arm by solving various rearrangement
planning instances, requiring only 60 ms to compute the plan to rearrange 25
objects. In addition, we show that our system is insensitive to camera
movements and can successfully recover from external perturbations.

new millimeter-wave carbon recombination lines (mmCRLs) and existing far-IR

beta, and gamma transitions) observed with the IRAM 30m telescope, at ~25''
angular resolution, toward the H/H2 dissociation front (DF) of the Bar. We also
present a mmCRL emission cut across the PDR. These lines trace the C+/C/CO gas
transition layer. As the much lower frequency carbon radio recombination lines,
mmCRLs arise from neutral PDR gas and not from ionized gas in the adjacent HII
region. This is readily seen from their narrow line profiles (dv=2.6+/-0.4
km/s) and line peak LSR velocities (v_LSR=+10.7+/-0.2 km/s). Optically thin
[13CII] hyperfine lines and molecular lines - emitted close to the DF by trace
species such as reactive ions CO+ and HOC+ - show the same line profiles. We
use non-LTE excitation models of [13CII] and mmCRLs and derive n_e = 60-100
cm^-3 and T_e = 500-600 K toward the DF. The inferred electron densities are
high, up to an order of magnitude higher than previously thought. They provide
a lower limit to the gas thermal pressure at the PDR edge without using
molecular tracers. We obtain P_th > (2-4)x10^8 cm^-3 K assuming that the
electron abundance is equal or lower than the gas-phase elemental abundance of
carbon. Such elevated thermal pressures leave little room for magnetic pressure
support and agree with a scenario in which the PDR photoevaporates.

some critical value, the STT excites high-frequency magnetization precession in
the ""free"" electrode of MTJ. Such precession gives rise to microwave output
voltage and, furthermore, can be employed for spin pumping into adjacent normal
metal or semiconductor. Here we describe theoretically the spin dynamics and
charge transport in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Au tunneling heterostructure connected
to a constant-current source. The magnetization dynamics in the free CoFeB
layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy is calculated by numerical integration
of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation accounting for both STT and
voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy associated with the CoFeB|MgO interface.
It is shown that a large-angle magnetization precession, resulting from
electrically induced dynamic spin reorientation transition, can be generated in
a certain range of relatively low current densities. An oscillating spin
current, which is pumped into the Au overlayer owing to such precession, is
then evaluated together with the injected spin current. Considering both the
driving spin-polarized charge current and the pumped spin current, we also
describe the charge transport in the CoFeB/Au bilayer with the account of
anomalous and inverse spin Hall effects. An electric potential difference
between the lateral sides of the CoFeB/Au bilayer is calculated as a function
of distance from the CoFeB|MgO interface. It is found that this transverse

the observation of H$_{\rm I}$ suffers from the contamination from extremely

We find that the SKA1-mid operated in single-dish mode has a sufficient

Fisher analysis assuming a constant linear bias of H$_{\rm I}$, $b$, and
SKA1-mid observation of 1,000 hours for each of Band 1 and 2, we show that
$\Omega_{\rm H_{\rm I}} b$ can be constrained with a precision of $6-13\%$ at a

perturbative relation with the cusp anomalous dimension: the (four dimensional)
cusp anomalous dimension is equal to the $d$-dimensional soft-gluon effective
coupling at the conformal point $\ep=\beta(\as)$, where the $d$-dimensional QCD
$\beta$-function, $\beta(\as) - \ep$, vanishes. We present the explicit
expressions of the two soft-gluon couplings up to ${\cal O}(\as^2)$ in $d$
dimensions. In the four-dimensional case we compute the two soft couplings up
to ${\cal O}(\as^3)$. For one of the two couplings, we confirm the ${\cal
O}(\as^3)$ result previously presented by other authors. For the other
coupling, we obtain the explicit relation with the cusp anomalous dimension up
to ${\cal O}(\as^4)$. We comment on Casimir scaling at ${\cal O}(\as^4)$.

Proximal Method of Multipliers (PMM). The resulting algorithm (IP-PMM) is
interpreted as a primal-dual regularized IPM, suitable for solving linearly
constrained convex quadratic programming problems. We apply few iterations of
the interior point method to each sub-problem of the proximal method of
multipliers. Once a satisfactory solution of the PMM sub-problem is found, we
update the PMM parameters, form a new IPM neighbourhood and repeat this
process. Given this framework, we prove polynomial complexity of the algorithm,
under standard assumptions. To our knowledge, this is the first polynomial
complexity result for a primal-dual regularized IPM. The algorithm is guided by
the use of a single penalty parameter; that of the logarithmic barrier. In
other words, we show that IP-PMM inherits the polynomial complexity of IPMs, as
well as the strict convexity of the PMM sub-problems. The updates of the
penalty parameter are controlled by IPM, and hence are well-tuned, and do not
depend on the problem solved. Furthermore, we study the behavior of the method
when it is applied to an infeasible problem, and identify a necessary condition
for infeasibility. The latter is used to construct an infeasibility detection
mechanism. Subsequently, we provide a robust implementation of the presented

In this work, the EoS of neutron star matter is established constructively in
the framework of the relativistic point-coupling models to study neutron star
physics. Taking two selected functionals DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 as examples, nuclear
symmetry energies and several neutron star properties including proton

are discussed. A suppression of pressure of neutron star matter found in the
functional PC-PK1 at high densities results in the difficulty of its prediction
when approaching to the maximum mass of neutron stars. In addition, the
divergences between two selected functionals in describing neutron star
quantities mentioned above are still large, ascribing to the less constrained
behavior of these functionals at high densities. Then it is expected that the
constraints on the dense matter EoS from precise and massive modern

information into instructive signals for cell events for each cell, as well as
for transforming it after each cell event. Next we give notions of cell state,
determined by its epigenetic array, and cell event, which is a change of cell
state, and formalize development as a graph (tree) of cell states connected by
5 types of cell events, corresponding to the processes of cell division, cell
growth, cell death, cell movement and cell differentiation. Here we present a

blocks for large scale quantum computers thanks to their high qubit density and
compatibility with the existing semiconductor technologies. High fidelity
single-qubit gates exceeding the threshold of error correction codes like the
surface code have been demonstrated, while two-qubit gates have reached 98\%
fidelity and are improving rapidly. However, there are other types of error ---
such as charge leakage and propagation --- that may occur in quantum dot arrays
and which cannot be corrected by quantum error correction codes, making them
potentially damaging even when their probability is small. We propose a surface
code architecture for silicon quantum dot spin qubits that is robust against
leakage errors by incorporating multi-electron mediator dots. Charge leakage in
the qubit dots is transferred to the mediator dots via charge relaxation
processes and then removed using charge reservoirs attached to the mediators. A
stabiliser-check cycle, optimised for our hardware, then removes the
correlations between the residual physical errors. Through simulations we
obtain the surface code threshold for the charge leakage errors and show that
in our architecture the damage due to charge leakage errors is reduced to a
similar level to that of the usual depolarising gate noise. Spin leakage errors
in our architecture are constrained to only ancilla qubits and can be removed
during quantum error correction via reinitialisations of ancillae, which ensure
the robustness of our architecture against spin leakage as well. Our use of an
elongated mediator dots creates spaces throughout the quantum dot array for
charge reservoirs, measuring devices and control gates, providing the
scalability in the design.

single-note instrumental sound analysis. This study extends the frame mask
approach to speech signals. For voiced speech, the fundamental frequency is
usually changing consecutively over time. We employ NSGT with pitch-dependent

induced by pump pulses in the reflectance spectrum accompanied by simultaneous
rises in both real and imaginary parts of conductivity. We compare the

of non-densely defined operators in the closure of its domain, in order that
certain bounded perturbations preserve some regularity properties of the
semigroup such as norm continuity, compactness, differentiability and
analyticity. Furthermore, we study the critical and essential growth bound of
the semigroup under bounded perturbations. The main results generalize the
corresponding results in the case of Hille-Yosida operators. As an
illustration, we apply the main results to study the asymptotic behaviors of a
class of age-structured population models in $ L^p $ spaces ($ 1 \leq p <
\infty $).

accident analysis, this work discusses a compositional framework for risk
modelling. Risk models capture fragments of the space of risky events likely to
occur when operating a machine in a given environment. Moreover, one can build
such models into machines such as autonomous robots, to equip them with the
ability of risk-aware perception, monitoring, decision making, and control.
With the notion of a risk factor as the modelling primitive, the framework
provides several means to construct and shape risk models. Relational and
algebraic properties are investigated and proofs support the validity and
consistency of these properties over the corresponding models. Several examples
throughout the discussion illustrate the applicability of the concepts.
Overall, this work focuses on the qualitative treatment of risk with the
outlook of transferring these results to probabilistic refinements of the
discussed framework.

using inference on occluded MNIST images, and show that our representation

Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been
separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model
fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been
done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and
there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can

action, G on Mat(R), and a subset of allowed deformations, \Sigma. The
traditional objects of study in Singularity Theory and Algebraic Geometry are
the tangent spaces T_{(\Sigma,A)}, T_{(GA,A)}, and their quotient, the tangent
module to the miniversal deformation, T^1_{(\Sigma,G,A)}.
  This module plays the key role in various deformation problems, e.g.,
deformations of maps, of modules, of (skew-)symmetric forms. In particular, the
first question is to determine the support/annihilator of this tangent module.
In [Belitski-Kerner.1] we have studied this tangent module for various R-linear
group actions. In the current work we study the support of the module
T^1_{(\Sigma,G,A)} for group actions that involve automorphisms of the ring.
(Geometrically, these are group actions that involve the local coordinate
changes.)
  We obtain various bounds on localizations of T^1_{(\Sigma,G,A)} and compute
the radical of the annihilator of T^1_{(\Sigma,G,A)}, i.e., the set-theoretic
support. This brings the definition of an (apparently new) type of singular
locus, the ""essential singular locus"" of a map/sub-scheme. It reflects the
""unexpected"" singularities of a subscheme, ignoring those imposed by the
singularities of the ambient space. Unlike the classical singular locus
(defined by a Fitting ideal of the module of differentials) the essential is
defined by the annihilator ideal of the module of derivations.

Moreover, Teleparallel Horndenski contains the standard Horndenski gravity as a

under abstractions) if and only if its interpretation is not empty. We then
show that the size of type derivations can be used to measure the execution

call-by-name lambda-calculus, the quantitative information enclosed in type
derivations does not lift to types (i.e. to the interpretation of terms). To
get a truly semantic measure of execution time in a call-by-value setting, we
conjecture that a refinement of its syntax and operational semantics is needed.

the metric and a product of the unit vectors; and a linear sum of
divergenceless symmetric tensors. A modified Einstein equation of general
relativity is then obtained by using the principle of least action, the

decomposition introduces a new symmetric tensor $ \varPhi_{\alpha\beta} $ which
describes the energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It completes
Einstein's equation and addresses the energy localization problem. Variation of
the action with respect to $ X^{\mu} $ restricts $u_{\mu}$ to a particular

of why the vacuum energy density is so small, and why it dominates the present

equation, from which the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is obtained.

In fact, a large trilinear scalar $A_t$ term at the electroweak (EW) scale
creates a large mass splitting between the top squarks, driving the light stop
to near degeneracy with an LSP that is almost all Higgsino, with $\Delta
M(\widetilde{t}_1, \widetilde{\chi}_1^0) < 5$ GeV, evading the LHC constraint

one-loop contributions from the Yukawa couplings between the flippons and Higgs
fields. The resulting parameter space satisfying naturalness is rather
constrained, thus we assess its viability by means of comparison to the LHC

spin-independent cross-sections. Finally, we compute the level of electroweak

transfer (SWIPT) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. The system consists of a large number of randomly
(Poisson-distributed) located access points (APs) serving multiple information
users (IUs) and an information-untrusted dual-antenna active energy harvester
(EH). The active EH uses one antenna to legitimately harvest energy and the
other antenna to eavesdrop information. The APs are networked by a centralized
infinite backhaul which allows the APs to synchronize and cooperate via a
central processing unit (CPU). Closed-form expressions for the average
harvested energy (AHE) and a tight lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate
(ESR) are derived. The obtained lower bound on the ESR takes into account the
IUs' knowledge attained by downlink effective precoded-channel training. Since
the transmit power constraint is per AP, the ESR is nonlinear in terms of the
transmit power elements of the APs and that imposes new challenges in
formulating a convex power control problem for the downlink transmission. To
deal with these nonlinearities, a new method of balancing the transmit power
among the APs via relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) which is proved to be
rank-one globally optimal is derived. A fair comparison between the proposed
cell-free and the colocated massive MIMO systems shows that the cell-free MIMO
outperforms the colocated MIMO over the interval in which the AHE constraint is
low and vice versa. Also, the cell-free MIMO is found to be more immune to the
increase in the active eavesdropping power than the colocated MIMO.

it can help them and their advisers during the process of course selection as
well as for designing personalized degree plans and modifying them based on
their performance. One of the successful approaches for accurately predicting a
student's grades in future courses is Cumulative Knowledge-based Regression
Models (CKRM). CKRM learns shallow linear models that predict a student's
grades as the similarity between his/her knowledge state and the target course.
A student's knowledge state is built by linearly accumulating the learned
provided knowledge components of the courses he/she has taken in the past,
weighted by his/her grades in them. However, not all the prior courses
contribute equally to the target course. In this paper, we propose a novel
Neural Attentive Knowledge-based model (NAK) that learns the importance of each
historical course in predicting the grade of a target course. Compared to CKRM
and other competing approaches, our experiments on a large real-world dataset
consisting of $\sim$1.5 grades show the effectiveness of the proposed NAK model
in accurately predicting the students' grades. Moreover, the attention weights
learned by the model can be helpful in better designing their degree plans.

as a particularly promising option, combining small footprint with simple
operation by a DC current and offering flat broadband comb spectra. However,
the data transmission performance achieved with QD-MLLD was so far limited by
strong phase noise of the individual comb tones, restricting experiments to
rather simple modulation formats such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)

these limitations can be over-come by digital symbol-wise phase tracking
algorithms, avoiding any hardware-based phase-noise compensation. We
demonstrate 16QAM dual-polarization WDM transmission on 38 channels at an
aggregate net data rate of 10.68 Tbit/s over 75 km of standard single-mode

The dominance of CNNs follows a breakthrough by Alex Krizhevsky which showed
improvements by dramatically reducing the error rate obtained in a general
image classification task from 26.2% to 15.4%. In road safety, CNNs have been
applied widely to the detection of traffic signs, obstacle detection, and lane
departure checking. In addition, CNNs have been used in data mining systems
that monitor driving patterns and recommend rest breaks when appropriate. This
paper presents a driver drowsiness detection system and shows that there are
potential social challenges regarding the application of these techniques, by
highlighting problems in detecting dark-skinned driver's faces. This is a
particularly important challenge in African contexts, where there are more
dark-skinned drivers. Unfortunately, publicly available datasets are often
captured in different cultural contexts, and therefore do not cover all
ethnicities, which can lead to false detections or racially biased models. This
work evaluates the performance obtained when training convolutional neural
network models on commonly used driver drowsiness detection datasets and
testing on datasets specifically chosen for broader representation. Results
show that models trained using publicly available datasets suffer extensively
from over-fitting, and can exhibit racial bias, as shown by testing on a more
representative dataset. We propose a novel visualisation technique that can
assist in identifying groups of people where there might be the potential of
discrimination, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to produce a grid of

BDD-A was aware of this problem and collected the driver attention in
laboratory because of the rarity of such scenes. Nevertheless, BDD-A focuses
the critical situations which do not encounter actual accidents, and just faces
the driver attention prediction task, without a close step for accident
prediction. In contrast to this, we explore the view of drivers' eyes for
capturing multiple kinds of accidents, and construct a more diverse and larger
video benchmark than ever before with the driver attention and the driving
accident annotation simultaneously (named as DADA-2000), which has 2000 video
clips owning about 658,476 frames on 54 kinds of accidents. These clips are
crowd-sourced and captured in various occasions (highway, urban, rural, and

their categories, the accident window in clips and spatial locations of the
crash-objects. Based on the analysis, we obtain a quantitative and positive

networks suffer from serious computation costs and redundancies. Although
previous works address this issue by enhancing diversities of filters, they
have not considered the complementarity and the completeness of the internal
structure of the convolutional network. To deal with these problems, a novel
Inner-Imaging architecture is proposed in this paper, which allows
relationships between channels to meet the above requirement. Specifically, we
organize the channel signal points in groups using convolutional kernels to
model both the intra-group and inter-group relationships simultaneously. The
convolutional filter is a powerful tool for modeling spatial relations and
organizing grouped signals, so the proposed methods map the channel signals
onto a pseudo-image, like putting a lens into convolution internal structure.
Consequently, not only the diversity of channels is increased, but also the
complementarity and completeness can be explicitly enhanced. The proposed
architecture is lightweight and easy to be implemented. It provides an
efficient self-organization strategy for convolutional networks so as to
improve their efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multiple benchmark image recognition data sets including CIFAR, SVHN and
ImageNet. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the Inner-Imaging
mechanism with the most popular convolutional networks as the backbones.
